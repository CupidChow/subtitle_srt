1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not afraid of you.

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Qi.

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Qi.

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Qi.

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Qi.

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Qi.

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Qi.

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Qi.

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Qi.

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
How did you get back?

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's useless.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Master Li.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The Moon Sect.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's already lost its power.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What?

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Master Li.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Please listen to the disciple say.

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The twoçš‡ princes on the Moon Sect.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's fake.

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The emperor who is the master of this sect.

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Is that group of people.

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
People are chasing.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
To stop the Moon Sect from meeting.

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yes.

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You are on the side of the people.

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Is it the people on the A-Nu's side?

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
But.

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
If you want to sacrifice.

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You will become a flying bird.

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:08,400
That

45
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,000
It has a strong power.

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
A-Nu has only half.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You must find the other half.

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
There is a group of couples.

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
They are together.

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
They are in the new wish.

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And if you want to sacrifice.

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You will have a strong power.

53
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's a world.

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Only love.

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Because love is complete.

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Love is.

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
A-Qi.

58
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Don't say.

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Master won't let you die.

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Life is a miracle.

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Death is no more.

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Besides.

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I have found two.

64
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I don't know.

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Six.

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
A-Qi.

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You have been neglecting your parents.

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's time to laugh.

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Master, you are not going to die.

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Ten years of fate.

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Let me be alone.

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And be with my cousin.

73
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
A-Qi.

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Be with me.

75
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
A-Qi.

76
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Brother Qi.

77
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
A-Qi.

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Brother Qi.

79
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
A-Qi.

80
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Brother Qi.

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Brother Qi.

82
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Brother Qi.

83
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Brother Qi.

84
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Brother Qi.

85
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Brother Qi.

86
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Brother Qi.

87
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Brother Qi.

88
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Brother Qi.

89
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Brother Qi.

90
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Brother Qi.

91
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Brother Qi.

92
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Brother Qi.

93
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Brother Qi.

94
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Brother Qi.

95
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Brother Qi.

96
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Brother Qi.

97
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Brother Qi.

98
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Brother Qi.

99
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Fei- fences will come.

100
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,200
When he steps back,

101
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,880
will he come back?

102
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,760
Subm mesures

103
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,840
Tonto

104
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:29,620
...!

105
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:41,720
Love

106
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I've always wanted to fight you.

107
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,600
I wanted to protect you and protect you.

108
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,600
I wanted to borrow your daughter's power

109
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,600
to build a beautiful country.

110
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,000
But no one understands me.

111
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,600
They forced me to do so.

112
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,800
They forced me to do so ten years ago.

113
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,800
Is this the only way to achieve my great wish?

114
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,400
They will understand it in the future.

115
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,800
Your Majesty,

116
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,400
it's time to fight.

117
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:46,080
The Assault

118
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,800
The immortal god has blessed us with a powerful power.

119
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,800
I have only half of it.

120
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
I must find another half.

121
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,800
I have a pair of lovers who will make it together.

122
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,800
And if I want to sacrifice myself, I will have a powerful power.

123
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,800
I will do my best to make it together.

124
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,800
I will do my best to make it together.

125
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,800
I will do my best to make it together.

126
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,800
I will do my best to make it together.

127
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:44,800
Qi Xiu, I finally understand what you said.

128
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:51,800
If I can make it together, I will be good and evil.

129
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,800
Without evil, I can't be beautiful.

130
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:03,800
I will use my power to change this.

131
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,800
I will make it together.

132
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,800
The immortal god has blessed us with a powerful power.

133
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,800
I will make it together.

134
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,800
I will make it together.

135
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,800
I will make it together.

136
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,800
I will make it together.

137
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,800
I will make it together.

138
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,800
14th.

139
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,800
14th.

140
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,800
14th.

141
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,800
14th.

142
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,800
14th.

143
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,800
14th.

144
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,800
14th.

145
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,800
14th.

146
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,800
14th.

147
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,800
14th.

148
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,800
14th.

149
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,800
14th.

150
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,800
14th.

151
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,800
It's him.

152
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,800
He came back to the palace.

153
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,800
Ling Yu, what's wrong?

154
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,800
Master Bai Yu called the water beast to come out.

155
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,800
I will stop him.

156
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,800
Ling Yu, it's too dangerous here.

157
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,800
Come back with me first.

158
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,800
Let's go.

159
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,800
I have something to say.

160
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,800
I won't die.

161
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,800
I won't die either.

162
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,800
The end.

163
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,800
Goodbye, trouble certificate.

164
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,800
You are finally here.

165
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,800
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

166
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,800
You are the descendant of the female frog.

167
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,800
Do you feel a little excited seeing my great performance?

168
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,800
This five-legged pearl represents the stars in the sky.

169
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,800
These stars are my control.

170
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,800
They are my strength to change the world.

171
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,800
The world will soon be destroyed.

172
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,800
All the foolish people will die and then re-birth.

173
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,800
The descendant of the female frog.

174
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,800
I once again invite you to join me.

175
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,800
I once again invite you to join me.

176
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,800
I will re-birth your power.

177
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,800
I will make a perfect human being.

178
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,800
You have already made my answer clear.

179
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,800
Why do you have such short eyes?

180
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,800
Even the descendant of the female frog is the same.

181
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,800
It's because you have done everything you can.

182
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,800
No one understands me at this moment.

183
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,800
You are all the same in the world.

184
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,800
You fools will never understand me.

185
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,800
Nonsense.

186
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,800
Today I will use your blood to train all my dead friends.

187
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,800
Brother Qingrui.

188
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,800
Is this your love?

189
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,800
Can you endure the love of your own daughter?

190
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,800
Run.

191
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,800
Run.

192
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,800
Hurry up.

193
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,800
Be careful.

194
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,800
Run faster.

195
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,800
Don't ignore me.

196
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,800
I killed her.

197
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,800
I killed someone.

198
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,800
I killed Taoyu Xiaobao.

199
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,800
I was killed.

200
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,800
I was killed.

201
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,800
My sonetztin.

202
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,800
Help me.

203
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,800
We are already religion friends.

204
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,800
Mother.

205
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,800
Mother.

206
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,800
I killed her.

207
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,800
Mother

208
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,280
Your Majesty...

209
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,560
SuENTHER screening

210
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,440
SuENTHER screening

211
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,940
Why you lying to me?

212
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,140
I've read your lines, I've killed it

213
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,740
How could I do that?

214
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,080
I'm a ì™”ihit

215
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,200
I'm a ì™”ihit

216
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,320
I am aà¹€à¸›rqt

217
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:18,520
specifically

218
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,280
Enough

219
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,560
How dare you die!

220
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,880
If you want to die, I'll die with you!

221
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,840
Brother!

222
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,800
Who are you?

223
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,680
You.

224
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,840
Mother.

225
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,160
Please

226
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,040
help me

227
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,640
kill me at the last shot.

228
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,880
I've cut off yourï¿½ï¿½ë‹¤.

229
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,640
You lost everything!

230
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,520
And I killed my own father!

231
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,560
I can't beat you.

232
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,400
I'm a bad man.

233
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,880
I'm your enemy.

234
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:00,840
Okay.

235
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,360
Dad, I'm drunk.

236
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,080
Dad.

237
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,360
This is from Mr. Jianxin.

238
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,960
This is from my aunt.

239
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,360
This is from me.

240
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,360
What are you doing?

241
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,760
Didn't I tell you to kill me?

242
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,480
Everyone's revenge is over.

243
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,160
Don't be angry.

244
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,280
Don't be sad.

245
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,520
Don't be sad.

246
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,880
You're all my fault.

247
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,840
If you want to die,

248
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,760
I'll accompany you.

249
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,240
I don't even want to live.

250
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,200
I can't even die.

251
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,720
You can.

252
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,360
But definitely,

253
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,760
I won't die like this.

254
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,320
Your dad,

255
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,920
and the innocent people you killed,

256
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,960
including me,

257
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,600
are not your real enemies.

258
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,800
They're trying to kill that devil.

259
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,840
Don't do this, don't do this.

260
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:31,980
label po

261
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,800
I wanna see

262
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,480
your love towards you.

263
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,120
What are your feelings?

264
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,360
I won't die.

265
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,360
I won't die.

266
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,360
I finally found it.

267
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,360
It's hard to find the other side.

268
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,360
Maybe it's the fate.

269
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:14,360
Ji said that if he was taken by the love of true love,

270
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,360
and made a wish,

271
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,360
he would definitely fulfill it.

272
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,360
He said most of the lovers

273
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,360
would make the same wish,

274
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
and love each other forever.

275
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,360
They could live for hundreds of years in the world.

276
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,360
Bai Zi, Qian Si, Xiang Qing, Xiang Ai,

277
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,360
and left.

278
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,360
In the end, they became a pair of birds.

279
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,360
Can you make other wishes?

280
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,360
Yes.

281
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,360
No matter what you make,

282
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,360
he will fulfill it.

283
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,360
But you will become a bird.

284
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:02,360
Tan Yu, do you know what I want to make?

285
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,360
I know.

286
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,360
I've prepared everything.

287
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,360
You have no future.

288
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,360
What about you?

289
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,360
Our brothers and sisters are working hard

290
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,360
to fight for their future.

291
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,360
We should also be together with everyone.

292
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,360
Anu, I know you don't like war.

293
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,360
We have peace and love.

294
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,360
We have a good relationship.

295
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,360
We should be together with love.

296
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,360
I will always think for you.

297
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,360
If I have a future,

298
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:46,360
I will be your wife forever.

299
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:50,360
Anu, I love you.

300
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,360
I will never let you down.

301
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,360
I will always love you.

302
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,360
We are three people.

303
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:12,360
I am always your wife forever.

304
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,360
Let's make a wish.

305
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,360
May you be happy.

306
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,360
May you be happy.

307
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,360
We are three people.

308
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:32,360
I will always love you.

309
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:36,360
I will always love you.

310
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:41,360
I will always love you.

311
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,360
I will always love you.

312
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:52,360
Anu, there are really people in the world.

313
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,360
We are here.

314
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,360
As long as there is love,

315
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,360
the world is in our heart.

316
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,360
Where are we going?

317
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,360
We are going to become a pair of birds.

318
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,360
We are always together.

319
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,360
But I lost my double-edged sword.

320
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,360
I can't fly without wings.

321
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,360
Tang Yu and Xiaobao have always supported me.

322
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,360
They protect me and take care of me.

323
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,360
Now they are going to protect Tang Yu and Xiaobao.

324
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,360
I will take you with me.

325
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,360
Silly girl, why are you flying with me?

326
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,360
We have a single-edged sword.

327
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,360
I already lost my double-edged sword.

328
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,360
I can't use a single-edged sword.

329
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:51,360
A single-edged sword is not used to use this sword since the time of Ji Yi Qi.

330
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,360
It is used here.

331
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,360
Come, let me take you flying.

332
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,360
A single-edged sword is a new age.

333
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,360
Let's fly.

334
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,360
It is Anu and Tang Yu.

335
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,360
They are the power of the birds.

336
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,360
It is the power of their love.

337
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,360
They...

338
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,360
They sacrificed themselves to restore this land.

339
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,360
They sacrificed themselves.

340
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,360
Thank you.

341
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,360
Thank you.

342
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,360
We will work hard for them.

343
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,360
The land is back.

344
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,360
How could this happen?

345
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,360
How could this happen?

346
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,360
How could this happen?

347
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,360
What is this?

348
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,360
Time is back to normal.

349
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,360
Is this love?

350
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,360
Is this unyielding?

351
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,360
Is this love?

352
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,360
Is this unyielding?

353
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,360
Or is there really a sea of â€‹â€‹fear in the world?

354
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,360
In this world,

355
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,360
the things you don't believe in

356
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,360
do not mean that they do not exist.

357
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,360
Tell me.

358
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,360
What is your experience?

359
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,360
What is love?

360
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,360
What is love again?

361
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,360
Let me tell you.

362
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,360
What is love?

363
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,360
Love is not limited.

364
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,360
Love is not limited.

365
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,360
Catch them!

366
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,360
I am not dead.

367
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,360
My life should not be cut off.

368
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,360
Heaven also helps me.

369
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,360
This proves that what I used to do is right.

370
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,360
Everyone!

371
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,360
I want someone to love me.

372
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,360
I want many, many love.

373
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,360
You are talking about these.

374
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,360
Are you still sad?

375
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,360
A man and a husband must be strong.

376
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,360
I am not afraid of them.

377
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,360
A man and a husband must be strong.

378
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,360
I just want to hear someone say that they love me.

379
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,360
I want to feel that I am important.

380
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,360
It's not true to be able to say such a thing.

381
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,360
I know.

382
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,360
But someone and I can listen to me.

383
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,360
Encourage me to play with me and laugh with me.

384
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,360
Don't cry with me.

385
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,360
I have had these.

386
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,360
I have had them.

387
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,360
I have had them.

388
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,360
I have had them.

389
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,360
I have given up on them.

390
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,360
I have given up on them.

391
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:59,360
I have not saved my love.

392
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:06,360
I have given up on them.

393
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:14,360
Actually, love has always been by my side.

394
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:30,360
I didn't expect that you are so desperate.

395
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,360
You have ruined me.

396
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,360
Brother Chengyao.

397
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,360
Brother Chengyao.

398
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,360
Ling'er.

399
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,360
Ling'er.

400
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,360
Ling Xiao Yao.

401
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,360
You are useless.

402
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,360
Why?

403
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,360
Why are you all around you?

404
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,360
Why are you all around you?

405
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,360
Why are you all around you all dead?

406
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,360
Why?

407
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,360
Ling'er.

408
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,360
Ling'er, you promised me.

409
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:53,360
You promised me that you wouldn't leave me.

410
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,360
You promised me. You promised me.

411
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,360
Xiao Yao.

412
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,360
Xiao Yao.

413
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,360
Xiao Yao.

414
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,360
Ling'er.

415
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,360
Ling'er, is it really you?

416
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,360
Ling'er.

417
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,360
That's great.

418
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,360
Thank you.

419
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,360
Thank you.

420
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,360
Silly.

421
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:26,360
I won't die if they promised you.

422
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,360
Ling'er.

423
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,360
I've made up my mind.

424
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,360
Let's take a few days off.

425
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,360
Then we'll take you back to the Yuhang Town.

426
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,360
Okay?

427
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,360
Okay. I want to go to Shanshan.

428
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,360
And Little Tiger.

429
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,360
I miss them too.

430
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,360
We can't let them go to Yiru.

431
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,360
I'm afraid that they'll ruin Yiru.

432
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,360
Yiru is grown up.

433
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,360
Is he like you or me?

434
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,360
Like you.

435
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,360
I think that

436
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,360
he has a big eye for you.

437
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,360
And I have a big nose for you.

438
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,360
I think that's better.

439
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,360
Half of you is like me.

440
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,360
Ling'er.

441
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,360
Why?

442
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,360
Why are you like this?

443
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,360
Why did you come back?

444
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,360
I was just trying to make you happy.

445
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,360
I'll go back home.

446
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,360
Ling'er.

447
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,360
You...

448
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,360
Brother Xiaoyao.

449
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,360
I'm okay.

450
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,360
Let's go home.

451
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,360
Ling'er.

452
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,360
I'm okay, brother Xiaoyao.

453
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,360
Really?

454
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,360
Let's go home.

455
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:06,360
Ling'er, what's wrong with you?

456
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,360
Ling'er!

457
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,360
Promise me. Don't leave me.

458
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,360
Ling'er!

459
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,360
Ling'er!

460
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,360
Ling'er!

461
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,360
Ling'er!

462
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,360
You...

463
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:34,360
You kept this breath just for that promise?

464
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:40,360
Ling'er, I won't die.

465
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:45,360
I'll stay by your side.

466
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:52,360
Ling'er has never been by your side since I was a child.

467
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:57,360
She often went to the market to sell sand.

468
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:01,360
She's stupid. She's more careful than anyone else.

469
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:09,360
Xiaoyao's life has been very hard.

470
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,360
She's the best friend.

471
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,360
She's left him.

472
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,360
I don't want her to suffer this much.

473
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:26,360
I promised to give you happiness.

474
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,360
Ling'er!

475
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,360
Ling'er!

476
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,360
Ling'er, listen to me.

477
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:40,360
I don't want you to suffer this much.

478
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,360
I can leave.

479
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,360
No.

480
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,360
I really can.

481
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,360
No.

482
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,360
Xiaoyao.

483
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,360
Don't stay.

484
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,360
Go.

485
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,360
No.

486
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,360
The one who left is the most painful.

487
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:04,360
I don't want Xiaoyao to suffer this much.

488
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,360
Ling'er, listen to me.

489
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,360
Listen to me.

490
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,360
I'm your aunt.

491
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,360
I'm your Xiaoyao.

492
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,360
I really can trust you.

493
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:23,360
You can let me stay alone to bear all this, okay?

494
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,360
No, Xiaoyao.

495
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,360
We've made a deal.

496
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,360
Have you forgotten?

497
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,360
Xiaoyao.

498
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,360
I want to go home.

499
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,360
I know.

500
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,360
Can you take me home?

501
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,360
I want to go back to Xiaoyao's home.

502
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:51,360
I'm Xiaoyao's wife.

503
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,360
I'm...

504
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,360
I'm Yuhang Zhen's wife.

505
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,360
We're...

506
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,360
Xiaoba Lang.

507
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,360
Take me home.

508
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,360
Okay.

509
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,360
Okay.

510
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,360
I'll take you away.

511
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,360
Go back to our...

512
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,360
Go back to our home.

513
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,360
Okay.

514
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:52,360
Ling'er.

515
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,360
You're tired.

516
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,360
Close your eyes.

517
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,360
I don't want to.

518
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,360
I don't want to close my eyes.

519
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,360
Sleep for a while.

520
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,360
I'm afraid...

521
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,360
I won't wake up.

522
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,360
Silly girl.

523
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:28,360
I'll wake you up when you're home.

524
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,360
Really?

525
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:36,360
After you're home, I'll wake you up with Luo Shao and Yi Ru.

526
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,360
Okay?

527
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,360
Don't lie to Ling'er.

528
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,360
When did Xiaoyao lie to Ling'er?

529
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:48,360
Sleep.

530
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,360
I'll wake you up when you're home.

531
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,360
Okay?

532
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,360
Okay.

533
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,360
Okay.

534
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,360
Okay.

535
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,360
Okay.

536
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:03,360
Okay.

537
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,360
Okay.

538
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,360
Okay.

539
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,360
Okay.

540
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,360
Okay.

541
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,360
Okay.

542
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,360
Okay.

543
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,360
Okay.

544
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,360
Okay.

545
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:21,360
Okay.

546
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,360
Okay.

547
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,360
Okay.

548
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,360
My child.

549
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,360
You understand.

550
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:21,360
My child.

551
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:51,360
My child.

552
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:21,360
My child.

553
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,360
My child.
