Do you see your master?

25
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,360
Yes.

26
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,260
I look for the master in my own body.

27
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,380
You may rise.

28
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,260
Thank you, Your Highness.

29
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:32,140
I'm here to welcome you back.

30
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,620
Your Majesty is waiting for you.

31
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,740
I want to go back soon.

32
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,780
I want to ask Father about something.

33
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,620
Okay.

34
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,340
Tang Yu,

35
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,420
try to stop all the people who love us.

36
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,340
Get out of here.

37
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,180
Wait.

38
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,020
Elder,

39
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,100
what you mean is...

40
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,060
Li Xiaoyao and Lin Yuerong.

41
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,860
No.

42
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,380
Your Highness, please think twice.

43
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,900
They are our food and drink.

44
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,020
Elder,

45
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,780
they protect us all the way.

46
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,700
They are good people.

47
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,740
They are innocent.

48
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,420
They are very angry with me.

49
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,660
If they keep them,

50
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,580
they will only harm us.

51
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,260
Father,

52
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,500
I'm very tired.

53
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,940
I can't kill them.

54
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,300
You are so mean.

55
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,660
Elder,

56
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,580
I've decided to leave Li Xiaoyao and Lin Yuerong.

57
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,660
Your Highness.

58
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,820
You really have decided?

59
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,300
Yes.

60
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,620
Okay.

61
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,300
I won't say anything else.

62
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,820
I've promised you to go back.

63
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,860
Let's let Miss Mengzi go.

64
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,740
I've let her go.

65
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,380
Your Highness,

66
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,740
let's go.

67
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,900
Your Highness, let's go.

Ling'er.

70
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:51,780

71
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,980

00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,140
Ling'er.

78
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,380
Ling'er.

79
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,220
Ling'er.

80
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,100
Ling'er.

81
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,860
Ling'er.

82
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,580
Why does I live under that guardian tree?

83
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,180
It'slive, follow me you all00もの

84

promised me not to hurt them

89
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:37,980
Then I'll have to see you.

90
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,020
Ling'er, are you willing to leave us?

91
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:45,820
Sister Yuru,

92
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,020
do you remember what I told you?

93
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,060
Princess, we should go.

94
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,460
Ling'er.

95
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,420
Let's go.

96
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,140
Ling'er.

97
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,300
Ling'er.

98
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,660
Ling'er.

99
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,900
Miss, don't worry.

100
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,700
She's fine.

101
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,020
I'm sorry, Brother Xiangyang.

102
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:49,980
Ling'er.

103
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:52,820
Don't go.

104
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,980
Ling'er, don't go.

105
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,260
Ling'er.

106
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,380
Ling'er.

107
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:07,900
Ling'er.

108
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,540
Ling'er, don't go.

109
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:11,780
Ling'er.

110
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,260
It's you.

111
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,020
Where's Ling'er?

112
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,860
The old man's promise

113
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,420
has been returned to Mengzi.

114
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,740
How could this happen?

115
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:51,780
Li Daxia,

116
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,420
I've been making you suffer.

117
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,300
I'm sorry.

118
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,220
We helped you.

119
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,540
Look at you now.

120
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,220
We'll be even more unhappy.

121
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,780
You should get up first, okay?

122
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:03,660
Uncle.

123
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:04,540
Come.

124
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,380
Li Daxia,

125
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,380
I'm so lucky to meet you.

126
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:14,380
God will protect Ling'er.

127
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,660
I'll go out first.

128
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,380
Li Daxia.

129
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,060
Li Daxia, what's wrong?

130
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,020
Go.

131
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,180
Han Yixian, she's all fever.

132
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,500
She's very fat and strong.

133
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,500
She's in the chest and the shoulder.

134
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,700
She's in a pure movement.

135
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,620
I'm so tired.

136
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:40,620
Weird.

137
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,620
This is not a poison.

138
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,900
I feel that the internal organs

139
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,100
are good for the lungs.

140
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,140
It's good for the body.

141
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,100
But it looks very hard.

142
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,060
Don't worry.

143
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,660
Take the medicine gun.

144
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,460
Shaoyang.

145
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,780
Lady reform.

146
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:25,380
Your brother,

147
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,660
there's nothing wrong with you anymore.

148
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,020
Mr. Tang Yun,

149
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,460
you looked very tough.

150
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,300
It was your brother,

151
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,220
gangbangers sent you to work with?

152
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,380
What did you say?

153
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,900
will be protected by general Kuro.

154
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,740
He will also have emperor of Chi Kui wang

155
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,740
That could ruin Otherwise the Odin died

156
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,380
Talk clearly!

157
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:45,980
!

158
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,480
What is it?

159
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,640
No thank you!

160
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,420
You may вопросы Tang Yu

161
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,860
Stop

162
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,340
Back off

163
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,040
Brother Tang Yu

164
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,520
Brother Tang Yu

165
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,040
Please don't lie to me

166
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,100
You just had your窄

167
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,440
Can't you cure him?

168
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,740
Say something.

169
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,060
Tang Yu never does anything alone.

170
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,540
He won't kill anyone.

171
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,500
Thank you, Brother Tang Yu.

172
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,340
Princess, don't be like this.

173
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,540
Tang Yu can't stand it.

174
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,460
He's just a slave.

175
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:23,940
Tang Yu doesn't have enough power.

176
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,820
He can keep his life safe for now.

177
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,940
He needs a doctor

178
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,380
to help him sell his gold and silver.

179
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,100
Then he'll have no power.

180
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,460
You'll do as you wish.

181
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,260
I won't forget it.

182
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,060
Princess, you're too serious.

183
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,420
Chou Dan!

184
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,380
Chou Dan!

185
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,060
Chou Dan!

186
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,780
Chou Dan!

187
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,300
Chou Dan!

188
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,500
Brother Xiaoyao.

189
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,460
It's different this time.

190
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:43,540
My life may not be like yours.

191
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,300
But I swear

192
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,300
and everybody who's ripe for today

193
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:59,020
will follow you

194
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,940
every day.

195
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,060
That night,

196
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,060
I wish you a happy life.

197
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,300
Anu, why are you so quiet?

198
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,060
It's not like you.

199
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,340
No, no, no.

200
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,620
This girl is so naughty.

201
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,660
She talks about something

202
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,540
in a hurry all day.

203
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,500
So I went crazy for her.

204
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,300
Anu must be very tired.

205
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,100
Princess, the bed is ready.

206
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,660
You can go upstairs.

207
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,020
Stop.

208
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:08,220
Stop.

209
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,620
Princess, come in.

210
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,620
Director, that's it.

211
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,780
How long will we travel in HSA?

212
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,360
Half a month.

213
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,360
But if no one is with me on this journey,

214
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,360
I will be bored to death.

215
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,360
We are willing to accompany the princess on this journey.

216
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,360
Right, Tang Yu?

217
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,360
You are right.

218
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,360
We are willing to accompany the princess on this journey.

219
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,360
But Elder,

220
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,360
there are some women who are not convenient to talk to men.

221
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,360
So,

222
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,360
is there any way...

223
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,360
I'll go with you.

224
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,360
Okay, I'll go with you.

225
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,360
Okay, I'll go with you.

226
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,360
Okay, I'll go with you.

227
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,360
Okay, I'll go with you.

228
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,360
Okay, I'll go with you.

229
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,360
It's so comfortable.

230
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,360
Princess, you are really a child's stepmother.

231
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,360
Okay, go.

232
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,360
Get up.

233
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,360
There was a big old aunt who was born to be a fool.

234
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,360
She used to play with me and draw her butt.

235
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,360
There was a big old aunt who was really a fool.

236
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,360
One day, she came to the palace to help her.

237
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,360
I took a little piece of her and drew her butt.

238
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,360
She was so scared that she went back to the south.

239
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,360
There was a big old aunt who was really a fool.

240
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,360
One day, I came to the palace to find her.

241
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,360
I took a little piece of her and drew her butt.

242
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,360
Is Ling'er and the others gone?

243
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,360
I asked the passerby's talisman. They said so.

244
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,360
Thank you.

245
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,360
Hey, what do you mean?

246
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,360
I'll go find Ling'er. You go back.

247
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,360
Stop!

248
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,360
Listen to me.

249
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,360
Don't pretend to be a fake.

250
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,360
I won't go back to Suzhou.

251
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,360
Then I'll tell you.

252
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,360
You help me make the sound of the wind.

253
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,360
I'm very grateful to you.

254
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,360
As for Ling'er's matter, I'll go by myself.

255
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,360
So, Ling'er later called me sister.

256
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,360
It's not your own business to find her.

257
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,360
Why do you keep following me?

258
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,360
Shut up!

259
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,360
Find Ling'er.

260
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,360
They went up the road to find Ling'er.

261
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,360
Good.

262
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,360
The mission is complete.

263
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:06,360
We'll send a message to the chief of the police.

264
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,360
Yes.

265
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,360
Stop.

266
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,360
Elder, the road is too steep.

267
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,360
It's dangerous to take the sedan.

268
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,360
Fall back.

269
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,360
Please forgive me.

270
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,360
It's okay.

271
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,360
I'll carry you to the destination.

272
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,360
No, you can't.

273
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,360
Elder, let Ling'er go by herself.

274
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,360
It's a difficult road.

275
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,360
I can't let you be punished by the noble body.

276
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,360
You can do it.

277
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,360
I can do it too.

278
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,360
You have different identities.

279
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,360
You can discuss it with each other.

280
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,360
Please go back.

281
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,360
No.

282
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,360
Do you dislike my status and status?

283
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,360
You don't deserve to carry me.

284
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,360
Elder, you misunderstood.

285
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,360
I don't want to.

286
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,360
Elder, you misunderstood.

287
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,360
I beg your understanding.

288
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,360
It's an important mission to go back.

289
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,360
I beg you not to make things difficult for me.

290
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,360
I don't want to be punished.

291
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,360
Elder, you're tired.

292
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,360
Let Ling'er rest for a while.

293
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,360
Yes.

294
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,360
Tang Yu, take them to the small town.

295
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,360
Let the princess rest.

296
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,360
Yes.

297
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,360
Tingling.

298
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,360
Tang Yu, Xiaobao.

299
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,360
Be good.

300
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,360
Be good with the princess.

301
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,360
Okay.

302
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,360
Elder, they don't know my taste.

303
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,360
You go with them.

304
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,360
I'll prepare something delicious.

305
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,360
No.

306
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,360
She will only do things in vain.

307
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,360
Elder, Ling'er has always listened to you.

308
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,360
I hope you'll listen to Ling'er this time.

309
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,360
I dare not.

310
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,360
Let's go.

311
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,360
Princess, Anluozhi is going.

312
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,360
Let's go.

313
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,360
It smells so good.

314
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,360
Do you know that I'm bored with my uncle?

315
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,360
I don't speak in a day.

316
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,360
I'm not allowed to.

317
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,360
Wrong.

318
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,360
Now I finally give you a breath.

319
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,360
Anluo, can I hold your hand?

320
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,360
Sure.

321
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,360
Really?

322
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,360
Hold his hand.

323
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:46,360
Hold hands and be a good friend.

324
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,360
Young master, we received a secret.

325
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,360
It seems that it's too dirty this time.

326
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,360
Okay.

327
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,360
You two go to the front to check the way.

328
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,360
I'll go with Anluo.

329
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,360
Yes.

330
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,360
Wait, you don't hold hands.

331
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,360
Don't be dirty.

332
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,360
How about I hold your hand?

333
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,360
Wait.

334
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,360
Anluo, do you remember what you promised me at the dance?

335
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,360
I remember that you'll be your bride.

336
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,360
Really? You remember that?

337
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,360
But is there anything delicious?

338
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,360
Of course.

339
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,360
I'll make a big wedding.

340
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,360
The best food is the best wine,

341
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,360
the most guests,

342
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,360
and the most precious gift is for you.

343
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,360
Okay.

344
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,360
Brother, brother, brother, brother.

345
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,360
But you have to make the clothes first.

346
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,360
I'll make the clothes first.

347
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,360
Okay.

348
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,360
But you have to make the clothes first.

349
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,360
Why should I make her promise?

350
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,360
I'm not going to marry her.

351
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,360
I'm not going to say that.

352
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,360
I'll respect her.

353
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,360
But she won't promise.

354
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,360
I'll make her promise.

355
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,360
I'll make you happy.

356
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,360
Is that important?

357
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,360
Yes, it is.

358
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,360
It's delicious.

359
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,360
Why do you always eat what you think?

360
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,360
You don't eat only the wedding.

361
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,360
Of course I know.

362
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,360
But other than eating,

363
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,360
I'll solve everything.

364
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,360
That's right.

365
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,360
But before that,

366
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,360
promise me that you'll do something.

367
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,360
Okay.

368
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,360
Don't talk to Yifu.

369
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,360
You have to obey her.

370
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,360
Got it?

371
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,360
Elder, the Young Mistress has prepared everything.

372
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,360
Young Master, please.

373
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,360
Elder, the road is good.

374
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,360
You can put me down.

375
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,360
Uncle, please.

376
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,360
You don't need to come here.

377
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,360
What brings you down?

378
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,360
Don't you know what is most important,

379
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,360
knowing how to live,

380
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,360
knowing not to live,

381
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,360
seeing from your own Bernard?

382
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,360
Make ways.

383
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,360
Please have a seat.

384
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,360
I'm wrong,

385
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,360
꾹,ics to you for为 her......

386
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,600
What is it?

387
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:24,560
What did you want to know about Liana?

388
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:28,160
Do you want to know more about that place?

389
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,480
Do you want to know more about that place?

390
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:37,400
If you want to go and find her, just say it.

391
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,480
Don't be ridiculous.

392
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,280
Shikun!

393
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,040
Where did you come from?

394
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,680
You can't tell me if you know about this place.

395
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,680
But Master, he is really against you.

396
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,680
He doesn't need to.

397
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,680
I think Elder Master may just be himself.

398
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,680
You still help him talk?

399
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,680
No.

400
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,680
I feel bad for him.

401
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,680
Don't worry.

402
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,680
You go with me.

403
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,680
We will go back to the South Gate together.

404
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,680
Can you?

405
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,680
I can do it.

406
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:24,680
OK. You can come in.

407
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,680
Yes.

408
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,680
Princess said she is full.

409
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,680
Princess means we should share the good food with everyone.

410
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,680
Sit down.

411
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,680
Sit down.

412
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,680
Sit down.

413
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,680
Hurry up.

414
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,680
These dishes are delicious.

415
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,680
These dishes are really delicious.

416
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,680
Shut up.

417
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,680
Do you think we can eat your dishes like this?

418
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,680
I... I just...

419
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,680
I...

420
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,680
Tell me.

421
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,680
I...

422
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,680
A'Lu, don't do this.

423
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,680
OK.

424
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,680
I will put you on the princess' side.

425
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,680
But I remember they didn't eat these dishes.

426
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,680
Yes.

427
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,680
It's hard to eat these dishes with Master.

428
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:42,680
But he is so naughty.

429
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:46,680
So I just used this spell to make them angry.

430
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,680
But they...

431
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,680
You can do it.

432
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,680
But...

433
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,680
You don't want to hurt yourself.

434
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,680
You want to think about A'Lu and me.

435
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,680
Do you know I am bored with that big tiger?

436
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,680
OK. Don't talk anymore.

437
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,680
Just say they are OK.

438
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,680
OK. Let's go.

439
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,680
OK.

440
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,680
Don't worry.

441
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,680
They will be OK soon.

442
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,680
It's OK.

443
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,680
OK. Don't think about it anymore.

444
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,680
Come with me.

445
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,680
Biao, protect the princess.

446
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,680
Yes.

447
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,680
Why didn't you invite her back?

448
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,680
You think it's a mistake?

449
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,680
A'Lu has been trying to protect her.

450
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,680
We will be in trouble if we keep her.

451
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,680
I will deal with her.

452
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,680
You should protect the princess.

453
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,680
Tell me if you are in trouble.

454
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,680
Do you know?

455
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,680
Master knows I will punish us.

456
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,680
I will deal with her.

457
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,680
Be careful. Go.

458
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,680
Yes.

459
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,680
A'Lu, don't go.

460
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,680
Princess, are you feeling unwell?

461
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,680
I want to ask you something.

462
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,680
OK.

463
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,680
If many people want to find you,

464
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:13,680
you should go back to Nanzhao.

465
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,680
But you should tell them not to find you.

466
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,680
Why?

467
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,680
Princess, I know you are in trouble.

468
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,680
But don't be afraid.

469
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,680
We have heard about it.

470
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,680
I will take you with me.

471
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,680
No.

472
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,680
I think you are hiding something from me.

473
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,680
And it's an important thing.

474
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,680
I never tell you.

475
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,680
Can you tell me?

476
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,680
Nanzhao is going to fight.

477
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,680
Who is he going to fight?

478
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,680
Fight yourself.

479
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,680
Why?

480
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,680
We are family.

481
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,680
Yes.

482
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,680
I don't know your father is a king.

483
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,680
And how did you think of master?

484
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,680
Who is he going to fight?

485
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,680
Uncle Baiyue.

486
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,680
Didn't you say that he is a good person?

487
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,680
Yes.

488
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,680
He doesn't want to fight.

489
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,680
And he wants to see you.

490
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,680
He wants to talk with you.

491
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:06,680
He said he can create a beautiful world with you.

492
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,680
Me?

493
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,680
I know that.

494
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,680
You are also from the Baiyue family.

495
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,680
Uncle Baiyue won't accept me.

496
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,680
Princess, you are important.

497
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,680
You can stop fighting after you go back.

498
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,680
Me?

499
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,680
What can I do?

500
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,680
Do I have this ability?

501
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,680
Yes.

502
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,680
I believe you.

503
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,680
Is he a good person or a bad person?

504
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,680
What about my father?

505
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:40,680
If you ask me, I will say that master is a bad person.

506
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,680
But as for your father,

507
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,680
I don't know.

508
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:48,680
Nanny and master are all hate him.

509
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,680
Because he let your mother down.

510
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,680
Really?

511
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,680
He doesn't understand you these years.

512
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,680
Maybe I should go back soon.

513
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,680
I don't understand much.

514
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,680
Why?

515
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,680
Sixu is complicated.

516
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,680
Yes.

517
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,680
Like a bowl of noodles.

518
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,680
Yes.

519
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,680
I really want your trouble.

520
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,680
Like a bowl of noodles.

521
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,680
I can eat it all at once.

522
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,680
I'm going.

523
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,680
Good night.

524
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,680
Have you seen a couple of foreigners?

525
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,680
A girl.

526
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,680
No.

527
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,680
Have you seen a 16-year-old girl?

528
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,680
No.

529
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,680
Thank you.

530
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,680
I want to ask if I have seen a 16-year-old girl.

531
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,680
Have you seen a 16-year-old girl?

532
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,680
With a couple of men?

533
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,680
No.

534
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,680
Have you seen a 16-year-old girl?

535
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:19,680
With a couple of foreigners?

536
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,680
Yes.

537
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,680
You asked me yesterday.

538
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,680
No.

539
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,680
I asked you yesterday.

540
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,680
I didn't ask you today.

541
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,680
No.

542
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,680
No.

543
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,680
You are so generous.

544
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,680
It's cold.

545
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,680
I'm not hungry.

546
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,680
It's so long.

547
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,680
You don't eat.

548
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,680
Do you have strength?

549
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,680
Really?

550
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,680
Why is your heart so heavy?

551
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,680
What did you say?

552
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,680
Don't think I don't know what you're thinking.

553
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,680
You just don't want me to find Ling'er.

554
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,680
You are a pervert.

555
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,680
You are a pervert.

556
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,680
I'm so scared of you.

557
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,680
Who cares about you?

558
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,680
I just want to find Ling'er.

559
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,680
You love her.

560
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,680
You can get out of here.

561
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,680
If you can't find her, don't push the blame on me.

562
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,680
It's a self-discipline.

563
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,680
You...

564
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,680
I tell you.

565
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,680
Ling'er must have some kind of eye for eye.

566
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,680
A man who is a big man.

567
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,680
He only wants to talk about love.

568
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,680
He only wants to ask if he loves you.

569
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,680
Have you thought about it for him?

570
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,680
Why did he become like this?

571
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,680
What happened to him?

572
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,680
He didn't love you so much, but he wants to avoid you.

573
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,680
You are like a mad dog.

574
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,680
You are so noisy.

575
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,680
How did you find him?

576
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,680
Are you happy for him?

577
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,680
I tell you.

578
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,680
The reason he avoided you

579
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,680
is maybe because you love him.

580
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,680
You...

581
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,680
Wake up.

582
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,680
From now on, I won't bother you anymore.

583
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,680
You can be yourself.

584
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,680
You can be yourself.

585
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,680
Get out of the way.

586
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,680
I will never see you again.

587
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,680
Okay.

588
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,680
Thank you.

589
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,680
It smells so good.

590
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,680
Of course.

591
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,680
We chose it ourselves.

592
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,680
It's not a big deal.

593
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,680
I think he is like a useless person.

594
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,680
Yes.

595
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,680
He doesn't allow us to talk casually.

596
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,680
He doesn't allow the princess to walk on his own.

597
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,680
He is so rude.

598
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,680
He is so rude.

599
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,680
Anyway, we are all wrong.

600
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,680
How dare you!

601
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,680
Princess, I didn't expect you to be so naughty.

602
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,680
Actually,

603
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,680
I want to wake up one day.

604
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,680
I am still in the fairy island in the Wuyou Wulü.

605
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,680
I am still here.

606
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,680
Nothing has changed.

607
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:53,680
All of this is just a long nightmare.

608
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,680
Do you want to know Li Xiaoyao?

609
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,680
No.

610
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,680
Do you really think so?

611
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,680
Princess is here.

612
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,680
You go back and report to Young Master.

613
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,680
So you have been following us?

614
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,680
Your Highness.

615
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,680
Young Master was chasing after her because of the princess.

616
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,680
Please forgive him.

617
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,680
Go back and tell him.

618
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,680
Go to hell.

619
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,680
Don't follow us.

620
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,680
It's hard to live.

621
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,680
How dare you!

622
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,680
You bully us.

623
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,680
It's him.

624
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,680
No.

625
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,680
They are just in the middle of the city.

626
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,680
Please stand up.

627
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,680
Thank you, Your Highness.

628
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,680
You two, go to the fire together.

629
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,680
No, we will protect you here.

630
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,680
Thank you.

631
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,680
Your Highness.

632
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,680
Thank you.

633
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,680
Xiaoyao.

634
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,680
Xiaoyao.

635
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,680
Didn't you say no?

636
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,680
Xiaoyao.

637
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,680
Xiaoyao.

638
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,680
Xiaoyao.

639
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,680
Xiaoyao.

640
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,680
Ling'er.

641
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,680
Why?

642
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,680
Why?

643
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,680
Why?

644
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,680
Xiaoyao.

645
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,680
No more wine.

646
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,680
Coming.

647
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,680
You are drunk.

648
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,680
It's not for women.

649
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,680
What do you know?

650
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,680
I...

651
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,680
I abandoned my wife.

652
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,680
I was so drunk.

653
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,680
You abandoned your wife?

654
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,680
She ran away by herself.

655
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,680
She ran away by herself.

656
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,680
She ran away by herself.

657
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,680
Then she ran away.

658
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,680
You wouldn't chase her.

659
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,680
You are so stupid.

660
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,680
Where did you go?

661
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,680
Where did you go?

662
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,680
Did you forget the princess?

663
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,680
Who?

664
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,680
Who do you like?

665
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,680
Of course, Ling'er.

666
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,680
Say it again.

667
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:22,680
Ling'er.

668
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,680
Why don't you go find her?

669
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,680
Ling'er.

670
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,680
Ling'er.

671
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,680
Ling'er.

672
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,680
Ling'er.

673
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,680
Today, I have the world.

674
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,680
Ling'er.

675
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,680
Ling'er.

676
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,680
Ling'er.

677
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,680
Ling'er.

678
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,680
Ling'er.

679
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,680
Ling'er.

680
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,680
Ling'er.

681
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,680
Ling'er.

682
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,680
Ling'er.

683
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,680
Ling'er.

684
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,680
Ling'er.

685
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,680
Ling'er.

686
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,680
Ling'er.

687
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,680
You can go back if you don't need the light.

688
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,680
Are you afraid that I will trouble you

689
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,680
if I say that I am a Tang Yi?

690
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,680
I misunderstood.

691
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,680
I don't understand.

692
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,680
You should go back to the side of the two men.

693
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,680
I am going to the top of the road with the princess.

694
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,680
Don't worry.

695
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,680
They will protect you secretly.

696
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,680
Okay.

697
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,680
Go back.

698
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,680
The princess will worry if she can't see you.

699
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,680
Sit down.

700
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,680
They are so pitiful.

701
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,680
Ling'er.

702
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,680
So beautiful.

703
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,680
Ling'er.

704
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,680
Ling'er.

705
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,680
Be careful.

706
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,680
Ling'er.

707
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,680
Nu.

708
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,680
Can I hold your hand?

709
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,680
No.

710
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,680
I am much better.

711
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,680
What do you want to eat tonight?

712
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,680
I want some peanuts.

713
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,680
So little.

714
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,680
Guess who I met.

715
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,680
Who?

716
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,680
Mrs. Fu.

717
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,680
Is she okay?

718
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,680
She has drunk.

719
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,680
She is a little different.

720
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,680
She is a little different.

721
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,680
Can you be serious?

722
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,680
She said that she has drunk.

723
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,680
She really loves the princess.

724
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,680
I have felt it when I was in Guiyin Mountain.

725
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,680
You are so cool.

726
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,680
Where?

727
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,680
I am asking you.

728
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,680
What is love?

729
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,680
Don't you know?

730
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,680
I just ask you because I don't know.

731
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,680
Don't you know everything?

732
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,680
I didn't teach you.

733
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,680
She...

734
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,680
She doesn't need to teach.

735
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,680
It's a basic skill.

736
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,680
It's the essence of the game.

737
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,680
What is it?

738
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,680
Who is it?

739
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,680
What?

740
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,680
Tell me clearly.

741
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,680
I don't know.

742
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,680
Do you know or pretend to know?

743
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,680
I know.

744
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,680
I know when I met you.

745
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,680
So...

746
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,680
It's...

747
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,680
13.

748
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,680
Tang Yunxiao, you are so funny.

749
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,680
You haven't told me what it is.

750
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,680
Do you really want to know?

751
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,680
Do you want to know?

752
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,680
All right.

753
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,680
Close your eyes.

754
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,680
What?

755
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,680
Don't you want to know?

756
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,680
All right.

757
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,680
What are you doing?

758
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,680
I...

759
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,680
Do you want to kiss her?

760
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,680
No...

761
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,680
Don't...

762
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,680
What is love?

763
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,680
What are you doing?

764
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,680
Let's go.

765
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,680
Princess, you are back.

766
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,680
Where are you going?

767
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,680
I have good news.

768
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,680
Do you want to listen to me?

769
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,680
You found something delicious?

770
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,680
No.

771
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,680
It's Li Xiaoyao.

772
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,680
Is she recovered?

773
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,680
She is so old-fashioned.

774
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,680
That's good.

775
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,680
I heard her saying

776
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,680
she is old-fashioned.

777
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,680
Tang Yunxiao said it.

778
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,680
Do you want to listen to me?

779
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,680
Don't listen to me.

780
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,680
Don't you want to know?

781
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,680
Nunu, don't mention her anymore.

782
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,680
I don't understand.

783
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,680
Princess, what is love?

784
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,680
Do you have any feelings for Tang Yunxiao?

785
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,680
Tang Yunxiao?

786
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,680
No.

787
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,680
After you kissed her,

788
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,680
are you nervous?

789
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,680
Yes.

790
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,680
Do you feel comfortable?

791
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,680
Of course.

792
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,680
Do you want to be with her forever?

793
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,680
No.

794
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,680
I want to be with her forever.

795
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,680
Why?

796
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,680
I learned it from my mother.

797
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,680
Once,

798
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,680
my mother took some men to the forest.

799
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,680
But the general couldn't see her as a woman.

800
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,680
He said he wanted to bully her.

801
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,680
He wanted to beat her.

802
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,680
It's so serious.

803
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,680
But

804
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,680
she kissed the general

805
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,680
when she was in danger.

806
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,680
The general was so angry.

807
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,680
He was so jealous.

808
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,680
So he signed the contract.

809
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,680
Last time,

810
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,680
when Tang Yunxiao almost found the princess,

811
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,680
I kissed her.

812
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,680
I didn't expect it to be so effective.

813
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,680
What's wrong with you?

814
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,680
It's not like this.

815
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,680
You'll understand one day.

816
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,680
Chu Dan.

817
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,680
Don't drink so much.

818
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,680
Ling'er.

819
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,680
Ling'er.

820
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,680
Ling'er.

821
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,680
Ling'er.

822
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,680
Ling'er.

823
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,680
Don't drink.

824
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,680
Don't drink.

825
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,680
Can I find Ling'er if I don't drink?

826
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,680
Brother.

827
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,680
Tell me.

828
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,680
What do I want to do?

829
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,680
He can come back to me.

830
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,680
Don't talk so much.

831
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,680
Do you want to kill him?

832
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:21,680
I do.

833
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,680
You're so drunk.

834
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,680
Ling'er.

835
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,680
Did you see it?

836
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,680
Ling'er.

837
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,680
Ling'er.

838
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,680
Get up.

839
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:47,680
I'll help you.

840
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:51,680
Be careful.

841
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,680
Be careful.

842
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:54,680
I'll help you to get back to bed.

843
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:57,680
Come on.

844
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,680
I...

845
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:05,680
Come on.

846
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,680
You'll feel better when you get out.

847
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,680
Come on. Lie on the bed.

848
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,680
Here.

849
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:21,680
Ling'er.

850
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,680
Ling'er.

851
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,680
Ling'er.

852
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:32,680
Ling'er.

853
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:35,680
He'll think of you.

854
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:39,680
Yuan'ru.

855
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,680
That evil woman.

856
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,680
She doesn't understand.

857
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,680
How can she not understand?

858
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:53,680
Why can't she understand?

859
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,680
Because she hasn't given up.

860
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,680
I won't give up on Ling'er.

861
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,680
I must find her.

862
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:10,680
Yes.

863
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:12,680
We'll find Ling'er.

864
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,680
Ling'er.

865
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:16,680
Ling'er.
