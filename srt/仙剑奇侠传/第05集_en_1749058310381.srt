1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm not afraid of you.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not afraid of you.

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The King of Thrones

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Episode 40

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,500
What?

20
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,500
Help me, Xia!

21
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,500
They are so pitiful.

22
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,000
Let them go.

23
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,000
I don't care how they are.

24
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,500
You are dead.

25
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,500
You dare to go to the martial art world?

26
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,500
You are dead.

27
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,500
You are the one who is dead.

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You are dead.

29
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Ying Jin!

30
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,500
You are dead.

31
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,500
You are dead.

32
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,500
I am killing you.

33
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I am giving it back to you.

34
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:56,500
You are so shameless.

35
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,500
I am telling you, I am the daughter of Lin Jia Feng and Lin Tian Nan.

36
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,500
If you don't let me go, I will kill you.

37
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,500
I will kill you.

38
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,500
I told you to shut up.

39
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,500
So fierce.

40
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,500
Lin, am I the enemy of the world?

41
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,500
Brother Xiaoyao, you are so mean.

42
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,500
Why?

43
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,500
You don't see how he hit me just now.

44
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,500
Let's go.

45
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,500
I told you I am the enemy of the world.

46
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,500
How is it? Did I harm you?

47
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,500
What's wrong with you?

48
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,000
Let's go back.

49
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,500
How can we?

50
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,500
You dare to hit that San Ma Lin.

51
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,000
Let him stay with you.

52
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I am fine.

53
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,000
How can I let others bully you?

54
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,500
You bully him too.

55
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,500
Even if you hit him,

56
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,500
What?

57
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,500
He is the enemy of the world?

58
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,000
My old man taught me to be a good man.

59
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Forget it.

60
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What good man?

61
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,500
You are going to be a loser.

62
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,500
Forget it.

63
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,500
You don't need to save him. I will go by myself.

64
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,500
Okay, I will go.

65
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,500
Little beauty, who tied you here so hard?

66
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,500
You are so dangerous.

67
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,500
This is the punishment for our brothers.

68
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,000
Today, you will be punished.

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Stop it.

70
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Let's go.

71
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I tied this duck.

72
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
No one can touch it.

73
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Stop it.

74
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Let him go.

75
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
He must be very tired.

76
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Don't be angry, my lady.

77
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Brother Xiaoyao is just a momentary anger.

78
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Please forgive him.

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
What's wrong?

80
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Let's settle the condition first.

81
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Don't be angry.

82
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Ling'er, Ling'er.

83
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Ling'er, I am telling you.

84
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,500
Brother Xiaoyao.

85
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,000
You are not hiding.

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I said I am the enemy of the world.

87
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
What can I do?

88
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Brother Xiaoyao.

89
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Brother Xiaoyao.

90
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Brother Xiaoyao.

91
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Brother Xiaoyao.

92
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Why don't you hide?

93
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
His sister is so scary.

94
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
How can I hide?

95
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Brother Xiaoyao.

96
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Brother Xiaoyao.

97
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Brother Xiaoyao.

98
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What should we do?

99
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Let me teach my audience.

100
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I can save people.

101
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Brother Xiaoyao, wait for me.

102
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,000
Brother Xiaoyao.

103
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Brother Xiaoyao.

104
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Ling'er, wait for me.

105
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Ling'er.

106
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Ling'er.

107
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Brother Xiaoyao.

108
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Ling'er, you are awake.

109
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Don't get up.

110
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Lie down.

111
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Ling'er, are you feeling better?

112
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,500
Did I sleep well?

113
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,500
Yes.

114
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,000
You have been sleeping for three hours.

115
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I have been looking for you.

116
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Don't talk so much.

117
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,500
Just wipe your face for him.

118
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,000
It seems to be more comfortable.

119
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Mr. Li.

120
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Let me help you on the This face.

121
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,120
Hello.

122
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,840
What's the big deal in your actions?

123
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
The doctor told me to be careful.

124
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,500
And told me your facial expression was aloof.

125
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,260
He changed my facial expression

126
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,000
to the standard.

127
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You are so thoughtful.

128
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You even mentioned rhythm.

129
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
rhythm?

130
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You are not singing.

131
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
What rhythm?

132
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
rhythm is very important to the blood circulation of the patient.

133
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Look at the left side.

134
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

135
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
The right side.

136
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

137
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You are so thoughtful.

138
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You are so thoughtful.

139
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Brother Ji Yuan, I feel much better.

140
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Hey, hey, hey.

141
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Come, come, come.

142
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Ling'er, come, lie down.

143
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
What?

144
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You know Huang Di Lao, right?

145
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
He is my student.

146
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
What are you talking about?

147
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Our young master is the person who personally wants to be a man.

148
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
His Majesty is very impressed with his young master's knowledge.

149
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
He will be the assistant of the emperor soon.

150
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Next month, he will be a official in Chang'an.

151
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Brother Ji Yuan is really great.

152
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I am sorry.

153
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Young master Li, please listen to me.

154
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The so-called circle of the two worlds.

155
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The Buddha has a cloud.

156
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
The cause is the cycle of the cycle.

157
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
We should be able to disturb people.

158
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
We should be able to disturb people.

159
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Ling'er, I understand.

160
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Brother Ji Yuan is right.

161
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
We should learn from him.

162
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Young master, the time is up.

163
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Young master, he...

164
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Young master.

165
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Xiaojun, speak slowly.

166
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Don't worry.

167
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Have some tea.

168
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
He is back.

169
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Isn't that a good thing?

170
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
But he killed someone.

171
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Father, I am really not a friend.

172
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
He must help me.

173
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
He must help me.

174
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Sister.

175
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Brother.

176
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
What's wrong with you?

177
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Why did you kill someone?

178
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I don't want to.

179
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I really don't want to.

180
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Then...

181
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Did that person really die?

182
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I don't know.

183
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
When I left,

184
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
he was lying on the ground.

185
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
He was crying.

186
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I really don't know.

187
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I know.

188
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Ru'er is not a murderer.

189
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
She is a concubine.

190
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
She is a woman.

191
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
She is seriously injured.

192
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I have arranged everything.

193
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Don't worry.

194
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Why did you do such a horrible thing?

195
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
No wonder she doesn't listen to father.

196
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
She left the house.

197
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
If she stays at home,

198
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
it's good.

199
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You forced me to leave.

200
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
What did I force you?

201
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Why did you force me to leave?

202
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I said I didn't marry her.

203
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I didn't want to.

204
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Then why am I still here?

205
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I just want to find a good man for you.

206
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I want to teach you a lesson.

207
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Look at you now.

208
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You look better than Wu Zhaokin.

209
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
No.

210
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
You...

211
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Brother Xiaoyao,

212
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
things are over.

213
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Please forgive me.

214
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Okay.

215
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I don't mind.

216
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Cousin,

217
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
you are injured because of your son's grace.

218
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Drink this wine.

219
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Who are you helping?

220
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm telling you.

221
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
The sword is so sharp.

222
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You can do it yourself.

223
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Do you want me to give you a try?

224
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You are not well.

225
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You can sit here and eat.

226
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm telling you.

227
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm lucky to have my daughter.

228
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'm here to help.

229
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Who are you afraid of?

230
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Ru'er,

231
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
drink.

232
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You are a gentleman.

233
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Drink it.

234
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Cheers.

235
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You...

236
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Ru'er, you...

237
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm not drinking.

238
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm not.

239
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Don't be too much.

240
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You...

241
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You...

242
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Forget it.

243
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Okay.

244
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'll listen to Ling'er.

245
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Why don't you get up first?

246
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
The food is getting cold.

247
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Right.

248
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Come on.

249
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Let's eat.

250
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Brother Xiaoyao,

251
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
let's eat.

252
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
What do you want?

253
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You want to fight?

254
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Ling'er,

255
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
this is good.

256
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Here, have a bite.

257
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Here you are.

258
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Thank you for your kindness.

259
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
No,

260
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
it's our Ru'er's fault.

261
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Right.

262
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
We should apologize to you.

263
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's your fault.

264
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
What?

265
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I don't know.

266
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You are so bold.

267
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
You are dead.

268
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You dare to do this to me?

269
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Brother Xiaoyao,

270
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
it's our fault.

271
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Okay.

272
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Sit down.

273
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Apologize to me.

274
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
If you want to apologize,

275
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
you should apologize to me.

276
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Please enjoy your meal.

277
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Lin Mo will teach Ru'er a lesson.

278
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm not as good as you

279
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
in the Li Xiaoyao's house.

280
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You are the one who made a mistake.

281
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
She didn't ask for help.

282
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
What are you doing?

283
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I knew you didn't like me.

284
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm not a man.

285
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You...

286
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Li Zhang, cousin.

287
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Jingyuan,

288
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
go and persuade her.

289
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Go out with me.

290
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Your father is a man.

291
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Please don't be angry.

292
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm grateful to you.

293
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Please give me some respect.

294
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Let her stay here for a few days.

295
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Okay?

296
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Who is against me

297
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
in her side?

298
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
How dare you!

299
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Jingyuan is your cousin.

300
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
How can you do this?

301
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Please don't be angry.

302
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
She just wants to get angry.

303
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm serious.

304
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You should ask her to marry you.

305
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Jingyuan,

306
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
it's not that I don't teach you

307
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
how to be a man.

308
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You can't do this to a woman like her.

309
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Is it okay to be a man?

310
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I don't care if it's a man or a woman.

311
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I don't accept it.

312
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm going to bed.

313
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Please leave.

314
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It's not over yet.

315
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You don't have to sleep.

316
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You are just a woman.

317
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You haven't eaten yet.

318
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Go.

319
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm going to wash my clothes.

320
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm going to wash my clothes.

321
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Go.

322
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Go.

323
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Go.

324
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Go on.

325
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Go.

326
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Go on.

327
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Let's go.

328
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
What are you doing?

329
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I'm staying in the hotel room.

330
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
You want to go out again?

331
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Yes.

332
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
How dare you!

333
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I won't do this to you!

334
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
How can I do this to you?

335
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I don't like that woman.

336
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
How dare you!

337
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I'm just a slut!

338
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,840
How dare you!

339
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,000
You like it, you can eat it all.

340
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,680
Why do I have a daughter like you?

341
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,840
Why do I have a father like you?

342
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,320
Did you ask me to punish you?

343
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,840
You've already punished me.

344
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,320
Why do you need to be so anxious?

345
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,520
It's for your own good.

346
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,600
Lin Jia Bu will ask you to be the manager.

347
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,960
He'll come back to take care of you.

348
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,920
What's wrong with that?

349
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,520
It's a matter of two horses.

350
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,840
Why do you want to talk about it?

351
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,640
You just can't see my daughter.

352
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,240
Do you think I won't help you to beat Lin Jia Bu?

353
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,760
As long as you think I'll leave now,

354
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,840
I won't come back.

355
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,600
Can you understand me?

356
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,000
Understand your father's heart?

357
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,000
I don't understand.

358
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,000
I don't understand.

359
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,440
You always look for someone who is blind.

360
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,520
Why are you with me?

361
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,080
I can't find someone I like.

362
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,960
The marriage is done by a father.

363
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,400
It's a matter of the world.

364
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,600
You can't be fooled.

365
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,760
Why can't I?

366
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,040
You're not a fool.

367
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,160
Why can't I?

368
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,840
It's a matter of two horses.

369
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,400
Hey!

370
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,760
You're a official in the imperial court.

371
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,440
You don't allow people to turn on the lights.

372
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,600
I won't change my mind.

373
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,200
I must do it.

374
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,560
My mind won't change.

375
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,280
Lin Jia will be successful.

376
00:16:59,320 --> 00:16:59,840
You...

377
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,560
You can beat me.

378
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,720
You'll never beat me.

379
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,600
Let me tell you.

380
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:04,840
From now on,

381
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,480
you can't mention your mother.

382
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,000
You'll do it as you wish.

383
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,120
If you dare to leave,

384
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,160
or make a fool of yourself,

385
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,680
I'll lock you up in the interview room.

386
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,760
I don't want it.

387
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,880
I don't want it.

388
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,080
You have to want it.

389
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,120
The only way you can do it now

390
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,360
is to beat all the people who challenge you.

391
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,720
In this way,

392
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,040
you can get out of the house.

393
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,280
Mom!

394
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,840
Here.

395
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:55,800
Defense.

396
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,000
Nice.

397
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,200
Go!

398
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,560
Don't be nervous.

399
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,380
He's going to call that blanket?

400
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,680
Come on, let's check.

401
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,680
Good.

402
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,680
Dear relatives and elders,

403
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,680
I believe that you will be having a competition today.

404
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,680
We are all looking forward to it.

405
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,680
Let's not talk about it.

406
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,680
Whoever wants to defeat me,

407
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,680
will be able to get into my Lin family.

408
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,680
And become my Lin Tiannan's Dragon-Honor.

409
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,680
Good!

410
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,680
If you don't want to marry, you have only one choice.

411
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,680
Kill him.

412
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,680
Good.

413
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,680
Good.

414
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,680
The competition begins now.

415
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,680
Which one will be the winner?

416
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,680
I will do it.

417
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,680
Kill him.

418
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,680
Kill him.

419
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,680
Brother Xiao'er, what are you laughing at?

420
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,680
You marry that guy.

421
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,680
You are laughing at me.

422
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,680
I will beat you.

423
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,680
You will suffer a lot.

424
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,680
Kill him.

425
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,680
Go.

426
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,680
Go.

427
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,680
You beat me.

428
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,680
Miss Lin is so good.

429
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,680
So no man dares to kill her.

430
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,680
Brother Xiao'er, why don't you go and compete with him?

431
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,680
This is not a game.

432
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,680
If I win, I will marry him.

433
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,680
Why?

434
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,680
Because this is called competition.

435
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,680
You little fool.

436
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,680
Then you don't want to go up.

437
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,680
If you win him last time,

438
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,680
what if I win again?

439
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,680
What should I do?

440
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,680
Then marry him.

441
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,680
No.

442
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,680
Good.

443
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,680
I won't beat him to death.

444
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,680
I am coming.

445
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,680
The fifth game begins.

446
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,680
I will do it.

447
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,680
You are so good.

448
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,680
Master, we are going to fight you.

449
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,680
Beat him.

450
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,680
Master, go.

451
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,680
Brother Ji Yan.

452
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,680
Isn't he a man?

453
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,680
Cousin, hello.

454
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,680
What are you doing here?

455
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,680
I...

456
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,680
I am here to challenge you.

457
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,680
Sorry.

458
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,680
Cousin, you are so smart.

459
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,680
You are so simple.

460
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,680
Cousin, you are a cousin.

461
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,680
You don't want to be trapped by the curse.

462
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:11,680
So I will do my best to defeat you.

463
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,680
But you don't have to marry me.

464
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:17,680
You can choose your son-in-law.

465
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,680
Come on.

466
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,680
Come on.

467
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,680
Come on.

468
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,680
I am dying.

469
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,680
Don't say that.

470
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,680
Brother Ji Yan is so innocent.

471
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,680
I admire his courage.

472
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,680
Brother Ji Yan.

473
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,680
Brother Ji Yan.

474
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,680
Brother Ji Yan, are you all right?

475
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,680
I lost.

476
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,680
Alright, alright. Get up.

477
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,680
Are you alright?

478
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,680
I don't need you to help me.

479
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,680
I don't need you to help me.

480
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,680
You can't even beat a girl like me.

481
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,680
All of you men are useless.

482
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,680
He's too much.

483
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,680
What are you talking about? You're a bad girl.

484
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,680
What did I say?

485
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,680
All of you men are useless.

486
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,680
You're useless.

487
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,680
Listen, you'd better not interfere.

488
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,680
I've been with you for a long time.

489
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,680
Me too.

490
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:07,680
Listen, I'm going to teach you a lesson today.

491
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,680
Yes, yes.

492
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,680
Come on, you're a good girl.

493
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,680
I'm not.

494
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,680
I'm going to marry you.

495
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,680
I'm not that stupid.

496
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,680
Come on.

497
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,680
Alright.

498
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:36,680
Everyone, I'll teach you a lesson today.

499
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,680
I'll teach you a lesson.

500
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,680
But I'm a good girl.

501
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,680
If I beat this bad girl, I won't marry her.

502
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,680
Don't talk nonsense.

503
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,680
You don't have a chance.

504
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,680
I'll kill you now.

505
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,680
Brother Xiaoyao, I support you.

506
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,680
I support you.

507
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,680
I support you.

508
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,680
Is this your Lu Yilang?

509
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,680
Yes.

510
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,680
You're a good girl.

511
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,680
You're so energetic.

512
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,680
Brother Xiaoyao, I'm going to teach you a lesson.

513
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,680
I'll teach you a lesson.

514
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,680
Great.

515
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,680
Great.

516
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,680
Brother Xiaoyao, I support you.

517
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,680
I support you.

518
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,680
I support you.

519
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,680
I support you.

520
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,680
Be careful.

521
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,680
What are you doing?

522
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,680
You're a good girl.

523
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,680
Brother Xiaoyao, I support you.

524
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,680
Brother Xiaoyao, I support you.

525
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,680
I support you.

526
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,680
I support you.

527
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,680
I support you.

528
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,680
I support you.

529
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,680
You're a good girl.

530
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,680
We support you.

531
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,680
Get up, get up.

532
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,240
Hey,

533
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,880
are you doing something wrong?

534
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,040
I was good at the trib Basic justice appellation.

535
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,920
Get this bad girl.

536
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,240
I calculated her well enough.

537
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,680
How dare you?

538
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,880
My Mia beforehand

539
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,880
What's wrong?

540
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,880
I've been in the temple so many times.

541
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,880
I've been in the temple so many times.

542
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,880
Are you born in the temple or are you born in the temple?

543
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,880
I'm not stupid.

544
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,880
You can tell me. I'll take my spirit back.

545
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,880
Stop.

546
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,880
Brother.

547
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,880
You're not a fool. You want to be my hero.

548
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,880
Tell me. Don't you want to leave?

549
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,880
Old man, what do you want?

550
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,880
I want you to be my hero and apologize to me.

551
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,880
Do your dream.

552
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,880
I'll kill you.

553
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,880
Just you?

554
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,880
Aren't you afraid of my temple?

555
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,880
How dare you?

556
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,880
I didn't lose to him.

557
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,880
He's Xia Sanlan's trick.

558
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,880
I'll beat him and beat him.

559
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,880
Fine. I'll bully you.

560
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,880
Beat him.

561
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,880
You don't know how to use Xia Sanlan's tricks.

562
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,880
I don't need to beat you.

563
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,880
Old man, if I beat him, we'll leave.

564
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,880
See if you have the right to do that.

565
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,880
Why is he so fast?

566
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,880
He's so fast.

567
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,880
He's not my hero.

568
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,880
You want to see?

569
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,880
I won't hurt you.

570
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,880
I won't hurt you.

571
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,880
You learned the sword skills so fast.

572
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,880
Yes.

573
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,880
You're so talented.

574
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,880
You're really a genius.

575
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,880
Did you see that?

576
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,880
Old man, I'm leaving.

577
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,880
Who asked you to leave?

578
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,880
Hey, are you a fool?

579
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,880
Can you tell me?

580
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,880
Did I ask him to leave?

581
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,880
No.

582
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,880
You old fox.

583
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,880
I want you to be my son-in-law.

584
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,880
Congratulations.

585
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,880
Congratulations.

586
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,880
Congratulations.

587
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,880
Congratulations.

588
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,880
Congratulations.

589
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,880
Congratulations.

590
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,880
Congratulations.

591
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,880
Congratulations.

592
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,880
Congratulations.

593
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,880
You heard it.

594
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,880
Beat him.

595
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,880
You're leaving.

596
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,880
Miss Ling'er.

597
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,880
Miss Ling'er.

598
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:35,880
Ling'er.

599
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,880
Go find the doctor.

600
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,880
Ling'er.

601
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,880
Princess, are you nearby?

602
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,880
Miss Ling'er.

603
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,880
Are you okay?

604
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,880
Don't be noisy.

605
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,880
You're so shameless.

606
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,880
I can smell women.

607
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,880
Miss Ling'er.

608
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,880
Are you okay?

609
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,880
What's wrong with me?

610
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,880
Don't you hate...

611
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,880
Hate...

612
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,880
What do you hate?

613
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,880
Say it.

614
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,880
Do you hate being a girl?

615
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,880
When did I say that?

616
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,880
No.

617
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,880
Can I be a girl now?

618
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,880
Xiaoyu.

619
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,880
Tell me.

620
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,880
What do you think of Zhao Ling'er?

621
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,880
He's the one who came back from the hospital.

622
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,880
Tell me.

623
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,880
He's so quiet.

624
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,880
He's so soft.

625
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,880
He's polite.

626
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,880
He's so cute.

627
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:24,880
I'm asking you.

628
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,880
I'm asking you.

629
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,880
Are you sure?

630
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,880
Do you think they're good?

631
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,880
I...

632
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:29,880
Are you sure?

633
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,880
Maybe I haven't been with him for a long time.

634
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,880
I'll find out more if I eat.

635
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,880
Let me ask you.

636
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,880
Who's the one who borrowed Ling'er from you?

637
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,880
Tell me.

638
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,880
Of course, it's Miss Ling'er.

639
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,880
I'm telling you.

640
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,880
Xiaoyu didn't lie to you.

641
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,880
Tell me.

642
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,880
Who's the one who borrowed her from you?

643
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,880
Uncle Zhao.

644
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,880
Ling'er.

645
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,880
You're so stubborn.

646
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,880
Get out of here.

647
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,880
I'm telling you.

648
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,880
I don't want to see you again.

649
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,880
What are you doing here?

650
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,880
You're so stubborn.

651
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,880
I want to see how beautiful you are.

652
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,880
I want to see how beautiful you are.

653
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,880
I don't want to see you again.

654
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,880
I don't want to see you again.

655
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,880
I don't want to see you again.

656
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,880
What are you doing here?

657
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,880
Are you a god?

658
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,880
A woman is ill.

659
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,880
A man is in the factory.

660
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,880
He's rude.

661
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,880
What a nice rude man.

662
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,880
You can take your time.

663
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,880
You're so mean.

664
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,880
Then you won't be hungry.

665
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,880
Miss.

666
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,880
Let me see.

667
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,880
Miss Ling'er.

668
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,880
Miss Ling'er.

669
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,880
Miss Ling'er.

670
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,880
No.

671
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,880
Are you sick or in the secret room?

672
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,880
I'm sick.

673
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,880
The doctor said she's sick.

674
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,880
But she's not sick.

675
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,880
I'll do it.

676
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,880
I'll do it.

677
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,880
I'll do it.

678
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,880
I'll do it.

679
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,880
Miss Ling'er.

680
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,880
Doctor.

681
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,880
You have such small waist.

682
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,880
Miss Ling'er.

683
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,880
Are you OK?

684
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,880
I'll go to the doctor now.

685
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,880
I'll take your little waist.

686
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,880
Where's the doctor?

687
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,880
I lost it.

688
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,880
Let me tell you.

689
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,880
I want you to leave the medicine.

690
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,880
I won't leave her.

691
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,880
I'll give you a lot of time.

692
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,880
And you have time to protect me.

693
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,880
I don't want it.

694
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,880
No.

695
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,880
Li Xiaoyao is not a man.

696
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,880
He's just a man.

697
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,880
A man.

698
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,880
I have many family members.

699
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,880
You're so mean.

700
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,880
Long and Biao.

701
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,880
Pick one for you.

702
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,880
I'll give it to you.

703
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,880
I don't want Ling'er.

704
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,880
I just want Xiaoyao.

705
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,880
Don't drink.

706
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,880
You killed me.

707
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,880
I won't change.

708
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,880
No.

709
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,880
I'm fat.

710
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,880
You're a beauty.

711
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,880
Do you like fat or thin?

712
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,880
I...

713
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,880
I like you.

714
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:37,880
Mr. Li.

715
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,880
Li.

716
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,880
You've worked so hard.

717
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,880
Don't overestimate me.

718
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,880
You forced me to make a fool of you.

719
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,880
Hey, you're beautiful when you talk to that woman.

720
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:51,880
I'm telling you, my ears can't be closed.

721
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,880
Your mouth can be closed.

722
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:01,680
Cousin, why don't we go to the garden to talk?

723
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,080
Don't disturb the meal of the young master.

724
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,880
Who wants to talk to you?

725
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,880
Let me ask you, I'm fat and handsome.

726
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:13,680
You are too much.

727
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,080
You are even more handsome than my monkey.

728
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,080
Really?

729
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,080
You should eat more.

730
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,680
Cousin.

731
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,880
You will be prettier when you eat the white fat.

732
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,680
I ate a lot.

733
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,880
And I was pretty.

734
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,680
I'm telling you, if you eat 100 jin,

735
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,280
you will be even more handsome than me.

736
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,880
I'm going to marry you.

737
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,280
I don't like you.

738
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,080
I'm going to marry you.

739
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,080
Miss, you haven't paid yet.

740
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,080
I want to see your bag.

741
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,080
Miss, you haven't paid yet.

742
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:28,080
I want to see your bag.

743
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,080
Miss, what do you want to eat?

744
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,080
I want to eat.

745
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,080
Then I'll eat.

746
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,080
It's delicious.

747
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,080
All of you, come here.

748
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,080
Okay.

749
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,080
So you are here.

750
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,080
How are you?

751
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,080
Pay.

752
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,080
I'm here.

753
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,080
I want to see Tang Yu.

754
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,080
I'm sorry.

755
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,080
I forgot to bring Tang Yu here.

756
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,080
He is my ex-boyfriend.

757
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,080
What does he want to eat?

758
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,080
He wants to take care of me.

759
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,080
Your Majesty.

760
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,080
I can change my fairy.

761
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,080
Open it.

762
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,080
Where is Yu?

763
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,080
No.

764
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:08,080
How did it turn out like this?

765
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,080
I'm so hungry.

766
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,080
I'm so hungry.

767
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,080
I'm so hungry.

768
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,080
I'm so hungry.

769
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,080
Master Shamu.

770
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,080
Master Shamu.

771
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,080
I'm really hungry.

772
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,080
How can I find it?

773
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,080
Doesn't this have Fanчив's name?

774
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,080
Wow!

775
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,080
Nana Ma Ma Ma.

776
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,080
I need it.

777
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,080
répondeman fill.

778
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:17,880
Master, I heard the sound of the sound of the little bird in the kitchen.

779
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:21,480
That was the sound of the bird.

780
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,480
Then, I heard it again.

781
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,280
It turned out to be a chicken.

782
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:30,280
He told me to eat it.

783
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,680
Eat it.

784
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,880
So, I helped a big horse.

785
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,680
I ate it.

786
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,680
You are so mean.

787
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,680
You stole the food.

788
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,880
No.

789
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,480
You can't go to the kitchen anymore.

790
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,480
You know that?

791
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,280
I can eat it myself.

792
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,280
I told your mother not to use the food.

793
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:56,480
I can make up for it.

794
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,280
You can grow a big beard every time you make up for it.

795
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,280
Then, I can make up for it.

796
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,280
You can grow a hair every time you make up for it.

797
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,680
No.

798
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,080
You can grow a beard.

799
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:14,080
You can grow a big beard or a rabbit.

800
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,080
No.

801
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,680
No.

802
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,680
Please.

803
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:28,280
My chicken.

804
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:32,080
Master Shangguan didn't teach me how to make up for it.

805
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,880
No.

806
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,880
Master Shangguan didn't teach me how to make up for it.

807
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,880
What should I do?

808
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:15,080
Why is it like this?

809
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:19,080
I don't want to be a big man.

810
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,080
Master Shangguan.

811
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:15,080
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

812
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:28,080
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

813
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:44,280
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

814
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,080
Lin.

815
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,080
Xiao You, I need to go.

816
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,480
Listen to me.

817
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,480
Let me tell you, Jingyuan is a monster.

818
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,280
He's a good boy. I'll take you to him.

819
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,480
Why do you always want to make up for him?

820
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,080
He treats me well.

821
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,880
He came to visit me several times every day and would chat with me.

822
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,280
Haiqing gave me food.

823
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,720
What? What did he say to you?

824
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,200
Hey, is there any medicine in here?

825
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,320
Brother Xiaoyao, you're too much.

826
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,920
Brother Ji Yuan is kind. Why are you...

827
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:23,080
Hey, don't open your mouth to Brother Ji Yuan.

828
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,520
Close your mouth to Brother Ji Yuan.

829
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,320
You're crazy.

830
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,380
Brother Ji Yuan.

831
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,040
D ein

832
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,340
Lin Er

833
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:30,380
Зд Kund ground, Li Er

834
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:31,100
Sorry, it's my fault

835
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,340
I...rather thanJI

836
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:37,100
Why don't you look out?

837
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:40,100
Ling'er, I beg you. Open the door.

838
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:43,100
Ling'er, what do you want? Please forgive me.

839
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:45,100
I was wrong.

840
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:48,100
Fine, fine. You can leave now.

841
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,100
Let your Ji Yuan Geng come to you.

842
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:43,100
I've always been destined to have no future with you.

843
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:50,100
I'm a blank, disappearable blank.

844
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:54,100
Don't say anything.

845
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:57,100
I don't want to understand.

846
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:04,100
At least I still have a beautiful dream.

847
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:07,100
Don't say anything.

848
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:11,100
I really don't want to understand.

849
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:17,100
I finally understand that I should let go.

850
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:21,100
Don't say anything.

851
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:24,100
I don't want to understand.

852
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:31,100
At least I still have a beautiful dream.

853
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:35,100
Don't say anything.

854
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:38,100
I really don't want to understand.

855
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:44,100
I finally understand that I should let go.
