1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not afraid of you.

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Good!

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Come, fighting with the Grand Emperor!

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Hahaha.

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:12,000
мет逼

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,040
Capsestra

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Your Majesty, I've never blamed you.

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
To Your Majesty, I'm more than willing to do anything.

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
How dare you!

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You're getting too much.

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
He's the devil behind the country.

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Kill him!

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Kill the empress!

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Kill the empress!

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm not in favor of Your Majesty.

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Kill him!

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Your Majesty, why didn't you say anything?

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What's the problem?

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Your Majesty, you can't go back.

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You just make a decision.

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
No, I can't make this decision.

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Our people are defeated.

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You and I can't do anything.

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Qing'er, how can you make this decision?

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
This is a crime.

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
This is a crime.

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Kill the empress!

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Go!

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Kill him!

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
He's the devil behind the country.

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The empress.

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
How can you kill him?

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
He's the devil behind the country.

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The devil behind the country.

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You're the devil behind the country.

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Kill the empress!

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Kill the empress!

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Who's the Taoist?

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Do you think he's your friend?

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I can believe it.

56
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Qing'er is the real one.

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The body is the real one.

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What about the soul?

59
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Have you ever doubted His Majesty?

60
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You can't kill him.

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But if he's the devil,

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
it's impossible.

63
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
He'll prove it to His Majesty.

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
He's the devil behind the country.

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
He's the devil behind the country.

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
He's the devil behind the country.

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Can't you prove your innocence?

68
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Kill!

69
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The empress sent me to save you.

70
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The empress.

71
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
The empress.

72
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
The empress.

73
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Kill!

74
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Kill!

75
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
The empress.

76
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You brat!

77
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You're still here?

78
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm not going to use this fan tomorrow.

79
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm going to use the oil.

80
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Don't be so cruel.

81
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
How?

82
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Go inside.

83
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Go.

84
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Open the door.

85
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Hurry up.

86
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Wake up.

87
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Why didn't you come?

88
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'll bring the gun up.

89
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But only three of us are here.

90
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You're a fool.

91
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You're still here?

92
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Hurry up.

93
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Come on.

94
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Three guests.

95
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Have some tea.

96
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Have some tea.

97
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Is there any room?

98
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
No.

99
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
The guest room.

100
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Guest room?

101
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Of course.

102
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
The whole building is a guest room.

103
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Some people can only sleep on the floor.

104
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Look, you're all in the dust.

105
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You're not in the guest room.

106
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
What's wrong with you?

107
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You don't know that.

108
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I've been busy since morning.

109
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I don't have time to clean up.

110
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
He's right.

111
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
We're busy every day.

112
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
We don't have time to eat or drink.

113
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
God, look at him.

114
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
He's tired.

115
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
He's sleeping.

116
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Why is it so quiet here?

117
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's so strange.

118
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Look.

119
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
What time is it now?

120
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
10 o'clock.

121
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yes.

122
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Where are the guests now?

123
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
They're all sleeping.

124
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Take away all of them.

125
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
We're going to take this shop away.

126
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's here.

127
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's here.

128
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You're so clever.

129
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I mean,

130
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
you're going to take this shop away.

131
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
But...

132
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's hard.

133
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's so sincere.

134
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm almost crying.

135
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Since you're sincere,

136
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'll take it out.

137
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You're so clever.

138
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'll take it out.

139
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'll take it out.

140
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'll take it out.

141
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'll take it out.

142
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'll take it out.

143
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Hello, everyone.

144
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Hello, everyone.

145
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I've got up.

146
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Hello, everyone.

147
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I've got up.

148
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm sorry.

149
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I know you're happy here.

150
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You're sleeping well.

151
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
But...

152
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
But three adults

153
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
have taken the shop away.

154
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Everyone, get up.

155
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
What are you doing?

156
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You're sleeping?

157
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Li, I'm asking you.

158
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Why are you here?

159
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Sorry, I'm sorry.

160
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Please take care of me.

161
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Three guests,

162
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
we're so busy with this shop.

163
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
We're so busy with this shop.

164
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
We can't open it.

165
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
But they said

166
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
you don't have class at all.

167
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Who said that?

168
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Those people

169
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
are good businessmen.

170
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Sorry, let's go.

171
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Let's go.

172
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Listen.

173
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The cave is clear.

174
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Let's go.

175
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
My dear nephew.

176
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Get up.

177
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Look at you.

178
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You're so miserable.

179
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
What's wrong with you?

180
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Nothing.

181
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You put Xiaozhou's temper in the body.

182
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You want to kill me.

183
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Everyone, look.

184
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
My nephew

185
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
can make you

186
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
wrap the shop

187
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
and make people fall down.

188
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
But don't worry.

189
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'll make him

190
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
buy the best rice

191
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
and the best food.

192
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
The pureest wine

193
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
to make you feel better.

194
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
That's all.

195
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You can't do it yourself.

196
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You want to kill me?

197
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Go ahead.

198
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Let's go.

199
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Let's go.

200
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Let's go.

201
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Let's go.

202
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Xiaoyou

203
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
will come

204
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
at this time.

205
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You're still thinking about Xiaoyou?

206
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Forget it.

207
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I saw him

208
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
with another woman yesterday.

209
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What?

210
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Another one?

211
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And

212
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
that girl

213
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
is only five years old.

214
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You're so stupid.

215
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
You should be with Xiaohu.

216
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
She's sincere to you.

217
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
My dear sister.

218
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Stop thinking about it.

219
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Let's do something.

220
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You can have money.

221
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Don't be a man.

222
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Don't be a man.

223
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It's so tight.

224
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
You don't want

225
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
such fresh food?

226
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
What are you doing?

227
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
You want to bite me?

228
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Xiaoyou

229
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
the dog you signed yesterday

230
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
is so cute.

231
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Where did you get it?

232
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I got it.

233
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Xiaoyou

234
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
you're so kind.

235
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Yesterday

236
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I told Xiong Lan

237
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
that you're a killer.

238
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
But that dog

239
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
is really good.

240
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Do you want to try it?

241
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Who's the five-year-old boy?

242
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
The fox-eared one.

243
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Okay.

244
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Don't be angry.

245
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'll call you

246
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
my love.

247
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You're my brother-in-law.

248
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
What do you think?

249
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
No, my wife.

250
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
How can I be your brother-in-law?

251
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Oh, I see.

252
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Fine.

253
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'll go find my wife.

254
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Then I'll go find my wife.

255
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Why don't you go with me?

256
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I'm so lucky.

257
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
When will you die?

258
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
What?

259
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You'll die after you're rich.

260
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
This is the biggest luck for men.

261
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Xiaohu

262
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You think so?

263
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Yes.

264
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Xiaohu

265
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
how do you know

266
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
what we're talking about?

267
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
What Xiaoyou said is right.

268
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I'm not sure.

269
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It's true.

270
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
So beautiful.

271
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Do you love me?

272
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Yes.

273
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Just find a husband

274
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
who can cure your life.

275
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You're not a good wife.

276
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
How can you be so lucky?

277
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Yes.

278
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Every successful man

279
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
will have a woman.

280
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Yes.

281
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Li Xiaoyou

282
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I told you to buy something

283
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
and you're here to make a fuss.

284
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Try my big spoon.

285
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
They're here again.

286
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Stop.

287
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Stop.

288
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
You little brat.

289
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I'll teach you a lesson.

290
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Stop.

291
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Stop.

292
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
What do you want?

293
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I want big fish and big meat.

294
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's good to have a lot of meat.

295
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Xiaoyou

296
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
bring him in.

297
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Okay.

298
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'll pay for it.

299
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Hurry up.

300
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
You scared me.

301
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Help me.

302
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Xiaoyou

303
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Who's Xiaoyou again?

304
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Hit me.

305
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
You're dead.

306
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
What's wrong?

307
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
What's wrong?

308
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Tell me.

309
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Do you have any family?

310
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
They're talking behind you.

311
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
They're talking behind me?

312
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Listen.

313
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
They said you had a father and a wife.

314
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I can't stand it.

315
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Go and hit them.

316
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Don't come over.

317
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Don't come over.

318
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Stop.

319
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Go home.

320
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Didn't you see my mom?

321
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You little brat.

322
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Go.

323
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
No.

324
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
No.

325
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Help me.

326
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Come.

327
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Kneel down in front of the ancestors.

328
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Kneel down.

329
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm not wrong.

330
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I'm kneeling down for you.

331
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You're right.

332
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
They'll scold you.

333
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
They'll be enemies to you.

334
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
How do I know?

335
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Stop.

336
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You're not going to the battle.

337
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
You're innocent.

338
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
You're not going to fight.

339
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
You're going to gamble.

340
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
You're going to run away.

341
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
You're not doing anything.

342
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
They'll throw you into the pit.

343
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I'm the one.

344
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
You're the one.

345
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Who's going to get involved?

346
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
They're scolding you for having a father and a wife.

347
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
They'll be angry at you for that.

348
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I'm the one who's going to do it.

349
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm not only going to raise you.

350
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I'm going to teach you.

351
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
You know that?

352
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I've learned all the tricks.

353
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I've learned them from you.

354
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
If it wasn't for this poor girl.

355
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
If it wasn't for my parents coming back.

356
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I wouldn't have given you

357
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
those tricks that you can't even use.

358
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You...

359
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
What?

360
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
What?

361
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You want to say that I'm innocent?

362
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I'm telling you.

363
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I'm innocent.

364
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I...

365
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I hate this shop.

366
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I hate the ugly women you've known.

367
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I hate them the most.

368
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's you.

369
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You little brat.

370
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Apologize to me.

371
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Apologize.

372
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
You should be apologizing.

373
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It's you.

374
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Don't go.

375
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I won't come back.

376
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You come back.

377
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I'm telling you.

378
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You come back.

379
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Stop playing with me.

380
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Ugly woman.

381
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Pretty woman.

382
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Shen Shen, what's wrong?

383
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Shen Shen.

384
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Shen Shen, wake up.

385
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Shen Shen, sorry.

386
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I didn't mean it.

387
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Don't scare me, Shen Shen.

388
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Boss.

389
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Will you succeed in this?

390
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Yes.

391
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Only for her so-called...

392
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
love.

393
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Doctor Qian.

394
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
What's wrong with Shen Shen?

395
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
What did you say?

396
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
What did you say?

397
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
What did you say?

398
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm here to help you.

399
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Xiaoyao, calm down.

400
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Can I calm down?

401
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I'm sorry.

402
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I didn't mean to do this.

403
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You're a doctor.

404
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
You know medicine.

405
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You read medicine.

406
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
But this is not medicine.

407
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I'm not good at reading medicine.

408
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I can't read medicine.

409
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Shen Shen.

410
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Shen Shen.

411
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Shen Shen.

412
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Don't scare me.

413
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Shen Shen.

414
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Shen Shen, don't scare me.

415
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Shen Shen.

416
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I'm not good at reading medicine.

417
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I shouldn't have been a doctor.

418
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I shouldn't have been angry with you.

419
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Doctor Qian.

420
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Do you know other doctors?

421
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
They know this medicine.

422
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Xiaoyao.

423
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
You have to be prepared.

424
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
She will...

425
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
No.

426
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
She won't.

427
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Shen Shen.

428
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Shen Shen.

429
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Master.

430
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Can you really save me?

431
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Shen Shen.

432
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I know this.

433
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Yu Hangzhen is in the southwest.

434
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
He has a fairy.

435
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
The fairy has many spiritual pills.

436
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It's said that

437
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
it can cure all diseases.

438
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Even a dead person can save him.

439
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Really?

440
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
But the secret of the island is not a secret.

441
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It's not a consciousness.

442
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I'm not scared.

443
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
As long as I can save Shen Shen,

444
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I can do anything.

445
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I can do it.

446
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Little brother.

447
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I know you.

448
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
You are a good friend.

449
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
You are a filial son.

450
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I have two treasures here.

451
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I can lend you one.

452
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Master.

453
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
We meet each other in the water.

454
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
You...

455
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
You treat me so well.

456
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
That's a broken hammer.

457
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It can be used to break the stone.

458
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Those mechanisms will automatically break the spirit.

459
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Then,

460
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
we will find the fairy.

461
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
And the medicine.

462
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
You can't be afraid of the poison.

463
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
It's not a big deal.

464
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Until we find the fairy,

465
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
you can leave.

466
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
The Demon King.

467
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
You must wait for me.

468
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I will get the fairy back.

469
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Ghost Valley Cave

470
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
It's here.

471
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Ghost Lord怎麼了?

472
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Help me!

473
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I'm afraid I'll be late.

474
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I'll go to the temple.

475
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I'll go to the temple.

476
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I'll go to the temple.

477
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I'll go to the temple.

478
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I'll go to the temple.

479
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I'll go to the temple.

480
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I'll go to the temple.

481
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I'll go to the temple.

482
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I'll go to the temple.

483
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I'll go to the temple.

484
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I'll go to the temple.

485
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I'll go to the temple.

486
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I'll go to the temple.

487
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I'll go to the temple.

488
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
The temple is here.

489
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
The narcs are just coming out of the palace.

490
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,920
That's why the winem weakened angry and obviously severely injured.

491
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,960
Now the centipede is going.

492
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,960
I thought of something interesting.

493
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,360
The Lord of the Hall has sent me and you too

494
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,800
to stay and wait in the palace.

495
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,040
Go.

496
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,740
I will give you this.

497
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:08,080
Thank you.

498
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,780
Why is it like it's towering at thetern temple?

499
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,080
Why didn't I get it when I heard it coming back?

500
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,600
Get away from me.

501
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,720
Do not be afraid.

502
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,440
No don't be afraid.

503
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,040
You dare to chase me?

504
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,040
Ha ha ha ha ha

505
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,040
Ha ha ha ha

506
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,040
Why is there a girl's clothes?

507
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:04,040
Wow, it smells good.

508
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,040
Ha ha ha ha ha

509
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,040
So beautiful.

510
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:22,040
I've never seen such a beautiful girl before.

511
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,040
Who is it? Is it Xiao Hua?

512
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,040
I'm not Xiao Hua.

513
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,040
Who are you? Why are you here?

514
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,040
I'm here to get the medicine.

515
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,040
I'm here to get the medicine.

516
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,040
Please forgive me.

517
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,040
You...

518
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,040
Don't come over.

519
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,040
I'm not coming over.

520
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,040
Sister Xian Yu, I dare not bully you.

521
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,040
It's my aunt who got a serious illness.

522
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,040
I came here to get the medicine.

523
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,040
Please give me the medicine.

524
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,040
Why are you taking my clothes?

525
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,040
Do you want to threaten me?

526
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,040
No, no, no.

527
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,040
I don't want to take your clothes away.

528
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,040
I'll put your clothes here.

529
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,040
You're not going to go.

530
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,040
You're going to be my backup.

531
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,040
Let's go to the five accounts.

532
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,040
Okay, okay.

533
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,040
No, ten accounts.

534
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,040
Okay, okay.

535
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,040
Stay away.

536
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,040
Don't steal.

537
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,040
I... I won't steal.

538
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,040
Sister Xian Yu, are you okay?

539
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,040
Sister Xian Yu, are you okay?

540
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,040
Sister Xian Yu, please.

541
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,040
My grandma said that the men who steal the girl's bath are bad men.

542
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,040
They're the shadows.

543
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,040
I'll kill you.

544
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,040
Okay.

545
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,040
Brother, where are we going now?

546
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,040
I'll take you to the western side of the country.

547
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,040
Brother Xian Yu.

548
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,040
I knew you would come to see me.

549
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,040
I finally got you.

550
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,040
What?

551
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,040
I'm not a thief.

552
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,040
What?

553
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,040
I'm a spirit, Brother Xian Yu.

554
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,040
Spirit?

555
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,040
Come here, Brother Xian Yu.

556
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,040
I've been waiting for you every day.

557
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,040
I've prepared a gift for you.

558
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,040
What gift?

559
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,040
That's great.

560
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:11,040
I'll play the game of the devil every day.

561
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,040
I've waited for ten years.

562
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,040
You finally came back.

563
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,040
We really know each other.

564
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,040
Of course.

565
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,040
Don't forget.

566
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,040
Hu Tuchong, we met ten years ago.

567
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,040
We?

568
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,040
Why can't I remember?

569
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,040
Really?

570
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,040
Yes.

571
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,040
I see.

572
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,040
You can remember it now.

573
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,040
Ten years ago, I came here to see Brother Xian Yu.

574
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,040
You mean ten years ago?

575
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,040
Yes.

576
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,040
I've calculated it.

577
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,040
Today is just ten years.

578
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:53,040
Ten years ago, I was just that tall.

579
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,040
Really?

580
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,040
I should be taller than you.

581
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,040
A little bit taller.

582
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,040
Brother Xian Yu, you're so unchanging.

583
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,040
You always make Ling'er so happy.

584
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,040
I'll take you to see something.

585
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,040
Let's go.

586
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,040
Hurry up.

587
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,040
Wait.

588
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,040
Uncle, look who I've come to see.

589
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,040
You're talking to him?

590
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,040
Brother Xian Yu,

591
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,040
say hello to him.

592
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,040
He's always thinking of you like I do.

593
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,040
Look, he's smiling.

594
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,040
Thank you, sister.

595
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,040
When can you take me to get the medicine?

596
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,040
I haven't seen these.

597
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,040
Wait a minute.

598
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,040
What's this?

599
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,040
This is the homework you taught Ling'er ten years ago.

600
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,040
Let's go.

601
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,040
Let's go.

602
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,040
What's this?

603
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,040
I fell down when I was seven.

604
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,040
It hurts.

605
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,040
But I didn't cry at all.

606
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,040
Because you said that

607
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,040
no matter what,

608
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,040
I'm smiling.

609
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,040
You're so unchanging.

610
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,040
What's this?

611
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,040
This is Ling'er's life.

612
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,040
I promised Brother Xian Yu

613
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,040
that I'd be happy every day.

614
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,040
I'll always be smiling.

615
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,040
What?

616
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,040
If these are true,

617
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,040
you must be a good boy.

618
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,040
I'll always be waiting for you.

619
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,040
But there's one thing

620
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,040
that you must do well.

621
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,040
What is it?

622
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,040
It's that seed you taught Ling'er ten years ago.

623
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,040
It hasn't blossomed yet.

624
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,040
What seed?

625
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,040
Brother Xian Yu, you forgot.

626
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,040
I'll take you to see it.

627
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,040
Sister Xian Yu,

628
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,040
I'm sick and dying at home.

629
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,040
I'm here to get the medicine.

630
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,040
I can't play with you.

631
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,040
Come on.

632
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,040
I'm sick and dying at home.

633
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,040
I can't play with you.

634
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,040
I'm sick and dying at home.

635
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,040
I can't play with you.

636
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,040
I'm sick and dying at home.

637
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,040
I'm sick and dying at home.

638
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,040
I can't play with you.

639
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,040
I'm sick and dying at home.

640
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,040
Don't be angry.

641
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,040
I promise you

642
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,040
that after I'm cured,

643
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,040
I'll come to you.

644
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,040
There's no other sister

645
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,040
but you.

646
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,040
I'll take the medicine.

647
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,040
Brother Xian Yu.

648
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,040
Brother Xian Yu,

649
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,040
wait for Ling'er.

650
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,040
I can't wait for Shen Shen.

651
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,040
Brother Xian Yu.

652
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,040
Sorry, Brother Xian Yu.

653
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,040
Ling'er only cares about herself.

654
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,040
I forgot about you.

655
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,040
Ling'er.

656
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,040
Miss Liang.

657
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,040
Are you really just a normal person?

658
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,040
Are you a monster?

659
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,040
No.

660
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,040
If you ever do anything,

661
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,040
you won't let Brother Xian Yu suffer.

662
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,040
Let's go to get the medicine now.

663
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,040
I'm so proud of you.

664
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,040
You did this for Miss Liang.

665
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,040
Do you need to do this between us?

666
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,040
I'm not good at Shen Shen.

667
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,040
Let's go get the medicine.

668
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,040
Come on.

669
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,040
Are you okay?

670
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,040
I'm fine.

671
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,040
She's not hurt, right?

672
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,040
I found it.

673
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,040
With it,

674
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,040
Shen Shen will recover soon.

675
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,040
What's so angry?

676
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,040
This is a purple gold pill.

677
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,040
It can cure all diseases.

678
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,040
Last time,

679
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,040
I asked Brother Xiaohu

680
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,040
to take this medicine.

681
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,040
Xiaohu?

682
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,040
Do you know him?

683
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,040
He's my best friend.

684
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,040
Really?

685
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,040
You're so filial.

686
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,040
Where?

687
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,040
Brother Xian Yu,

688
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,040
it's late.

689
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,040
Go back and get Shen Shen.

690
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,040
Okay.

691
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,040
Ling'er.

692
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,040
Ling'er is back.

693
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,040
This way.

694
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,040
Ling'er.

695
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,040
How many times have I said that?

696
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,040
You're so scary.

697
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,040
I'll punish you.

698
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,040
Ling'er.

699
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,040
Why are you looking at me?

700
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,040
What are you doing?

701
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,040
It's fun.

702
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,040
Why is Ling'er gone?

703
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,040
You...

704
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,040
Do you know?

705
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,040
This is called a trick.

706
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,040
He's called a trick?

707
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,040
No.

708
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,040
I mean,

709
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,040
you're tricking me.

710
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,040
This is called a trick?

711
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,040
What will happen?

712
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,040
I'll punish you.

713
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,040
What?

714
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,040
I...

715
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,040
I'll do something bad.

716
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,040
What do you think?

717
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,040
Are you scared?

718
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,040
This is called a bad thing.

719
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,040
I'll do it too.

720
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,040
How is it?

721
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,040
Are you scared?

722
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,040
I'm telling you.

723
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,040
You'll do something bad

724
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,040
to me.

725
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,040
What?

726
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,040
Ling'er doesn't know?

727
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,040
Ling'er.

728
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,040
Ling'er.

729
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,040
Ling'er.

730
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,040
How dare you!

731
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,040
How dare you!

732
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,040
Eunuch!

733
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,040
Eunuch!

734
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,040
We finally meet you.

735
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,040
Come here.

736
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,040
Ling'er.

737
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,040
These are all what Ling'er painted when he was young.

738
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,040
I remember what Eunuch looked like.

739
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,040
I liked to paint like this since I was a child.

740
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,040
How is it possible?

741
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,040
We've never met each other before.

742
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,040
Mr. Xiao Ya.

743
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,040
This is what Ling'er liked the most.

744
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,040
A little fat.

745
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,540
That day, when the South Zhao State was in a disaster,

746
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:56,040
the whole country was in chaos and was trapped in the flood.

747
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:00,540
The credit was immediately sent to rescue Ling'er and his life.

748
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,540
I?

749
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,540
Brother Xiaoyao came to save us with his sword.

750
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,040
At that time, Ling'er was crying.

751
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:14,540
Later, until you took me to see the red-pink cloth in Man Shan,

752
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,540
I didn't cry.

753
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:21,540
You even promised me that you would live happily ever after.

754
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:24,040
Finally, you gave me a seed.

755
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,040
You said that as long as this seed is blooming,

756
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:28,040
you would come to see me again.

757
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,040
Seed?

758
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:34,040
Could it be that I can't remember the seeds ten years ago?

759
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,040
To be honest,

760
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,540
I never left our town

761
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:43,040
except for this time to get the medicine.

762
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:47,040
Besides, I was just this tall ten years ago.

763
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,040
How could I have saved your Xia?

764
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,040
I can't.

765
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:53,540
Ling'er.

766
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,040
Brother Xiaoyao, I can't.

767
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,040
I took you to see the seed.

768
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,540
You will remember it after you see it.

769
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,040
Come.

770
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,040
Ling'er.

771
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:04,540
Brother Xiaoyao,

772
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,040
I will put the seed you gave me here.

773
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:09,540
Miss Ling'er, you are mistaken.

774
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,540
Brother Xiaoyao, take a look.

775
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,540
You might remember it.

776
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:18,040
I would give it to him every morning, noon, evening, and three times a day.

777
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,540
But I don't want to give him too much water.

778
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:22,040
I'm afraid that he might get bad seeds.

779
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,540
I can't give him too little water.

780
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:25,040
I will feed him.

781
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,540
I want to grow up healthy.

782
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,540
Ling'er,

783
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,040
I'm not your brother Xiaoyao.

784
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:35,040
You are brother Xiaoyao.

785
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,540
You are brother Xiaoyao.

786
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:44,540
You said that you have taken care of this seed for ten years.

787
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:48,040
Why didn't it sprout?

788
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:53,540
It's broken.

789
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,540
Brother Xiaoyao,

790
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:58,540
is it because you are not a good doctor?

791
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,540
You broke the seed.

792
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:08,040
It's just a stone.

793
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:14,540
It's a stone.

794
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:21,540
I know that you won't lie to me.

795
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:22,540
Am I right?

796
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:23,540
I...

797
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:28,540
I know that you will never lie to Ling'er.

798
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:30,540
Ling'er?

799
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:31,540
Even if it's a stone,

800
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:33,540
it's also a gift from brother Xiaoyao.

801
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:36,540
So it will sprout.

802
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:43,540
Ling'er,

803
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:46,540
it's Xiaoyao.

804
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:49,540
Come in.

805
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:56,540
Ling'er,

806
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:58,540
Xiaoyao broke the seed.

807
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:00,540
Please forgive me.

808
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:02,540
I understand your filial piety.

809
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,540
But I still have a question.

810
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:07,540
Ling'er,

811
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:09,540
Ling'er,

812
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,540
I am not the one you are talking about.

813
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:13,540
I know.

814
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:15,540
I just want to know

815
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:17,540
if your hometown is in Yuhang Town.

816
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:19,540
How do you know?

817
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:20,540
My child,

818
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:23,540
your father is a martial arts master.

819
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:24,540
Does he look like

820
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,540
the one you are looking at?

821
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,540
When my father was three years old,

822
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:32,540
he went out with my mother to create the martial arts world.

823
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:36,540
My sister has a very bad impression of him.

824
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:38,540
So he is Xia's father.

825
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:40,540
Then I shouldn't be wrong.

826
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:41,540
What is your father's name?

827
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:42,540
Li Sansi.

828
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:44,540
Li Sansi?

829
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:47,540
I think

830
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:49,540
I am not good enough to help

831
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:51,540
my father.

832
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:55,540
So I use my son's name

833
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:56,540
to replace him.

834
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,540
He is a gentleman.

835
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:01,540
No wonder.

836
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:03,540
So the hero

837
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:04,540
who Ling'er said

838
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:05,540
is my father.

839
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:09,540
You are my son.

840
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:10,540
Your family is sick.

841
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:12,540
I am not good enough to help you.

842
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:15,540
I am not responsible for my father.

843
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:16,540
I have done some good things.

844
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:17,540
You saved my aunt.

845
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,540
But

846
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:21,540
I have a request.

847
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:22,540
If you agree,

848
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:24,540
I will give it to you.

849
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:25,540
Please say it.

850
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:27,540
I want you and Ling'er

851
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:29,540
to get married soon.

852
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:31,540
What?

853
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:37,540
I want to marry you.

854
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:07,540
I want to marry you.

855
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:37,540
Don't say anything.

856
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:39,540
Don't say anything.

857
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:42,540
I don't want to be with you.

858
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:45,540
At least I still have

859
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:48,540
a beautiful hug.

860
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:51,540
Don't say anything.

861
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:53,540
Don't say anything.

862
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:56,540
I really don't want to be with you.

863
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:58,540
I understand.
