I see.

The central��

39
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:39,060
but it can be used to kill the enemy of the central person

40
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,060
Is this what you think or what the former person thinks?

41
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,060
What is the Tao?

42
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,620
Usually, there is no violation, but it is not a violation

43
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,420
What is the Tao?

44
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,980
The Tao is used to use the goods to attack

45
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,180
and to attack the sect of Wanwu

46
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:50,860
What is the Tao?

47
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,620
I don't know

48
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,740
The Tao is used to kill the weak

49
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,020
and the Tao is used to push the weak

50
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,020
and the Tao is used to save the weak

51
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,460
and the Tao is used to attack the weak

52
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,460
So what is the real Tao?

53
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,660
Tao is Tao, it is very Tao

54
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,540
This must be done by yourself

55
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,540
The Tao is self-evident

56
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,540
and it can't be used to kill the weak

57
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,820
The real Tao is used to kill the weak

58
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,540
and the Tao is used to push the weak

59
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,140
Do you want to go down the mountain with me?

60
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,700
Go to the capital yourself?

61
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,660
You grew up in Shushan

62
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,220
You never went down the mountain

63
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,660
You don't know

64
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,220
your true nature

65
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,900
You can't understand

66
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,660
the sound of water

67
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,860
A man and a woman are always thinking in one's mind

68
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,340
I just want you to be able to live in one's mind

69
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,140
I hope you can clear your mind

70
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,140
and not make a real trouble

71
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,660
Why?

72
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,660
Why are you so cowardly?

73
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,660
This is what you should do

74
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,660
You should go

75
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,660
I will go

76
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,660
I will go

77
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,660
I will go

78
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,660
I will go

79
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,660
I will go

80
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,660
I will go

81
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,660
I will go

82
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,660
I will go

83
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,660
I will go

84
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,660
I will go

85
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,660
I will go

86
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,660
Wrong

87
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,660
It's you

88
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,660
It's me

89
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,660
It's me

90
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,660
I gave you the pendant

91
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,660
You will meet him

92
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,660
and be with him

93
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,660
Then

94
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,660
You really think so?

95
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,660
It won't happen

96
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,660
It's not as you think

97
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,660
that someone will come out

98
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,660
Even if no one comes out

99
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,660
it will happen

100
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,660
Will it happen?

101
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,660
It will happen

102
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,660
No

103
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,660
It's not him

104
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,660
It's not him

105
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,660
No

106
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,660
Have you decided to return the sword to the mountain?

107
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,660
I have decided to go down the mountain for three years

108
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,660
I don't know what to do

109
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,660
Good

110
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:58,660
Go

111
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,660
I will give you 18 valuable words

112
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,660

117
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,660
Please give me those

118
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,660
I will leave

119
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,660
The King of the West

120
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,660
The King of the West

121
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,660
The King of the West

122
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,660

00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,660
The King of the West

132
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,660
The King of the West

133
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,660
The King of the West

The King of the West

137
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,660
You?

138
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,660
I'm a small character from Mount Zu. You don't know him?

139
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,660
I know you. I saw you on the day I went to the mountain.

140
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,660
This is...

141
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,660
Here you are.

142
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,660
If Gao Zhen didn't lie, this must be useful.

143
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,660
What is this?

144
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,660
This is...

145
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,660
This is the treasure of the legendary family.

146
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,660
I gave it to you. Don't bother. Take it.

147
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,660
Okay. Thank you.

148
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,660
Goodbye.

149
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,660
What are you doing on the mountain?

150
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,660
I'm going to get some things I want to give up.

151
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,660
Why are you going to Mount Zu?

152
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:54,660
For one day, you call me a junior.

153
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,660
Okay. I won't be far from here.

154
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,660
I'll tell you my account when you come back.

155
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,660
Oh, right.

156
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,660
Thank you for that stone.

157
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,660
See if it's useful.

158
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:17,660
Tell me if it's useful.

159
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,660
Got it?

160
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,660
Go.

161
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,660
Go.

162
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,660
Go.

163
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,660
Why do you become a woman?

164
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,660
Why are you back without a break?

165
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,660
What happened?

166
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,660
Hey!

167
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:47,660
Is it because of this?

168
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,660
Miss!

169
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,660
I'm sorry. I'm pressing you.

170
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,660
I'm sorry.

171
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,660
Why are you here?

172
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,660
You are...

173
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,660
Who are you?

174
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,660
Where is Brother Ruozhe?

175
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,660
Senior.

176
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,660
Brother Ruozhe.

177
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,660
Brother Ruozhe.

178
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,660
For the past 20 years,

179
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,660
I've been thinking about it.

180
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,660
I've been persuading myself.

181
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,660
I thought I've figured it out.

182
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:28,660
I thought everything was just because I wanted to be a power.

183
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,660
I thought it was just an explanation.

184
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,660
I thought it was just an explanation.

185
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,660
I thought it was just an explanation.

186
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,660
Until I saw Xiaoyao Ling'er Yue'ru,

187
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:52,660
I realized that I was just an excuse.

188
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,660
You don't understand anything!

189
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,660
It's all that I've got.

190
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,660
I've got everything.

191
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,660
I've got everything.

192
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,660
Why? Answer me!

193
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,660
You gave up the Su family.

194
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,660
You gave up the Wu family and sent them to Nanzhao.

195
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,660
You want her to go to the female slave's house.

196
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,660
Does that mean you can do it?

197
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,660
There's always a sacrifice in the female slave's house.

198
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,660
Why do you still have to go there?

199
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,660
This is all her power.

200
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,660
Why?

201
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,660
Answer me!

202
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:29,660
I'll send Wu family down the mountain to meet the winner.

203
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,660
I'll be a thief from now on.

204
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,660
She's still in the marriage.

205
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,660
She's lost her beloved daughter.

206
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,660
Answer me!

207
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,660
Is that my way?

208
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,660
Is it the pain I have to endure before I enter the palace?

209
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,660
Answer me!

210
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,660
I don't understand!

211
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,660
If I get it,

212
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:55,660
I'll never give up my power

213
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:58,660
if I sacrifice myself.

214
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:07,660
You...

215
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,660
You...

216
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,660
I don't understand.

217
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,660
I still don't understand.

218
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,660
I just don't want to give up my power.

219
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,660
I don't want to give up my power.

220
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,660
I don't want to give up my power.

221
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,660
You don't know what you're doing.

222
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:08,660
You already know what you're not doing.

223
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,660
And you're trying to find a way to get rid of your heart.

224
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:14,660
You're not doing it.

225
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,660
Actually, you still have a solution.

226
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,660
You have to put it into two.

227
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,660
As long as you solve this,

228
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,660
your sky will be more clear.

229
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,660
I didn't understand anything.

230
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:35,660
He will find out if I don't solve it.

231
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,660
Let me help you.

232
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:48,320
Combine it up just a little.

233
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,420
Yeti.

234
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:00,340
Stop inside.

235
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:09,420
Don't try anything malignant.

236
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,960
This side of the patient is either my friend or her father.

237
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,960
Why did you do that?

238
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,960
I'll ask him if he wants to be my daughter.

239
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,960
It's too late.

240
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,960
You and Xiaoyao are going to Mount Shushan to save the princess.

241
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,960
Yes, we still have to save the princess.

242
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,960
Can you still catch up with him?

243
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,960
We'll take him as our father first.

244
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,960
Then we'll save the princess.

245
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,960
That's great.

246
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,960
Do you have anything else to say?

247
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,960
No.

248
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,960
No.

249
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,960
Go get ready.

250
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,960
Otherwise we won't be in time.

251
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,960
Tang Xiaobao, sorry.

252
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,960
Wait a minute.

253
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,960
How's Qiqiu?

254
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,960
He seems to be dead.

255
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,960
You two are kind.

256
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,960
You're lucky to be here.

257
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,960
We'll talk about it later.

258
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,960
Since Qiqiu is not well,

259
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,960
we shouldn't bother you.

260
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,960
You misunderstood.

261
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,960
I'm telling you.

262
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,960
I hope you can give these to my master

263
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,960
and Yue Ru's cousin.

264
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,960
They're too hasty.

265
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,960
I can't wait to give them the best equipment.

266
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,960
I'll take them to the thank you.

267
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,960
Do you have any delicious food for Anou?

268
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,960
What do you think?

269
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,960
Qiqiu, you're the best.

270
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,960
Those two kids

271
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,960
have overcome the test of a game.

272
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:25,680
Song Dajin and Snow finally twog

273
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,960
Come with us.

274
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,320
Thert will be encountering huge Ice and Baş trusted note.

275
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,320
His Majesty has already expressed that you should recuperate.

276
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,320
What is this sound?

277
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,320
What... what's going on?

278
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,320
What's going on?

279
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,320
We are not doing anything.

280
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,320
We are not doing anything.

281
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,320
We are not doing anything.

282
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,320
Why?

283
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,320
Why?

284
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:59,320
Do you remember that water can flow up?

285
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,320
It's you? That night?

286
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:11,320
I have fought with you.

287
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:15,320
You are the master of the Moon Sect?

288
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:19,320
You are the master of the Moon Sect of the South Zhao State.

289
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,320
You are quite a good friend.

290
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,320
No need to be polite.

291
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:27,320
I'm just here to visit my brother.

292
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,320
How is your illness?

293
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,320
I'm fine with the rest of my health.

294
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,320
You are very good at the city.

295
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,320
What's wrong with my son?

296
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,320
Father, I'm fine.

297
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,320
In your country, it's early in the morning.

298
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,320
Is it good for the white and black people to be sent here?

299
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,320
What?

300
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,320
What nonsense are you talking about?

301
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,320
Isn't my son fine?

302
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,320
Son, how could this happen?

303
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,320
You are kind.

304
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,320
Master.

305
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:15,320
Little brother Qi, what did you say about your filial piety?

306
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,320
I'm sick and I have a father.

307
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,320
I dare not hurt you.

308
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,320
I know the truth.

309
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,320
You are a scholar.

310
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,320
You should know all these.

311
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,320
Thank you for your concern.

312
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,320
Guards, come on.

313
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,320
We are not students.

314
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,320
We are not students.

315
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,320
Master, what do you want?

316
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,320
I'm here to help you.

317
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,320
You really can help us?

318
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,320
I'm just being mean.

319
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,320
Master.

320
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,320
Son, how are you?

321
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:35,320
Mother, father, I'm fine.

322
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,320
Thank you, master Baiyue.

323
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,320
You are very kind.

324
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,320
We don't know how to thank you.

325
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,320
You are welcome.

326
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,320
I'm fine.

327
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,320
I'm fine.

328
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,320
I'm fine.

329
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,320
I'm fine.

330
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,320
You are welcome.

331
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,320
Master, you are very kind.

332
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,320
Master, you should accept our thanks.

333
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,320
Yes, we can't owe you.

334
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:15,320
You are kind and you are fair.

335
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,320
I like you very much.

336
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,320
Okay, I will prepare for the ceremony.

337
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,320
No need.

338
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:27,320
I just want my brother to help me.

339
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,320
I will do it.

340
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:33,320
Okay, I will do it.

341
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:37,320
I want my brother to go to Mount Shu.

342
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:42,320
Please invite Li Xiaoyou and Zhao Ling'er.

343
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,320
I'm sorry.

344
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,320
I can't do it.

345
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,320
Why?

346
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,320
You can take anything.

347
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,320
You can't do it.

348
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,320
You can't do it.

349
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,320
It's not fair to me.

350
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,320
I don't want anything from you.

351
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,320
At the same time,

352
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,320
I don't want anything from you.

353
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,320
At the same time,

354
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,320
you can't owe me anything.

355
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,320
Then only you will die.

356
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,320
Jin Yuan, are you crazy?

357
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,320
What's the big deal?

358
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:28,320
You just find them back for Master.

359
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,320
You are a child.

360
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,320
Why do you have to find them to die?

361
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,320
Father, mother,

362
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,320
there are some things you won't understand.

363
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,320
I won't owe you anything.

364
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:44,320
Since you saved my life,

365
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,320
you can take my life.

366
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,320
To have love,

367
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,320
I can give up my life.

368
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,320
It's so nice.

369
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,320
Jin Yuan, are you crazy?

370
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,320
I can't betray my friends.

371
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,320
You are doing this

372
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,320
because you don't accept my help?

373
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,320
You want to give it back to me?

374
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,320
Yes.

375
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,320
Jin Yuan, you can't do this.

376
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,320
You can't do this.

377
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,320
Fine.

378
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,320
Since that,

379
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:23,320
I will do it for my son.

380
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,320
Master.

381
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,320
Father.

382
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,320
Master.

383
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,320
Father.

384
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,320
Master.

385
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,320
Master.

386
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,320
I didn't want his life.

387
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,320
What's wrong with him?

388
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,320
Don't hurt my son.

389
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,320
Don't touch my son.

390
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,320
I will give my life to you.

391
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,320
I will give my life to you.

392
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,320
Mother.

393
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,320
Father.

394
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,320
Let me go.

395
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,320
Mother.

396
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,320
I want to die for him.

397
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,320
Mother.

398
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,320
Mother.

399
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,320
Father.

400
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,320
Mother.

401
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,320
Father.

402
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,320
Little brother Qi.

403
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,320
You are too emotional.

404
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,320
What are you doing?

405
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,320
I didn't want to kill you this time.

406
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,320
Including you.

407
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,320
To be honest,

408
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,320
your life is useless to me.

409
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,320
Why do you need this?

410
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,320
I admire your loyalty.

411
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,320
But you are not happy with it.

412
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,320
Father.

413
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,320
Let's try it.

414
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,320
It's a big one.

415
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,320
It's broken.

416
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,320
I don't know how to use the hook.

417
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,320
Why don't you say it?

418
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,320
Yue Ru.

419
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,320
Choupier.

420
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,320
Choupier.

421
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,320
Choupier.

422
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,320
Choupier.

423
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,840
Choupier.

424
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,320
Choupier.

425
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,320
Choupier.

426
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:27,840
where to andaudience

427
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,800
why are you here ? are you okay ?

428
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,320
i'm still not dead

429
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:35,080
still not learned, do not jump

430
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,940
you know it, do not see me

431
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,520
larger

432
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,320
You...

433
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,320
You didn't fall down?

434
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,320
I have a body.

435
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,320
What are you doing?

436
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,320
You can't get up?

437
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,320
It hurts.

438
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,320
I don't know how many you have.

439
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,320
What about your food?

440
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,320
Come on.

441
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,320
Are you crazy?

442
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,320
You're using it to make a wine?

443
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,320
Although I can only make nine times,

444
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,320
the wine inside makes me die 20 times.

445
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,320
Okay.

446
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,320
Let's destroy all the demons in the Demon Tower.

447
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,320
Okay.

448
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,320
We're the enemies of the world.

449
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,320
Okay.

450
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,320
Two hours to the Demon Tower.

451
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,320
Okay.

452
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,320
You're a bad girl.

453
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,320
You're so mean.

454
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,320
You...

455
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,320
Let's go to the Demon Tower first.

456
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,320
We'll fly together after we get out.

457
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,320
What's wrong?

458
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,320
You're the one.

459
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,320
Let's go.

460
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,320
The Demon Tower.

461
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,320
The Demon Tower.

462
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,320
Ling'er.

463
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,320
Why is she locked in here?

464
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,320
She'll be fine.

465
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,320
We must save her.

466
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,320
If we lose...

467
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,320
We still have this.

468
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,320
Master.

469
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,320
Mother.

470
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,320
Mother.

471
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,320
Mother.

472
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,320
Mother.

473
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,320
Mother.

474
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,320
Mother.

475
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,320
Mother.

476
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,320
Mother.

477
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,320
Mother.

478
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,320
Mother.

479
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,320
Mother.

480
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,320
Mother.

481
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,320
Mother.

482
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,320
Mother.

483
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,320
Mother.

484
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,320
Mother.

485
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,320
Mother.

486
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,320
Mother.

487
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,320
Mother.

488
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,320
Mother.

489
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,320
Mother.

490
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,320
Mother.

491
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,320
Mother.

492
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,320
Mother.

493
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,320
Mother.

494
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,320
Mother.

495
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,320
Mother.

496
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,320
Mother.

497
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,320
Mother.

498
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,320
Mother.

499
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,320
Mother.

500
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,320
Mother.

501
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,320
Mother.

502
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,320
Mother.

503
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,320
What are you doing?

504
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,320
You're so scary.

505
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,320
You scared me.

506
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,320
You're so small.

507
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,320
What?

508
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,320
I'm not scared at all.

509
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,320
What about you?

510
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,320
You're not scared, are you?

511
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,320
Who said I'm scared?

512
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,320
I'm afraid of the human nature.

513
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,320
What's the situation?

514
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,320
You're still a girl.

515
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,320
I'm not scared.

516
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,320
Who dares to challenge me?

517
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,320
Okay.

518
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,320
Let's kill them.

519
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,320
Look at me.

520
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,320
Mother.

521
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,320
Mother.

522
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,320
Mother.

523
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,320
Mother.

524
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,320
Mother.

525
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,320
I'm not willing to go to the city.

526
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,320
I'm not willing to go to the city.

527
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,320
Mother.

528
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,320
Hurry.

529
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,320
Leave us.

530
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,320
Let's go.

531
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,320
What are you doing?

532
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,320
What are you doing?

533
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,320
What are you doing?

534
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,320
Mother.

535
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,320
What?

536
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,320
This is the magic spear that master gave me.

537
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,320
Look.

538
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,320
What?

539
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,320
Are you scared?

540
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,320
I'm scared.

541
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,320
You're so weird.

542
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:51,320
Let's go.

543
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,320
What's this?

544
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,320
It's a stone box.

545
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,320
Stone box?

546
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,320
What is it?

547
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,320
Can you bite it?

548
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,320
Wait for me.

549
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,320
Wait for me.

550
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,320
Wait for me.

551
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,320
Hurry.

552
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,320
Good boy.

553
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,320
Why are you here?

554
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,320
It's dangerous here.

555
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,320
Do you know?

556
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,320
Do you know?

557
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,320
Do you know?

558
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,320
Watch out.

559
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,320
Watch out.

560
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,320
What's this?

561
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,320
I'm dead.

562
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,320
I'm so good.

563
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,320
Why did you hit him?

564
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,320
He wants to bite me.

565
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,320
He's a dog.

566
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,320
His nose is very cold.

567
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,320
I want him to take the road.

568
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,320
This is a long road.

569
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,320
Long road.

570
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,320
Yes.

571
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,320
How dare you hurt our face.

572
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,320
Go.

573
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,320
Now they're taking us.

574
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,320
Go.

575
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,320
Go.

576
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,320
How did they hurt us?

577
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,320
How did they...

578
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,320
It's so dangerous.

579
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,320
Go.

580
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,320
Go.

581
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:23,320
Go.

582
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,320
Don't say anything.

583
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,320
Don't say anything.

584
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,320
Don't say anything.

585
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,320
I don't want to be with you.

586
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,320
Don't say anything.

587
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:01,320
At least I still have

588
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:05,320
a beautiful dream.

589
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,320
Don't say anything.

590
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:07,320
Don't say anything.

591
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:08,320
Don't say anything.

592
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:12,320
I really don't want to be with you.

593
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,320
I just understand that

594
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:17,320
I should let go.
