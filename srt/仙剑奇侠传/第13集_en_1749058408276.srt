1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,200
I'm not afraid of you.

2
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,200
I'm not afraid of you.

3
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,200
I'm not afraid of you.

4
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,200
I'm not afraid of you.

5
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,200
I'm not afraid of you.

6
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,200
I'm not afraid of you.

7
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,200
I'm not afraid of you.

8
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,200
I'm not afraid of you.

9
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,200
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,200
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,200
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,200
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,200
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,200
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,200
I'm not afraid of you.

16
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,200
I'm not afraid of you.

17
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,200
I'm not afraid of you.

18
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,200
I'm not afraid of you.

19
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,200
I'm not afraid of you.

20
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,200
I'm not afraid of you.

21
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,200
I'm not afraid of you.

22
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,200
I'm not afraid of you.

23
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,200
I'm not afraid of you.

24
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,200
I'm not afraid of you.

25
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:46,400
I am blocked by alone

26
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,200
Lin Er, come.

27
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,200
I'm not thirsty.

28
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,200
I didn't expect you to be so thoughtful.

29
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,200
Don't think that he's always so careless.

30
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,200
He's afraid that you'll get thirsty and will get water for you.

31
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,200
I'm not thirsty.

32
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,200
You should drink for Sister Yue Ru.

33
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,200
I don't need it. I don't drink much water.

34
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,200
Ling Er is not feeling well.

35
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,200
You should take good care of him.

36
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,200
I'm used to taking care of myself.

37
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,200
It's okay.

38
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,200
I'm a man's husband.

39
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,200
Taking care of you two girls is a big deal.

40
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,200
I don't need it.

41
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,200
Brother Xia Yao, don't worry.

42
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,200
Ling Er is not the original one.

43
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,200
You should take good care of yourself.

44
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,200
It's okay.

45
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,200
Don't talk about me.

46
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,200
I'm afraid of being a man.

47
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,200
I'm the same now.

48
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,200
Enough.

49
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,200
What do you think of me?

50
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,200
I'm just a man.

51
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,200
I'm a man.

52
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,200
I have feelings for you.

53
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,200
I'm usually a man who likes to joke.

54
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,200
But I never joke about love.

55
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,200
So I ask you two not to do this.

56
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,200
Ling Er, if I did something wrong before,

57
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,200
and you're unhappy, tell me.

58
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,200
I can change it.

59
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,200
But you shouldn't be honest.

60
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
I'm so upset.

61
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,200
What happened after you disappeared?

62
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,200
Nothing.

63
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,200
Then why did you change?

64
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,200
Ling Er, you have the right to not like me.

65
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,200
But you don't have the right to make me not like you.

66
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,200
You don't have the right to be my match.

67
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,200
Let me...

68
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,200
Let me like someone else.

69
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,200
Let's go.

70
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,200
Go.

71
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,200
You're too much.

72
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,200
Anyone?

73
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,200
Be careful.

74
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,200
It's weird here.

75
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,200
Miss, let me go.

76
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,200
Miss, run.

77
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,200
I'm your right to be sick.

78
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,200
Let me go.

79
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,200
You should fight in front of the minister.

80
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,200
I don't want to see you anymore.

81
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,200
Can you let me eat?

82
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,200
What?

83
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,200
I really want to eat meat.

84
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,200
Please, please.

85
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,200
Let me taste the meat.

86
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,200
You call me a chef?

87
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,200
I'm not a chef.

88
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,200
I'm just a liar.

89
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,200
Is that okay?

90
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,200
What happened?

91
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,200
I was a pig.

92
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,200
I ate a ten-centred meat every day.

93
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,200
I was so upset.

94
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,200
What happened after that?

95
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,200
I was upset.

96
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,200
What happened in the middle?

97
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,200
In the middle?

98
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,200
There should be something in the middle.

99
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,200
But after you helped me to cut the meat,

100
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,200
I can't remember anything.

101
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,200
Take us to see you, Fang.

102
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,200
You have a few questions.

103
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,200
Amitabha,

104
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,200
I've seen three masters.

105
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,200
Master Fang.

106
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,200
Master Fang.

107
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,200
Master Fang.

108
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,200
The three masters are so close.

109
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,200
Could you please come down?

110
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,200
Master Fang,

111
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,200
we want to ask you to come down

112
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,200
to help our soldiers.

113
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,200
To help the people.

114
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,200
It's rare that you have a heart of ten thousand people.

115
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,200
I'd like to come down

116
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,200
and help the three masters.

117
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,200
Amitabha.

118
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,200
That's great.

119
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,200
Thank you, Fang.

120
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,200
But I have a small request.

121
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,200
I know it's not that simple.

122
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,200
Please listen to me.

123
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,200
When I see this master,

124
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,200
I think he will follow me.

125
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,200
If he wants to leave,

126
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:33,200
he must be good to him.

127
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,200
Ha!

128
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,200
What?

129
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,200
You want me to be like you

130
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,200
and go down the mountain to kill the demon?

131
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,200
Amitabha.

132
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,200
If he wants to leave,

133
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,200
I won't believe you.

134
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,200
Don't think you know me so well.

135
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,200
Yes.

136
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,200
Okay.

137
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,200
I've seen the red dust.

138
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,200
The water in the heart is not mine.

139
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,200
Okay.

140
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,200
I promise you.

141
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,200
I'll be your disciple.

142
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,200
Amitabha.

143
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,200
Yes.

144
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,200
Hey, hurry up.

145
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,200
Don't make a noise.

146
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,200
What?

147
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
Hurry up.

148
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,200
No, no, no.

149
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,200
Are you really going out?

150
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,200
I tell you.

151
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,200
If you touch him,

152
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,200
I'll kill you all.

153
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,200
This lady.

154
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,200
She is so nice to him.

155
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,200
Why do you have to worry about this?

156
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,200
Ling'er.

157
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,200
Hurry up.

158
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,200
He's going to kick it.

159
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,200
Tell him.

160
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,200
Do it.

161
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,200
Ling'er.

162
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,200
Ling'er.

163
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,200
Ling'er.

164
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,200
Don't kill me.

165
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,200
Why do you want to be a high-ranking monk?

166
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,200
Yes.

167
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,200
You're so evil.

168
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,200
You almost hit the monk.

169
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,200
I didn't hurt you.

170
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,200
I just wish you good luck.

171
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,200
You wish us good luck?

172
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,200
I've been a spider in the Demon's Hand.

173
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,200
I've been practicing for 999 years.

174
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,200
Then why did you come to harm people?

175
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,200
To get them out of the house?

176
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,200
That's what the Buddha said.

177
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,200
That the Buddha is born,

178
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,200
and everyone has a Buddha's nature.

179
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,200
Besides, I brought them into the Buddha's house.

180
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,200
The Buddha will praise me.

181
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,200
You're wrong.

182
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,200
The Buddha is just a form of birth.

183
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,200
If you really want to be a Buddha,

184
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,200
you must convince everyone to give up the obsession

185
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,200
and give them the Buddha's nature.

186
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,200
You force them to do so

187
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,200
to make them realize their true self.

188
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,200
That's right.

189
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
I understand.

190
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,200
I've been wrong before.

191
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,200
I'm sorry.

192
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,200
I'm sorry.

193
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,200
I'll take you to the Demon King.

194
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,200
Demon King?

195
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,200
He's in the woods,

196
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,200
and he's playing the role of the General of the Cury House.

197
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,200
He's taking the blood of the mortal

198
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,200
to make up for his own power.

199
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,200
I see.

200
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,200
Where is he now?

201
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,200
He's in the north of the Black Water Town.

202
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,200
The Buddha is so generous.

203
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,200
From now on,

204
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,200
I'll recognize you as my master.

205
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,200
How can I do that?

206
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,200
I don't care.

207
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,200
Anyway,

208
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,200
I'll follow you from now on.

209
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,200
Master.

210
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,200
Master.

211
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,200
Just call me Ling'er.

212
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,200
I'm a little girl.

213
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,200
My name is Little Stone.

214
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,200
Little Stone,

215
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,200
don't be more rude than you.

216
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
What about the people in the lake?

217
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,200
After I'm back to the fairy tale,

218
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,200
the magic power suddenly disappears.

219
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,200
They'll go home by themselves.

220
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,200
I'll go home by myself.

221
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
What's this place?

222
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,200
It's a temple.

223
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,200
Tang Yu Xiaowen, we're dead.

224
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,200
There's nothing here.

225
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,200
There's nothing to eat.

226
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,200
I'm so tired.

227
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,200
Nu, this is not the temple.

228
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,200
Look up there.

229
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,200
Can the sun eat it?

230
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,200
No.

231
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,200
Why is the temple under the sun?

232
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,200
The place where the mortal lives is different from the fairy.

233
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,200
That's right.

234
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,200
Your Xiaobao is still there.

235
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,200
Your father is also there.

236
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,200
No one is dead.

237
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,200
Great.

238
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,200
We're dead.

239
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,200
We're dead.

240
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,200
The moon is so bright.

241
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,200
I didn't expect the cave to be so strong.

242
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,200
Nu, don't be naive.

243
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,200
The moon is so high.

244
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,200
It's just a joke.

245
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,200
Look, they're sending us to such a beautiful place.

246
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,200
What's the moon?

247
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,200
Don't think so much.

248
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,200
We're looking for the princess.

249
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,200
I have one more father.

250
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,200
He must be so anxious.

251
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,200
Nu, you must see him.

252
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,200
You must.

253
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,200
Why?

254
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,200
Because we promised to...

255
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,200
What are you asking me?

256
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,200
That's right.

257
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,200
I'm marrying him.

258
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,200
Nu, promise me.

259
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,200
You can't talk to him anymore.

260
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,200
You must respect him and bear with him.

261
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,200
Do you understand?

262
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,200
Why?

263
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,200
Because I love you.

264
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,200
I want to be with you forever.

265
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,200
I'll love you forever and take care of you.

266
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,200
I'll try my best.

267
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,200
That's great.

268
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,200
Don't let him bully me.

269
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,200
Don't worry. I'll protect you.

270
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,200
This is not the heaven.

271
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,200
This is the paradise.

272
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,200
It's so beautiful.

273
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,200
I'm so happy to see you.

274
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,200
Father.

275
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,200
What's the matter?

276
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,960
I'm sorry for your kindness.

277
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,440
I'm worried about you.

278
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,440
I haven't punished you.

279
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,440
By the way,

280
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,720
why does he know we're here?

281
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,840
You told him again.

282
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,520
I've been with you.

283
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,360
Young Master,

284
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,040
we met an old lady in the mountain.

285
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,640
She can show you her face.

286
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,280
We got a lot of useful information from her.

287
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,120
Including the princess.

288
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,720
Princess?

289
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,440
The law of the Baihe Village.

290
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,200
Father, is that what the princess is doing?

291
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:22,920
Don't ask.

292
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,000
As long as she's convinced,

293
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,640
we'll be there before it's dark.

294
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,040
Yes.

295
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,760
Let's go.

296
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:29,800
Yes.

297
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,560
An Tung, let's go.

298
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,320
Animation

299
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,280
Old Master Xiao,

300
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,800
it seems like a tonic will be out soon.

301
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,520
Yes.

302
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,360
It seems that these palm trees

303
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,600
have gotten the pass here today.

304
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,360
Just wait and see.

305
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,720
Why such a big entourage?

306
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,520
Not much.

307
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,640
This is the demon aura.

308
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,680
It's the caravan.

309
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,440
Careful.

310
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Conf 스ล języ simplistic

311
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,500
Ling'er, you have improved.

312
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I guess the oath has grown strong.

313
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,000
Quit talking rubbish, please.

314
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Sister Ling'er, there are so many people around.

315
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
People? I haven't seen any of them.

316
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
They are from Jiangshi. You fool.

317
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
What are you talking about? Stop joking.

318
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Be careful.

319
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Be careful.

320
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Be careful.

321
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Be careful.

322
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Look at their heads.

323
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Be careful.

324
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Those guys with their heads just now, they are dead.

325
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
They are dead.

326
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
They are all small. They are different from other soldiers.

327
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
They are very strong.

328
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
The more scared this bastard is, the more powerful he is.

329
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
The more powerful they are, the more we will kill them.

330
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
They are so nervous now. They must be in danger.

331
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
We should be careful.

332
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
This is the mess.

333
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's too luxurious.

334
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
They are still so angry.

335
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Little Stone, is the Ghost King hiding in here?

336
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
The tomb is a well. There is a big blood pool.

337
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
The Ghost King is lying in there.

338
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Who is out there?

339
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It looks like a big blood pool.

340
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Who is out there?

341
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Who is out there?

342
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Who is out there?

343
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
It looks like a big blood pool.

344
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Are you scared?

345
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
It's more scary than this.

346
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Who is scared of you?

347
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Lei, let's go.

348
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Brotherden born.

349
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
That's my brother.

350
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Brother Guan Horse race again.

351
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Brother維 hier is looking for General Kunto.

352
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Who are they?

353
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,500
Back.

354
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Back,ácai.

355
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Right.

356
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Recall this.

357
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Say what you think?

358
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
What story do you mean?

359
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
JENN dazu.

360
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
General, I like you.

361
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Do you still have a dream of me?

362
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Come out!

363
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
You two are like the boss.

364
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Come again, I'll show you my eyes.

365
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
You are so bold.

366
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Look at the place where General Chunping went to see Qin.

367
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Where is the King of the Dead?

368
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'll see the King of the Dead until I die.

369
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
You all burn to death.

370
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Be careful.

371
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
You...

372
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Look, sister.

373
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
You are here.

374
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You have a good body.

375
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Why are you so bad?

376
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
How do you know that I'm a bad person?

377
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Sister, be careful.

378
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Be careful.

379
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Look at the place where General Chunping went to see Qin.

380
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Why are you here with my friend?

381
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I'm here to see Qin.

382
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Actually, Qin is a very smart person.

383
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Really smart?

384
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I know they like you so much.

385
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
But I've already told you.

386
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I know that you like me so much.

387
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Why do you want to be a bad person?

388
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Qin, I'm not sure if I can defeat you.

389
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I'm afraid that you will be defeated.

390
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I must defeat you.

391
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Let's go.

392
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I'll go.

393
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
You are so bold.

394
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
You are so bold.

395
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Master, you can't be angry anymore for Bao.

396
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
What should we do?

397
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
You are wearing a pair of pants.

398
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
A tiger?

399
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
How can we defeat a tiger?

400
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
At least, we can let him slow down.

401
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
We can find the hot spring and kill him.

402
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Help.

403
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Help.

404
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
The Buddha's law is very important.

405
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I'm only a good person.

406
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I'm just a good person.

407
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I'm not good at living.

408
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Hey, hey, hey.

409
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
You are so bold for this kind of people.

410
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
No, no, no.

411
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
This kind of things are so bold.

412
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Isn't it too valuable?

413
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Be a good person.

414
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Be a good person?

415
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Then, let me tell you.

416
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I used my sword to kill him.

417
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
This is the biggest being.

418
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Right?

419
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Right, Yue Ru?

420
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Yes.

421
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Then, look.

422
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Yue Ru helped me in my age.

423
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Little stone.

424
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Li Xiaorou, if Ling Er didn't help me,

425
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
would you have killed him so easily?

426
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Hey, hey, hey.

427
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
What did you say?

428
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
You are a dragon.

429
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
You can't even hear it.

430
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Run.

431
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Ling Er.

432
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
The king of the world is in the blood of the world.

433
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I don't care what you are.

434
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Come out.

435
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Everyone, be careful.

436
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
The king of the world is much stronger than the Buddha.

437
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Ling Er, I'm here.

438
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Don't be afraid.

439
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Look at me.

440
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Ling Er.

441
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Ling Er.

442
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Ling Er.

443
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Ling Er.

444
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Ling Er.

445
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Ling Er.

446
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Brother Xiaorou.

447
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Brother Xiaorou.

448
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Hurry up.

449
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Brother Xiaorou.

450
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Ling Er.

451
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Run.

452
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Run.

453
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Hurry up.

454
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Brother Xiaorou.

455
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Come out.

456
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I'm your brother.

457
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
You are the king.

458
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
You are the king.

459
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
You are the king.

460
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I don't care.

461
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,180
Someone's here!

462
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,840
YouRong!

463
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,880
YouRong!

464
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,720
YouRong!

465
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,720
Master, why didn't he save you first?

466
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,520
I hoped so.

467
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,920
Yuru.

468
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,920
Ling'er, I'm sorry.

469
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,920
I can't be in the love of Qian'e.

470
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,920
Because I can't live with her.

471
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,920
I'm sorry.

472
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,520
I want to pay my life back.

473
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,720
If you know,

474
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,920
no matter where you go,

475
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,720
I will be with you.

476
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,720
Brother Xiaoyao, we all want to live.

477
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,320
Come on.

478
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,720
Brother Xiaoyao.

479
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,320
Brother Xiaoyao.

480
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,320
Brother Xiaoyao.

481
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,720
It's a potato.

482
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,720
What?

483
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:52,720
I mean,

484
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,720
Ling'er, look, this is a potato.

485
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,720
My master told me that

486
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,320
since ancient times,

487
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,720
Lady Yuru collected the spirit energy from heaven and earth,

488
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,720
and made it into a five-pick potato.

489
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,720
She wanted to conquer the world,

490
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,720
conquer the world,

491
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,720
and save the world.

492
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,720
But this potato has been missing for many years.

493
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,720
Wonderful.

494
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,720
It's all in the world.

495
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,520
Ling'er,

496
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,520
you came here to deal with the King of Chibui

497
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,720
and get the potato.

498
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,720
It's all destined by heaven.

499
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,720
Maybe your birth

500
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,320
is to save the world.

501
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,720
Is it?

502
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,720
Is it?

503
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,720
It's all destined by heaven.

504
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,720
My destiny

505
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,720
has been written down.

506
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,720
What about Brother Xiaoyao?

507
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,720
Is he in his position?

508
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,720
No, Sister Ling'er.

509
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,720
You were so angry.

510
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,720
You just spent so much energy.

511
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,720
You can't save people in the palace.

512
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,720
I'm afraid you'll be in danger too.

513
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,720
Without him,

514
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,720
I can't live.

515
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,720
Besides, Sister Yuru

516
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,720
can sacrifice herself.

517
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,720
Sister Yuru.

518
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,720
Are you all right?

519
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,720
I'm fine.

520
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,720
Is it all right to hit a girl?

521
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,720
Sister Yuru.

522
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,720
You're awake.

523
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,720
Where's the King of Chibui?

524
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,720
Brother Xiaoyao beat him up.

525
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,720
You're alone?

526
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,720
Yes.

527
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,720
If you didn't love to play with the wine,

528
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,720
I'd kill you more quickly.

529
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,720
I'll warn you seriously.

530
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,720
If you're in danger next time,

531
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,720
you must save Ling'er first.

532
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,720
What are you talking about?

533
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,720
You're the one who's scared.

534
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,720
You're a mute.

535
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,720
No, no, no.

536
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,720
I was wrong.

537
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,720
I know you treat me as an outsider.

538
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,720
No one wants to lie to me.

539
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,720
But I treat you as my family.

540
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,720
Especially you, Ling'er.

541
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,720
No matter what,

542
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,720
I'm your sister Yuru.

543
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,720
I should be qualified

544
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,720
to live for you.

545
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,720
Sister Ling'er.

546
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,720
What's wrong?

547
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,720
Don't be angry.

548
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,720
Let's leave here.

549
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,720
Yes.

550
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,720
We must leave here as soon as possible.

551
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,720
The moon is so bright.

552
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,720
The moon and the moon are so beautiful.

553
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,720
It's so beautiful.

554
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,720
Why is it like this?

555
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,720
We killed too many people.

556
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,720
We're too much.

557
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,720
But without the immortal method,

558
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,720
their souls are too much.

559
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,720
Those soldiers...

560
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,720
They're the people.

561
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,720
It's worth it.

562
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,720
The soldiers are also people.

563
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,720
They have lives, too.

564
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,720
I...

565
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,720
I can't say it out loud.

566
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,720
Ling'er,

567
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,720
don't waste your power on them.

568
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,720
They've caused a lot of trouble.

569
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,720
But they're not the same.

570
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,720
I should be able to live for them.

571
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,720
Let their souls be at ease.

572
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,720
They're the people.

573
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,720
Yes.

574
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,720
They're the people.

575
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,720
Ling'er.

576
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,720
You're not here yet.

577
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,720
What do you want to tell me?

578
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,720
I'll have dinner with everyone tonight.

579
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,720
Why didn't you tell me?

580
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,720
They're like birds.

581
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,720
I have something to tell you.

582
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,720
Little Stone.

583
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,720
Ling'er,

584
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,720
I want to tell her.

585
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,720
Tell her that she's a genius.

586
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,720
She's a genius.

587
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,720
You said it.

588
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,720
I knew it.

589
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,720
Ling'er, look at them.

590
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,720
They're the people.

591
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,720
You don't want to hear it?

592
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,720
I won't say it.

593
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,720
Little Stone,

594
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,720
I like to talk.

595
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,720
No need.

596
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,720
Every time you talk to the opponent,

597
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,720
no matter how powerful or internal force you are,

598
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,720
you'll have a huge increase.

599
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,720
Listen,

600
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,720
this is God's grace to you.

601
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,720
Am I the best in the world?

602
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,720
Little Stone,

603
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,720
what about me?

604
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,720
You...

605
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,720
You won't have a huge increase in your power.

606
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,720
But you'll have a great experience.

607
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,720
Nonsense.

608
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,720
Let's go back and start cooking.

609
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,720
Tonight,

610
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,720
what do you want to tell me?

611
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,720
What you said in the secret passage.

612
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,720
Is it true?

613
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,720
I, Li Xiao Xiao,

614
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,720
love you, Zhao Ling'er.

615
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,720
Doctor!

616
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:09,720
I'll tell you everything tonight.

617
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,720
Okay.

618
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,720
But you can't say you love me.

619
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,720
Are you a man?

620
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,720
You're so mean.

621
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,720
You're making me angry.

622
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,720
Do you have a lesson?

623
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,720
Why are you talking to others?

624
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,720
You're too noisy.

625
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,720
Shut up!

626
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,720
Sister Lu,

627
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,720
why are you here?

628
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,720
Stay with him.

629
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,720
Sorry.

630
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,720
Why do you say sorry to me?

631
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,720
I'm telling you,

632
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,720
it's not the right time to say sorry.

633
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,720
If I were you,

634
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,720
I wouldn't say sorry.

635
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,720
I've told you about the fair competition.

636
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,720
And you can't say sorry.

637
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,720
You're so nice.

638
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,720
Don't think I won't be mad

639
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,720
if you say so.

640
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,720
Be careful.

641
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,720
How come?

642
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,720
Where's Han Yixian?

643
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,720
He's gone.

644
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,720
What happened?

645
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,720
Li Xiao Xiao,

646
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,720
please save Uncle.

647
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,720
Get up.

648
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,720
We're all ourselves.

649
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,720
Don't be like this.

650
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,720
Han Yixian, what happened?

651
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,720
Sister Lin'er,

652
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,720
Sister Mengzi was arrested.

653
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,720
Was that a crime?

654
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,720
No, it wasn't.

655
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,720
Who was it?

656
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,720
I don't know them.

657
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,720
They came in,

658
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,720
and beat up the family.

659
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,720
Then they arrested Mengzi.

660
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,720
What kind of old man is he?

661
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,720
If Mengzi came back,

662
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,720
they'd have to take care of Miss Zhao

663
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,720
and go to Guiyin Mountain to see them.

664
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,720
They came here because of Ling'er.

665
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,720
Could it be that gang of half-moon disciples?

666
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,720
It must be Shi Zhang.

667
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,720
Who is he?

668
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,720
He's finally here.

669
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,720
Ling'er, what's wrong?

670
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,720
Ling'er, it doesn't matter who they are.

671
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,720
I won't let you leave me.

672
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,720
Then we'll go to save Miss Mengzi.

673
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,720
We'll see what they'll do.

674
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,720
Yes, we'll go now.

675
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:11,720
I'll go too.

676
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,720
Wait.

677
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,720
What's wrong?

678
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,720
It's useless for you to go.

679
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,720
Why?

680
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,720
They came here because of me.

681
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,720
If I go to exchange,

682
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,720
Mengzi will come back safely.

683
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,720
How can you go to exchange?

684
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,720
I promised my grandma

685
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,720
that I'd send you back to Nan Zhao.

686
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,720
But I don't want to bother you anymore.

687
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,720
Ling'er,

688
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,720
do you think I'm your sister?

689
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,720
Of course.

690
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,720
I'll go with this bastard

691
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,720
to go to Guiyin Mountain with you.

692
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,720
Fine.

693
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,720
You're the one,

694
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,720
Shaoyu, and A'bao.

695
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,720
Don't worry.

696
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,720
I'll save Mengzi.

697
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,720
Ling'er.

698
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:15,720
Do we still have a bowl of rice to eat?

699
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,720
You...

700
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,720
What do you want to say to me?

701
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,720
Brother Shaoyu,

702
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,720
can you calm down for a while?

703
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,720
Sure.

704
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,720
You can do anything.

705
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,720
Thank you.

706
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,720
Chu Dan, Ling'er...

707
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,720
Don't say it.

708
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,720
Let her come in.

709
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,720
Ling'er, are you okay?

710
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,720
Ling'er,

711
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,720
you've thought it through.

712
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,720
Why don't you tell Brother Shaoyu?

713
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,720
I did.

714
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,720
He can't be with Sister Yue Ru.

715
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,720
He can't be with Sister Yue Ru.

716
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,720
Why can't you be with them?

717
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,720
I'm the princess of Nanzhao.

718
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,720
I'm the descendant of the Mungwa.

719
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,720
I'll go back to my own life

720
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,720
and meet my own destiny.

721
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:26,720
You can take Brother Shaoyu with you.

722
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,720
This is too important.

723
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,720
Even I can't bear it.

724
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,720
Don't talk about him.

725
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,720
Sister Ling'er, is it dangerous?

726
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,720
I don't know.

727
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,720
I just know I don't want Brother Shaoyu to be the one.

728
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,720
I don't want him to suffer.

729
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,720
I want him to be sad.

730
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,720
Why don't we leave now?

731
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,720
Sister Ling'er, you're so pitiful.

732
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,720
Maybe I'm too close to Brother Shaoyu.

733
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,720
Too close.

734
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,720
Every time I ask for happiness,

735
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,720
there's always an accident.

736
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,720
Maybe I'm the descendant of the Mungwa

737
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,720
and I'll be destined to bear it.

738
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,720
Sister Ling'er!

739
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,720
Ling'er!

740
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,720
Do you know how to dream?

741
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,720
Ling'er!

742
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,720
Brother Shaoyu.

743
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,720
Chou Dan!

744
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,720
Sorry, Brother Shaoyu.

745
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,720
Chou Dan!

746
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,720
I love Brother Shaoyu's smile the most.

747
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,720
I don't want you to be sad.

748
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,720
Forget Ling'er.

749
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,720
Sorry, I can't bring you happiness.

750
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,720
Only Brother Shaoyu and Yilan

751
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,720
wish you complete your wish.

752
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,720
I'll always wish you

753
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,720
a long and long life.

754
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,720

Take good care of Brother Shaoyu.

757
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,720
a long and long life.

00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:44,720
Brother Shaoyu.

759
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:14,720
