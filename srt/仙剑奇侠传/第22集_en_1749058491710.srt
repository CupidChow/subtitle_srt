1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm not afraid of you.

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I only took you down.

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Then I can save him.

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,720
Of course!

19
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,580
Fine!

20
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,200
Come on.

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I...

22
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You're so concerned about the heart.

23
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Sister-in-law, don't be careful.

24
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
How could you?

25
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's all because of Yue Ru Chong Dong.

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I have no other choice.

28
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's all my fault.

29
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'll kill you today.

30
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You're dead.

31
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I won't let you go.

32
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Be careful.

33
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Let me go, brother.

34
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Let's leave here first.

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'll kill you.

36
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Are you okay, sister-in-law?

37
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Are you okay?

38
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Don't worry.

39
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'll go with her.

40
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'll kill you again.

41
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Brother.

42
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Master.

43
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Brother.

44
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Master.

45
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Brother.

46
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Why are you here?

47
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Didn't you see me?

48
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I fell asleep.

49
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So the poisonous demon girl swallowed the thunder-glazed pearl.

50
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
No wonder she was so arrogant.

51
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Master.

52
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Master.

60
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Can you stop talking about this?

61
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The pearl is not small.

62
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It can open the world.

63
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's one of the five pearls.

64
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Master, I'll tell you.

65
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You're my disciple, okay?

66
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You're my disciple.

67
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm cousin.

68
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Sister-in-law, hold on.

69
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Yes, my master is very good.

70
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Sister-in-law.

71
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Sister-in-law.

72
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The poisonous demon girl died.

73
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Master.

74
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I can't save her.

75
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Master.

76
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Senior.

77
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Did she...

78
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Did she...

79
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Qi.

80
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You can't die, cousin.

81
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Qi, wake up.

82
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Qi, I haven't taught you martial arts yet.

83
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Qi.

84
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Qi.

85
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You know me best, cousin.

86
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm your only disciple.

87
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Qi.

88
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Brother.

89
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Qi, wake up.

90
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Don't wake up, Qi!

91
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:24,000
My true love has been lost.

92
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Only if you let me eat it, will I be able to save my husband.

93
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:36,000
You thought that if you fed Zhizhu Jin, he would save them?

94
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,000
Qi!

95
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Qi, wake up!

96
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,600
I beg you to wake up! I'm not well!

97
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,600
Wake up, Qi! Don't scare me! You know me best!

98
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,600
Qi!

99
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,600
Qi!

100
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,600
You can't die!

101
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,600
Qi!

102
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,600
Don't worry. I won't let Xiang Gu die.

103
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,600
Really? Really? Really?

104
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,600
What are you saying?

105
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,600
Wei Yuan

106
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,040
Yes Madame.

107
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,720
You can eat the food.

108
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,320
OK

109
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,400
Don't worry I'm fine

110
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,200
Good

111
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,840
Thank your wife

112
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,300
What is the real reason for your

113
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,300
If I tell him to the Prime Minister

114
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,340
He can live

115
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,540
Give him ten years of training

116
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,140
for your thousand years of cultivation

117
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,140
Is it worth it

118
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,540
No, it's not worth it

119
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,040
Only you are willing

120
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,340
Not willing

121
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:06,540
The Prime Minister has sacrificed for me

122
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,240
From the moment he saved me

123
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,340
He made me think how important he is

124
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,340
I will protect him

125
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:19,340
This is the heart of a thousand years of cultivation

126
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:46,340
The Prime Minister has sacrificed for me

127
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,340
I will protect him

128
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:53,340
He made me think how important he is

129
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:56,340
I will protect him

130
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,340
I will protect him

131
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:03,340
I will protect him

132
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:07,340
I will protect him

133
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:12,340
I will protect him

134
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,340
Help!

135
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:18,340
Is it possible that he is back to the Demon Realm?

136
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:22,340
Help!

137
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:26,340
Help!

138
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:31,340
Can anyone save me?

139
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,340
Help!

140
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,340
Come here!

141
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,340
Help!

142
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,340
Help!

143
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,340
Help!

144
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:53,340
Help!

145
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,340
Help!

146
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,340
The one who saved me was not lucky

147
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,340
You poisoned my plate?

148
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,340
You will die very scared

149
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,340
if you make the rest of the days well

150
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,340
Thank you, Eunuch

151
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:16,340
I am really in the Demon Realm

152
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:35,340
I took away the food from the entrance

153
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:38,340
No wonder he wanted to bite me

154
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,340
No?

155
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:47,340
Go now. Be careful

156
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,340
Go

157
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:41,340
Go

158
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,340
What are you afraid of?

159
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,340
Eunuch can't see us

160
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:41,340
Why didn't you come home?

161
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,340
I just want to accompany you

162
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,340
Can you tell me everything?

163
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,340
Where are you?

164
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,340
Why do you have a butterfly?

165
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:12,340
Eunuch, are you okay with everything?

166
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,340
Eunuch

167
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,340
Eunuch

168
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,340
Eunuch

169
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,340
Even though you look so sad

170
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:52,340
Why do you keep crying?

171
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:55,340
Even though you have everything

172
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:59,340
or the world is so cruel

173
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,340
you still have no fear

174
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:25,340
Eunuch

175
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,340
Eunuch

176
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,340
Eunuch

177
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,340
Eunuch

178
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,340
Eunuch

179
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,340
Eunuch

180
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,340
Don't be afraid

181
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,340
I will keep watching you

182
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:49,340
Eunuch

183
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:55,340
It's good to eat or to be silly

184
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:00,340
I won't understand my feelings for Eunuch

185
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:05,340
But I can't take away

186
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:10,340
the most precious thing between me and Eunuch

187
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,340
Actually

188
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,340
I know Eunuch likes someone

189
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,340
not me

190
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,340
He treats me as

191
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:29,340
a butterfly saved by him

192
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,340
He wants to calm me down

193
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,340
and scold me

194
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,340
He doesn't want me to sacrifice for him

195
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,340
He is the one who

196
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:45,340
has no relationship with him

197
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,340
for a long time

198
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,340
He is the one

199
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,340
who is full of love

200
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:56,340
for anyone and life

201
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,340
He will have

202
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:01,340
love

203
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,340
But

204
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,340
sometimes

205
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,340
I feel a bit selfish

206
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,340
I hope he loves me

207
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:16,340
I just love Wanwu

208
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,340
And

209
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:22,340
I love someone

210
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,340
It's my fault

211
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,340
It's my fault

212
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,340
If I didn't have a heart

213
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,340
and a heart

214
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,340
he would have saved my cousin

215
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,340
It's all my fault

216
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,340
It's all my fault

217
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,340
It's all my fault

218
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:40,340
Don't blame yourself

219
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,340
You are not wrong

220
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,340
You are not wrong

221
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,340
You are not wrong

222
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,340
You are not wrong

223
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,340
You are not wrong

224
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,340
You are not wrong

225
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,340
You are not wrong

226
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:57,340
It's all my fault

227
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,340
It's all my fault

228
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,340
When I met Eunuch

229
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,340
he saved me

230
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,340
It's fate

231
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,340
I went to save him

232
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,340
It's a debt

233
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,340
I knew he didn't like me

234
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,340
But I like him

235
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,340
I insisted on staying with him

236
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,340
I want to take care of him

237
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,340
I want to scold him

238
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,340
I want to protect him

239
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,340
It's fate

240
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,340
It's my fate

241
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,340
Can you promise me a request?

242
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,340
I want to tell Xianggong

243
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,340
I will save him

244
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,340
You sacrificed so much for him

245
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:55,340
Don't you want him to remember you and think of you?

246
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,340
Xianggong is kind

247
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:01,340
Don't let him know about this

248
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,340
It's easy to die

249
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:11,340
But the living are more painful

250
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:15,340
You want me to go back to my mother's house?

251
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,340
Okay?

252
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,340
I beg you

253
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,340
Thank you

254
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,340
Thank you

255
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,340
Well

256
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,340
I can go now

257
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,340
Sangzi

258
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,340
Don't cry

259
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,340
People are always dead

260
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,340
The demon is like this

261
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:03,340
I am enough for my whole life

262
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:44,340
I am enough for my whole life

263
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,340
I am enough for my whole life

264
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:50,340
I am enough for my whole life

265
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,340
I am enough for my whole life

266
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,340
I am enough for my whole life

267
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:59,340
I am enough for my whole life

268
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:02,340
I am enough for my whole life

269
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,340
I am enough for my whole life

270
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:08,340
I am enough for my whole life

271
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:11,340
I am enough for my whole life

272
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:37,340
I met your DMP

273
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,340
I said

274
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:44,340
I will never let you go back

275
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,340
But I can't do it

276
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,340
No matter I know

277
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:03,340
You will never be lonely

278
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:07,340
There is a demon

279
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,340
But there is a demon

280
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,340
You drank so much that day

281
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:31,340
Do you remember? You came back alone

282
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:35,340
We followed you after you came back

283
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:39,340
We met your cousin at the door

284
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:44,340
Your cousin found a good doctor for you

285
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:47,340
He is so amazing

286
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:50,340
He took a small pill

287
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,340
You can take it after you eat

288
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,340
What about Mr. Cai?

289
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:59,340
He is our family's wife

290
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,340
How can you leave without saying anything?

291
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:04,340
Yunyi, don't blame me

292
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:08,340
I am not good enough to blame you

293
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,340
Don't blame yourself

294
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,340
Cousin, listen to me

295
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,340
Don't say anything

296
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,340
I know

297
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:20,340
I know that day when Cai Yi came to our family

298
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,340
He is not a human

299
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:28,340
He is just a butterfly

300
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,340
What?

301
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:35,340
He came here to repay the kindness

302
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,340
He took a long break

303
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:43,340
He came to ruin my life

304
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,340
He can become a butterfly

305
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,340
It's a good thing

306
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,340
Think about it

307
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:55,340
He can fly freely in the flower garden

308
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,340
It's so happy

309
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:03,340
Even a butterfly

310
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:06,340
cherishes his life

311
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,340
We are human

312
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,340
Cousin

313
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,340
What did you do?

314
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,340
Why?

315
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,340
Because he did a good thing

316
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,340
In the end

317
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,340
He only has ten years left

318
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,340
He is a good man

319
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,340
He is a good man

320
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,340
He is a good man

321
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,340
He is a good man

322
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,340
He is a good man

323
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,340
He has ten years left

324
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:46,340
Why is he like a good demon?

325
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,340
In the end

326
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,340
He has to be a good man

327
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,340
Is this destiny?

328
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,340
If

329
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:07,340
If I didn't stop him from saving Cousin

330
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,340
Maybe

331
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,340
Everything can change

332
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:20,340
If Cousin didn't stop him from saving Cousin

333
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,340
Or Cousin

334
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:26,340
He would not save Cousin

335
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,340
This

336
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:32,340
This would not be the end

337
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,340
Really?

338
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:42,340
If the same thing happens

339
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,340
The result will be the same

340
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,340
Even if they know the result

341
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,340
Think about it

342
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:55,340
Can Cousin see Cousin on the internet?

343
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,340
Can he really save Cousin?

344
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,340
Can Cousin really abandon Cousin?

345
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,340
Is it unreasonable?

346
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:08,340
Do you think Cousin will abandon Cousin?

347
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,340
Actually this happened

348
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,340
One thousand times

349
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,340
Ten thousand times

350
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:21,340
Even if they make a choice

351
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,340
The result will be the same

352
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:28,340
Because Cousin's character is kind

353
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:32,340
And you care about Cousin

354
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,340
Will never change

355
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,340
It's their character

356
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,340
That caused everything

357
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,340
In the end

358
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,340
It changed everyone's fate

359
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,340
Can't you change anything?

360
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,340
I don't know

361
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,340
But everyone

362
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,340
For the biggest sacrifice

363
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:07,340
If I were you

364
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,340
Would you sacrifice like this?

365
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,340
Don't say such a bad word

366
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,340
If I were you

367
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:21,340
I would

368
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,340
I understand Cousin's feelings

369
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:32,340
He thinks he can sacrifice for his beloved

370
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,340
It's worth it

371
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:42,340
Remember what Cousin said before leaving?

372
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,340
He said

373
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:52,340
The one who stays is the most painful

374
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,340
I don't understand

375
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,340
I don't want you to understand

376
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,340
Why?

377
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:00,340
Because if you understand

378
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,340
It means you've experienced the pain

379
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,340
Do you understand?

380
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,340
Okay

381
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:11,340
How can we do this?

382
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,340
Only by the half of the line

383
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:28,340
Find another one

384
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:31,340
They will be blessed

385
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,340
And will be blessed

386
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:36,340
And will love each other for a hundred years

387
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,340
Master

388
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,340
Senior

389
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,340
We're here

390
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,340
Let's go

391
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,340
Let's go

392
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,340
What's the matter?

393
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,340
Yes, it's true

394
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,340
We can help you

395
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:14,340
I'll kill him

396
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:18,340
I'll kill him

397
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,340
I care about you

398
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,340
Come

399
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,340
This is my wine

400
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,340
Who is Anu?

401
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,340
Where did you get it?

402
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,340
Who is Anu?

403
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,340
It's a man and a woman

404
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,340
This is the most important thing

405
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,340
Where did you get it?

406
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,340
Is he really saying that?

407
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,340
Where did you get it?

408
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,340
Tell me who Anu is

409
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,340
Where did you get it?

410
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,340
Where did Anu get it?

411
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,340
Tell me

412
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,340
Don't fight with me

413
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:59,340
Help

414
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,340
Anu

415
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,340
Who is Anu?

416
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,340
Tang Yu

417
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,340
Anu

418
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,340
Anu

419
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,340
Anu

420
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,340
Anu

421
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:15,340
Who is Anu?

422
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,340
Who is Anu?

423
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,340
Anu

424
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:39,340
Who saved me?

425
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:43,340
I let him be my father

426
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,340
Just say it

427
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:49,340
You won't be mad at me

428
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,340
Tang Xiaobao

429
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:55,340
Anu

430
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:59,340
I'm so scared

431
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,340
Don't be scared

432
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,340
If you leave first

433
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,340
I'll bite your tongue

434
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,340
and catch up with you

435
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,340
If you come again

436
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,340
I'll definitely

437
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,340
marry you

438
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:25,340
Marry Tang Xiaobao

439
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,340
Silly

440
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,340
Silly

441
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,340
Is that Anu?

442
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,340
Anu

443
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,340
Anu

444
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,340
Tang Yu

445
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,340
Anu

446
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,340
Anu

447
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,340
Anu

448
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,340
Are you okay?

449
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,340
Tang Yu

450
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,340
Anu

451
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,340
Wake up, Anu

452
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,340
Tang Yu

453
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,340
Master

454
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,340
You guys save them first

455
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,340
Who saved me?

456
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,340
Master, what are you doing?

457
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,340
Why are you crying?

458
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:50,340
I want to know why he fell down

459
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,340
What happened?

460
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,340
Tell me who is Anu

461
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:57,340
No, you have to save them first

462
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,340
I'll tell you

463
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:01,340
Go

464
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,340
Okay, I'll go

465
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,340
Wait

466
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,340
So fast

467
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,340
So fast

468
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,340
I'm so fast

469
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,340
I'll be done in two days

470
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,340
Tell me

471
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,340
What's that girl doing?

472
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,340
Wake up

473
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,340
Are you okay?

474
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,340
Be careful

475
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,340
Where's Anu?

476
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,340
He's there

477
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,340
He's fine

478
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,340
Did the princess save him?

479
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,340
Ling'er is still in Mount Zu

480
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,340
What?

481
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,340
Mount Zu

482
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,340
Yes

483
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,340
Ling'er was caught by that

484
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:45,340
Why did my senior catch that beauty?

485
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,340
Is he your senior?

486
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,340
His name is Du Gu Jian Sheng

487
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,340
My name is Jiu Jian Xian

488
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,340
Both of us have a sword

489
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,340
We are brothers

490
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,340
I know you are strong

491
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,340
But you don't have to joke

492
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,340
Be careful

493
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,340
No

494
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,340
Master

495
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,340
Take us to Mount Zu

496
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,340
Okay, senior

497
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,340
Think about it

498
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,340
Master

499
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,340
Master

500
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,340
Master

501
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,340
Senior

502
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,340
Master

503
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,340
Don't you have to go so far?

504
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,340
Go to the desert to report to you

505
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:24,340
No, I want to ask you about Mount Zu

506
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,340
Have I told you?

507
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,340
By the way, you owe me an answer

508
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,340
What?

509
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,340
Who is Anu?

510
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:34,340
He's from the southern Zhao State

511
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,340
He looks like the daughter of that man

512
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,340
What kind of man?

513
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,340
He looks like the mother of the southern Manman

514
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,340
Mother of the southern Manman?

515
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,340
Do you know him?

516
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,340
No

517
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,340
By the way

518
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,340
Why does he have this pendant?

519
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,340
Is it strange?

520
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,340
Isn't it just a normal pendant?

521
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,340
He looks like a normal pendant

522
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:12,340
He has a long back

523
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,340
What is it?

524
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,340
A

525
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,340
A

526
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,340
Only a

527
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,340
Completely

528
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,340
No way

529
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,340
How can you say he has only half of it?

530
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,340
Smart

531
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,340
You see it?

532
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,340
He's not just my apprentice

533
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,340
I'm flattered

534
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:35,340
There is a saying

535
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:40,340
A man's life is half

536
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,340
Sometimes

537
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,340
I tell you

538
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,340
The whole person

539
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:55,340
It seems empty

540
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,340
Until one day

541
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,340
You meet someone

542
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,340
Suddenly

543
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:06,340
You will feel

544
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,340
Like a

545
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:10,340
People who have been apart for 13 years

546
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,340
They meet again

547
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,340
Be with him

548
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:14,340
Very happy

549
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,340
Absolutely happy

550
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,340
Love

551
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:23,340
Love that is selfish

552
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,340
That's it

553
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:29,340
He's your other half

554
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:33,340
Your real name is the other half

555
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,340
With him

556
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,340
You are the one

557
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,340
He's complete

558
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,340
So

559
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,340
He really has the other half

560
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,340
A legend

561
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,340
If the owner of the pendant

562
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:00,340
Meet each other

563
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,340
They will be a pair of gods

564
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,340
This is called

565
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:12,340
Love is hard to seek

566
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,340
You idiot

567
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,340
I understand

568
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,340
There was a fool

569
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,340
About your age

570
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,340
He didn't understand

571
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:31,340
He gave this pendant to the senior

572
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,340
He's so stupid

573
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,340
Yes, very stupid

574
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,340
So

575
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:39,340
He met another girl

576
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,340
Who gave him the pendant

577
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,340
Isn't that good?

578
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,340
He can't meet himself

579
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:47,340
He can choose someone else

580
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,340
Yes

581
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:50,340
It's good to start

582
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,340
They met

583
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,340
They fell in love

584
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:59,340
They have gone through a lot

585
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,340
But

586
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:06,340
But he gave up the real god

587
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,340
Why?

588
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:13,340
I don't understand why

589
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,340
It's true

590
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,340
It's very true

591
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:21,340
Is that senior a family member?

592
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,340
It's a tragedy

593
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,340
It's a tragedy

594
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:30,340
How was that idiot?

595
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:34,340
Idiot

596
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,340
Idiot

597
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:49,340
I don't know what kind of fruit he is

598
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,340
He's a great brother

599
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:57,340
He fell in love with that girl

600
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,340
What happened?

601
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,340
What happened?

602
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,340
What can he do?

603
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,340
Is he okay?

604
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,340
The only thing he can do

605
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:12,340
For his beloved girl is

606
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:16,340
Send her home

607
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,340
Then

608
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:20,340
Look at her

609
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:23,340
Another man married her

610
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:28,340
Later

611
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:33,340
He did something ridiculous

612
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:37,340
He lost another woman

613
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:41,340
He's so mean

614
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:43,340
Don't mention that idiot again

615
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:48,340
So he's been drinking

616
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,340
He forgets everything

617
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,340
But can he forget?

618
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:55,340
Of course he can

619
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,340
Drink it

620
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,340
Hold it

621
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,340
It's okay

622
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:09,340
It's a little bit sour

623
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:10,340
Look at me

624
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,340
Drink it

625
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:12,340
Master

626
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,340
Drink it

627
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,340
If you can forget

628
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:17,340
You don't need it

629
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:18,340
If it's me

630
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,340
I'll face it

631
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:22,340
I won't run away

632
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:24,340
Because I won't forget

633
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,340
Master

634
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:33,340
No matter what

635
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:35,340
I must save Ling'er

636
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:40,340
No

637
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:10,340
No

638
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:41,340
Sorry, I scared you

639
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:11,340
I still exist

640
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:17,340
I can't stop crying

641
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:25,340
I'm destined to have your future

642
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:32,340
I'm a blank lost in the dream

643
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:36,340
Don't say anything

644
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:39,340
I don't want to understand

645
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:46,340
At least I still have a beautiful dream

646
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:50,340
Don't say anything

647
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:53,340
I really don't want to understand

648
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:56,340
I finally understand

649
00:45:56,340 --> 00:46:00,340
I should let go

650
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:04,340
Don't say anything

651
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:07,340
I don't want to understand

652
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:14,340
At least I still have a beautiful dream

653
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:18,340
Don't say anything

654
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:21,340
I really don't want to understand

655
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:24,340
I finally understand

656
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:26,340
I should let go
