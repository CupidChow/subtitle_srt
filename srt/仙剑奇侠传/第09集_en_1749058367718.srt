1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not afraid of you.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not afraid of you.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm not afraid of you.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The End

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Episode 34

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The End

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Episode 34

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What does this broken glass do?

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The End

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You're kidding me?

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The End

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You're a bastard.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Let me go.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
What are you doing?

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You're a fool.

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Qi.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Your cousin is waiting for you.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Your spring is here.

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You.

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Qi is missing.

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Cousin.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Cousin.

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Cousin.

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You're a cousin.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I still like him.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
He calls me the fool.

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
He's so gentle to you.

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Don't you like him?

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Cousin.

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
There's a pair of strangers

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
on the surface of the moon.

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I saw them when I saw you.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I saw them when I saw you.

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I saw them when I saw you.

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I saw them when I saw you.

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Miss, please be careful.

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Don't let the moon

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
in my heart.

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'll use your blood

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
to kill my husband.

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So you're sad.

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Don't insult me.

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
We're not classmates.

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Sorry.

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I asked you.

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You like a girl who's been in love for more than ten years.

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You're so jealous.

63
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Don't you like him?

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You're a fake.

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I was just

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
lying to myself.

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I treated you as a real moon.

68
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Because I replaced him

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and completed my ten-year dream.

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
When he was seven,

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
he left my home

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
and went back to Linjia Bao.

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Then he never paid me back.

74
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
He never paid me back.

75
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
He was very bad to me.

76
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
He hit me and scolded me.

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Then you still love him.

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Why?

79
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
He's not good.

80
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
He's not so mean.

81
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You've been tortured for him.

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Does he care about you?

83
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
He's been so mean to you.

84
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
He's not as good as Li Xiangyang.

85
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
He's not as good as Li Xiangyang.

86
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I've accepted

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
his love for me.

88
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You're so mean.

89
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's okay.

90
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But

91
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I want to thank you.

92
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
At least

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
before I die,

94
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I can hear Yue Ru say something to me.

95
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
That's

96
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
what I've been waiting for.

97
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I want to get back to the warmth

98
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
he's been feeling.

99
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Although he's a selfish person,

100
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
he's the best person

101
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I've ever got.

102
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Enough.

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm satisfied.

104
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
What's the feeling of ten years?

105
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I've been with you for six hundred years.

106
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
We've been living together.

107
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
We've been looking for each other.

108
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
That's what I want.

109
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
That's what I want.

110
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
No wonder you're so pitiful.

111
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Little disciple.

112
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Little disciple.

113
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Little disciple.

114
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I didn't expect that monster to be so mean.

115
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You're a bad girl.

116
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You're not good enough for a city.

117
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Why are you blaming me?

118
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Who just beat you?

119
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Who threw my bag?

120
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
What's the big deal?

121
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
We're in a relationship.

122
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
We don't need help.

123
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You're not even a monster.

124
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Fine. I won't argue with you.

125
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Let's get together

126
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
and talk to Ling'er.

127
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You're in a relationship?

128
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm not a wild man.

129
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'll listen to you.

130
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
But you have to tell me slowly.

131
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Because sometimes I can't understand.

132
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Tell me.

133
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'll go this way.

134
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You go this way. I'll go this way.

135
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Fine.

136
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
How can we get in touch?

137
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I didn't expect that.

138
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I didn't know he's so nice.

139
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Don't forget that there are two sides of the world.

140
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm only three years old.

141
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I don't know what to do.

142
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

143
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Qi.

144
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Qi.

145
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Where did you go?

146
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Where did you go to the camp?

147
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Qi.

148
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Qi.

149
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
She said that

150
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
if you come back,

151
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
she'll marry you.

152
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You bastard!

153
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Cousin.

154
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Cousin.

155
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Where are you?

156
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
If you don't come out,

157
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'll burn your books.

158
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Qi.

159
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Cousin.

160
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Cousin.

161
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Did you find it?

162
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Why are you alone? Where's he?

163
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I don't know.

164
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Didn't you say that you can't get in touch?

165
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You got news?

166
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Don't come in. Go find him.

167
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
What do you want?

168
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I can't walk.

169
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
What's wrong?

170
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm dizzy.

171
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Where are you?

172
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You must be hungry.

173
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I lost my bag.

174
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Okay.

175
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
What's this?

176
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Give me this.

177
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I can't match you.

178
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You're so stubborn.

179
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You're so stubborn.

180
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I eat this every day.

181
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I can eat it.

182
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Thank you.

183
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Enjoy your meal.

184
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You want to starve to death?

185
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You have to feed me.

186
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You don't want to eat it?

187
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I don't want to eat steamed buns.

188
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
What do you want?

189
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I want fish.

190
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You want to eat it?

191
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Do you want to go?

192
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'll go.

193
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'll go.

194
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You...

195
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I know you.

196
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Remember to catch some fresh fish.

197
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Oh, my.

198
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You're so generous.

199
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Don't run.

200
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Help!

201
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Help!

202
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
What's wrong?

203
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I saw a monster.

204
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's a man.

205
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Is it strange?

206
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's a fox.

207
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Where did they go?

208
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's a cave.

209
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's scary.

210
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
The monster went inside.

211
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Thank you.

212
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Wait.

213
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'll catch the monster.

214
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I escaped from that cave.

215
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
The air is heavy.

216
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You can't go in.

217
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's dangerous.

218
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
What's the use of your plan?

219
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You can't save him.

220
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But tomorrow...

221
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
The storm will come.

222
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
If the storm breaks the air, you can't save him.

223
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'll die.

224
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Wait.

225
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Wait.

226
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Qi.

227
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Wait for me.

228
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'll come to save you.

229
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
This is my necklace.

230
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I don't understand.

231
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It's your friend's.

232
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You killed my necklace

233
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
when you were in the river.

234
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You spent 500 years in the cave.

235
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You saved his life.

236
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Why did you tell me this?

237
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Because you're a man.

238
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Yes.

239
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm a man.

240
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I mean

241
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
you're the real man.

242
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Your blood is warm.

243
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It's red.

244
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And the so-called human blood

245
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
is cold blood.

246
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
The heart is black.

247
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Maybe I'm not as good as you think.

248
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
But at least

249
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
you're really

250
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
worth it.

251
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
The things you love

252
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
never happened in human life.

253
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You're called human.

254
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You're more cruel than us.

255
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You're more cruel.

256
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I don't want to live.

257
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I don't want to be your enemy.

258
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I just want to live with

259
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
my husband.

260
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I'm just a beast.

261
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
What can I do?

262
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
No.

263
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
You can only die.

264
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Don't be so serious.

265
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You're a good man.

266
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Let's go.

267
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Why?

268
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I love black.

269
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
How many people do you want?

270
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I just want to find

271
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
the things he loves.

272
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I believe he'll live

273
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
for a day.

274
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You're wrong.

275
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You can't save my husband.

276
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
No.

277
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
But I know

278
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
you used the wrong method

279
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
to save your husband.

280
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You spent 500 years of cultivation

281
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
to protect his money.

282
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
This witness needs your existence.

283
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You need to feel

284
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
your feelings for him.

285
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'll sit here

286
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
and do nothing?

287
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Maybe.

288
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Yes.

289
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Song,

290
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
you can go back now.

291
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Everything in the world

292
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
is made up of gold and silver.

293
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Every gold

294
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
is made up of his people

295
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
to take care of him and help him.

296
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
This way,

297
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
he can grow up.

298
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Really?

299
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Take care of him.

300
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
The snake is a cold blooded animal.

301
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It's often used for death.

302
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You can't let

303
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
the heat

304
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
hurt it

305
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
in the dark and dark places.

306
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Can you feel it?

307
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Remember this temperature.

308
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You can't be

309
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
taller than my body.

310
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Or else,

311
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
it will hurt you.

312
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I don't understand.

313
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'm afraid.

314
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm not afraid.

315
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
To tell you the truth,

316
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm a man.

317
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I'm a man.

318
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
A man?

319
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Maybe.

320
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I don't know much.

321
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
But I know

322
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
some people.

323
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Do you believe me?

324
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I believe you.

325
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I believe you.

326
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I believe you.

327
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I believe you.

328
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I believe you.

329
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I believe you.

330
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I believe you.

331
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I believe you.

332
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I believe you.

333
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I believe you.

334
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I believe you.

335
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I believe you.

336
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I believe you.

337
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I believe you.

338
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I believe you.

339
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I believe you.

340
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I believe you.

341
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I believe you.

342
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I believe you.

343
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I believe you.

344
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I believe you.

345
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I believe you.

346
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I believe you.

347
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I believe you.

348
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I believe you.

349
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I believe you.

350
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I believe you.

351
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I believe you.

352
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I believe you.

353
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I believe you.

354
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I believe you.

355
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It can't be.

356
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Do you want to go with him?

357
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
No.

358
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I just want to go with her.

359
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
With her?

360
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You need the sword so much?

361
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Of course.

362
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
She also needs a bodyguard.

363
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I won't be a big deal

364
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
if I met a girl like you.

365
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
You want to go alone with brother?

366
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Yes.

367
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Where is the girl?

368
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I know.

369
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You hide in the cave and wait for my good news.

370
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Stop pretending.

371
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
You think you can pretend not to let others know?

372
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
You think you can make people feel dangerous and you will be responsible for it?

373
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Mom, you don't want to know who's more powerful than who.

374
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You're so funny.

375
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Your aunt is more powerful than mine? Who are you?

376
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Then let's compare.

377
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Let's see who is better.

378
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I'm telling you, it's hard to fight with a woman.

379
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I'm going to save A-Qi.

380
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You come back.

381
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You're so old-fashioned.

382
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm more emotional than you.

383
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I can go alone.

384
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I'm telling you, I'm going to be a master all my life.

385
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
He can fix you, but he can't do anything.

386
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
What are you talking about?

387
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
No one can fix you.

388
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I told him to fix you.

389
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I told him to be a master.

390
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
What's going on?

391
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Is the tiger going to leave?

392
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Yes.

393
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It's true.

394
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It's true.

395
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Little brother.

396
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Little brother.

397
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Little brother.

398
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Little brother.

399
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Little brother.

400
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Little brother.

401
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Are you alright?

402
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Are you okay?

403
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Idiot, you lost your mind to the tiger.

404
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Let go of me.

405
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
He didn't think of me so badly.

406
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
He didn't hurt me at all.

407
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Little brother.

408
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Will my husband

409
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
come back?

410
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Little brother.

411
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Little brother.

412
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Little brother.

413
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Little brother.

414
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,520
Your wound all killed in the SFX 없는.

415
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,200
I'm heart- livestreaming.

416
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I've been looking for her for so many days.

417
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I just forgot.

418
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I didn't remember.

419
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
You said you were a bastard.

420
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
But you were forced to divorce her.

421
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Are you all right?

422
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
You're too much.

423
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Without us, you'd have become a big hit.

424
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
You don't have to buy it.

425
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
She won't marry anyone.

426
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Let me tell you.

427
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
If you want to marry someone,

428
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
you can't be a bastard.

429
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
You know what you're like.

430
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
You're a man.

431
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
You're a bastard.

432
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
So you can't be a bastard.

433
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Do you understand?

434
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I know she doesn't understand.

435
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Because you're her cousin.

436
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm not a mother.

437
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I'm not a god.

438
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I'm not a woman.

439
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,400
Other things?

440
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,560
ShетOur

441
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,480
What is what

442
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,480
Dare to say

443
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,240
Are you happy for that

444
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,240
Hey!

445
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,240
A-Qi.

446
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:04,240
I just want to tell you that we did all for you.

447
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:14,240
To be honest, I was in love with Hu Yao in the cave.

448
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,240
What?

449
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:20,240
Because she became the female demon in Yue Ru's life.

450
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,240
She didn't hurt my intention.

451
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:29,240
I'm telling you, she didn't kill you this time.

452
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,240
So you're pregnant.

453
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,240
You should be careful next time.

454
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,240
I knew Yue Ru's life was fake.

455
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,240
You're more stupid.

456
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,240
You know she's fake.

457
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,240
You followed her.

458
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,240
Yes, I'm stupid.

459
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:51,240
I might be the one who lied to myself.

460
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,240
Okay, don't forget.

461
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:59,240
I'm telling you, you have many chances.

462
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,240
You missed a chance to be a family.

463
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,240
What?

464
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,240
Nothing.

465
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,240
Nothing.

466
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,240
What's this?

467
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,240
Fish bones?

468
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,240
Did you catch the fish in the river?

469
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,240
No.

470
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,240
You're pretending.

471
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,240
I smelled the fish's smell yesterday.

472
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,240
Did you eat it?

473
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,240
Yes.

474
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,240
You made me hungry.

475
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,240
I'll kill you right now.

476
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,240
Help!

477
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,240
You're so big.

478
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,240
Help!

479
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,240
Come on.

480
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,240
Help!

481
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,240
Help!

482
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,240
Help!

483
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,240
They're the gods.

484
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,240
Your Majesty, how's the progress?

485
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,240
They've got the spirit of the fox and snake demon.

486
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,240
Send them back to Nanzhao.

487
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,240
Tell the master.

488
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,240
Yes.

489
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,240
A'nu, I can walk so fast.

490
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,240
Don't be so fast.

491
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,240
Poor me.

492
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,240
I want to see him as soon as possible.

493
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,240
You're only a demon.

494
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,240
You're a demon.

495
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,240
What will he think after he knows my identity?

496
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,240
Ling'er, you're the descendant of the female frog.

497
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,240
You're the princess of Nanzhao.

498
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,240
I like you more than a demon.

499
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,240
Okay.

500
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,240
A'nu, love is the heart of the spirit.

501
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,240
It's not changed because of your identity and status.

502
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,240
I don't understand.

503
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,240
Tell me.

504
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,240
Ling'er, no matter what you become,

505
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,240
I still love you.

506
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:23,240
Because you're always my Ling'er.

507
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,240
I understand.

508
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,240
Ling'er, I really miss Brother Xiaoyao.

509
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,240
You're fast.

510
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,240
I'm slow.

511
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,240
Brother Xiaoyao.

512
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,240
Brother Xiaoyao.

513
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,240
Brother Xiaoyao.

514
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,240
Brother Xiaoyao.

515
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,240
Miss Ling'er.

516
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,240
You're wrong. It's a demon.

517
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,240
Brother Xiaoyao.

518
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,240
A big demon.

519
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,240
I'm Ling'er.

520
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,240
You pretend to be Ling'er.

521
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,240
Tell me.

522
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,240
How are you doing?

523
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,240
Listen to me.

524
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,240
Huo Yao is my cousin.

525
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,240
You have a demon now.

526
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,240
I'll teach you a lesson.

527
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,240
Tell you, I'll drop it.

528
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,240
You're much worse than Ling'er.

529
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,240
Yes, I'll kill you.

530
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,240
Let me go.

531
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,240
Let me go.

532
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,240
I want to explain to you.

533
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,240
No.

534
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,240
Let me go.

535
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,240
Let me go.

536
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,240
No.

537
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,240
I'm so mad.

538
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,240
Mother, let me go.

539
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,240
I can't go.

540
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,240
Let me go.

541
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,240
No.

542
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,240
No.

543
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,240
I want to explain to you.

544
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,240
You don't understand.

545
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,240
I want to explain to you.

546
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,240
You don't understand.

547
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,240
No.

548
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,240
No.

549
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,240
No.

550
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,240
Brother Xiaoyao.

551
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,240
No.

552
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,240
No.

553
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,240
No.

554
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,240
You have to explain.

555
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,240
You don't understand.

556
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,240
She's just a bad guy.

557
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,240
She almost killed you.

558
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,240
She took me as a drug.

559
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,240
You let me go to see her.

560
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,240
All right.

561
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,240
It's the first time I saw you.

562
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,240
I knew you're not a demon.

563
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,240
She's your idol.

564
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,240
You even pregnant with her.

565
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,240
How could she not recognize you?

566
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,240
Maybe.

567
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,240
It's the same for me.

568
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,240
Actually,

569
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,240
it's a crime.

570
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,240
Don't talk nonsense.

571
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,240
You're the back of the girl.

572
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,240
This is a serious fight.

573
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,240
It's your glory.

574
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,640
I don't want this.

575
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,240
She is a hard-working follower.

576
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,440
If I had chosen,

577
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,240
I would only be a normal girl.

578
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,640
I would live a simple life with the one I like.

579
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,240
Princess,

580
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,640
but even this little thing,

581
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,440
I can't do it.

582
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,040
Princess, don't be like this.

583
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,040
Anu,

584
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,040
do you have a way to

585
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,840
help me take this tail?

586
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,440
Change it back to double legs?

587
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,840
You still want to see her?

588
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,640
With double legs,

589
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,440
Brother Xiaoyao won't have to kneel down.

590
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,440
No, I won't tell you.

591
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,840
You know that?

592
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,040
Tell me.

593
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:35,840
Bukhanyi,

594
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,840
please, Anu.

595
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,840
I'm begging you.

596
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,640
Don't beg me.

597
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,440
Why?

598
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,840
Because this sacrifice is too big.

599
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,040
It's not worth it.

600
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,240
I'm just you.

601
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,240
Good, Anu.

602
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,040
If I can't see Brother Xiaoyao,

603
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,640
I can't even pass today.

604
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,640
There's no way.

605
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,240
I'll let you suffer for three years.

606
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,240
Are you afraid?

607
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,440
It's okay.

608
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,440
Then,

609
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,640
you can't keep your legs

610
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,440
for too long.

611
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,040
Maybe you can only keep your legs for a few days.

612
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,040
That's it?

613
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,840
You're not afraid?

614
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,240
Don't say three years.

615
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,840
Even if it's ten years, I'm willing to do it.

616
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,840
Is love really worth it?

617
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,840
No wonder my mom said

618
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,840
love will make you a madman.

619
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,840
If there's no love,

620
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,240
and you choose to live,

621
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,640
I'll be your madman forever.

622
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,640
I won't love you even if you hit me.

623
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,440
Anu,

624
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,040
what should I do?

625
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,240
Only by using your body blood

626
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,840
can you temporarily suppress

627
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,240
the female demoness who is being triggered.

628
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,240
I'm afraid I'll be a madman forever.

629
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,240
I'll be your madman forever.

630
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,240
I'll be your madman forever.

631
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,240
I'll be your madman forever.

632
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,240
I'll be your madman forever.

633
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,240
I'll be your madman forever.

634
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,240
I'll be your madman forever.

635
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,240
I'll be your madman forever.

636
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,240
I'll be your madman forever.

637
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,240
I'll be your madman forever.

638
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,240
I'll be your madman forever.

639
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,240
I'll be your madman forever.

640
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,240
I'll be your madman forever.

641
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,240
I'll be your madman forever.

642
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,240
I'll be your madman forever.

643
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,240
I'll be your madman forever.

644
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,240
I'll be your madman forever.

645
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,140
Key, what he said....

646
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,140
Let's not talk about it again.

647
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,840
Sis Xiao Yao, shouldn't I usually make sure that...?

648
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,640
I see you have multiple customers.

649
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:41,640
Sis Xiao Yao really needed to say a few words.

650
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,740
You've been making our plans.

651
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,440
Okay, one word first.

652
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,140
Sister Xiao Yao.

653
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:50,640
Tell Xiaoxiao properly to take the meeting back.

654
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,140
spoke

655
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:55,140
I still don't like her.

656
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,140
No one has ever been in love.

657
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,140
So you won't understand.

658
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,140
I don't miss her.

659
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:05,140
Love is boring and useless.

660
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,140
I don't want to.

661
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:10,140
Actually, being with the person you like is very happy.

662
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,140
You will understand.

663
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:15,140
For me, beauty is more important than beauty.

664
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:19,140
Look, this is the best and most superior fabric in this shop.

665
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,140
Look at this.

666
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,140
How beautiful.

667
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,140
So beautiful.

668
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:26,140
Anu, change her into a dress.

669
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,140
Do you like Xia Xia?

670
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,140
I'm not her.

671
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,140
How would I know?

672
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:41,140
Then you have to give me your opinion.

673
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,140
I'm confused.

674
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,140
Fine, beauty.

675
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,140
Everyone can see beauty.

676
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,140
Fine?

677
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:50,140
Then, I'll go.

678
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,140
I'll pay for it.

679
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:55,140
Anu, you are too much for me.

680
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:58,140
Who calls you my bride?

681
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:02,140
I'll buy a knife and hang it here.

682
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,140
Boss, I'll pay for it.

683
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,140
You are so lucky.

684
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:11,140
You are the glory of the shop.

685
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:14,140
I wish you two happiness.

686
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:17,140
I wish you two happiness.

687
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:22,140
I'll tell you, I'll get a red-braised pork feet, red-braised quince, good duck tongue,

688
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:24,140
any meat, horse meat, pork belly, etc.

689
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:26,140
And a red-braised head.

690
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:28,140
You want to eat such a scary thing?

691
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:30,140
Who wants you to eat my fish head?

692
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:32,140
You are not useful to me.

693
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:34,140
I just ask you to eat noodles.

694
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:37,140
You have already ordered more than 40 dishes.

695
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:40,140
I think we can eat it for the day after tomorrow.

696
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:42,140
Why don't we just do it?

697
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:46,140
I'll tell you, the most expensive dishes are ready.

698
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,140
Okay.

699
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,140
Why are you so stubborn?

700
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,140
You don't have to care about it.

701
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:04,140
You are so self-conscious.

702
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:07,140
I'm telling you, we are going to meet you.

703
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:10,140
You'll wait for him in the river court after two hours.

704
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,140
What princess?

705
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,140
Zhaolin.

706
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,140
You must go.

707
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,140
What are you thinking about?

708
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:18,140
I'm his good sister.

709
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,140
Sister?

710
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,140
Okay.

711
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:29,140
You've asked me the 23 times.

712
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,140
Really?

713
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,140
You are so beautiful today.

714
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,140
Really?

715
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:37,140
Ever since I met you for the first time,

716
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,140
you have never been so happy.

717
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,140
Let's go to see Brother Xiaoyao.

718
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,140
Look, A'nuo.

719
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,140
Here.

720
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,140
It's there.

721
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:08,140
I'll do this alone.

722
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,140
You?

723
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:21,140
Princess, why are you going up to him?

724
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,140
Let's go.

725
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,140
Let's go.

726
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,140
Okay, I'll ask you.

727
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:31,140
Why do you have to do this to me?

728
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,140
You are different from my daughter.

729
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,140
She will be happy when I touch her.

730
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:38,140
Yes, your daughter loves you so much.

731
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,140
You are a bad girl.

732
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,140
You've never been loved by anyone.

733
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,140
You are so stupid.

734
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,140
That's it.

735
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,140
I'm asking you how you get along.

736
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,140
You don't understand what I said.

737
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,140
I'm telling you the truth.

738
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:54,140
Love is not a matter of the past.

739
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:58,140
It's just a matter of the future.

740
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,140
You understand?

741
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,140
Anyway,

742
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:08,140
I'll ignore her when my Ling'er comes.

743
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,140
Why are you angry?

744
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,140
I'm not.

745
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,140
Are you going to make Xiaoyao angry?

746
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,140
No.

747
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,140
Are you going to kill her?

748
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,140
No.

749
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,140
Are you going to abandon her?

750
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,140
No.

751
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,140
You don't like her?

752
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,140
No.

753
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,140
Princess.

754
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,140
How could she do this?

755
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,140
What's wrong with her?

756
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:28,140
This is my own action.

757
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,140
I've never been like this to anyone.

758
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:33,140
But why does she act like this to a girl?

759
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:36,140
Does she have me in her heart?

760
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:38,140
She has forgotten me.

761
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,140
Princess, Anu is here.

762
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,140
Let's stop thinking about that bad girl.

763
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,140
Okay, Anu, I'll listen to you.

764
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,140
I'll never miss her.

765
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,140
Never see her again.

766
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:56,140
We'll take care of you.

767
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,140
Okay, Anu.

768
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,140
We'll go back to Nanzhao.

769
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:01,140
Okay, let's go.

770
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,140
Zh evangelical lawyer.

771
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,140
Zh estosiable lawyer.

772
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,140
What a good man!

773
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:37,420
Maybe it's the wrong time to remember.

774
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,540
Is that right, cousin?

775
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,180
Yes.

776
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:45,420
It's time for a girl to go out.

777
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,380
Especially for the wedding.

778
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:51,620
So it's a half hour late.

779
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,740
One day, two days.

780
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,220
That's not strange.

781
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:01,300
So as a gentleman, you are called a man.

782
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:02,700
Enough, cousin.

783
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,740
You are so fake.

784
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,460
A gentleman is so honest.

785
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,740
He doesn't say anything.

786
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:09,860
I know.

787
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,980
It must be that man.

788
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,540
We don't know whether he is a man or a woman.

789
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,980
Anyway, he is a man.

790
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,260
It's not true, cousin.

791
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,420
Have you said anything?

792
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:24,900
You...

793
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,980
I understand his feelings.

794
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,460
Let him go.

795
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,500
You can leave now.

796
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,020
But I've told him enough.

797
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:51,940
I don't expect you to know him.

798
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,380
You can tell him so.

799
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,820
But I don't know him for every day.

800
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:02,420
Road work takes a long time.

801
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,500
Truth never goes words.

802
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,520
Not to be questioned.

803
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:26,140
My

804
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,820
Don't start anything.

805
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:34,820
You won't be in pain.

806
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,820
God.

807
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:54,820
When can you pity me?

808
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:58,820
Let me have a happy moment.

809
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:09,820
All right. Princess, don't cry.

810
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,820
Princess, don't cry, all right?

811
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:13,820
Don't cry.

812
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:17,820
Anu, my heart hurts.

813
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,820
Don't move. Don't move.

814
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,820
Don't think about that idiot.

815
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,820
I can't forget him.

816
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,820
All right, stop it.

817
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,820
I can go with you to find another half.

818
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,820
I hope you can be with me.

819
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:39,820
Look.

820
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:47,820
The shenggu master said that everyone is only half.

821
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:51,820
Only when you find your other half will you be complete.

822
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:55,820
There is a legend behind this thing.

823
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:59,820
Half of it is male, half of it is female.

824
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,820
Two couples are together.

825
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:07,820
This couple will be blessed to be together for 100 years.

826
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,820
I'll give it to you.

827
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:12,820
I'll find another half with you.

828
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,820
You'll be happy forever.

829
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,820
I won't hurt anyone.

830
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,820
What about Anu? Do you love Anu?

831
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:25,820
I'll marry you.

832
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,820
I'll take care of you forever.

833
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,820
I'll make you happy forever.

834
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,820
I'll be happy forever.

835
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:34,820
I'll marry you.

836
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,820
I'll take care of you forever.

837
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:40,820
Silly girl.

838
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:43,820
How can girls and girls get married?

839
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:45,820
Can't they?

840
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:51,820
Or why would men and girls have a girl in the world?

841
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,820
I don't understand.

842
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:56,820
If you like her, you can get married.

843
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:00,820
I don't care.

844
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:04,820
If anyone bullies you, Anu will eat her.

845
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,820
Anu, you're so nice.

846
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:16,820
You bastard.

847
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:19,820
Be calm.

848
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:20,820
Don't be mad at me.

849
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:23,820
I know you're unhappy.

850
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:24,820
I'll be unhappy too.

851
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:26,820
I'll tell you. Don't be mad at me.

852
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:28,820
Be careful.

853
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:31,820
How about I buy you your favorite food?

854
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:32,820
Don't talk nonsense.

855
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:33,820
I don't have it.

856
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:34,820
I'll go.

857
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,820
Wait.

858
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:37,820
I want to eat the beef noodles in Suzhou.

859
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:39,820
Okay.

860
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:40,820
I'll buy you some food.

861
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:42,820
I want to eat the beef noodles in Suzhou.

862
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,820
The best food for you.

863
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:45,820
What?

864
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:46,820
Your house?

865
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:47,820
Suzhou?

866
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:48,820
Do you have any questions?

867
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:50,820
I'll go.

868
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,820
I accidentally bumped into Master Li.

869
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:55,820
Please forgive me.

870
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:57,820
I'm always willing to do it.

871
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:01,820
I've been doing it all the time.

872
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:03,820
Why are you looking for Qi?

873
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,820
You know you've made me angry.

874
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:09,820
Go ahead. I'll go find Master Lamei.

875
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:12,820
You're so far away from Suzhou.

876
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:15,820
I'll be at ease as long as you're happy.

877
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,820
I'll take my leave.

878
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:21,820
I want to eat the beef noodles in Suzhou.

879
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:22,820
This...

880
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:27,820
Master Li, please don't make things difficult for me.

881
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:31,820
You want to eat the beef noodles?

882
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:32,820
Okay.

883
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:35,820
From now on, you'll eat everything except the beef noodles in Suzhou.

884
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:37,820
I won't eat anything.

885
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:38,820
Who are you afraid of?

886
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:40,820
Okay. I'll go find Master Lamei.

887
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:42,820
Hey, hey, hey.

888
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:43,820
Are you out of your mind?

889
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:44,820
I'm so embarrassed.

890
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:23,820
I'm so embarrassed.

891
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:53,820
Don't say anything.

892
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:55,820
Don't say anything.

893
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:58,820
I don't want to be alone.

894
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:05,820
At least I still have a beautiful dream.

895
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:07,820
Don't say anything.

896
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:09,820
Don't say anything.

897
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:12,820
I really don't want to be alone.

898
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:17,820
I understand that you should let go.
