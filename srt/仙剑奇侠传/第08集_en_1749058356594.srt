00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,200
I'm not afraid of you.

I'm not afraid of you.

18
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,200
I'm not afraid of you.

19
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,200
I'm not afraid of you.

20
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,200
I'm not afraid of you.

21
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,200
I'm not afraid of you.

22
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,200
I'm not afraid of you.

23
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,200
I'm not afraid of you.

24
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,200
I'm not afraid of you.

25
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,200
I'm not afraid of you.

26
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,200
I'm not afraid of you.

27
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,200
I'm not afraid of you.

28
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,200
I'm not afraid of you.

29
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,200
I'm not afraid of you.

30
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,200

I'm not afraid of you.

42
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,200
I'm not afraid of you.

43
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,200
I'm not afraid of you.

44
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,200
I'm not afraid of you.

45
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,200
I'm not afraid of you.

46
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,200
I'm not afraid of you.

47
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,200
I'm not afraid of you.

48
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,200
I'm not afraid of you.

49
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,200
I'm not afraid of you.

50
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,200
Why is there no reaction now?

51
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,200
I found you.

52
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,200
I can't find you.

53
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,200
I can't find you.

54
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,200
I can't find you.

55
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,200
No.

56
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,200
No.

57
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,200
No.

58
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,200
No.

59
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,200
No.

60
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,200
Wenyu, are you hungry?

61
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,200
Are you hungry?

62
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,200
Can you eat this?

63
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,200
It's so dangerous.

64
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,200
Yes.

65
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,200
Yes.

66
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,200
It's a abalone.

67
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,200
It's so yellow.

68
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,200
What's this?

69
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,200
It's just a normal lunch.

70
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,200
It's Miss Linqiao.

71
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,200
It's different.

72
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,200
It's not out yet.

73
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,200
It's a rabbit.

74
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,200
Yes.

75
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,200
It's so ugly.

76
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,200
I've eaten all the food in the past three days.

77
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,200
I'm so angry.

78
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,200
What are you doing?

79
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,200
Hurry up.

80
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,200
I'll go.

81
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,200
What's the matter?

82
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,200
You're talking about Miss Linqiao again?

83
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,200
You...

84
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,200
We're here.

85
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,200
You know it again?

86
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,200
Look.

87
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,200
Cousin.

88
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,200
Cousin.

89
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,200
Cousin.

90
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,200
Give it to me.

91
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,200
Master Li Fengzi.

92
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200
Hello.

93
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,200
What's wrong with you?

94
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,200
You've been here for so long.

95
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,200
You're not hungry.

96
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,200
You're so lazy.

97
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,200
You've been walking all day.

98
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,200
You're sweating all night.

99
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,200
You're washing your clothes.

100
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,200
It's a bit of a man's taste.

101
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,200
That's why it's called a man.

102
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,200
It's a man's taste.

103
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,200
It's a man's taste.

104
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,200
It's a man's taste.

105
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,200
Miss Linqiao.

106
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,200
I know you've been working hard.

107
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,200
I've prepared chicken soup for you this morning.

108
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,200
Really?

109
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,200
I'm starving.

110
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,200
Hurry up.

111
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
You're so...

112
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,200
You're so lazy.

113
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,200
I know you must be tired.

114
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,200
I've prepared some dishes for you.

115
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,200
Qi.

116
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,200
I didn't expect you to be so good at reading.

117
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,200
You even have a room to clean.

118
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,200
Of course.

119
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,200
I'm a cousin.

120
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,200
I don't want to have a little mess

121
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,200
that only helps me to clean the floor.

122
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,200
I'm worried that

123
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,200
you can't find this place.

124
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,200
I woke up at midnight last night.

125
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,200
I was wrongly looking for this place.

126
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,200
I'm starving.

127
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,200
Wan'er.

128
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,200
You're leaving again?

129
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,200
Master Li is so funny.

130
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,200
Where's the old man you mentioned?

131
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,200
Master Liu.

132
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,200
Master Liu.

133
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,200
These are fresh wild vegetables.

134
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,200
I'll cook them for you.

135
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,200
Thank you.

136
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
This is Master Zhang.

137
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,200
Thank you for saving my life.

138
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,200
I'm so lucky.

139
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,200
Thank you, Master.

140
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,200
Master.

141
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,200
Please come in.

142
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,200
Master.

143
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,200
Don't say that.

144
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,200
We're here to help you.

145
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,200
Can you tell me where that Shandong is?

146
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,200
Master Zhang is so pitiful.

147
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,200
His granddaughter Xiaohui

148
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,200
was arrested by the snake demon two days ago.

149
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,200
She's been dead recently.

150
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,200
That's right.

151
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,200
The snake demon killed all the servants

152
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,200
on the mountain two days ago.

153
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,200
Even their hearts and lungs

154
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,200
were dug out to eat.

155
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,200
It's so scary.

156
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,200
How dare you!

157
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
I'm going to kill her

158
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,200
and kill her snake skin

159
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,200
to help me.

160
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,200
You're so stingy.

161
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,200
Don't be so stubborn.

162
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,200
You're going to die.

163
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,200
It's too cold.

164
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,200
Let's eat.

165
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,200
Let's eat.

166
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,200
You're so annoying.

167
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,200
Oh, right.

168
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,200
Don't be so jealous

169
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,200
when you run away from these people.

170
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,200
It's not good to run away.

171
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,200
I'm just a little bit more annoying.

172
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,200
Otherwise,

173
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,200
my little stomach

174
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,200
will run away.

175
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,200
I'm going to kill you.

176
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,200
Master Zhang,

177
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,200
don't be so stubborn.

178
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,200
I'm going to kill you.

179
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,200
Master Zhang.

180
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,200
Master Zhang.

181
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,200
Master Zhang.

182
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,200
Master Zhang.

183
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,200
You're talking to people.

184
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,200
Yes.

185
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,200
Good days are coming.

186
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,200
You're eating too much, sister.

187
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,200
You can also

188
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,200
eat my tail

189
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,200
like you did.

190
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,200
Yes.

191
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,200
Those disgusting humans

192
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,200
have taken your skin

193
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,200
to be beautiful clothes.

194
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,200
They took your clothes.

195
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,200
Those disgusting humans.

196
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,200
By then,

197
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,200
I can also go to the natural path.

198
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,200
I can go everywhere like you.

199
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,200
I can go out.

200
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,200
You're going to take me

201
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,200
to the restaurant

202
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,200
to watch the sunset and the play.

203
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,200
Okay.

204
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,200
I'll take you.

205
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,200
Eat.

206
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,200
Let me ask you.

207
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,200
Will you run away

208
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,200
with other men

209
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,200
after you become a human?

210
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,200
Of course.

211
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,200
Of course.

212
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
No.

213
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,200
Otherwise,

214
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,200
how can I marry them?

215
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,200
I'll make you a little fool.

216
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,200
Yes.

217
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,200
It's been 600 years.

218
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,200
After that,

219
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,200
when we become human,

220
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,200
we can be together for thousands of years.

221
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,200
Shi Jie pushed your right palm.

222
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,200
Master Li Geng, are you teaching me to train?

223
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,200
Shut up.

224
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,200
Follow me.

225
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,200
Push your left palm out.

226
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,200
Okay.

227
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,200
Now,

228
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,200
put your left hand

229
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,200
under your right hand.

230
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,200
Then,

231
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,200
put your left ear on.

232
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,200
Hurry up.

233
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,200
Okay.

234
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,200
Stand up.

235
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,200
Then,

236
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,200
lift your right leg.

237
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,200
Put your left leg on your knee.

238
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,200
Listen.

239
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,200
I can do this

240
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,200
for ten hours

241
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,200
if you do it with me.

242
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,200
Stand up.

243
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,200
Hurry up.

244
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,200
Master Li Geng, I understand.

245
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,200
What do you understand?

246
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,200
I know

247
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,200
you want me to train.

248
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,200
It's because

249
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,200
you don't want me to be in danger

250
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,200
and to save people with you.

251
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,200
You can

252
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
take less burden.

253
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,200
I understand.

254
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,200
What do you mean?

255
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,200
Stand up.

256
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,200
I will.

257
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,200
When you come back,

258
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,200
I will definitely

259
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,200
stand up.

260
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,200
Okay.

261
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,200
I will come back.

262
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,200
So slow.

263
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,200
You said you want to save Ling'er.

264
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,200
Ling'er will wait for you,

265
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,200
but Snake Demon

266
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,200
won't wait for you.

267
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,200
You are

268
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,200
a snake demon.

269
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,200
You are a snake demon.

270
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,200
Unleash this.

271
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,200
Didn't I tell you earlier?

272
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,200
No one can

273
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,200
unleash this thing except my father.

274
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,200
You are so annoying.

275
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,200
No.

276
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,200
Just accept this fact.

277
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,200
You want to abandon me?

278
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,200
It's impossible.

279
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,200
What's wrong with you?

280
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,200
Stop talking, okay?

281
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,200
Why?

282
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,200
Ling'er is dead in your hands.

283
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,200
I beg you.

284
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,200
What's wrong with you?

285
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,200
We are going to the Dragon Cove.

286
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,200
You will clean the snake,

287
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,200
right?

288
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,200
Yes.

289
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,200
I didn't expect that.

290
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,200
This is common sense.

291
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,200
Do you understand?

292
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,200
I knew you don't understand.

293
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,200
It's cold and gloomy here.

294
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,200
I think it's going to be cold soon.

295
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,200
I didn't say it.

296
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,200
It's far away.

297
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,200
What?

298
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,200
You are going back?

299
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,200
You are not going to save Ling'er?

300
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,200
I am your father.

301
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,200
I won't go if you don't go back.

302
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,200
I told you to go.

303
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,200
Why do you take me away?

304
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,200
Don't be so stubborn.

305
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,200
I am not joking with you.

306
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,200
Who is joking with you?

307
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,200
Do you know what we will encounter?

308
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,200
What?

309
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,200
What do you mean?

310
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,200
We are different from what we usually encounter.

311
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,200
You might die.

312
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,200
Ling'er is just a bastard.

313
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,200
You are still so stubborn.

314
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,200
I told you

315
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,200
that life and death are equal.

316
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,200
I have nothing to do with you.

317
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,200
You are more like a family.

318
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,200
What do you mean?

319
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,200
I mean

320
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,200
we are not related to you.

321
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,200
You don't have to risk your life.

322
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,200
You have nothing to do with me.

323
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,200
You are so stubborn.

324
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,200
What do you know?

325
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,200
I know.

326
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,200
You don't know.

327
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,200
I don't mind.

328
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,200
But I know her.

329
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,200
So you know her.

330
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,200
Ling'er has been a girl since she was a kid.

331
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,200
She is not a girl.

332
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,200
How did you know

333
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,200
that Miss Qianqian is a girl?

334
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,200
You know I don't understand.

335
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,200
Do you know me?

336
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,200
Do you know me?

337
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,200
I don't care about you.

338
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,200
Forget it.

339
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,200
I don't want to tell you.

340
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,200
Then we are not related.

341
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,200
You are the one who is so stubborn.

342
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,200
I don't care.

343
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,200
It's easy to know.

344
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,200
It's a saying.

345
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,200
You are so stubborn.

346
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,200
You are so stubborn.

347
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,200
I tell you.

348
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,200
I am not just a girl.

349
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,200
I will save her.

350
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,200
This is the rule of the martial arts world.

351
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,200
Do you understand?

352
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,200
You...

353
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,200
You know me?

354
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,200
Be careful.

355
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,200
There is a snake.

356
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,200
Yes.

357
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,200
It can kill people.

358
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,200
Be careful.

359
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,200
What's wrong with you?

360
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,200
What's wrong with you?

361
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,200
What kind of snake is this?

362
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,200
You can't be so careless.

363
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,200
This is the rule of the martial arts world.

364
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,200
Do you understand?

365
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,200
You...

366
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,200
Look.

367
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,200
I know you don't understand.

368
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,200
Go to hell.

369
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,200
If I die,

370
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,200
you won't live.

371
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,200
Do you think I will ruin your mood?

372
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,200
I have so many girlfriends.

373
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,200
If I die,

374
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,200
they will be like you.

375
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,200
You will be killed.

376
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,200
Don't move.

377
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,200
Be careful.

378
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,200
Look.

379
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,200
See?

380
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,200
You are making me a blind man.

381
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,200
What about here?

382
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,200
There is a snake.

383
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,200
It means it can't move.

384
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,200
And...

385
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,200
Go away.

386
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,200
What's wrong?

387
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,200
What's wrong?

388
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,200
What a big snake.

389
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,200
What snake?

390
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,200
Go away.

391
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,200
Go away.

392
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,200
Go away.

393
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,200
What's wrong?

394
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,200
It's a bell.

395
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,200
You are afraid of the snake.

396
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,200
It's troublesome.

397
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,200
That's all?

398
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,200
It's okay.

399
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,200
Go away.

400
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,200
Be careful.

401
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,200
Be careful of the snake.

402
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,200
Don't scare others anymore.

403
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,200
It's so scary.

404
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,200
It's so scary.

405
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,200
It's so scary.

406
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,200
What's wrong?

407
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,200
What's going on?

408
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,200
I can't see clearly.

409
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,200
What's wrong?

410
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,200
It's so scary.

411
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,200
What's wrong?

412
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,200
I know it's so scary.

413
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,200
Go to hell.

414
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,200
Why don't you talk?

415
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,200
Maybe it's serious for you.

416
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,200
It's a transfer.

417
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,200
What's wrong?

418
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,200
I'm going to die.

419
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,200
Stay away.

420
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,200
Why can't I see?

421
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,200
I'm lying.

422
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,200
What's wrong?

423
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,200
I'm scared.

424
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,200
Who's scared?

425
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,200
Okay.

426
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,200
I'll go with you.

427
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,200
What?

428
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,200
Why should I go with you?

429
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,200
You are so naughty.

430
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,200
What's wrong?

431
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,200
What's wrong?

432
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,200
What's wrong?

433
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,200
What's wrong?

434
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,200
What's wrong?

435
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,200
What's wrong?

436
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,200
What's wrong?

437
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,200
What's wrong?

438
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,200
Where's the firefly?

439
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,200
Who's scared?

440
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,200
What's this?

441
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,200
It's a long time ago.

442
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,200
I know.

443
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,200
It's so hard to get it.

444
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,200
Wait for me.

445
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,200
Wait for me.

446
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,200
Wait for me.

447
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,200
You dare to touch me.

448
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,200
What's wrong?

449
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,200
Are you sick?

450
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,200
I'm fine.

451
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,200
I'm fine.

452
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,200
You're sick.

453
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,200
I admire you.

454
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,200
You're so scary.

455
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,200
Do you want some red powder?

456
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,200
Are you okay?

457
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,200
Wait for me.

458
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,200
Wait for me.

459
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,200
What's wrong?

460
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,200
What's wrong?

461
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,200
You're not my problem.

462
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,200
It's not your problem.

463
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,200
You don't want to go on a date?

464
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,200
You don't want to go on a date?

465
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,200
What should we do?

466
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,200
Let's untie it.

467
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,200
Untie it?

468
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,200
Untie it.

469
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,200
Why did you do that?

470
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,200
I'm scared.

471
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,200
I saw a ghost.

472
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,200
Untie it yourself.

473
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,200
You...

474
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,200
You're annoying.

475
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,200
Why don't you ask me?

476
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,200
Why should I?

477
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,200
It's your fault.

478
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,200
What's wrong?

479
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,200
Let me go.

480
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,200
Hurry.

481
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,200
I found it.

482
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,200
I'm so happy.

483
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,200
I'm so happy.

484
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,200
I'm so happy.

485
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,200
I'm so happy.

486
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,200
Who said that?

487
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,200
It's you.

488
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,200
Get out of here.

489
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,200
I'm so happy.

490
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,200
I'm so happy.

491
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,200
He wants to be a beast.

492
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,200
You won't leave him.

493
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,200
This gentle monster.

494
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,200
How can you teach him?

495
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,200
How can you teach him?

496
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,200
This is a trap.

497
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,200
Let's get rid of him.

498
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,200
Let's get rid of him.

499
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,200
The human is so brave.

500
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,200
To satisfy himself.

501
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,200
He took all my beloved comrades

502
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,200
and killed them.

503
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,200
He needs them.

504
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,200
The ugly human.

505
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,200
He wants me to kill you all.

506
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,200
He wants to do something good for the world.

507
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,200
I'll kill him.

508
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,200
If I didn't kill him,

509
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,200
would you kill him?

510
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,200
That's because you're a poor man.

511
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,200
You can only play with the snake and the tail.

512
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,200
See?

513
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,200
Snake is standing in my way.

514
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,200
He's right.

515
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,200
You're a coward.

516
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,200
You're not talking about me.

517
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,200
You're the ugly man.

518
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,200
Ugly?

519
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,200
I'm not.

520
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,200
I'm not.

521
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,200
I'm not.

522
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,200
I'm not.

523
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,200
I'm not.

524
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,200
I'm not.

525
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,200
I'm not.

526
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,200
I'm not.

527
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,200
I'm not.

528
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,200
Ugly?

529
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,200
Why are you following me?

530
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,200
Are you hurt?

531
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,200
I'm hurt.

532
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,200
You're not listening to me?

533
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,200
The head is over there.

534
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,200
Tell me.

535
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,200
Let's go.

536
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,200
I'll catch you today.

537
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,200
What's this?

538
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,200
You...

539
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,200
You two are so mean.

540
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,200
How dare you kill my husband?

541
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,200
My lady.

542
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,200
I can't do this anymore.

543
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,200
I can't do this anymore.

544
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,200
I can't do this anymore.

545
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,200
I can't do this anymore.

546
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,200
I can't do this anymore.

547
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,200
I can't do this anymore.

548
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,200
I'm sorry.

549
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,200
It's okay.

550
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,200
I have my own way.

551
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,200
No.

552
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,200
You're going to pay for this.

553
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,200
I don't care.

554
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,200
I can't do this anymore.

555
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,200
I didn't expect that you can do this.

556
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,200
Yes.

557
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,200
I can't do this anymore.

558
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,200
I'll fix this for you.

559
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,200
It's temporary.

560
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,200
I'll do it.

561
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,200
What are you doing?

562
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,200
You know that

563
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,200
I'll do it if I'm lucky.

564
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,200
You don't understand me.

565
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,200
I'll do it.

566
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,200
You don't have to do it.

567
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,200
You little brat.

568
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,200
You're still not married.

569
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,200
I'll kill you.

570
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,200
I'll do it.

571
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,200
I'll do it.

572
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,200
I'll do it.

573
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,200
I'll do it.

574
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,200
I'll do it.

575
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,200
Thank you.

576
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,200
It's my pleasure.

577
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,200
You're welcome.

578
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,200
I'll do it.

579
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,200
I'll do it.

580
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,200
What?

581
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,200
Do you like this stuff the most?

582
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,200
You little brat.

583
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,200
Be careful.

584
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,200
Stop.

585
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,200
Lady.

586
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,200
Lady.

587
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,200
Lady.

588
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,200
Lady.

589
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,200
Lady.

590
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,200
Lady.

591
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,200
Lady.

592
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,200
Lady.

593
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,200
Let's go.

594
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,200
Yu Long.

595
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,200
No.

596
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,200
No.

597
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,200
No.

598
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,200
See you in the next life.

599
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,200
No.

600
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,200
No.

601
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,200
No.

602
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,200
Don't chase him.

603
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,200
He's not our opponent.

604
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,200
He's trying to protect Hu Yao.

605
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:10,200
I didn't expect him to be so affectionate.

606
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,200
Maybe he's right.

607
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,200
We're just self-sufficient.

608
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,200
You're the one.

609
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,200
I'm not like this.

610
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,200
You're the only one who's right.

611
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,200
What's the point?

612
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,200
The point of a woman.

613
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,200
When a man is not allowed to be with a woman,

614
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,200
that's the point.

615
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,200
Understand?

616
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,200
Help.

617
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,200
Help.

618
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,200
Help.

619
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,200
Ling'er.

620
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,200
No.

621
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,200
Don't eat me.

622
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,200
Help.

623
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,200
Don't eat me.

624
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,200
Ling'er.

625
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,200
Don't fight.

626
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,200
You can see clearly.

627
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,200
We're not the demons.

628
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,200
The demons are dead.

629
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,200
Really?

630
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,200
Sister, help us out.

631
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,200
They're all eaten by the demons.

632
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,200
Where's Ling'er?

633
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,200
Ling'er.

634
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,200
There's no one called Ling'er among us.

635
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,200
She's older than you.

636
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,200
She was caught two days ago.

637
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,200
The girl in the village was caught.

638
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,200
I don't know the Ling'er you're talking about.

639
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,200
By the way,

640
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,200
is there a girl named Zhang Xiao Hui among you?

641
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,200
I'm Zhang Xiao Hui.

642
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,200
You're Xiao Hui.

643
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,200
Your grandpa asked us to take you back.

644
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,200
Grandpa.

645
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,200
Sister, take me back to see grandpa.

646
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,200
Okay.

647
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,200
I want to see grandpa.

648
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,200
Come.

649
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,200
Where's Ling'er?

650
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,200
Come.

651
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,200
Where did she go?

652
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,200
Ling'er.

653
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,200
Where did she go?

654
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,200
I don't know.

655
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,200
I don't know where she went.

656
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,200
I don't know.

657
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,200
I saw Ling'er.

658
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,200
Ling'er?

659
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,200
Ling'er.

660
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,200
Ling'er.

661
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,200
Ling'er.

662
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,200
Ling'er.

663
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,200
Come.

664
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,200
Mom, I finally find the princess!

665
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,200
Don't come over. I'll scare you.

666
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:58,200
How could it be? You're Ling'er, the princess.

667
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,200
You're... I'm Anu.

668
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,200
You forgot?

669
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,200
It's you.

670
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,200
I was a good friend when I was a kid.

671
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,200
Now I'm a good friend.

672
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,200
I'm a little bit...

673
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,200
Anu!

674
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,200
Anu!

675
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,200
Princess!

676
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,200
Princess, I'm not scared of you like this.

677
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,200
You must have suffered a lot of grievances.

678
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,200
Princess must have suffered a lot of grievances.

679
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,200
It's okay.

680
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,200
If it wasn't for this tail, I wouldn't be sure that you're the princess.

681
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,200
I'm just your symbol. It's a symbol of a man's love.

682
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,200
Who am I?

683
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,200
You said I'm the princess.

684
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,200
Aunt Shan Shan said I'm the descendant of the female frog.

685
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,200
But grandma said I'm just a normal girl.

686
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,200
That's right. You're the princess and the descendant of the female frog.

687
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,200
You're also the descendant of the female frog.

688
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,200
So I'm not me.

689
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,200
But I am.

690
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,200
It doesn't matter.

691
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,200
You're an important person.

692
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,200
Your father...

693
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,200
Prince of Wuling.

694
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,200
And Uncle Bai Yu.

695
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,200
Many people have sent them to Central Plains to take you back to Nanzhao.

696
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,200
Anu is the best. Anu will find you first.

697
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,200
The people of Bai Yu.

698
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,200
They sent people to kill my grandma.

699
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,200
No way.

700
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,200
It's not them. It won't happen.

701
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,200
It's impossible.

702
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,200
Uncle Bai Yu is a good person.

703
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,200
And he loves to be with him all over the country.

704
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,200
He likes to steal stories.

705
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,200
But he only helps people.

706
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,200
He won't kill people.

707
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,200
Really?

708
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:16,200
I think there must be someone who takes Bai Yu's name.

709
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,200
Or it's the evil world.

710
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,200
It's okay. After we get back to Nanzhao,

711
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,200
Uncle Bai Yu will help us to return to the palace.

712
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,200
No matter what, we must help grandma to return to the palace.

713
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,200
Yes. Let's go back.

714
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,200
Where's Prince of Fu?

715
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,200
You even know I'm a relative.

716
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,200
You have a little baby, right?

717
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,200
When did your fairy book become so powerful?

718
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,200
No. Master Sheng said it.

719
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:47,200
He said when your mother was pregnant and the first time she showed her tail,

720
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,200
she said she was pregnant.

721
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,200
He said that the pregnant woman changed the nature of the motherland.

722
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,200
I understand.

723
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,200
Where's she?

724
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,200
She's not here.

725
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,200
Where did she go?

726
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,200
Actually, I ran out of the house.

727
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,200
Why?

728
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:10,200
Because I was afraid that she would be scared to death when she saw me like this.

729
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,200
You're so stupid. I'm not afraid of her.

730
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,200
You really think so?

731
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,200
Yes.

732
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:20,200
She won't hate me because of this?

733
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,200
If it's true, then don't love her.

734
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,200
Let's go to the horse farm together.

735
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,200
She's already so anxious to see you leave like this.

736
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,200
It's true.

737
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,200
I just think of myself.

738
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,200
Really?

739
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,200
Yes.

740
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,200
I can understand.

741
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,200
She must be happy to see you.

742
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,200
Really?

743
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,200
Princess, what should we do next?

744
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,200
Let's go to the mountain.

745
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,200
I don't want to scare others anymore.

746
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,200
No problem.

747
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,200
Don't move.

748
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,200
I'm hungry.

749
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,200
What's wrong?

750
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,200
You take her back first.

751
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,200
You want to make fun of me?

752
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,200
No, I want to pull the rope.

753
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,200
You want me to pull the pants?

754
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,200
Don't be so rude.

755
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,200
Come on.

756
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,200
All right.

757
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,200
Master Li, you're back.

758
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,200
Are you with Princess Yue?

759
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,200
Did you find Miss Zhao?

760
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,200
That woman is so thick.

761
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,200
Why is she here?

762
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,200
But I don't know where she is.

763
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,200
Don't worry.

764
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,200
Miss Zhao is so stubborn.

765
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:10,200
She can't even do evil to her.

766
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,200
It seems that she's very educated.

767
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,200
It's useful.

768
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,200
Master Li, give me some advice.

769
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,200
I saw it.

770
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,200
I can't stand it.

771
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,200
I'm sorry.

772
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,200
Forget it.

773
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,200
You're so kind.

774
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,200
You're qualified.

775
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,200
Thank you, Master Li.

776
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,200
To reward you,

777
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,200
I'll treat you to roast lamb.

778
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,200
How is it?

779
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,200
Good.

780
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,200
But you have to treat me to a drink.

781
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,200
I want to drink the lotus root.

782
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,200
All right.

783
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:47,200
Girl, come and give me some warm greetings.

784
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,200
I wish you a long life.

785
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,200
We're so lucky.

786
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,200
It's so hard to forget.

787
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,200
Get up.

788
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,200
You're old.

789
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,200
You're old.

790
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,200
You're not old anymore.

791
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,200
I'm telling you.

792
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,200
I've always been a good teacher.

793
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,200
Good teacher?

794
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,200
Don't forget.

795
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,200
I didn't mean to say that.

796
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,200
Of course I know.

797
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,200
I'm just trying to find something better.

798
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,200
Uncle Zhang, this place is dangerous.

799
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,200
You're safe too.

800
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,200
Yes.

801
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,200
Master Li, it's late.

802
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,200
Let's get up.

803
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,200
That's right.

804
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,200
It's time to leave.

805
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,200
We'll be back.

806
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,200
Take care.

807
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,200
Take care.

808
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,200
It's so lucky.

809
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,200
I said I'd find something better.

810
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,200
Take care.

811
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,200
Take care.

812
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,200
Take care.

813
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,200
Grandpa, let's go back.

814
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,200
I'll report to the chief.

815
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,200
Yulu, let me carry you.

816
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,200
What?

817
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,200
You're so hard to carry.

818
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,200
You're so hard to carry.

819
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,200
You can't carry anything.

820
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,200
You can't carry a bunch of dirty dirty things.

821
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,200
You're annoying.

822
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,200
Yuzhu, cousin.

823
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,200
Are you talking about me?

824
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,200
You're a dirty thing.

825
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,200
You're listening to me.

826
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,200
Don't shout every time.

827
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,200
What?

828
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,200
Shout to the snow.

829
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,200
Master Li, it's not snow.

830
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,200
It's blood.

831
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,200
And, Yuzhu, cousin.

832
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,200
Don't blame Master Li.

833
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,200
What's wrong with you?

834
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,200
Don't blame my disciple.

835
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,200
Who do you think you are?

836
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,200
You're just a little bastard.

837
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,200
Let me tell you.

838
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,200
I'm not bad.

839
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,200
You always make me feel sorry for you.

840
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,200
What are you talking about?

841
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,200
Did I do something wrong?

842
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,200
You're my subordinate.

843
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,200
I'll fight you now.

844
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,200
I'll beat you to death.

845
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,200
You've beaten me up?

846
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,200
You're so annoying.

847
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,200
You bastard.

848
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,200
Don't run away.

849
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,200
Come back.

850
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,200
Come back.

851
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,200
Lu Bermay.

852
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,200
Lu Bermay.

853
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,200
This way.

854
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,200
Let's go.

855
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,200
What?

856
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,200
Come back.

857
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,200
Come back.

858
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:57,200
Let's go.

859
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,200
Let's go.

860
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,200
Yuzhu, cousin.

861
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,820
I thought this through, you are still the best.

862
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:23,360
Were you eager for a pity?

863
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,680
Come in

864
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,640
Why?

865
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,780
Sit.

866
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:04,160
Do you feel tired?

867
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,900
I'm not.

868
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,020
I've always been sort to you.

869
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,920
Will you blame me?

870
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,420
Yes, I understand.

871
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:17,320
Do you like me?

872
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,600
Yes.

873
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,560
I like you.

874
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,120
I've always liked you.

875
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,480
Actually,

876
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,160
I've always liked you.

877
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:33,160
But...

878
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,280
I don't know how to express my love to you.

879
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,400
Will you forgive me?

880
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,400
Are you crazy?

881
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,640
You brought so many things.

882
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,600
You brought all the things.

883
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,220
Does she have a golf course?

884
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,580
Princess,

885
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:54,900
this is pretty.

886
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:00,960
She sent me a gift.

887
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,340
I must send it back at that night.

888
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:08,180
Then you might never get it with your little brother.

889
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:14,060
I'll send it back maybe in two weeks.

890
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,280
Which trip to updates?

891
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,280
Well...

892
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,180
Don't tell me.

893
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:19,440
I won't.

894
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,600
This is the one I stole last time.

895
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,600
This man is so good at drawing.

896
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,600
Why is he using the back of his back?

897
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,600
He's worse than my foot.

898
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,600
He's eating.

899
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:46,600
Chow Dan.

900
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,600
Why are you coming back?

901
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:52,600
I need to get some water.

902
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,600
You're stealing my stuff.

903
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,600
Go to hell.

904
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,600
My little uncle.

905
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,600
I'll kill you now.

906
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:09,600
Help.

907
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:10,600
I...

908
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,600
I'm a bag.

909
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:16,600
I can use it to get a bottle.

910
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,600
What's that?

911
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,600
What's that?

912
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,600
Little uncle.

913
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:20,600
What little uncle?

914
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,600
That's my dad.

915
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,600
I can't sleep without him.

916
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,600
Little uncle.

917
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:25,600
You're so ugly.

918
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,600
You're like a water.

919
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,600
Go to hell.

920
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,600
Little uncle.

921
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,600
Come and save me.

922
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,600
Little uncle.

923
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,600
I'll kill you.

924
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,600
I'll kill you.

925
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:41,600
Little uncle.

926
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,600
You're so stupid.

927
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:50,600
Let go of me.

928
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,600
What?

929
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,600
Uncle Yue.

930
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:10,600
Uncle Yue.

931
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:40,600
Uncle Yue.
