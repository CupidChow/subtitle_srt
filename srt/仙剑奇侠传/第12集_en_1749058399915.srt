1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not afraid of you.

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Stop!

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Who's there?

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Excuse me, I got injured.

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I have a wound. I want to see a doctor.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Get out!

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
There are wounds.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You are bitten by Jiangshi.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I am not.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The doctor is not here.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
This is too much.

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What is this?

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Let's go.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
A'bao, he may be bitten by Jiangshi.

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Don't be too close to them.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Jiangshi?

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Let's go.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Let me see.

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Let's go.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Don't worry.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This man's wound is not bitten by Jiangshi.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Come with me.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Okay.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Brother, we need a doctor.

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
My master is the best doctor in this village.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Really?

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Thank you.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Okay, let's go.

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Let's go.

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Grandpa.

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Meng Si, how is he today?

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
He is dreaming again.

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
He seems to be calling someone.

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Meng Si, take the water to the room.

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
He will be fine in a day.

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Then he will be fine in five days.

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Isn't this the medicine for the fetus?

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
He is pregnant.

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
He is weak.

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We must take care of him and the baby.

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Be careful.

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Let's go in.

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Let's go.

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Come in.

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Are you scared?

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It looks like you.

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Are you scared?

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yes, I am.

63
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You are afraid of being infected?

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You are even bitten by the animals.

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Now you meet a female Jiangshi.

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You are not obedient to your own neck.

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Then you become a silver-dead Jiangshi.

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Are you afraid?

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
He is from Black Water Town.

70
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
He is bitten by Jiangshi.

71
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
He is too late.

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
He is like this.

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
A'bao, you are back.

74
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Meng Si.

75
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Miss, my name is Li Xiaoyao.

76
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I am the one who is called the best in the world.

77
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
He is not good in the world.

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
He is the best in the world.

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Are you hurt?

80
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It is a revenge for Jiangshi.

81
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What is it for?

82
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
He is a bad guy.

83
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Does it hurt?

84
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yes.

85
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
If there is a good girl now,

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
you can help me sit down.

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I will do it.

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I said she is a pretty girl.

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's none of your business.

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
A'bao, you are the one who is a good person.

91
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Miss, it's not you.

92
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I am not worried about her.

93
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I will get the medicine for you.

94
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Miss, it's not a big deal.

95
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Will you die?

96
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
No, I will not.

97
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I will be fine soon.

98
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's good that you are here.

99
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Miss, how can Black Water Town leave?

100
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Miss Li, you are going?

101
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Don't go.

102
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Why?

103
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Because there is a dead city.

104
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
There is only Jiangshi.

105
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Isn't that interesting?

106
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's dangerous.

107
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You can go with her.

108
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
She is a good girl.

109
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I am here.

110
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
She is safe.

111
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
No, you can't go.

112
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Listen, my friend is there.

113
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I am not going.

114
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's not interesting.

115
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
No one can go to Black Water Town.

116
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Li.

117
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You are the doctor.

118
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You are fine.

119
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You can continue.

120
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I am going to your friend.

121
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
My friend is in Black Water Town.

122
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
He is in Black Water Town.

123
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I can't help him.

124
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
What doctor?

125
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Isn't he dying?

126
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I said no.

127
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Li.

128
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You two,

129
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
you don't know that

130
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Black Water Town is very popular.

131
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
But it's like this.

132
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You are two people.

133
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Uncle, I don't believe that

134
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
no one will help us.

135
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Who dares?

136
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You are the boss.

137
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
This is my rule.

138
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I am going to ask your village head

139
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
if you are full of food.

140
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What kind of rule?

141
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I am the village head.

142
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You are the village head?

143
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
He...

144
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I am not eating now.

145
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
My head is very cold.

146
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Enough.

147
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Don't talk to him.

148
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I am going to talk to you.

149
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's all about the guests.

150
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I don't believe that you can't kill them.

151
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Okay, I am going.

152
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Aunt.

153
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Aunt Hong.

154
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What?

155
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Who is the daughter of the cow?

156
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Aunt Hong.

157
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
What is that sound?

158
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Two days ago,

159
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
we met a girl in the village.

160
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
She called the auntie

161
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
during the wedding period.

162
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Is it...

163
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Aunt Hong.

164
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Aunt Hong.

165
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Aunt Hong.

166
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Ling'er.

167
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Ling'er.

168
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Ling'er.

169
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Aunt Hong.

170
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Ling'er.

171
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Who is the girl?

172
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Ling'er.

173
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Ling'er.

174
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Ling'er.

175
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I won't let you leave me again.

176
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
We won't be apart.

177
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Ling'er.

178
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Sorry, Ling'er.

179
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I am so happy.

180
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Ling'er, where have you been?

181
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
We thought you were caught by the monster.

182
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Yes.

183
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
We found you so hard.

184
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
We almost killed the monster.

185
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And...

186
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I am sorry.

187
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You are the one who is following us.

188
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
What are you complaining about?

189
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Ling'er, don't blame her.

190
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
How can you say that?

191
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I owe you a lot of love.

192
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Okay.

193
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I don't need to pay you back.

194
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
As for her,

195
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I will thank her for you.

196
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Who is she?

197
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Why do you represent her?

198
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You...

199
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You are right.

200
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I should say everything myself.

201
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I shouldn't let Brother Yao say it.

202
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
After all,

203
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I am me.

204
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Is she her?

205
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Ling'er,

206
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
don't we have to be so close?

207
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
We are just friends.

208
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Brother Yao is just a little girl.

209
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
He wants to save me.

210
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
What's wrong with you?

211
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Why are you so upset?

212
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Ling'er,

213
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
are you not feeling well?

214
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So you are not feeling well?

215
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Dr. Han,

216
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Ling'er,

217
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
what's wrong with her?

218
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
She...

219
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Nothing.

220
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
She was lost for too long.

221
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
She was not well.

222
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
She is weak.

223
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Luckily, she was saved by Dr. Han.

224
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
That's all.

225
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You three,

226
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
you can talk.

227
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I need to see the patient.

228
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Please go out.

229
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Did you hear that?

230
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Don't talk about love.

231
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Get out of here.

232
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
No.

233
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I am asking Brother Yao to go out with you.

234
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Me?

235
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I have something to tell Miss Ling.

236
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I...

237
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I can't hear you.

238
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Sorry.

239
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Did you hear that?

240
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Don't talk about love here.

241
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Get out of here.

242
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Let me tell you.

243
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
If you dare to bully Ling'er,

244
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I will kill you.

245
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You...

246
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You are growing up.

247
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You are fast.

248
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I am scared.

249
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Ling'er,

250
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I am standing outside.

251
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You can call me if you need anything.

252
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I...

253
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I...

254
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
What do you want to say?

255
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
If you really like Brother Yao,

256
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I will go out.

257
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
What?

258
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
But you must have a condition.

259
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You must love him for life.

260
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Don't leave him.

261
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Don't make him sad.

262
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Are you sick?

263
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I am fine.

264
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I am fine.

265
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Then,

266
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I should be happy

267
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
for what you said.

268
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
But I don't think so.

269
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You always like Brother Yao.

270
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
That's another thing.

271
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
What's wrong with you?

272
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
What happened?

273
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Actually,

274
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I always think

275
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
you are more compatible with Brother Yao.

276
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I don't want to talk about it.

277
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Go to bed.

278
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And,

279
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
you should cover your quilt more.

280
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I don't think

281
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
what you said.

282
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Don't think too much.

283
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I should say everything myself.

284
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Brother Yao should take me with him.

285
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
After all,

286
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I am me.

287
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Is he him?

288
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
We are just like water.

289
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
We just want Brother Yao to be with you.

290
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Then,

291
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
we can save my girl.

292
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Chou Dan.

293
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Chou Dan.

294
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Chou Dan.

295
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Chou Dan.

296
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Chou Dan.

297
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Chou Dan.

298
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Chou Dan.

299
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Don't be so stubborn.

300
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Come out if you have the guts.

301
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Brother Yao.

302
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Brother Yao.

303
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Why are you running out?

304
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I found him to love you.

305
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
You are the same type of person.

306
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
You are the same type of person.

307
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
How is it?

308
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I said I have a way.

309
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You are so stubborn.

310
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
What did Ling'er tell you?

311
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I won't tell you.

312
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Let's think of a way to bring him back.

313
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Chou Sanba.

314
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Han Yixian.

315
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
How is it?

316
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Am I good?

317
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Didn't he die in the wet for a few days?

318
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
He was just buried.

319
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Did he die in the wet for a few days?

320
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You mean

321
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
he was kicked out of the grave?

322
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I thought he was unfilial to the dead.

323
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I thought he would be fine as long as he was buried.

324
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Why now?

325
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
He is a heartless man.

326
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
He can't even avoid death.

327
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
What kind of medicine is this?

328
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Don't move.

329
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Don't move.

330
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Don't move.

331
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It's fun to play with.

332
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You...

333
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It's hard to beat the soldiers.

334
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
But once they can't smell the alive smell,

335
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
they won't move.

336
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Did you hear that?

337
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Is there any way to cure them?

338
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I only know how to use medicine.

339
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I only know how to use medicine.

340
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
As for becoming a soldier,

341
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I...

342
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Actually,

343
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
they don't know how to become soldiers

344
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
as long as they are cured.

345
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I think

346
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
you two

347
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
have no other way than us.

348
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
How many did you bury?

349
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Three.

350
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Ling'er,

351
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
you just recovered.

352
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Just take a rest.

353
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Leave this to me and his family.

354
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I'll go to the hospital.

355
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I'll go to the hospital.

356
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'll go to the hospital.

357
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I'll go to the hospital.

358
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I'll go to the hospital.

359
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'll go to the hospital.

360
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I'll go to the hospital.

361
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I'll go to the hospital.

362
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I'll go to the hospital.

363
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I'll go to the hospital.

364
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I'll go to the hospital.

365
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I'll go to the hospital.

366
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I'll go to the hospital.

367
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I'll go to the hospital.

368
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I'll go to the hospital.

369
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I'll go to the hospital.

370
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I'll go to the hospital.

371
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I'll go to the hospital.

372
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'll go to the hospital.

373
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I'll go to the hospital.

374
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I'll go to the hospital.

375
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I'll go to the hospital.

376
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I'll go to the hospital.

377
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I'll go to the hospital.

378
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I'll go to the hospital.

379
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I'll go to the hospital.

380
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I'll go to the hospital.

381
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
The herbs are really useful.

382
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Okay, I'll go to the washroom.

383
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Drink these herbs.

384
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Come on, give me your hand.

385
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Be careful.

386
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I'm telling you, don't think...

387
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
What do you think?

388
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Do you think you've learned medicine?

389
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
No, I haven't.

390
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Do you need to learn it?

391
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Miss Meng Si, how do I look?

392
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Actually, I want you to teach me.

393
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
But I don't have time now.

394
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Wait for me.

395
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I'll find the supplementary doctor.

396
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Wait for me.

397
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
The supplementary doctor?

398
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Yes.

399
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Who is it?

400
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm so tired.

401
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Look at your face.

402
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
You know you can't find anything.

403
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Yes, it's red.

404
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Even nothing is white.

405
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
What should I do?

406
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I know how to do it.

407
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
But I can't tell you.

408
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I can't let you break it.

409
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Hey, I'm so despicable.

410
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
You just need to take care of yourself.

411
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'm not afraid of you.

412
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
You just need to take care of yourself.

413
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Red?

414
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
What is it?

415
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
What are you doing?

416
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
You want to eat my tofu?

417
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I know.

418
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Pink supplementary doctor.

419
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I'm telling you.

420
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Don't tell me.

421
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I want to surprise her.

422
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It's not necessary to care about one person.

423
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
What's your problem?

424
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Don't you think Ling'er is weird recently?

425
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
You're weird.

426
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I'm serious.

427
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
You didn't ask her

428
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
what happened to us

429
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
after we separated for so long?

430
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
She didn't tell me anything.

431
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
What did she tell you that day?

432
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Nothing.

433
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Just tell me.

434
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Listen.

435
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
She told you to give her up.

436
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
What?

437
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
She told you to fall in love with someone else.

438
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Who?

439
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I forgot.

440
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
What's going on?

441
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
What's going on?

442
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Maybe Ling'er is talking to you.

443
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
You know she's

444
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
a little bit heartless.

445
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Maybe she's ill.

446
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And you should be patient

447
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
when you ask her.

448
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
She doesn't like me.

449
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
She's always nagging me.

450
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
She should tell you.

451
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Why are you looking at me like that?

452
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I have food on my face.

453
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Yuzhu, thank you.

454
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Why are you taking me here?

455
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Wait here.

456
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I'll be right back.

457
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
So mysterious.

458
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:29,460
Red

459
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Are you happy

460
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
when you see Ling'er?

461
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
What else?

462
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
What's wrong?

463
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
You're so ugly.

464
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Good.

465
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
It's so beautiful today.

466
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I'll go to see Ling'er.

467
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Ling'er

468
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Let's go.

469
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Ling'er, I'm not lying.

470
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
You're really thinking about something.

471
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Brother Xiaoyao, Ling'er is not feeling well.

472
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
He wants to rest.

473
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Listen to me.

474
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
You'll feel better

475
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
when you see him.

476
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Come on.

477
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Let's go.

478
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Ling'er, wait for me.

479
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Close your eyes.

480
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Don't peek.

481
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Ling'er

482
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Ling'er

483
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Ling'er

484
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Feng Lanyan

485
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Feng Lanyan

486
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Ling'er, please don't come again.

487
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Ling'er

488
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
What are you doing here?

489
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Go and blow Ling'er.

490
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I'm asking you to learn to blow the cow's face.

491
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Who? Go.

492
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Do you like it?

493
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Ling'er

494
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Ling'er

495
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
How was it?

496
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
You seem not happy.

497
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Actually, I don't sound like Pu Gongying.

498
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I can't help it.

499
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Do you know that

500
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
you can't even find

501
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
the hair of Pu Gongying

502
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
But it's okay.

503
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
We'll find it in the future.

504
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Right?

505
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
No.

506
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
In this world,

507
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
there's no red Pu Gongying.

508
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Why?

509
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Because it's just a memory of my childhood.

510
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Maybe I can't tell myself.

511
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Is it real or fake?

512
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
It's real.

513
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Anyway,

514
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
everything is far away.

515
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I won't come back.

516
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Okay.

517
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Come on.

518
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
After you're well,

519
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I'll go with you.

520
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
You can find it.

521
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I don't want anything now.

522
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I just want to go back to Nanzhao.

523
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Okay.

524
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I'll go with you.

525
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
No need.

526
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Why?

527
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Because you have what you want to do.

528
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I can go back by myself.

529
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
What are you talking about?

530
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I promised your wife

531
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
that I'll go with you to Nanzhao.

532
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I don't understand.

533
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Actually, we're different.

534
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
How could it be?

535
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
You want to fight and want to be a demon.

536
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
It's different from my idea.

537
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Lei Er.

538
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Actually,

539
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I've always been a demon.

540
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I've always been a demon.

541
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Actually,

542
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I've always wanted to ask you.

543
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
What's wrong with you these days?

544
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Why are you different from before?

545
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Did someone bully you?

546
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Actually, nothing.

547
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I know myself better

548
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
than before.

549
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
But I'm not sure.

550
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Actually, it's easy.

551
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
If I don't say it,

552
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
what will you think?

553
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
What do you mean?

554
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
You're not your wife.

555
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Maybe

556
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
many people's facial expressions

557
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
are different from yours.

558
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
That's a lot.

559
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Many people say I'm like that.

560
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Besides you,

561
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
there's another person like that.

562
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Miss Lin,

563
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I think

564
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
you're the one on the road.

565
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Me and her?

566
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
You seem to be

567
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
not concerned about anything

568
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
on your facial expressions.

569
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
You're concerned about

570
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
the person who doesn't care about you.

571
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
And she?

572
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
She seems to be

573
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
a woman with a hidden personality.

574
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Actually,

575
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
you two are kinder than anyone else.

576
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
You're more upright

577
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
and care about others than anyone else.

578
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
So I think

579
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
you two should be the same.

580
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Then,

581
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
what about Ling'er?

582
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
She...

583
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Maybe

584
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
she's like a red-colored

585
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
cryo.

586
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
It's just a fantasy.

587
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
A memory.

588
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Actually,

589
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
she's never existed.

590
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I'm sorry.

591
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I'm sorry.

592
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I'm sorry.

593
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I'm sorry.

594
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I'm sorry.

595
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
He must be very happy now.

596
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
What?

597
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
He saw the red-colored cryo.

598
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Maybe you're right.

599
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
He didn't want those.

600
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
That's not what I meant.

601
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
When I saw those red-colored cryo,

602
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I knew it was fake.

603
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
But...

604
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I was very touched.

605
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I really don't know

606
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
what you women are thinking about.

607
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
What's wrong with him?

608
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
He told me

609
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
he had forgotten about her.

610
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
He said he had a boyfriend.

611
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
And...

612
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
What else?

613
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
He said

614
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,000
you're very nice.

615
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
He said

616
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
he wanted me to be with you.

617
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Don't talk to him.

618
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
He's too silly.

619
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Of course.

620
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I know that.

621
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
But...

622
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Let's talk about it.

623
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
He said something wrong.

624
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
He said it was reasonable.

625
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
What did he say?

626
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
He said

627
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,000
you look

628
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
very rude

629
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
and very innocent.

630
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
You're the kind of person

631
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
who doesn't know

632
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
how hard it is to be a big girl.

633
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
But

634
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
he's kind-hearted

635
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
and very political.

636
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
He's very concerned about people.

637
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
He's the best girl

638
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
he's ever met.

639
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Don't be too selfish.

640
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I grew up on the island.

641
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I've never met anyone.

642
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
That's why I said that.

643
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Am I a bad guy?

644
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
No.

645
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,000
In my heart,

646
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
you're

647
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
a good girl.

648
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
You're a good girl.

649
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
You!

650
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
You're very nice.

651
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Be careful.

652
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Not everyone

653
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
will see you

654
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
and see you in the mirror.

655
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Ha ha ha ha.

656
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Ha ha ha ha.

657
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Hey, what are you thinking about?

658
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
What's wrong?

659
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
What's wrong with you and Ling'er?

660
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Why are you so sisters now?

661
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I'm not telling you.

662
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Don't worry about girls.

663
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Is it because of me?

664
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Stop acting like a fool.

665
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Get out of here.

666
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Hey,

667
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
don't act like a fool.

668
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Don't act like a fool.

669
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Hey dude,

670
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
wait.

671
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
He's here.

672
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Wait me!

673
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
What are you guys doing here?

674
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Let me alone.

675
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,000
What are you doing here?

676
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Give me a break!

677
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
What are you doing here?

678
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,360
Guys, this is the end.

679
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,400
Whether my boss, I trim my beard

680
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,120
whether it's good news

681
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,360
or bad news

682
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
those ¿y lots of people

683
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,080
don't keep me no sense

684
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,480
Professional skills

685
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,560
Children's story

686
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,720
we are too達

687
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,160
Catch off.

688
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,520
W大的 potato,收錢贈意煮

689
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,720
Run!

690
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,720
So Jiang Chi is a tiger.

691
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,720
Why don't you come here?

692
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,720
It's hard to have such a smart man.

693
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,720
You've got me.

694
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,720
You'll die if you step on me.

695
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,720
It's...

696
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,720
It's me, Jiang !

697
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,720
You are the upper- amazon.

698
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:51,720
Me, too.

699
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,720
What ?

700
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,720
I'm going to fix it.

701
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:39,720
Ling'er, you can't be disturbed by the outside force.

702
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:44,720
Xiangguo!

703
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,720
Ling'er!

704
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,720
Xiangguo!

705
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,720
Ling'er, are you alright?

706
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:55,720
I've already taken the poison in her body. She's fine now.

707
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:57,720
You're just in a good condition.

708
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,720
How can you try to save her?

709
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,720
What if she gets hurt?

710
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,720
She's all out of the poison.

711
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,720
Xiangguo, how are you?

712
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,720
Xiangguo, how are you?

713
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,720
What's wrong?

714
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,720
Why am I here?

715
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,720
Xiangguo, you went to the mountain to cut the wood.

716
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:16,720
You got hurt by the soldiers.

717
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,720
I brought you to the imperial doctor.

718
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:22,720
This girl saved us.

719
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,720
We should thank her.

720
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,720
Thank you, Xiangguo.

721
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,720
Thank you, Xiangguo.

722
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,720
Thank you, Xiangguo.

723
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:32,720
Stop fighting.

724
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,720
Stop fighting.

725
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,720
She's not a Bodhisattva.

726
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,720
She's not a doctor either.

727
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,720
Didn't you see how weak she is?

728
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,720
She can't be a doctor now.

729
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:44,720
Thank you, uncle.

730
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,720
Everyone, calm down.

731
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:47,720
Calm down.

732
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,720
Miss Zhao is ill.

733
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,720
She needs to rest.

734
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,720
You wait here quietly.

735
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,720
I'll arrange it.

736
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:56,720
I'll arrange it.

737
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,720
Don't worry.

738
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,720
Miss Li, Miss Lin.

739
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,720
Go back to your room and rest.

740
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,720
Let's go.

741
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:06,720
Miss Zhao, how do you feel?

742
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:07,720
I'll sell it to you.

743
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,720
Luckily, nothing happened.

744
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,720
Are you feeling unwell?

745
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:29,720
No.

746
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:30,720
I'm fine.

747
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:33,720
How are the soldiers?

748
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,720
The people in the town know that Miss Lin

749
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,720
can cure the people who have been poisoned by the Jiangs.

750
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,720
Now they're all in the hall.

751
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,720
Miss Lin can save them.

752
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,720
I'll go out and help them.

753
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,720
Mengzi, please tell them.

754
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,720
Please forgive them.

755
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,720
Why should I apologize?

756
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:52,720
If it's not for you,

757
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,720
they won't have any hope.

758
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,720
Jiangxin is a heartless person.

759
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,720
They shouldn't worry about it.

760
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:01,720
Fine.

761
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,720
There's no way to save the villagers.

762
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,720
Why didn't you tell them earlier?

763
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,720
This is impossible.

764
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,720
The master of the Yufo Temple in the mountain,

765
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,720
Master Zhixiu,

766
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,720
he used to cure Jiang Shi Dong

767
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:16,720
for my fiancee, Shaoyun.

768
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,720
Why didn't you ask him to come down?

769
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,720
No one can do that.

770
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:21,720
If he doesn't come down,

771
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,720
we can tie him down.

772
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,720
I once asked someone to come down.

773
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,720
But no one came back.

774
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:31,720
Is that so?

775
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:33,720
Did they all become monks?

776
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,720
Yes, that's right.

777
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,720
Mengzi and Shaoyun have been engaged for a long time.

778
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,720
They've been poisoned by the Jiangs.

779
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,720
Their family has been poisoned by Jiang.

780
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,720
Fortunately, they've been cured.

781
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:50,720
What happened?

782
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,720
Shaoyun and his brothers

783
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,720
became monks at home.

784
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,720
They never came back.

785
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,720
Master Zhixiu is so capable.

786
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:02,720
He can make everyone in the mountain a monk.

787
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:06,720
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

788
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,720
I can't figure it out.

789
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:09,720
Fine.

790
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:10,720
I'll go to Yufo Temple.

791
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,720
When will the truth be revealed?

792
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,720
Okay.

793
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:15,720
I'll go with you.

794
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:21,720
I'll go with you.

795
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,720
Don't say anything.

796
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:24,720
Don't say anything.

797
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,720
I don't want to be alone.

798
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:34,720
At least I still have a beautiful dream.

799
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,720
Don't say anything.

800
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,720
Don't say anything.

801
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,720
I really don't want to be alone.

802
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:46,720
I just understand that I have to give up.

803
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:53,720
I really don't want to be alone.

804
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:56,720
I really don't want to be alone.

805
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,720
I really don't want to be alone.

806
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,720
I really don't want to be alone.

807
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,720
I really don't want to be alone.

808
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:06,720
I really don't want to be alone.

809
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,720
I really don't want to be alone.

810
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,720
I really don't want to be alone.

811
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:13,720
I really don't want to be alone.

812
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,720
I really don't want to be alone.

813
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,720
I really don't want to be alone.

814
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,720
I really don't want to be alone.
