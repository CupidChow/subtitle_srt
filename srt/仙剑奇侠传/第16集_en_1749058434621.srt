1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not afraid of you.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not afraid of you.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm not afraid of you.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not afraid of you.

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Go away.

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Go away.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Go away.

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Go away.

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Go away.

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Li Xiaoyao.

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Stop.

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You shameless, shameless, shameless, shameless, coward.

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You're a fool or a blind?

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
That woman can be your mother.

29
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
My mother?

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What did you say?

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You're going to steal that old woman.

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Sorry.

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Ling'er.

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You're a fool.

35
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Mother.

36
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Mother.

37
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Mother.

38
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Mother.

39
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Brother Jing, why are you so angry?

40
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Come in.

41
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
No, I'll leave after I say a few words.

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
No, I'll leave after I say a few words.

43
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Fine, I'll stop.

44
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
How do you know what I want to say?

45
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I know what you're thinking.

46
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
How do you know what I'm thinking?

47
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Then say it.

48
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I look like your family.

49
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The first day I saw you,

50
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
your eyes were like my mother's.

51
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
How do you know?

52
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
In the past, my husband was like this.

53
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You're not a kid.

54
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You won't fall in love with someone like me.

55
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
But you're pretty.

56
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I believe your mother must be pretty.

57
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Actually,

58
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
after I was three,

59
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I've never seen my mother.

60
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Then how could you make others your mother?

61
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I didn't.

62
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's been more than ten years.

63
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
If I had a child,

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
she wouldn't be as small as you.

65
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Tell me what you want to say.

66
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Tell me what you want to say.

67
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Can you leave here?

68
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Why?

69
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
If you don't do it,

70
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
my friends will become bandits in Yangzhou.

71
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'll take you to the government

72
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
to get you out of the crime.

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I can't get you out of the crime.

74
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I know.

75
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You don't look like your mother.

76
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So let me go.

77
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'll go.

78
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Wait.

79
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You're a good boy.

80
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Thank you.

81
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'll wait for you at the police station.

82
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I can't take some things.

83
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I want you to help me keep them.

84
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
We won't meet again.

85
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You can't give me these things.

86
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'll take them as a gift.

87
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Okay.

88
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
But I won't take them if they're not money.

89
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Why are you sticking your head out?

90
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Why are you following me like a ghost?

91
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Are you hiding something from me?

92
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
None of your business.

93
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Ever since we met in the temple,

94
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
you haven't been this kind of man.

95
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I've been a man.

96
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I've been a man.

97
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I've been a man.

98
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You've never been this kind of man.

99
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Tell me.

100
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Which girl do you want to see?

101
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What's the matter?

102
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Are you so annoying?

103
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I told you I don't have any.

104
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You're lying to me.

105
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I saw you coming out of the house from the third year.

106
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You're a bad girl.

107
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You're a bad girl.

108
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You're a bad girl.

109
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You're a bad girl.

110
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Is there something you saw?

111
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yes.

112
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
What are you doing?

113
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Go down.

114
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I want to go too.

115
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Are you bored?

116
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'll die if I go down with you.

117
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
These must be the thief's evidence.

118
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,500
Man Fang.

119
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,500
This is what he left for me.

120
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,500
Hey, what are you looking at?

121
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,000
That stinky girl must be a thief.

122
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,700
Let's go.

123
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,500
What?

124
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,000
Go tell him.

125
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Come.

126
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,000
Maybe he has his own pain.

127
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,500
Brother, everything is in front of you.

128
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,500
What are you still thinking about?

129
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,500
I'm going to ask him.

130
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,500
No matter what, let's talk about it here.

131
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,500
Stop right there.

132
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,500
You thief, stop your nonsense.

133
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,500
Nonsense.

134
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,000
Hey, what are you doing?

135
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,500
Don't ask.

136
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,500
We were framed.

137
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,500
How dare you, you thief!

138
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,500
How dare you collude with the party?

139
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,500
You're making up a whole city in Yangzhou.

140
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,500
Why don't you tell me the truth?

141
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,500
I've never done it.

142
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,500
I'm guilty.

143
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You're a man.

144
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
How dare you?

145
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,500
Master Zhifu.

146
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,500
If there's a dog walking on the street,

147
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,000
you just passed by and stood there.

148
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,000
Could it be that you're just a master?

149
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You're a piece of cake.

150
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
How dare you!

151
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,500
How dare you insult me?

152
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,500
You said I'm a dog.

153
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,000
How dare you!

154
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Where's the man?

155
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,500
Pull him down.

156
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,000
He's a big man.

157
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
How dare you!

158
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,500
How dare you!

159
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,000
How dare you threaten me!

160
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,500
You're the best.

161
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,500
You're the best.

162
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,000
Is this a gift?

163
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Do you understand?

164
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
He'll know if he sees it.

165
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,000
What do you mean?

166
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,000
Master, let me ask you.

167
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,500
Who would be so stupid to run back to their own country

168
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,000
and wait for you to catch them?

169
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,500
It's obvious that they were framed.

170
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,500
That thief was obviously a woman

171
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,000
who lived in the streets of the city.

172
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
The third mother.

173
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,500
How dare you!

174
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,500
I've been in charge for ten years.

175
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,500
No, I've been in charge for ten years.

176
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,000
I've never been wrong.

177
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,000
You're obviously on the edge.

178
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,500
Beat him.

179
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,500
Yes, Master.

180
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,500
Instead of talking to the pig.

181
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,500
Dog, give me three days.

182
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,500
I'll help you.

183
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'll see you in three days.

184
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Let's go.

185
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Where are you going now?

186
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Hai Yongwen.

187
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You're a bad girl. Get out of here.

188
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Brother Jun, shouldn't you be in the prison?

189
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Did you hear that?

190
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
He said it himself.

191
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It seems that he's not well.

192
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Master Li is right.

193
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
There's nothing good in women.

194
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
That Master Li?

195
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
None of your business.

196
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What is it?

197
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
What's that?

198
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's a gift.

199
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
What is it?

200
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It's a gift.

201
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
What is it?

202
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Are you annoyed?

203
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You want to frame us?

204
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'll let you be punished today.

205
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Women should be like women.

206
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
They're fierce and unloved.

207
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You...

208
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You'd better go back and defend yourself.

209
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
My brother Jun,

210
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
you don't know anyone, do you?

211
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You used to call me Ai Qian.

212
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Since you want me to suffer,

213
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
you should come and accompany me.

214
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Let's see who's going to accompany me.

215
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It smells good.

216
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It's specially made for you.

217
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You should keep it for Brother Jun.

218
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
But this fragrance is not for men.

219
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Tian Ru.

220
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Serves We.

221
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,100
Umm..

222
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Lawyer~~~

223
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Wait.

224
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,080
Tu Dan Sol student.

225
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Hey, you're not dead?

226
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm alive.

227
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Good and evil lovers.

228
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's a pity that they will soon become the cause of the disaster.

229
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You...

230
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I want to lose my power.

231
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'll have to wait for three days to recover.

232
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
What do you want?

233
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Let go of her!

234
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You're so quick-witted.

235
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Don't touch her.

236
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
If you want to kill her, kill me.

237
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Of course. It's useless to leave you here.

238
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You know too much.

239
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
If you dare touch her, I'll kill you.

240
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
That's not necessary.

241
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You know what? You're very useful.

242
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Don't use me for anything you can't see.

243
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Don't you want to save your lover?

244
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm a woman. Don't listen to me.

245
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You've already told me about the woman.

246
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I need someone. A woman to help me.

247
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Father, what did you say?

248
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Don't think too much. I can't wait.

249
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You won't use me.

250
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You...

251
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Miss Chou, come out!

252
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Miss Chou!

253
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Wait outside.

254
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
What are you doing?

255
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Miss Chou!

256
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You can leave now.

257
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Yes.

258
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You've thought it through.

259
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
From the moment you saved us,

260
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
everything is well planned.

261
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
You're a smart girl.

262
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'll give you back your freedom now.

263
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Okay. I've thought about it.

264
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You'll be punished for me.

265
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You've always been not her.

266
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It's me.

267
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
No. I like her.

268
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
She's a naive boy.

269
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
She's a good girl.

270
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
How else could you sacrifice for her?

271
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
How could I have a plan?

272
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You're just a coward.

273
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Remember your promise. Let her go.

274
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Don't worry.

275
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
The world knows you're a woman.

276
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I'll let her go.

277
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You'd better do this.

278
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Or I'll kill you.

279
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I won't let you go.

280
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'm afraid you'll be in trouble.

281
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You...

282
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
You're right.

283
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'm a good person.

284
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Go now.

285
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I'll let Guan Fu catch you.

286
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'll let him go.

287
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Wait.

288
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'll give this to Xiao Yao.

289
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Tell her to give it to Ling'er.

290
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
My love

291
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
The scenery passing by

292
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I've been careful

293
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
But I've never returned to my place

294
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Your love has always been very clear

295
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I'll exchange for your love

296
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You're the one I love

297
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm a good person.

298
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Yang Fu, you miss me?

299
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
You forgot your sister Yuru so soon?

300
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
That bitch.

301
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
My dad had to leave early.

302
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
What are you doing here?

303
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
What happened to Yuru?

304
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Aren't you nervous?

305
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I'm warning you.

306
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
If Yuru is fine, I won't let you go.

307
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You're a young man.

308
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
You're handsome.

309
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I know that's true.

310
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
But I'll kill you.

311
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
You scared me.

312
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
This is Yuru's gift.

313
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
He's gone.

314
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It's impossible.

315
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
He won't take it.

316
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I'm not interested.

317
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
He just wants you to give it to Ling'er.

318
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Ling'er?

319
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Did he really say that?

320
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Yang Fu, did you force him to do something?

321
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Who forced him?

322
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
He did it willingly.

323
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Yang Fu, don't go.

324
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I'm going to lock you up here.

325
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I'm starving.

326
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
What do you think?

327
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
You're so stupid.

328
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
What do you want to do?

329
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I didn't give up.

330
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I won't leave you alone.

331
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Even if I have to break up,

332
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I'll still wait for you.

333
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I'm willing to do anything.

334
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I love you.

335
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I'll wait for your news.

336
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I love you.

337
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
There will always be a day

338
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
when you'll believe that I love you.

339
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I want to see you.

340
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I can't help but be in my heart.

341
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I want to see you.

342
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
You left the horse's tail.

343
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
You disappeared in the wind.

344
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I want to see you.

345
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Yang Fu, you're so bold.

346
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You ran away last time.

347
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
How dare you do that again?

348
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I dare not.

349
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Do you know that this is a palace?

350
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
You didn't come here to leave.

351
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
You just left.

352
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
You're so stupid.

353
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I'm not stupid.

354
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I'm not stupid.

355
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I'm not stupid.

356
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I just came here to leave.

357
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Come on.

358
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Give me a hand.

359
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Don't run.

360
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Don't let me play with you.

361
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Don't run.

362
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I'm in a hurry.

363
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I'll play with you next time.

364
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Madam.

365
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Sorry.

366
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Don't touch him.

367
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I'm sorry.

368
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Close the window.

369
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I didn't hurt you.

370
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I'm sorry.

371
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I'm sorry.

372
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I'm sorry.

373
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I'm sorry.

374
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I'm sorry.

375
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I've been in a hurry.

376
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Get out.

377
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Get out of here.

378
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Yes.

379
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,860
You can't go.

380
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,960
Why did you come?

381
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,180
I'm here to save you

382
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,780
You...

383
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,100
You can stop me.

384
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,240
It's me now.

385
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,800
If anyone stops,

386
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,200
I can't go!

387
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,480
You brat!

388
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,640
You ran to the police again!

389
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,400
Don't touch me!

390
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,520
Yes.

391
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,840
Yuezhu.

392
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,400
It hurts.

393
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,520
My lord.

394
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,320
You...

395
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,440
You're trying to blame me for being a good person.

396
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,560
You...

397
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,360
You're a bastard.

398
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,080
You've been a bastard for ten thousand years.

399
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,360
You're a bastard.

400
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,120
You're talking nonsense.

401
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,880
He admitted it himself.

402
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,360
Where did you get the grudge?

403
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,320
Where did you get it?

404
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,160
Listen to me.

405
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,440
This whole city is not a good place to live.

406
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,520
We said we'd catch the real female bandits.

407
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,040
Have you forgotten?

408
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,520
But you escaped.

409
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,960
We went out to find the female bandits.

410
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,000
But I didn't expect her to come back and take the blood.

411
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,240
She said she'd kill me.

412
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:19,000
So this idiot came out to punish her.

413
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,840
To punish the female bandits for you?

414
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,160
Yes.

415
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,560
Yuezhu.

416
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,480
Yuezhu.

417
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,080
Yuezhu.

418
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:30,200
Yuezhu.

419
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:30,640
Yuezhu?

420
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,280
Yuezhu.

421
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:32,760
Yuezhu.

422
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,400
Yuezhu.

423
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,280
Yuezhu.

424
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,120
Yuezhu.

425
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,360
Yuezhu.

426
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,360
Yuezhu.

427
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,320
Mistakes?

428
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,320
Yuezhu.

429
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,320
Love?

430
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,320
I don't think so.

431
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,320
You look so ugly.

432
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,320
It must be the debtor's relationship.

433
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,320
The debtor's head.

434
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,320
It's not.

435
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,320
What's your relationship?

436
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,320
What's my relationship with him?

437
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,320
Is it your fault?

438
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,320
I understand.

439
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,320
I understand.

440
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,320
I understand.

441
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,320
What do you understand?

442
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,320
I understand.

443
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,320
You are not a couple.

444
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,320
You are not lovers.

445
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:39,320
But you love him.

446
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,320
Nonsense.

447
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,320
Don't laugh.

448
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,320
It's reasonable.

449
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,320
But you should be honest.

450
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,320
He is so affectionate to you.

451
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,320
You should also hug him.

452
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,320
You should find evidence for him.

453
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,320
You should be punished.

454
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,320
Thank you, sir.

455
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,320
Nonsense.

456
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,320
Love?

457
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,320
Love?

458
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,320
Chudan.

459
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,320
You are still alive?

460
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,320
You are dying.

461
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,320
I feel so bad.

462
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,320
Who told you to find me?

463
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,320
I know you are fine.

464
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,320
You are so stubborn.

465
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,320
Why are you so stupid?

466
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,320
You believe in your husband.

467
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,320
You are being caught for me.

468
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,320
I will...

469
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,320
I will get him for you.

470
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,320
I will take the blame for you.

471
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,320
Wait for me.

472
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,320
I am waiting.

473
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,320
I am waiting.

474
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,320
Don't be so silly.

475
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,320
Don't throw him away.

476
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,320
What do you think?

477
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,320
It's time to get the evidence.

478
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,320
It proves your friend's innocence.

479
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,320
Go find a doctor.

480
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,320
Go.

481
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,320
Go.

482
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,320
Yes.

483
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,320
I am leaving.

484
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,320
Sir, did you get the pain?

485
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,320
If it hurts, I feel so bad.

486
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,320
Don't worry.

487
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,320
You will get better soon.

488
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,320
Have some eggs.

489
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,320
Don't worry.

490
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,320
After today,

491
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,320
everything will be fine.

492
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,320
Madam is inside.

493
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,320
This Ji San Niang is really a woman.

494
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,320
Go in and have a look.

495
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,320
You are a thief.

496
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,320
Just do it.

497
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,320
Just do it.

498
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,320
Don't be noisy.

499
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,320
Let me take a good rest.

500
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,320
I saw that

501
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,320
he was a dead man.

502
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,320
Are you a human?

503
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,320
How dare you say I am not a human?

504
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,320
You are not a human.

505
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,320
He has died for a long time.

506
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,320
Do you know how to go to the earth to be safe?

507
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,320
No.

508
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,320
I don't want him to be buried in the dark forever.

509
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,320
I don't want him to be alone,

510
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,320
suffering from illness and loneliness.

511
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,320
So you use the fairy list to protect him.

512
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,320
You use the villagers' incense.

513
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,320
This thing needs a lot of silver.

514
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,320
You don't have silver,

515
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,320
so you can only steal it.

516
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,320
So you are a thief.

517
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,320
You are a bad boy.

518
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,320
You are a bad boy.

519
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,320
But you are not stupid at all.

520
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,320
Do you know who the thief is?

521
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,320
You are a thief.

522
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,320
Take him down.

523
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,320
I won't let you catch him.

524
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,320
My husband.

525
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,320
My husband.

526
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,320
My husband.

527
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,320
Let me go.

528
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,320
Let me go.

529
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,320
Are you awake?

530
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,320
Let me go.

531
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,320
He has left.

532
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,320
I am not a thief.

533
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,320
I am a bad boy.

534
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,320
He has left.

535
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,320
He has left.

536
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,320
My husband.

537
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,320
My husband.

538
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,320
Mrs. Fan,

539
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,320
you are a thief.

540
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,320
You are a thief.

541
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,320
You are a bad boy.

542
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,320
You are a bad boy.

543
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,320
You are a bad boy.

544
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,320
You are a bad boy.

545
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,320
You are a bad boy.

546
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,320
You are a bad boy.

547
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,320
You are a bad boy.

548
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,320
You are a bad boy.

549
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,320
You are a bad boy.

550
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,320
You are a bad boy.

551
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,320
You are a bad boy.

552
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,320
You are a bad boy.

553
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,320
You are a bad boy.

554
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,320
Mrs. Fan,

555
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,320
you are a bad boy.

556
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,320
I am not a thief.

557
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,320
I don't have anything.

558
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,320
Why do you still want to get into the phoenix?

559
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,320
Come on.

560
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,320
Give me a 30-round.

561
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,320
Wait.

562
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,320
Sir,

563
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,320
can I take the 30-round?

564
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,320
Li Xiaoyou,

565
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,320
do you know where this is?

566
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,320
This is the palace.

567
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,320
I know.

568
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,320
Li Xiaoyou,

569
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,320
you broke into the palace last time.

570
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,320
You even held the top for him.

571
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,320
No, it's him who held the top for him.

572
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,320
I have no more pursuit.

573
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,320
This time, you are making a fool of yourself again.

574
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,320
It seems that

575
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,320
you are the only one who can take the sword.

576
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,320
Sir,

577
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,320
can you hear me out?

578
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,320
The reason why Mrs. Fan did this

579
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,320
is because she loves her husband too much.

580
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,320
Love is what you know.

581
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,320
Love can kill people and make people live.

582
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,320
Love can kill people and make people live.

583
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,320
Of course not.

584
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,320
But Mrs. Fan

585
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,320
risked her life to be a thief.

586
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,320
She can't accept the fact that

587
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,320
her husband died just now.

588
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,320
Life and death are the biggest pain in life.

589
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,320
And the person who lost her love the most just now.

590
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,320
Sir,

591
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,320
she is just a woman.

592
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,320
A woman who just lost her husband.

593
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,320
But what does this have to do with it?

594
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,320
Sir,

595
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,320
I know that Mrs. Fan is the most pitiful.

596
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,320
But

597
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,320
can you see that

598
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,320
everything she gave

599
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,320
is the love of her husband.

600
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,320
And it's not her fault.

601
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,320
You are so young.

602
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,320
You know how to love and be tolerant.

603
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,320
But

604
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,320
what's the point of this token?

605
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,320
This token

606
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,320
is still not allowed.

607
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,320
So I hope you can

608
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,320
let me take care of it.

609
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,320
Alright.

610
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,320
Come on.

611
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,320
I don't need anyone to be pitiful.

612
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,320
They are all family.

613
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,320
I should thank you.

614
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,320
Do it.

615
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,320
Please.

616
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,320
Please.

617
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,320
Please.

618
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,320
You silly girl.

619
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,320
I think I can see

620
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,320
the paper on your face

621
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,320
in front of my mother.

622
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:14,320
I think you are my mother.

623
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,320
I don't want to.

624
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,320
Are you willing to do it?

625
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,320
In my heart,

626
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,320
my mother is a good person.

627
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,320
You are a good person too.

628
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,320
I have been thinking.

629
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,320
If you have a son,

630
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,320
you will love him

631
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,320
like your husband.

632
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,320
He won't think the same way.

633
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,320
He will be a little confused.

634
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,320
I have never seen my mother

635
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,320
since I was three.

636
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,320
I almost forgot her.

637
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,320
But since I met you,

638
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,320
I seem to have met my mother.

639
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,320
So I...

640
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,320
I want to thank you.

641
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,320
Alright.

642
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,320
Listen to me.

643
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,320
Listen to me.

644
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,320
I made a mistake again.

645
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,320
Li Xiaoyao is a filial son.

646
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,320
He should be a good person.

647
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,320
I will not let him hit me.

648
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,320
Chudan, are you alright?

649
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,320
Thank you, sir.

650
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,320
Mrs. Fan, I hope you can be a good person.

651
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,320
You have been in jail for five years.

652
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,320
You can't change your mind.

653
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,320
Am I not guilty?

654
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,320
I think you are just stealing.

655
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,320
You didn't hurt people.

656
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,320
Besides,

657
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,320
stealing money is also to buy medicine

658
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,320
to keep your husband's body.

659
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,320
Although this behavior is crazy,

660
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:55,320
I appreciate your love.

661
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,320
Come on.

662
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,320
Put Mrs. Fan down.

663
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,320
Child, I hope you can meet your mother soon.

664
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,320
I will.

665
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,320
You are not young anymore.

666
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,320
Don't always think about your mother.

667
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,320
You should find a good girl.

668
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,320
Be a good girl.

669
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,320
Hit him.

670
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,320
Hit him.

671
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,320
Are you still in pain?

672
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,320
It's okay.

673
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,320
I am so strong.

674
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,320
I can be scared even if they hit me.

675
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,320
What are you doing?

676
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,320
You let me down.

677
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,320
Let me down.

678
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,320
Alright.

679
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,320
You are so big.

680
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,320
You must be in pain.

681
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,320
The grass is so beautiful.

682
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:29,320
I am waiting for my love.

683
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,320
Look at your face.

684
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,320
Have we stolen your belongings?

685
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,320
No.

686
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,320
I am a kind person.

687
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:45,320
Please don't be so stingy.

688
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,320
If you really want to thank us,

689
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,320
I just got some more drinks.

690
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,320
What?

691
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,320
More drinks?

692
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,320
You're not telling the truth, are you?

693
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,320
Actually, we don't have much demand.

694
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,320
We need 50 million.

695
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,320
What?

696
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,320
50 million?

697
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,320
This...

698
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,320
Are you asking for my life?

699
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,320
You don't have much.

700
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,320
How about...

701
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,320
Forget it.

702
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,320
Look at you.

703
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,320
Thank you.

704
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,320
Thank you.

705
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,320
Yangzhou is also closed.

706
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:35,320
I'm going home tomorrow morning.

707
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,320
Where are you staying?

708
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,320
Chang'an.

709
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:44,320
I haven't seen my wife for many years.

710
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,320
Do you regret it?

711
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,320
I regret it.

712
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,320
I'm telling you.

713
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:56,320
Not everywhere can meet a thief like us.

714
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,320
You're so good at talking.

715
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,320
Be careful on the road.

716
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,320
I'm sure.

717
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,320
What?

718
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,320
I'm looking at your big ass.

719
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,320
Is it good?

720
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:17,320
You're the big ass.

721
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,320
I'm using the gold-chonged medicine.

722
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,320
I'm fine after two days.

723
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,320
What are you doing?

724
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,320
You're heavy.

725
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,320
I don't know.

726
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,320
I said I'm heavy.

727
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,320
Why do you want to carry it?

728
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,320
I'll carry it for you.

729
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,320
No.

730
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:43,320
It's normal for a man to carry a bag.

731
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,320
Women are too hard on you.

732
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,320
Are you crazy or stupid?

733
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,320
I'm fine.

734
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,320
I'm serious.

735
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,320
Look at your hand.

736
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:03,320
It's still a small girl.

737
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,320
Fine.

738
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:08,320
I don't need you to be my maid.

739
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,320
Chou Dan.

740
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,320
What?

741
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,320
You don't need to do that.

742
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,320
I've carried Li Xiaoyao's bag.

743
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,320
What else do you want?

744
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,320
Li Xiaoyao.

745
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,320
What do you mean?

746
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,320
You like me?

747
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,320
Are you crazy?

748
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,320
Fine.

749
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,320
Can you please?

750
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,320
I'm not good to you.

751
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,320
I'm not good to you.

752
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,320
I'm not good to you.

753
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,320
What do you want?

754
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:39,320
You're grateful to me for what you did to me.

755
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,320
I don't like it.

756
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,320
I said you...

757
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,320
I'm telling you.

758
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,320
I don't want to be grateful to you.

759
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:47,320
I want to be grateful to you.

760
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,320
You're not a good girl.

761
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,320
Who loves you?

762
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,320
I'll send you off.

763
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,320
Fine.

764
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,320
You're still Chou Dan.

765
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,320
I'm still your maid.

766
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,320
Of course.

767
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,320
Here.

768
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,320
Stop.

769
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,320
Why are you here?

770
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,320
Master.

771
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,320
I heard there are monsters on the mountain.

772
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,320
It's amazing.

773
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,320
What do you think we should do?

774
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,320
We should go around the mountain.

775
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,320
How many days do we have to go around?

776
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,320
Ten days.

777
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,320
What are you talking about?

778
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,320
Ten days?

779
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,320
What are you talking about?

780
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,320
It's a sunny day.

781
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:42,320
What monsters are there on the sunny day?

782
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,320
You're blaming yourself.

783
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,320
What's wrong?

784
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,320
You want to kill me?

785
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,320
We dare not.

786
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,320
See?

787
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,320
That's enough.

788
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,320
Take it.

789
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,320
Drive.

790
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,320
Go up the mountain.

791
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,320
What a man.

792
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,320
Boss, are you done?

793
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,320
Yes.

794
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,320
Okay.

795
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:04,320
Here's your medicine.

796
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,320
Here.

797
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,320
Okay. Thank you.

798
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:12,320
Excuse me, are you on the mountain?

799
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,320
If you're on the mountain,

800
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,320
I suggest you go back.

801
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,320
Why?

802
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,320
There are monsters on the mountain.

803
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,320
Monsters?

804
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,320
What monsters?

805
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,320
That monster is a woman.

806
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,320
She's ugly and scary.

807
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,320
There's no one who can come back.

808
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,320
I thought it was monsters.

809
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,320
But it's a female monster.

810
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,320
We met her.

811
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,320
It's even scarier than her.

812
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,320
It's a monster.

813
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,320
We're going to the same place.

814
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,320
You must be careful.

815
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,320
I'm busy.

816
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,320
Wait a minute.

817
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,320
I ask you.

818
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,320
Have you ever met a girl who looks so handsome?

819
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,320
She's tall.

820
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,320
She's got a hairpin on her head.

821
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,320
What's wrong?

822
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,320
What a beautiful girl.

823
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,320
You're here.

824
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,320
What?

825
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,320
Bastard.

826
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,320
Isn't this the Purple Golden Fox?

827
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:39,320
I don't want to understand

828
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:45,320
At least I still have a beautiful dream

829
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:49,320
Don't say anything

830
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:53,320
I really don't want to understand

831
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,320
I finally understand

832
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:59,320
I should let go

833
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:03,320
Don't say anything

834
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:06,320
I don't want to understand

835
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:13,320
At least I still have a beautiful dream

836
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:17,320
Don't say anything

837
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:20,320
I really don't want to understand

838
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:23,320
I finally understand

839
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:26,320
I should let go
