1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not afraid of you.

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Aunt.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You seem to be embarrassed.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What are you saying?

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm going to fight for the princess.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I don't care.

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
How about Xiao Yao?

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Just do as she says.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Princess, you can lie to God.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You can lie to the earth.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You can't lie to the slave.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I don't like you being like this.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I don't like you being like this.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I go to drink and drink and relax all day.

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I have nothing to do with Xiao Yao.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Forget it.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Even if it's not for you,

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I have to catch her.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Who calls her every time

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
to find a girl in Tang Yu Xiaobao?

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Tang Yu Xiaobao is looking for a girl.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Li Xiao Yao, stop!

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
A'nu.

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Young master,

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
it's hard to avoid having a bad feeling

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
after drinking seven cups.

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I think you are

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
the best in the world.

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What are you doing?

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Do you think

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
you look like a man

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
when you are pretending?

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You are holding something.

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What is it?

49
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What is it?

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's a trick.

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You can't be so stupid

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
when I talk to her.

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I am here.

54
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Your cold expression

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
will make me sad.

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The rain in June

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
is the endless you.

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You are like a little brother.

59
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You are the pain in my heart.

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I don't believe

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
you didn't mean it.

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
But why do you

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
have me in the wind and rain?

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I don't want to be heartless.

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I don't want to be afraid of you.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Only you,

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
will turn around.

68
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I won't give up.

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I won't leave you.

70
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Even if I have to be separated,

71
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I will still wait for you.

72
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I will do my best.

73
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I will wait for your news.

74
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
There will always be a day

75
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
when you will believe me.

76
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I love you.

77
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I miss you.

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I don't believe

79
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
you didn't mean it.

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
But why do you

81
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
have me in the wind and rain?

82
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
There are so many dishes

83
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
tonight.

84
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I will go to the village.

85
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I will take you there.

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I don't want to live.

87
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I don't want to live.

88
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Wait, young master.

89
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I don't want to live.

90
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Young master, you have a business.

91
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Why do you have to search for a short-term?

92
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Young master, calm down.

93
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You are a father and a mother.

94
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You should not be born

95
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
if you live a hard life.

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's a big joke.

97
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I don't care.

98
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
He doesn't want me.

99
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I don't want to live.

100
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I don't want to live.

101
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Yes.

102
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's a sad thing.

103
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Young master Xiao can make such a decision.

104
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It must be inevitable.

105
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I won't stop you.

106
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Didn't you want me to die?

107
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Why didn't you save me?

108
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You really want to die?

109
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I...

110
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Of course.

111
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I am sad.

112
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Good.

113
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I admire Young master Xiao's courage.

114
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
The knife is here.

115
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's all gone.

116
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It really doesn't hurt?

117
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Yes.

118
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
But I have to ask Young master Xiao again.

119
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
No need.

120
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I will go and make it up to him.

121
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Okay.

122
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Go to hell.

123
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I will.

124
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I will.

125
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I will.

126
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I will.

127
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I will.

128
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I will.

129
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You...

130
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You lied to me.

131
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You said you wouldn't hurt him.

132
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I feel so hurt.

133
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I feel so hurt.

134
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I am scared.

135
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I want to live.

136
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Help me.

137
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Why are you so selfish?

138
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You are too much.

139
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Yes, brother Jingyuan.

140
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I don't like you.

141
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
They are right.

142
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It's just a lie.

143
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You are a traitor.

144
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You will teach a child.

145
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Calm down.

146
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Brother Jingyuan must have his reasons.

147
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Actually, I wanted Young master Xiao to feel pain.

148
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Let Jingyuan explain.

149
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I made a mark on Young master Xiao's chest.

150
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Actually, there is a scar.

151
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What scar?

152
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
He almost killed you.

153
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I read in a book.

154
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
The body of our new house is magical.

155
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
If we put something in it,

156
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
we won't be in danger.

157
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Of course, we have to cure him before bleeding.

158
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So magical?

159
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Yes.

160
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's not a death sentence.

161
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Young master Xiao wants to commit suicide.

162
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I know it's just a moment of impulse.

163
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
If he does something stupid,

164
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
it's more dangerous.

165
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Now, there is a safe way.

166
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It can make him feel like he is dying.

167
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
He will cherish his life more.

168
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I am not dead.

169
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I am still alive.

170
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Eunuch.

171
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Eunuch.

172
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Thank you for your kindness.

173
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Young master Xiao is injured.

174
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Please get up.

175
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
No.

176
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You made me understand my stupidity.

177
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You made me understand the precious life.

178
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Please get up.

179
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Come on.

180
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Actually, I didn't do anything.

181
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I just help others.

182
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
The key is in you.

183
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
If something happens,

184
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
you have to solve it yourself.

185
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
This is the most important thing.

186
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Good.

187
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Good job.

188
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Elder,

189
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
you have many advantages.

190
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You didn't notice them.

191
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
No.

192
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Tang Yu is so lovely and lovely when he was young.

193
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
He likes her.

194
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
But I don't know why

195
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
he is more and more weak now.

196
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I think you are too much respect to

197
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Elder Yin.

198
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Don't you want to be punished?

199
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Elder Yin,

200
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
please tell me what happened.

201
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I will share it with you.

202
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Actually, I have a meaning

203
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
before Tang Yu.

204
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You mean,

205
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
you have a brother?

206
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I don't know.

207
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's all my fault.

208
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Is he still alive?

209
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I regret it.

210
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's my wife's fault.

211
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
She left me a fault.

212
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Is it a fault for the society?

213
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's a country.

214
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's so serious.

215
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I never knew about it.

216
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I don't want her to know.

217
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's my biggest mistake.

218
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's okay.

219
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You don't need to tell me.

220
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Thank you for keeping it a secret.

221
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Don't worry.

222
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You shouldn't have

223
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
put all your fault on yourself.

224
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's good and bad.

225
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Don't make a conclusion

226
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
until the end.

227
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Sometimes,

228
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
bad things

229
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
are created to save a person.

230
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
They can make him

231
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
a good man

232
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
by breaking his courage and willpower.

233
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Good.

234
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I didn't expect

235
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I could meet such a person

236
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
at this age.

237
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It's my honor.

238
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I learned a lot

239
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
from Elder Yin.

240
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I envy your parents.

241
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Where?

242
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
How many people

243
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
can understand their parents' hard work?

244
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I have a son.

245
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I have a mother.

246
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I have a secret wife.

247
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I have a wife.

248
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Good.

249
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Who can tell the truth?

250
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I have a wife.

251
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Elder Yin

252
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
will understand your feelings

253
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
one day.

254
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Please.

255
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
We have a good talk.

256
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Let's have a drink together.

257
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
No.

258
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm sorry.

259
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Tang Yu said

260
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
the stone ghost is a big bad egg.

261
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
The stone ghost doesn't understand you.

262
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Junior Yin,

263
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
you are free now.

264
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
My father isn't the one proceedings again.

265
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
My father is not after me.

266
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Come in.

267
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Young Master,

268
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
may I ask if something is on Master Liu?

269
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Yes.

270
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Please sit.

271
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I will do my best.

272
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Brother Qi, since we know each other,

273
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I have something to say.

274
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Just say it.

275
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Brother Qi, I want to know how you got involved with me.

276
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I understand.

277
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I never talked to you.

278
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I never talked to you.

279
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I don't need to worry about you.

280
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's hard to talk to you.

281
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Brother Qi, I want to talk to you like you do.

282
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I am human.

283
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Brother Qi, you are late.

284
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It's you.

285
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I think I should give up.

286
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
How can you?

287
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I don't want to be in your shoes.

288
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It's all my fault.

289
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I let myself go.

290
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I don't want to be in your shoes.

291
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I ate the whole meal.

292
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I feel so happy.

293
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I am so happy.

294
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You are so brave.

295
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I know you care about me.

296
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Brother Qi, do you think I am useless?

297
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I know how you feel.

298
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I don't want my father to be my own son.

299
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I know you are so brave.

300
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Let me tell you a story.

301
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Okay.

302
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Long time ago, there was no language in the world.

303
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
It was quiet and pure.

304
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
But there was language.

305
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:59,000
After communication, there was anxiety, misunderstanding and sadness.

306
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
That's why I came here.

307
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I am a scholar.

308
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I don't know what you mean.

309
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Do you want to remind yourself?

310
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Or do you want to prove yourself?

311
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I care about my father.

312
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
What?

313
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I care about my father.

314
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Let go of your feelings and face yourself.

315
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I care about my father.

316
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I love him.

317
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I don't know what you mean.

318
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Okay.

319
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I love my father.

320
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
One more time.

321
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I love my father.

322
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I love my father.

323
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Princess, I have a lot of questions.

324
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Can we go back?

325
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Princess, you can't leave here with Xiaoyao.

326
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Leave the things in Nanzhao's hands to us.

327
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I will take you to war.

328
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I won't retreat.

329
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Tang Yu, you can go out.

330
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Is it useful to go out like this?

331
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Or you can marry Li Gongzi and stay away from Nanzhao.

332
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Or you can do something with him.

333
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
You can only make him the next young master.

334
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Young master, I will drink with you.

335
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Come on.

336
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Be happy.

337
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Come on.

338
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Are all your pretty girls dead?

339
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Why are you so mean?

340
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
What's wrong with you?

341
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I spent money to come here to play.

342
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I want to think about your feelings.

343
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Be good.

344
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
If you want to blame him, blame him.

345
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Okay.

346
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
You can drink more.

347
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Hello.

348
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Young master Lin.

349
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You are so nice.

350
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
What do you mean?

351
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You are Xiaoyao in the magic room.

352
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
So you are the young master.

353
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Young master, what's your name?

354
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Li.

355
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Really?

356
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I thought you are a bad person.

357
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You are so bad.

358
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Who is bad?

359
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You said you wanted to separate me.

360
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You are looking for a good husband.

361
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Please.

362
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I am here to play with you.

363
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
What's your problem?

364
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I am also a bad person.

365
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Aixie, Jianbi.

366
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Let's have fun.

367
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I am not like this young master.

368
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
If I have a girl,

369
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I will love her forever.

370
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I will not be like her.

371
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I will be a bad person.

372
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Come here.

373
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
You are all my love.

374
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I will not fight with you.

375
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Don't worry about me.

376
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I will take care of you.

377
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I never give you any pressure.

378
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Really?

379
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You should tell me.

380
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
How can I tell you?

381
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You don't know me.

382
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
You gave me a chance.

383
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
You are the one who said it.

384
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
You are the one who said it.

385
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
You are the one who said it.

386
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
You are the one who said it.

387
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I don't even have a place to stay.

388
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Is it fair?

389
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I am just a toy.

390
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I am just a person who will be punished.

391
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
You are the one who said it.

392
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
What are you doing here?

393
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
You can't forget me?

394
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
You are jealous?

395
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
You are lying.

396
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Are you still alive?

397
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
They are lovers.

398
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
They are men.

399
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
He is a girl.

400
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Young master can't forget her.

401
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
So he comes here every day to drink.

402
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
But this girl doesn't know the inside.

403
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
So he comes here to see what he is doing here.

404
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
So he is jealous.

405
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
What are you talking about?

406
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
He is still in love.

407
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Yes.

408
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Let go.

409
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Are you serious?

410
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Trust me.

411
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
My mom is rich.

412
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
She is so sincere.

413
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
She is so hard to get.

414
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Come on.

415
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
You can do whatever you want.

416
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I don't care about her.

417
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
You...

418
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
From now on, you are a teacher.

419
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
You are a young man.

420
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
You are rich and open-minded.

421
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
You are righteous.

422
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
You are not related to me.

423
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I won't ask who you like.

424
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I won't care about you.

425
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You are cruel.

426
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I am leaving.

427
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Don't follow me.

428
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Go.

429
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Go after him.

430
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
You are a fool.

431
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
He cares about you.

432
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Hurry up.

433
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
No need.

434
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Are they coming back?

435
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I should say everything.

436
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Why not come back?

437
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Something is wrong.

438
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Something is wrong.

439
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Sister Yuru.

440
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Leave now.

441
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Why?

442
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
You know it very well.

443
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I don't want to see you anymore.

444
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Please go back to the south immediately.

445
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I will decide if I can leave or not.

446
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
As long as you and Brother Xiaoyao don't follow me.

447
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Don't worry.

448
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I will take care of you.

449
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I will take care of you.

450
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I will take care of you.

451
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I will take care of you.

452
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I will take care of you.

453
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I will take care of you.

454
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Don't worry.

455
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
From now on,

456
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I will stop him from pestering you.

457
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
But don't hurt him anymore.

458
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I have never done anything.

459
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I know you heard it.

460
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
He is crying for you.

461
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
He has always been like this.

462
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I really don't understand.

463
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Why do you treat him so politely?

464
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I can't control him.

465
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I just don't like him.

466
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
You are lying.

467
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I know you like to be a bastard.

468
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I don't know what you want to do.

469
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
But you have been against him.

470
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I didn't.

471
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
You didn't?

472
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
If you didn't,

473
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
why are you here?

474
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I said I wouldn't fight with you.

475
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
What are you worried about?

476
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Be nice to him.

477
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Let him like you.

478
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I told you when I was in Baihua Village.

479
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I hate to say this.

480
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Do you think love is great?

481
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Nothing great.

482
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I just want to tell you.

483
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I really let go.

484
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I won't like him anymore.

485
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Okay.

486
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I believe you.

487
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
You can leave now.

488
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I will leave when I am done.

489
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
What?

490
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
What?

491
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I know you.

492
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
It's not like that.

493
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Why now?

494
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
You just see it clearly.

495
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
You can leave.

496
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I want to rest.

497
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I'll leave.

498
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I'm begging you.

499
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Don't leave.

500
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Ling'er.

501
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
I won't give up on Xiao Yao.

502
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I don't need you to love me.

503
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I won't take her away from you.

504
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I really only hope Xiao Yao

505
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
can be happy and happy.

506
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
From the first day I followed her to now,

507
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
she was happy.

508
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
She was unhappy.

509
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
It's all because of you.

510
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
In her heart,

511
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
you are always the most important.

512
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
This is also Xiao Yao.

513
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
She has always been

514
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
pursuing for something.

515
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Get up first.

516
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Listen to me.

517
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
All these days,

518
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
she cried all night.

519
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
She always

520
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
pretend to be carefree.

521
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
She was sad

522
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
because she didn't want you to know.

523
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
But when I saw her,

524
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I felt so sad.

525
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I felt so heartbroken.

526
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Ok.

527
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I have no other option but to tell you this.

528
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
It's a fact.

529
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Yes.

530
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
He has tortured me a lot.

531
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
They are out of nature.

532
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Perhaps they are not-

533
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Let me continue.

534
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Ok.

535
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I really don't want to see him again.

536
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I'm so sad for you.

537
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Since you chose not to want him,

538
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I'll cure him.

539
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I've said I won't talk to you.

540
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
What do you want to do?

541
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Please leave him now.

542
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Don't let him see you again.

543
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
If you don't leave him,

544
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
he won't have any space in his heart.

545
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I'll leave him.

546
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I won't have any space in his heart.

547
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I can't cure him.

548
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I beg you.

549
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Please leave him.

550
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Please leave him.

551
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I'm sorry.

552
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I'm sorry.

553
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I'm sorry.

554
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Tang Yu and Xiaobao, what's wrong with them?

555
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Here comes the food.

556
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Why is it so close today?

557
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Are you going out for fun?

558
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,000
By the way, tomorrow is the last day of the temple meeting.

559
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
There's a lantern meeting tonight. It's fun.

560
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I'm full.

561
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Where are you going?

562
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I know. Let's go out for a walk.

563
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Master Li, you're bored.

564
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Why don't we go to the flower shop and drink?

565
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Okay?

566
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Okay, I'm thirsty.

567
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Go.

568
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Let's go.

569
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I'll go with you.

570
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000

Let's go together.

572
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Didn't you say girls can't go?

573
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
The situation is different today.

574
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
The situation is different today?

575
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000

576
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Let's go.

577
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Doesn't HuAllu presses her little hand?

578
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
You will end it.

579
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
You can outfire me if you can.

580
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Okay.

581
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,000

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:51,240
metres away from Xiangda Eat

583
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:58,760
About options

584
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,720
What are you waiting for?

585
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,920

She said that people from the whole town would come to this award ceremony.

588
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,100
It must be fun.

589
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,900
Really? Then we will go too.

590
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,300
Princess, do you want to go with us?

591
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,300

00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,100

593
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:38,300

594
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,500
Exhausted.

595
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,700
Good boy.

Okay.

598
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:14,060
I won't quit.

599
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:19,480
Ah Ha, after all these hardships, I finally found one...

600
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,600
Oh, right, who almost killed him there?

601
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,560
You!

602
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:26,700
muscles were really quite strong, where did you know that they were?

603
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,680
It's Younger Brother Fourth Brother, thank God in advance Incidentally.

604
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,720
I just친 seeing them everywhere, accidentally spot it.

605
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,800
Hey! Are you really Kobayashi?

606
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,640
I still wanna know more about it.

607
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,360
Yeah, we were just...

608
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,280
It's just I've seen after meeting you guys all the time.

609
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:40,940

610
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,920
You can tell me know Damu

611
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,540
Looks like you have me on the same side then Can you understand what I mean?

612
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,580
You still want to fight?

613
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:45,940
Hurry up.

614
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,700
Girls, please stop fighting.

615
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,860
You must be a great man.

616
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,700
Don't break our plan.

617
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,060
I'm not a man.

618
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,500
Listen to me.

619
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:01,500
Father.

620
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:09,620
Father.

621
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,740
Princess and Xiao Yao are in the room.

622
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,540
Let's go.

623
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:14,420
Yes.

624
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,420
We've been to the flower party.

625
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,740
Why haven't we prepared it?

626
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,700
Let's do it.

627
00:33:42,780 --> 00:34:01,700
That's the endless

628
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,700
cooled down emergent kid.

629
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,180
husband.

630
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,220
He also applied it...

631
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,540
Please have a drink!

632
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:12,340
This is the name of the thereafterman of the title of governor.

633
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,460
Yes! Thank you!

634
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,700
He didn't turned it off.

635
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,420
Some helpers gave his token on me,

636
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,100
but he's leaving immediately.

637
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:27,980
Yes.

638
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,260
Are you okay now?

639
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,300
family members don't lie to people,

640
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,980
at least people can trust you!

641
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:42,720
And definitely also

642
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,520
those who jump from this building

643
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:44,880
don't often see

644
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,240
them to wear out after you get them!

645
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,440
So it will be boring

646
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,280
only if I don'tках

647
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,780
Lara belongs to me,

648
00:34:50,780 --> 00:35:04,060
Ц

649
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,380
me.

650
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,200
What are you waiting to learn.

651
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,400
So romantic.

652
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,080
Is Jiaxian music better for me?

653
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,440
Which kind of music?

654
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,240
Which kind of music?

655
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,720
Qimei.

656
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,680
Aiyue.

657
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,120
Speaking of the artist.

658
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:28,120
You are so bad at it.

659
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,120
Sorry.

660
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,720
Let me tell you.

661
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,560
Beauty is steady bumps are hard.

662
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,360
Listen.

663
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,440
You are being ruthless

664
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,600
and overtime to another man.

665
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,040
Don't be so courteous.

666
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,720
I can kill you all.

667
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,160
Look, asking you to do theそんな,

668
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:57,360
is your ricissus that Aren't scared of being Aberdeen.

669
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,240
You are treat me so poorly.

670
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,720
Brother Xiao Yao, you're so cute. Who would be willing to do that?

671
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,720
It's the fourth younger brother. It's easy to break the sound of the waterfall.

672
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,720
Be careful.

673
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:29,720
Tang Yu Xiaobao, how could you play this kind of thing?

674
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,720
Before I was adopted, La Erhu was my best friend.

675
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:57,720
I really like you. No matter what you do, I still like you so much.

676
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:04,720
Even if you really want to leave me and stop liking me, I understand.

677
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,720
Maybe I will become your burden with you.

678
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,720
Brother Xiao Yao...

679
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,720
You don't need to say anything. You don't need to explain.

680
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,720
I didn't want to let go of you before.

681
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:30,720
I think Ling Er is too fragile and needs to be protected.

682
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,720
But I didn't expect Ling Er to grow up.

683
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:42,720
If you leave me, you can become so good.

684
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:49,720
I know you've found the right direction.

685
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,720
You've found the right path.

686
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,720
What I can do for you now is to leave you.

687
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:08,720
No matter what, I will support you and bless you.

688
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:15,720
We won't meet again.

689
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,720
Brother Xiao Yao, you're right.

690
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:29,720
But I really can't bear to leave you.

691
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,720
Alright. I'll take the role of this man.

692
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,720
Let's break up.

693
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,720
No matter what, I won't see you again.

694
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,720
You can hate me or blame me.

695
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,720
I won't turn back.

696
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,720
Don't be sad.

697
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,720
I won't be outside.

698
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,720
Thank you.

699
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,720
It might be hard to bear at the beginning.

700
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,720
It's good that you've been waiting.

701
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,720
Take care.

702
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,720
Brother Xiao Yao's life is so short.

703
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,720
It's like a wolf.

704
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,720
You need to learn to be strong.

705
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,720
You need to stick to it.

706
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,720
I understand.

707
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:20,720
So quick.

708
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:25,840
Hurry, let's go, hurry, hurry

709
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:48,500
Lin, thank you

710
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:52,100
Love is not eternal.

711
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:56,980
Brother Xiaoyao, I also thank you.

712
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,940
Thank you for understanding me.

713
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,580
Love is...

714
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,300
better than knowing each other.

715
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,980
Then let's break up.

716
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:14,500
It's a real break up.

717
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:20,140
I want you to understand that

718
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,420
in my heart,

719
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,580
you will always exist.

720
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,620
Me too.

721
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:40,620
Let's go.

722
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:42,580
He's here.

723
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:43,940
Have you passed off?

724
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,060
He's bleeding.

725
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,180
No, brother Xiaoyao.

726
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:55,820
No.

727
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:57,780
It's okay.

728
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:01,860
Really.

729
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,300
Hi.

730
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:15,220
I won't give up and leave you alone

731
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:20,020
Even if I have to part ways, I'll still be waiting for you

732
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:27,220
I'm fully convinced that waiting for your news will always be a little bit

733
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:31,420
You will believe that I love you

734
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:34,820
I miss you in my life

735
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,220
Thank you

736
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,020
I'm also you

737
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,020
And me

738
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,020
And Qi

739
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:44,020
And Anong

740
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:47,020
You are also a big man

741
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:50,020
I'm not used to old clothes anymore

742
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:53,020
And I'm with you

743
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:56,020
Don't you hate me very much?

744
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:59,020
I still like strict clothes

745
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:03,020
And it's very strict

746
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:06,020
I'll remember to practice tomorrow morning

747
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:08,020
And I have to know

748
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,020
So beautiful

749
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:27,020
Look, it's really the five stars

750
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:30,020
Yes, this is the first time I've seen such a star

751
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:31,020
It's amazing

752
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:34,020
Look, there's a star in the five stars

753
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:39,020
I, Li Xiaoyou, will be the first star in the world

754
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:41,020
I will be strong and strong

755
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:43,020
I will be a great hero

756
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:46,020
I, Lin Yuezhu, will be the first star in the Lin family

757
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:49,020
I'm the heroine and I will fight with this bastard

758
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:53,020
I, Zhao Ling'er, will make all the men of the south Zhao State happy

759
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:57,020
I, Liu Jingyuan, will be the emperor of the modern world

760
00:43:57,020 --> 00:44:01,020
I, Liu Jingyuan, will be the emperor of the modern world

761
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:03,020
I, Tao Yu, am not afraid of any difficulties

762
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:05,020
You have to be loyal and brave like me

763
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:06,020
To protect the country

764
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:09,020
I, An Long, will be happy every day

765
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:12,020
I will be happy every day

766
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:15,020
Ok, let's say goodbye today

767
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:17,020
See you again after ten years

768
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:19,020
We will definitely achieve the ideal in our hearts

769
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:21,020
We will

770
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:24,020
See you again

771
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:36,020
Hello

772
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:39,020
Hello, I've seen you a hundred years ago

773
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:40,020
What?

774
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,020
What are you talking about?

775
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:43,020
I didn't tell you the truth

776
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:45,020
I'm 108 years old

777
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,020
108 years old?

778
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:50,020
Yes, I've never counted the truth after 100 years

779
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:53,020
You're really a real ghost

780
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:55,020
It's Ren Rui

781
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:57,020
Yes, there's a saying

782
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:59,020
When you see Ren Rui, you will be blessed

783
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:00,020
Really?

784
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:02,020
I can't play with it

785
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:06,020
Run

786
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:08,020
Run

787
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:14,020
Master, I've come to you

788
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:19,020
The peace is the best solution

789
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:22,020
I promise you

790
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,020
We will not fight back

791
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:27,020
We have to use the peace to solve everything

792
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:29,020
Thank you, master

793
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:35,020
Master

794
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:05,020
Master

795
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:38,020
I really don't want to understand

796
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:40,020
I finally understand

797
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:43,020
I should let go

798
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:46,020
Don't say anything

799
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:48,020
Don't say anything

800
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:51,020
I don't want to understand

801
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:54,020
At least I still have

802
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:57,020
Every dream

803
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:01,020
Don't say anything

804
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:05,020
I really don't want to understand

805
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:07,020
I finally understand

806
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:10,020
I should let go
