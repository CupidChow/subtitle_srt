00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,200
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,200
I'm not afraid of you.

I'm not afraid of you.

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,200
I'm not afraid of you.

29
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,200
I'm not afraid of you.

30
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,200
I'm not afraid of you.

31
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,200
I'm not afraid of you.

32
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,200
I'm not afraid of you.

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,200
I'm not afraid of you.

35
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,200
I'm not afraid of you.

36
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,200
I'm not afraid of you.

37
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,200

I'm not afraid of you.

39
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,200
I'm not afraid of you.

40
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,200
I'm not afraid of you.

41
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,200
I'm not afraid of you.

42
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,200
I'm not afraid of you.

43
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,200

I'm not afraid of you.

48
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,200
I'm not afraid of you.

49
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,200
Little seed, you're so good.

50
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,200
Brother Xiaoyao has come back.

51
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,200
You should sleep.

52
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,200
Please.

53
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,200
You're back.

54
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,200
Old man,

55
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,200
can you give Brother Xiaoyao the gold bill?

56
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,200
That's great.

57
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,200
Brother Xiaoyao is saved.

58
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,200
Brother Xiaoyao,

59
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,200
you'd better go back.

60
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,200
I'm afraid that you'll be worried.

61
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,200
You're too naive.

62
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,200
You'd better go back.

63
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,200
Although Ling'er will miss you a lot,

64
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,200
you don't have to worry about

65
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,200
Brother Xiaoyao anymore.

66
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,200
Why?

67
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,200
Don't you have to go back?

68
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,200
Xiaoyao,

69
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,200
tell him yourself.

70
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,200
Ling'er.

71
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,200
What's wrong?

72
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,200
Can you marry me?

73
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,200
Brother Xiaoyao,

74
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,200
tell me.

75
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,200
Let's...

76
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,200
Let's get married.

77
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,200
Time flies.

78
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,200
When Ling'er was born,

79
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,200
he came to help you.

80
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,200
Ling'er smiled.

81
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,200
You're a prince.

82
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,200
You're a grown-up.

83
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,200
You're going to marry him.

84
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,200
There's a custom in the middle.

85
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,200
When you're married,

86
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,200
you'll find a happy old man

87
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,200
who will live a happy life.

88
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,200
He'll give you a blessing.

89
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,200
You can take care of Ling'er.

90
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,200
When you're married,

91
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,200
I feel very happy.

92
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,200
Ling'er.

93
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,200
I love you.

94
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,200
Silly girl.

95
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,200
You're married.

96
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,200
You'll take care of your husband and your child.

97
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,200
Love them well.

98
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,200
Live a life with them.

99
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,200
And I...

100
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,200
I can't be with you forever.

101
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,200
You have your own family and your own life.

102
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,200
I can only be with you

103
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,200
for a while.

104
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,200
You'll be the one

105
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,200
in the future.

106
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,200
No.

107
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,200
Ling'er wants to be a family with me.

108
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,200
Okay.

109
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,200
Sit down.

110
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,200
I'll comb your hair.

111
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,200
Come on.

112
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,200
A comb is a big thing.

113
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,200
Uncle Ai.

114
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,200
A white hair.

115
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,200
Uncle San.

116
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,200
I'm full of sugar.

117
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,200
Brother.

118
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,200
Great.

119
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,200
Heavenly Emperor.

120
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,200
My ears hurt.

121
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,200
I'm sorry.

122
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,200
I'm sorry.

123
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,200
I can't be with Ling'er

124
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,200
for a single word.

125
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,200
I just want to ask you something.

126
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,200
You'll be happy with me.

127
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,200
I'm sorry.

128
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,200
I'm sorry.

129
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,200
I'm sorry.

130
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,200
I'm sorry.

131
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,200
Miss Xiang Yao.

132
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,200
Why are you still following me?

133
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,200
Brother Xiang Yao is already married.

134
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,200
We haven't finished the soup.

135
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,200
You're not my wife.

136
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,200
But...

137
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,200
I'm just a little fool in the prison.

138
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,200
I'm always in the mood to be a good man.

139
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,200
No one will like me.

140
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,200
And I have many women.

141
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,200
You'll be happy with me.

142
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,200
Ling'er knows that Brother Xiang Yao is not a bad guy.

143
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,200
Why don't you understand?

144
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,200
I'm just using you.

145
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,200
I'm just marrying you

146
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,200
to get the Purple Star Pill to save my aunt.

147
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,200
Do you know that?

148
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,200
I won't give up.

149
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,200
I'm not the one you're waiting for.

150
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,200
You're Brother Xiang Yao.

151
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,200
I'm sorry.

152
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,200
Ling'er promised to smile at Brother Xiang Yao.

153
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,200
I can't do it.

154
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,200
Brother Xiang Yao, look.

155
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,200
He's finally out of his mind.

156
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,200
He finally out of his mind.

157
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,200
I knew you wouldn't lie to me.

158
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,200
You're Brother Xiang Yao.

159
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,200
Is he really out of his mind?

160
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,200
Yes.

161
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,200
Brother Xiang Yao.

162
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,200
I'm here to take you to the cave.

163
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,200
What's going on?

164
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,200
The cave?

165
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,200
The cave?

166
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,200
It's the bad thing I said.

167
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,200
This?

168
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,200
This?

169
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,200
This?

170
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,200
This?

171
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,200
This?

172
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,200
No.

173
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,200
This is...

174
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,200
This is the bad thing I said.

175
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,200
Brother Xiang Yao hasn't told me yet.

176
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,200
It's itchy.

177
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,200
Let go of me.

178
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,200
How is it?

179
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,200
This is the bad thing I said.

180
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,200
Stop it.

181
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,200
Stop it.

182
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,200
Stop it.

183
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,200
Stop it.

184
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,200
Stop it.

185
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,200
I can't do it now.

186
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,200
What's going on?

187
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,200
I can't do it now.

188
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,200
I can't do it now.

189
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,200
I can't do it now.

190
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,200
I can't do it now.

191
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,200
I can't do it now.

192
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,200
I can't do it now.

193
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,200
I can't do it now.

194
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,200
I can't do it now.

195
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,200
I can't do it now.

196
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,200
I can't do it now.

197
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,200
I can't do it now.

198
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,200
I can't do it now.

199
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,200
I can't do it now.

200
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,200
I can't do it now.

201
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,200
I can't do it now.

202
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,200
I can't do it now.

203
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,200
I can't do it now.

204
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,200
I can't do it now.

205
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,200
I can't do it now.

206
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,200
I can't do it now.

207
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,200
I love you.

208
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,200
Brother Xiang Yao.

209
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,200
Give me your hand.

210
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,900
Lord Quickly, he Dad, he Get lost!

211
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,520
No action is prepared,

212
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,780
if people see Lord Finally,

213
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,600
you can't forget

214
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,940
Here, this

215
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:17,940
You little manager, you have a lot of money.

216
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:27,940
Brother Xiaoyao, you must be suffering from the life you used to live.

217
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,940
No.

218
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,940
I swear that I will take good care of Brother Xiaoyao.

219
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,940
I will not let you suffer again.

220
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:42,940
You are so stupid.

221
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,940
I...

222
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,940
Do you have it?

223
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,940
Listen to me.

224
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:55,940
I promise you that I will not play with you anymore.

225
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:58,940
I will not play with other girls anymore.

226
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:03,940
I will work hard to raise a daughter.

227
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:10,940
Even if we can't be rich, I will make you happy every day.

228
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,940
I promise.

229
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,940
I promise?

230
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,940
Brother Xiaoyao.

231
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,940
Brother Xiaoyao.

232
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,940
I will come back soon.

233
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,940
Tomorrow?

234
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:17,940
I will come back as soon as I can cure your illness.

235
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,940
The painkiller of the old building can cure any illness.

236
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,940
You will be better.

237
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:25,940
That's good.

238
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,940
So, I will come back today.

239
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:41,940
If I don't come back, I will be a joke.

240
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,940
I am Li Xiaoyao.

241
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,940
Unless I die, I will come back to you.

242
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,940
I will wait for you here.

243
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,940
I will come back next time.

244
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,940
I will come back with Shen Shen.

245
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:05,940
I never thought that you would be so beautiful.

246
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:08,940
Okay.

247
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,940
I will come back early.

248
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:14,940
This place is the only place that I have not been treated by my father.

249
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,940
My father has been here since then.

250
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,940
I promise you that I will come back soon.

251
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:33,940
It's you?

252
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,940
Who are you?

253
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,940
Why are you running to the fairy island?

254
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,940
If it weren't for the little brother by your side,

255
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,940
I would never come back.

256
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,940
You... You give me a gift.

257
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,940
It's too late.

258
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,940
It's too late.

259
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:02,940
What do you want?

260
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,940
I want to take the little girl by your side.

261
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,940
Don't think too much.

262
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,940
Sister Lian, go.

263
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,940
You are so bold.

264
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,940
You are not going to break the fairy island.

265
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,940
Because I am here to take you.

266
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,940
Go.

267
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:00,940
Go.

268
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:26,940
You go.

269
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:27,940
Lian Lian.

270
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,940
Lian Lian.

271
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,940
Go.

272
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,940
No. I will save you.

273
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,940
No.

274
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:32,940
Go.

275
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,940
I can't go.

276
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,940
I am going to save you.

277
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:48,940
No.

278
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,940
You are going to use me to get up.

279
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:50,940
I will help you.

280
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:51,940
Go.

281
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,940
Shen Shen is waiting for you.

282
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:53,940
Go.

283
00:17:58,940 --> 00:17:59,940
Go.

284
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,940
Hurry.

285
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:04,940
Lian Lian.

286
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,940
Lian Lian.

287
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,940
Lian Lian.

288
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,940
Protect Lian Lian.

289
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,940
Protect Lian Lian.

290
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:33,940
Is he Jagusa Lian?

291
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:39,940
略玩如柳在离开其实.

292
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,940
Okay.

293
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,940
You, go.

294
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:44,940
I will be careful of him.

295
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,940
O settings are within your expectation.

296
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,940
Always lick your face to get better.

297
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,940
ahaha.

298
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,940
Then you will have the chance to act the way you did.

299
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:55,940
Don't différent things.

300
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,940
Lala!

301
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,940
Lala!

302
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,940
Lala!

303
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,940
Princess!

304
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,940
Zhaolin!

305
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,940
Anu!

306
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,940
Anu, why are you staying at home?

307
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,940
It's too late!

308
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,940
I brought you something today.

309
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,940
What is it?

310
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,940
This!

311
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:06,940
I took it from my mother.

312
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,940
How did you get it?

313
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,940
Don't touch it.

314
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,940
I saw it!

315
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:24,940
I will know your secret.

316
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,940
She is a fairy.

317
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,940
She comes here with me.

318
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,940
She often comes to take care of me.

319
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,940
She makes me run around.

320
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,940
Anu, why do you keep protecting me?

321
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:40,940
We can go out to play with the fairy.

322
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,940
It's dangerous out there.

323
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,940
I'm afraid that Anu will protect you.

324
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:46,940
Really?

325
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:50,940
I want to ask Anu to take care of you.

326
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,940
Princess!

327
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,940
I will come back today.

328
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,940
The whole country will be confused.

329
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,940
Remember, you must send someone to visit.

330
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,940
So that it won't happen.

331
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,940
Mama!

332
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:08,940
Anu!

333
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,940
Mama!

334
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,940
Anu!

335
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:12,940
Princess!

336
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,940
Princess, I have news!

337
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,940
I can hear you again.

338
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,940
She is a fairy.

339
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,940
She is a special one.

340
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,940
Anu, are you okay?

341
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,940
She is scared.

342
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:31,940
She is afraid of something.

343
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,940
Hurry up, we should go to her.

344
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,940
She is in pain.

345
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,940
Old man, what's wrong with you?

346
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,940
Old man!

347
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,940
Good boy, calm down.

348
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,940
Calm down.

349
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,940
Everything is fine.

350
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,940
Old man!

351
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,940
Don't cry.

352
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,940
Don't cry.

353
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,940
Old man!

354
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,940
Don't cry.

355
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,940
Don't cry.

356
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,940
Anu!

357
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:30,940
Princess, what happened?

358
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,940
Go tell His Majesty that you have an important news.

359
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,940
His Majesty is in a hurry.

360
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,940
I will go in person.

361
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,940
Your Majesty.

362
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:48,940
Do you think you can find the world?

363
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:52,940
Your Majesty, I have known about it.

364
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:56,940
I have never dared to guess your ability.

365
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:02,940
I believe you never disappointed me.

366
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:05,940
I believe you.

367
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,940
Do you remember three years ago?

368
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,940
Of course, I remember.

369
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,940
That day was the wedding of Yuan Xiao.

370
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,940
His Majesty was so kind.

371
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:19,940
He personally helped the people of the new marriage.

372
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,940
The world is not far from here.

373
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,940
You are the one who left that day.

374
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:30,940
You are the one who sent the letter to the people of Nan Zhao.

375
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,940
You brought the happiness back.

376
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:37,940
I wonder what you will bring back from the world.

377
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:45,940
Your Majesty, I have urgent news.

378
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,940
Let's talk about it tomorrow morning.

379
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,940
Your Majesty, it's urgent.

380
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,940
We can't delay it.

381
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,940
The star of the sea is shining.

382
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,940
Come, take it slow.

383
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,940
Look.

384
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,940
It's the Chief.

385
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,940
Chief!

386
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,940
Chief!

387
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,940
Chief!

388
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,940
Chief!

389
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,940
The power of this boy is getting higher.

390
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,940
Chief!

391
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:29,940
Chief!

392
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,940
Chief!

393
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,940
Chief!

394
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,940
Chief!

395
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,940
Chief!

396
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,940
Chief!

397
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,940
Chief, I miss you.

398
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,940
I miss you so much.

399
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,940
Chief, I miss you so much.

400
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,940
I miss you so much.

401
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,940
Really?

402
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:03,940
But there is a friend here.

403
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,940
He is suffering.

404
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,940
Chief!

405
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,940
How is your condition?

406
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,940
My friend, are you feeling unwell?

407
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,940
I am not talking to you.

408
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,940
My mother said you were in a bad mood.

409
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,940
I am not talking to you.

410
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,940
Four years!

411
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:49,940
Four years!

412
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:59,940
I have felt your pain and torture deeply.

413
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,940
Chief!

414
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:05,940
Mother!

415
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,940
My head is not hurting.

416
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:11,940
Remember, don't eat anything

417
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,940
when you listen to me.

418
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,940
Mother, that boy seems to be a good person.

419
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,940
Don't be silly and believe others.

420
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,940
Especially him.

421
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,940
Chief!

422
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,940
Chief, His Majesty asked to see you,

423
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,940
he is waiting to meet you.

424
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,340
Please tell me what you think.

425
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,820
We are together.

426
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,620
These years,

427
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,220
the South Zhao State is too peaceful.

428
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,060
The state is in a fight.

429
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,180
I really don't have any good intentions.

430
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,220
Are you happy?

431
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,340
By the way,

432
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,140
Zhong Gui is a mortal.

433
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,500
I miss my family.

434
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,820
I'm willing to.

435
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:07,180
I miss my daughter, Lin.

436
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,460
Lin?

437
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,940
I haven't seen her for ten years.

438
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,220
I'm so angry.

439
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,060
I don't have time to think about her.

440
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,660
I'm in a hurry.

441
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,820
I don't know how to help her.

442
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,100
Don't worry.

443
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,300
You will.

444
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:34,020
I see Lin's heart is shining.

445
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:37,700
This means she is living a happy life.

446
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:38,700
Really?

447
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,860
You are so biased.

448
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:44,060
You let down other children.

449
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,860
But Lin is my only daughter.

450
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,820
You can't say this.

451
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,540
You can't think about it.

452
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,220
You are a soldier of the State.

453
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,860
You have to be the daughter of all the children.

454
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,620
You have to care about them.

455
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,820
You have to care about them.

456
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,300
You are so polite.

457
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,140
You are so honest.

458
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:12,500
I understand how to do it.

459
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,380
I'm sorry.

460
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,780
I'm sorry.

461
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,780
I'm sorry.

462
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,780
I'm sorry.

463
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:34,780
I'm sorry.

464
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,780
I'm sorry.

465
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,780
I'm sorry.

466
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:37,780
I'm sorry.

467
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,780
I'm sorry.

468
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,780
I'm sorry.

469
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,780
I'm sorry.

470
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,780
I'm sorry.

471
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,780
I'm sorry.

472
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,780
I'm sorry.

473
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,780
I'm sorry.

474
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,780
I'm sorry.

475
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,780
I'm sorry.

476
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,780
I'm sorry.

477
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,780
I'm sorry.

478
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:49,780
I'm sorry.

479
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,780
I'm sorry.

480
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:51,780
I'm sorry.

481
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,780
I'm sorry.

482
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,780
I'm sorry.

483
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,780
I'm sorry.

484
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,780
I'm sorry.

485
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,780
I'm sorry.

486
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,780
I'm sorry.

487
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,700
I'm sorry.

488
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,700
I'm sorry.

489
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,700
I'm sorry.

490
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,700
I'm sorry.

491
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,700
I'm sorry.

492
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,700
I'm sorry.

493
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,700
I'm sorry.

494
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,700
I'm sorry.

495
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,700
I'm sorry.

496
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,700
Xiao Yao.

497
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,700
Xiao Yao.

498
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,700
My dear, you're awake!

499
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,700
You're awake!

500
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,700
Are you okay?

501
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,700
Shanshan.

502
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,700
Are you okay?

503
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,700
I'm okay.

504
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,700
My dear.

505
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:25,700
I ate the藥 you brought me.

506
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,700
I woke up.

507
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,700
Xiao Yao!

508
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,700
Although we were injured this time,

509
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,700
we have successfully completed our mission.

510
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,700
In this case,

511
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,700
we will be the first leaders of the party.

512
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:56,700
The first leader is still our senior Gao Ming.

513
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,700
He should not have come here yet.

514
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,700
I will kill you all.

515
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,700
Xiao Yao!

516
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,700
Master, you are back.

517
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,700
How is it?

518
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,700
It's fun to play in this prison.

519
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:59,700
Little brother, do you want to use this knife to kill me?

520
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,700
No, no, no.

521
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,700
Master, I just...

522
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,700
Why do I need a knife?

523
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:12,700
I hope you don't use this knife to cut vegetables for us.

524
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,700
Of course not.

525
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,700
Look, this knife is so sharp.

526
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:28,700
Master, why are you all injured?

527
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,700
How about I give you a doctor?

528
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,700
I tell you,

529
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,700
the doctor I treat is the best doctor in our town.

530
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,700
He will never hurt anyone.

531
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,700
If I treat him,

532
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,700
he will be so happy.

533
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,700
Let's go.

534
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,700
Don't bother us.

535
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,700
Let's go.

536
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,700
Okay, okay.

537
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,700
Take care.

538
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,700
I have something to do.

539
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,700
What am I doing?

540
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,700
They are selling vegetables.

541
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,700
Let's go to the toilet.

542
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,700
Xiao Zuo, you are awake.

543
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,700
You are so funny.

544
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,700
You are so funny.

545
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,700
You are so funny.

546
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,700
You are so funny.

547
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,700
You are so funny.

548
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,700
You are awake.

549
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,700
Look,

550
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,700
the monkey is still so funny.

551
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,700
What?

552
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,700
You are so funny.

553
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,700
Xiao Zuo.

554
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,700
What are you talking about?

555
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,700
You are so funny.

556
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,700
You are so funny.

557
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,700
I cut the knife for you.

558
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,700
I treat you to a drink.

559
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,700
You are so cheap.

560
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,700
What are you talking about?

561
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,700
You are so silly after you become a hero.

562
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,700
I am not a hero.

563
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,700
I am not a hero.

564
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,700
You are so funny.

565
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,700
You are so funny.

566
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,700
You are so funny.

567
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,700
You are so funny.

568
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,700
You are so funny.

569
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,700
They are all here to welcome you.

570
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,700
I don't understand

571
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,700
why no one is welcoming me

572
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,700
when I am back.

573
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,700
You are the one who is making a mess.

574
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,700
What are they doing?

575
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,700
You have been dizzy for days.

576
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,700
Do you know that?

577
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,700
What?

578
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,700
Say it.

579
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,700
What are you talking about?

580
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:15,700
What are you doing?

581
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:16,700
What?

582
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:17,700
What are you hiding?

583
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,700
You...

584
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:21,700
I am done.

585
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:24,700
Ding Lingling.

586
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:28,700
What are you doing?

587
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,700
You must have been hit by a shoe.

588
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,700
You should have had a drink.

589
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,700
You are so silly.

590
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:33,700
Where do I go to drink?

591
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:34,700
Of course, to the sea.

592
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,700
I go to the sea?

593
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,700
I was waiting for you at the pier two days ago.

594
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,700
I saw you were rushed by the waves

595
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,700
last night.

596
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,700
I asked you to come back.

597
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,700
Why do I go to the sea?

598
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,700
Li Dashen was sick two days ago.

599
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,700
You went to the island to get the medicine.

600
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:49,700
I told you.

601
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,700
I went to the new island to get the medicine.

602
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,700
Why did you write the letter?

603
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,700
That's a big thing.

604
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,700
Big thing?

605
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:57,700
Forget it.

606
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,700
My dad said that

607
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,700
people who drink sea water will become silly.

608
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,700
It's not possible to save them.

609
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,700
Since you are silly, I will be the boss.

610
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,700
What are you doing?

611
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,700
I think I have a long dream.

612
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,700
Have you seen a fairy?

613
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,700
Fairy?

614
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,700
Yes.

615
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,700
Brother Xiaoyao.

616
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,700
Do you remember the fairy?

617
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,700
Brother Xiaoyao.

618
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,700
Sister Xiaoyao.

619
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,700
Come on.

620
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,700
Let me put the shrimp.

621
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,700
Brother Xiaoyao.

622
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,700
I don't want to be a sister.

623
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,700
Okay.

624
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,700
You sit down.

625
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,700
How is it?

626
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,700
Brother Xiaoyao likes it.

627
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,700
Good girl.

628
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,700
What are you doing?

629
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,700
I think

630
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,700
if you really love a girl,

631
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,700
you can't go with other girls.

632
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,700
You know it.

633
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,700
Brother Xiaoyao.

634
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,700
What's wrong with him?

635
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,700
Brother Xiaoyao.

636
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,700
What's wrong with him?

637
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,700
What's wrong with him?

638
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,700
I made soup for my grandma.

639
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,700
I made him drink the soup.

640
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,700
I made him drink the soup.

641
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,700
I made him drink the soup.

642
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,700
My grandma died long ago.

643
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,700
Who said that?

644
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,700
I said it was Li Daxi.

645
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,700
Li Daxi.

646
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,700
Li Daxi.

647
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,700
Li Daxi.

648
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:25,700
What's wrong with him?

649
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,700
He's out of the palace.

650
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,700
What's wrong with him?

651
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,700
Are you okay?

652
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,700
Are you going to die?

653
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:52,700
You brat.

654
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,700
Can a dead man drink?

655
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,700
How do I know?

656
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,700
I've never died.

657
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:01,700
What?

658
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,700
I hate you.

659
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:03,700
Who do you think you are?

660
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,700
Tell me.

661
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,700
You ask me?

662
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,700
Let me tell you.

663
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,700
I'm the best in the world.

664
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,700
There are no enemies in the world.

665
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,700
There are no enemies in the world.

666
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,700
There are no enemies in the world.

667
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,700
It's easy.

668
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,700
Lin Xiaoyao.

669
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,700
Lin Xiaoyao.

670
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,700
Stop.

671
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,700
Lin Xiaoyao.

672
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,700
What's wrong with him?

673
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,700
Tell me.

674
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,700
Where is Yu Hengzhen?

675
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,700
Where is he?

676
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,700
Where is Yu Hengzhen?

677
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:39,700
What a coincidence.

678
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,700
Don't move.

679
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,700
What a coincidence.

680
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,700
Is it fun?

681
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,700
Brother.

682
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,700
You're so good at this.

683
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,700
You're so good.

684
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,700
Come on.

685
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,700
I'll teach you martial arts.

686
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,700
You still teach me martial arts?

687
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,700
I tell you.

688
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,700
I've fallen into the water before.

689
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,700
I'm unlucky.

690
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,700
I'm unlucky.

691
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,700
Do you know who I am?

692
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,700
I'm the best in the world.

693
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,700
I'll leave if I tell you.

694
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,700
Don't worry.

695
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,700
I know a place is full of wine.

696
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,700
Where?

697
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:26,700
There.

698
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,700
What's the best in the world?

699
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,700
It's a dead ghost.

700
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,700
Let's go.

701
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,700
Brother.

702
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,700
Brother.

703
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,700
They're crazy.

704
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:46,700
The Great Sky Tree

705
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:59,700
I brought the Great Sky Tree back from the Sea.

706
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,700
From today,

707
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,700
as long as the whole country is in the same state,

708
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:08,700
every morning, noon, and evening,

709
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,700
when the time comes to kneel down,

710
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:15,700
it will grow bigger and bigger.

711
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,700
A hundred years later,

712
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:22,700
its flower will bloom in the whole of Nanzhao.

713
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:24,700
By then,

714
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:28,700
Nanzhao will become another

715
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,700
Sky Tree.

716
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:43,700
Sky Tree

717
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:49,700
Sky Tree

718
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:55,700
Sky Tree

719
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:01,700
Sky Tree

720
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:07,700
Sky Tree

721
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:13,700
Sky Tree

722
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,700
You're so stupid.

723
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,700
You ask me to wash so much every night.

724
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,700
You pretend to be a demon.

725
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:26,700
No one in our family knows about it.

726
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,700
I'm so stupid.

727
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,700
I want to wash dishes and chopsticks.

728
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,700
I'm so stupid.

729
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:40,700
Let's go.

730
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:47,700
You come inside,

731
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,700
Brother***

732
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,700
You're so stupid.

733
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,580
Ignorance

734
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:57,900
Li Haha

735
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,700
It's weird here.

736
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,700
Yuqiang,

737
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,420
Didn't you call me front?

738
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,700
I...

739
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,700
How could it be you?

740
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:17,700
I said that no one can stop me from doing what I want to do.

741
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:32,700
Listen. I must teach you a lesson.

742
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,700
Someone's here.

743
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,700
Where?

744
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,700
Behind the castle.

745
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:56,700
You and I are destined to be together.

746
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,700
You're dead.

747
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,700
Good boy.

748
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,700
You're so crazy.

749
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,700
I'm not as stupid as you.

750
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,700
What's the point of a man?

751
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:11,700
I'll fly you to the castle.

752
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:17,700
You'll regret it in three days.

753
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:20,700
I'll call you grandpa if you regret it.

754
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,700
Just go.

755
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,700
Grandpa.

756
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,700
Hurry up.

757
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,700
Grandpa.

758
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,700
Hurry up.

759
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,700
Grandpa.

760
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:08,700
Go.

761
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,700
Who told you to see my grandpa?

762
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:15,700
I've told you.

763
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:17,700
I'll be back in five days.

764
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:18,700
What?

765
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,700
You'll regret it in two days.

766
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,700
It's been five days.

767
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,700
Forget it.

768
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,700
What's the point of a man?

769
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:34,700
Grandpa.

770
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:36,700
Grandpa.

771
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,700
Grandpa.

772
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,700
Grandpa.

773
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:06,700
I really don't want to know.

774
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:08,700
I finally understand.

775
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:11,700
Don't let go.
