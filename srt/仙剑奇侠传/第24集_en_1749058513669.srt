Tell me.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000

In this era,

31
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,600
Am I wrong to perceive Moses's presence like a OLED tablet?

32
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,800
Those who were present a long time ago

33
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,160

Both a sound and high

38
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,600
Both eyes

The people of the country are all dead.

60
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
The North China Sea Temple Desها hotel

61
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
ienstabilized tens of thousands people.

62
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
The crime dissolved from the crime Dou family!

63
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
The crime...​

64
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
killed him...

65
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The people of the country are all dead.

66
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
The women of the country the verdict would be completed soon.

67
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:51,440
greets the Chang

68
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:58,160
I'd rather be uniform, because then I'm not a demon.

69
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,360
What should I do?

70
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,480
Kill!

71
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,760

81
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,120
Kill! Kill!

82
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,080
Kill him.

83
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,080
Can you go back to the right path?

84
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,160
Wang Lin has been in the palace for 20 years.

85
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,560
Now he is like Wei Wenjing and Wei Yishi.

86
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,080
He can't wake up.

87
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,600
He is a man of his own.

88
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,880
He is a man of his own.

89
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,480
He is insolent and ungrateful.

90
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,360
He is greedy, despicable,

91
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,000
and despicable.

92
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,520
He is a man of his own.

93
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,680
He is evil.

94
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,760
He is a man of his own.

95
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,640
He is a man of his own.

96
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,640
He is a man of his own.

97
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,880
He is a man of his own.

98
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,600
He is a man of his own.

99
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,200
He is a man of his own.

100
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,920
He is a man of his own.

101
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,120
Master, I want to ask you.

102
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,120
Is what I did evil?

103
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,120
Yes.

104
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,240
How should I let go of the evil?

105
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,920
I have never been more powerful

106
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,560
for the country.

107
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,480
I have never been more powerful for the country.

108
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,800
How should I let go of the evil?

109
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,200
Do you know what evil is?

110
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,120
Do you know what evil is?

111
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,240
I want to ask you.

Have you ever felt what evil is?

114
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,840
Will you deserve none?

115
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,480
Man shall open the作.

116
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,120
Master, you know what evil is?

117
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,400
Which...

118
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,040
Of the divine.

119
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:31,560
Gelior

120
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,100

This is Hell

124
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,380
It's like theカクリル牧彗星

125
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,960
New Taste

126
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,800
Teacher.

127
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,720
I've told you before,

128
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,160
men should show their loveиваем way.

129
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,740
good desires for the evil

130
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,780
confess it했어요

131
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,280
본色相本来就是空

132
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,760
若心中不邂念

133
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,940
怎麼会被眼前所见

134
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:37,180
谦动情绪

135
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,220
你们说他是rock

136
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,180
他是吗

137
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,360
还是我们的内心才是魔鬼

138
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,360
You are a ghost!

139
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,360
Stop talking nonsense!

140
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,360
I just want to ask you one thing!

141
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,360
Are you going to kill or not?

142
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,360
I just want to find the way out.

143
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,360
But the answer is not here!

144
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,360
Hurry! Take these two demons down!

145
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,360
Take these two demons down!

146
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,360
Prime Minister!

147
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,360
You...let me die!

148
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,360
Maybe it's fate.

149
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,360
I can't get the Immortal.

150
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,360
They are going to catch me.

151
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,360
You can revive me!

152
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,360
Do you think it's possible?

153
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,360
No!

154
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,360
What's wrong with you?

155
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,360
Madam!

156
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,360
You still have to go back with them!

157
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,360
No!

158
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,360
Madam!

159
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,360
Madam!

160
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,360
Madam!

161
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,360
Madam!

162
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,360
Madam!

163
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,360
I have been using you since I was a child.

164
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,360
I came to Mount Zu and saved them from the tower.

165
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,360
If you are telling the truth,

166
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,360
then everything is your conspiracy.

167
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,360
Yes.

168
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,360
You are all fake to me.

169
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,360
We were enemies.

170
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,360
I hate you guys!

171
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,360
You...

172
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,360
Don't ask!

173
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,360
I don't love you.

174
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,360
Cut me up!

175
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,360
rels!

176
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,200
Jiang Ming!

177
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,600
Jiang Ming and Yao Hu.

178
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,400
You two have no way back.

179
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,400
I'll ask you one more time.

180
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,840
Do you want to go back?

181
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,080
Do you admit your mistake?

182
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,960
Jiang Ming!

183
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,440
I can't go back.

184
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,880
I won't regret it.

185
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,400
I won't.

186
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,840
You!

187
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,040
I didn't have a life.

188
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,640
I was an orphan.

189
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,040
Thank you, master.

190
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,400
Thank you, father.

191
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,920
I'll repay you for your life.

192
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,400
I'll kill him now.

193
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,400
Master!

194
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,400
Master!

195
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,400
Ming!

196
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,400
Master!

197
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,400
Ming!

198
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,400
Why didn't you hit me?

199
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,400
I'll kill you.

200
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,400
Everything is over.

201
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,400
Wu'er!

202
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,400
Wu'er!

203
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,400
Wu'er!

204
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,400
I was an orphan.

205
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,400
Although I had a master,

206
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,400
I still had a father and a wife.

207
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,400
But I was still an orphan.

208
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,400
I'm not good.

209
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,400
I'm not good.

210
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,400
Let's go!

211
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,400
Let's go!

212
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,400
Brother Xiao, take care of master.

213
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,400
Master!

214
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,400
What happened?

215
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,400
What happened in the cellar?

216
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,400
What happened?

217
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,400
The number of dead disciples in the prison

218
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,400
is not a problem.

219
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
You're the one who caused it.

220
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,400
I'm willing to do it.

221
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,400
You're willing?

222
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,400
Jiang Ming.

223
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,400
His ghost soul is a demon.

224
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,400
He killed all the disciples in the mountain.

225
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,400
He escaped from the place where he wanted to go.

226
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,400
He was told before he died.

227
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,400
How could it be like this?

228
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,400
Brother Xiao said that

229
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,400
a man should always think about his own life.

230
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,400
I'm willing to do it.

231
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,400
One year later

232
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:24,740
Between Mount

233
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,000
and Yisse,

234
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,260
Master Tai was a master at the Jinyin Decibel

235
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,980
Master Tai, the beloved son of General Jiang,

236
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,420
the beloved disciple of Jiang Ming,

237
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,620
has finally entered the Demon Realm.

238
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:37,020
Master Tai, you have hurt yourself.

239
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,620
You will never face the ancestors again.

240
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,740
Here, this drink.

241
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:16,940
Master Tai has given two of the last如果你.

242
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,740
I'm telling you, please go to the Rotor One through the rice cooker.

243
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,660
Thus the girl can now enter the water by itself

244
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:25,260
from the entrance to the pond.

245
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,260
and the master of the clan, Qi Yi.

246
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,260
Qi Yi,

247
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:44,260
all the things related to Jiang Ming's daughter's wish and the tower,

248
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:47,260
all the disciples of Shushan, will never be mentioned.

249
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,260
All the records related to Jiang Ming,

250
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:53,260
everything of them are all returned to them.

251
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:57,260
Jiang Ming's name seems to have never been mentioned.

252
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,260
From that day on,

253
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:03,260
the Shushan Sect was completely lost.

254
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:11,260
After many years, all the disciples of the clan have passed away.

255
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,260
The darkest history of Shushan

256
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:16,260
is now unknown.

257
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:20,260
Except for the mother and the brother of the sword,

258
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:27,260
the Shushan Sect has been destroyed.

259
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:35,260
Although all the records of Jiang Ming have been burned,

260
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:39,260
but the master set up a memorial in the palace

261
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:42,260
and has been sincerely giving it to him.

262
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:45,260
He hopes that he can help him to get to the top soon.

263
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,260
His memorial has not been able to be rewritten.

264
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:54,260
It's not easy to give him a memorial.

265
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:59,260
So Jiang Ming's soul has been left in the tower.

266
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:02,260
He can't leave.

267
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:09,260
Drink it, Jiang Ming.

268
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,260
Now you two are ghosts.

269
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,260
Do you know why we didn't let you in?

270
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,260
Are you scared?

271
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:20,260
Do you think we'll be scared?

272
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:23,260
Yes. It's not enough to lie to a child.

273
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:26,260
You're so mean.

274
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,260
If you were the girl you mentioned,

275
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:32,260
you would do everything.

276
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,260
What nonsense are you talking about?

277
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:38,260
Someone told me a story in the wilderness.

278
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,260
I know that it must be you.

279
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:43,260
The Shushan Sect must be your brother.

280
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,260
Who is that Shushan Sect?

281
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,260
You're so loud.

282
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,260
You can't be serious.

283
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,260
Forget it.

284
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,260
There's no secret.

285
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,260
There's no secret at all.

286
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,260
It's the queen.

287
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,260
It's Ling'er's mother.

288
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,260
You...

289
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,260
She and I are even cleaner than water.

290
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,260
Master, you told me before.

291
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,260
You gave me your lamp.

292
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,260
This is another story.

293
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,260
What?

294
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:24,260
You and another woman have another story?

295
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,260
No, you're a fake.

296
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,260
What do you know?

297
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,260
Then tell me.

298
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,260
I won't say.

299
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,260
You're a senior.

300
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,260
You're a senior.

301
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,260
You're a senior.

302
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:40,260
Since you have a relationship with the queen,

303
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:43,260
why did she take Ling'er away and make her 70 years old?

304
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:46,260
I know that I have a lot to do.

305
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,260
I must ask her what she's thinking.

306
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,260
I don't care what she thinks.

307
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:53,260
I must save Ling'er.

308
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,260
You can't do that.

309
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,260
Ling'er.

310
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:17,260
You're too much.

311
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,260
I'm more handsome than you.

312
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,260
You're useless.

313
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,260
You can't kiss me or bite me.

314
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,260
It's your responsibility.

315
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,260
Who told you to be my master?

316
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,260
I've prepared it.

317
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,260
I'll make you embarrassed.

318
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,260
You want to see me?

319
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,260
Yes.

320
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,260
Isn't this your sword?

321
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,260
Give it to me.

322
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,260
Take it.

323
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,260
Don't touch my mother.

324
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,260
Hey, you don't need it.

325
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,260
What do I use it for?

326
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:51,260
I'm a strong sword.

327
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,260
Take it.

328
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,260
Protect your self-respect.

329
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,260
Give me a strong one.

330
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,260
Give me a strong one.

331
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,260
And these talismans.

332
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,260
You can use them in the tower.

333
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:07,260
And this bamboo.

334
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:09,260
It's not good for your hair.

335
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:12,260
You can use it to protect yourself.

336
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,260
And this carrot.

337
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,260
Hey, you're too much.

338
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,260
I can't take it.

339
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,260
You can keep it.

340
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:23,260
You're so stupid.

341
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,260
What's this wine?

342
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,260
It's called the Drinking God.

343
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,260
It's used to make wine.

344
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,260
Wine?

345
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,260
Yes.

346
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:38,260
I'm a strong man.

347
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:41,260
I can only use this kind of wine.

348
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,260
But you're too stingy.

349
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,260
You drink so much.

350
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,260
Why are you so stingy?

351
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,260
You hear me?

352
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,260
You're too stingy.

353
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,260
This is too powerful.

354
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,260
You've used wine many times.

355
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:00,260
You're too stingy.

356
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,260
You'll use this every time.

357
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,260
You'll be able to use all your spiritual power.

358
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,260
So remember.

359
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,260
Unless you die,

360
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,260
you can't use this.

361
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,260
So?

362
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:15,260
You're so smart.

363
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,260
I see.

364
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,260
And...

365
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,260
You're so handsome.

366
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,260
What's your skill?

367
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:45,260
This is the first Wanyue tree and the first cloud tree.

368
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,260
It's the perfect skill for the Qing and Huai.

369
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,260
This is the most important skill.

370
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,260
Awesome.

371
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,260
Is it useful when you're in the treasure?

372
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,260
And the last one.

373
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:59,260
You've learned it.

374
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,260
You'll be safe and sound.

375
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,260
Do you want to learn it?

376
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,260
Yes.

377
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:05,260
Tell me.

378
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,260
Don't be so stingy.

379
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,260
I won't learn it.

380
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:17,260
I won't learn it.

381
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,260
Take care.

382
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,260
Thank you, Shun Bu.

383
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,260
Thank you.

384
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:11,260
I'm not afraid of the earth.

385
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,260
I'll protect Ling Er and Sheng Liang.

386
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,260
Hey!

387
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,260
What's wrong?

388
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,260
You're making me nervous.

389
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,260
I'm afraid you'll be too fast.

390
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,260
I don't know who will kill you.

391
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,260
That old man.

392
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,260
He's a good man.

393
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:38,260
What's wrong?

394
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,260
Are you nervous?

395
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,260
It's not the first time.

396
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,260
What's so nervous?

397
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,260
What's the first time?

398
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,260
The second time.

399
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,260
So many times?

400
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,260
I'm counting them all.

401
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,260
You've met him since the first time we met.

402
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,260
You...

403
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,260
What's wrong?

404
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,260
You're a loyal friend to me.

405
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,260
No.

406
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,260
I like you after I've become a good friend.

407
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,260
I see.

408
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,260
What do you mean?

409
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,260
You like me?

410
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,260
I hate you too.

411
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,260
I don't care.

412
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,260
You promised me to be with me.

413
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,260
I see.

414
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,260
I'm done.

415
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,260
I'm done.

416
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,260
I'm done.

417
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,260
Let's go.

418
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,260
But we...

419
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,260
Close the door.

420
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,260
I have a way.

421
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,260
What are you doing?

422
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,260
You'll know later.

423
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,260
What's wrong?

424
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,260
I'm not afraid of you.

425
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,260
I'm afraid of you.

426
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,260
I'm afraid of you.

427
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:17,400
Step

428
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:33,420
You've learned to fly at a元house.

429
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,420
Miss Erni, where do you want to go?

430
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:38,420
I want to go to the Sea of Heaven.

431
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,420
Okay, let's go.

432
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,420
What's wrong?

433
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,420
What's wrong?

434
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,420
Is that what we should do?

435
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:48,420
You already know what you know.

436
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:52,420
You don't need to know what you don't know.

437
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:55,420
Why do you keep asking?

438
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,420
What about Ling'er?

439
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:02,420
Do you want to know my answer?

440
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:06,420
Or you can't accept the fact?

441
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,420
People are so kind.

442
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,420
But we should be busy.

443
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,420
I don't think so.

444
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,420
She's the daughter of the Empress.

445
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,420
What about Ying'er?

446
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,420
Li Xiaoyao.

447
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,420
What?

448
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,420
Why do you still want to disperse Xiaoyao and Ling'er?

449
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,420
No.

450
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:17,420
I just want to be a good person.

451
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,420
Why do you want to do that?

452
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,420
Tell me.

453
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:25,420
Even if you want to escape, you can prove it.

454
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:29,420
Prove Xiaoyao's feelings for Ling'er?

455
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:32,420
Why do you want to be a good person?

456
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:37,420
Why do you want a girl who has been suffering for 70 years?

457
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:42,420
70 years is just a deadline.

458
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:46,420
It's Li Xiaoyao's deadline.

459
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:49,420
You want to let Ling'er go after Xiaoyao is dead?

460
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:54,420
That's good for both of them.

461
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:58,420
Ling'er, you don't care about her at all.

462
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,420
Why do you care?

463
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:03,420
She's suffering.

464
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:07,420
She's suffering because she's been abandoned by her beloved.

465
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,420
She's suffering because she's been left behind.

466
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,420
It's just a matter of time.

467
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:15,420
If Li Xiaoyao can see through this,

468
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,420
it's her fate.

469
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,420
Everyone has his own choice.

470
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:23,420
Do you want to let Xiaoyao be as good as you?

471
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:26,420
She's a smart girl. She has her own talent.

472
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,420
If she knows how to let go,

473
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:32,420
she'll have great benefits no matter she's a martial artist or a human.

474
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:37,420
Even so, why do you want her to be the same as Xiaoyao?

475
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:40,420
Jiang Yuxi will be the same as Zhang Zhizhi.

476
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,420
If she makes a few mistakes,

477
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,420
she'll be much bigger than him.

478
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,420
I don't understand.

479
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,420
It's your right.

480
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,420
Everyone has his own choice.

481
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,420
What do you mean?

482
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,420
The person who abandoned her beloved

483
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:57,420
made her suffer.

484
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,420
She got married to someone else

485
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,420
and even sacrificed herself.

486
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:06,420
This is your mistake.

487
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:11,420
You're still in charge of this at this moment.

488
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,420
You killed Wu Hou.

489
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:16,420
Why do you want this tragedy to happen?

490
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,420
So you still don't understand.

491
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:21,420
Yes, I don't understand.

492
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,420
Junior.

493
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,420
Look.

494
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,420
This is my heart.

495
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,420
Junior.

496
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,420
What is the matter?

497
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:47,420
You know you're in danger.

498
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,420
You're not saved.

499
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,420
You're not saved.

500
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,420
This is the Taoism.

501
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,420
This is the wisdom.

502
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:58,420
You didn't see the wisdom in the water.

503
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:01,420
What you see is the surface of the water.

504
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,420
Look.

505
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,420
Look at you in the water.

506
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:10,420
You can't see yourself in the confusion.

507
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,420
You can't see the water.

508
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,420
You can't see the Taoism.

509
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:17,420
You know how to take it.

510
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,420
You can't let it go.

511
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,420
If this is the Taoism,

512
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:24,420
I'll use your Taoism to solve my problems.

513
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:27,420
Let it stop.

514
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:32,420
Just like what you did to me.

515
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,420
You dare not

516
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:41,420
or you can't?

517
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,420
When the ancient times began,

518
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:53,420
all the things in the world were divided into Yin and Yang.

519
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:55,420
So there are the heaven and earth,

520
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:58,420
and there are the curse and the evil.

521
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,420
Yin and Yang are united.

522
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:02,420
They are not lacking in anything.

523
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:04,420
They are not close to each other.

524
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,420
They are not united.

525
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,420
There is a legend.

526
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,420
Every person who comes out of this world

527
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:13,420
is actually just a half body.

528
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,420
One must find the other half.

529
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,420
The only other half.

530
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,420
This kind of life

531
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:23,420
can be called completely.

532
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:26,420
As long as you take the curse on the side,

533
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,420
find the other half's owner,

534
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:32,420
these two will be blessed by God.

535
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:36,420
They will love each other forever.

536
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:41,420
Today, I give this curse to someone.

537
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,420
No need. Thank you.

538
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:47,420
This is for you.

539
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:51,420
I'm willing to give it to you.

540
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:55,420
I'm on my way to Mount Zu to learn from you.

541
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,420
Does this have anything to do with it?

542
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,420
I'm going to join the Taoist sect.

543
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,420
I don't want to be a girl anymore.

544
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,420
Why?

545
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,420
Why not?

546
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,420
I heard that

547
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,420
you can join the Taoism and practice without hesitation.

548
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:12,420
This is the highest level of martial arts.

549
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,420
What is the highest level?

550
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,420
The world is the highest level.

551
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,420
What is the highest level?

552
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,420
There is no one to be the top.

553
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,420
The top is the highest level.

554
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:24,420
Aren't you the one who stands at the top?

555
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:27,420
Are you not your enemy?

556
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,420
You have teeth in your mouth,

557
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,420
but you have no teeth in your teeth.

558
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:34,420
People have their own limits.

559
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:37,420
In addition, you should only be the highest level of the Taoism.

560
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:40,420
Why don't you follow your heart?

561
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:43,420
The Taoism is to follow your heart.

562
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:46,420
To follow your heart is to follow your mind.

563
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,420
That's the real Taoism.

564
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,420
No one can know that.

565
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,420
No one can know that.

566
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,420
Taoism is to follow your heart.

567
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,420
As long as you understand this,

568
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:59,420
you will not be the top.

569
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:05,420
Although I don't understand what you are saying,

570
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:08,420
I like your saying,

571
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:11,420
Taoism is to follow your heart.

572
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,420
We are destined to be together.

573
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:20,420
That's why I gave you the half of the Taoism.

574
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,420
You are the Taoism of the mountain.

575
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,420
That's your fate.

576
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:29,420
I hope you can use your own Taoism to get rid of the doubt.

577
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:32,420
You need to give it to someone.

578
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:36,420
Maybe you can solve a problem.

579
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:40,420
A hundred years of love.

580
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:45,420
You think you can solve it?

581
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:09,420
Taoism is to follow your heart.

582
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:12,420
As long as you understand this,

583
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:15,420
you will not be the top.

584
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:18,420
That's your fate.

585
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,420
No one can know that.

586
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:24,420
That's your fate.

587
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:27,420
No one can know that.

588
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:30,420
That's your fate.

589
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:33,420
No one can know that.

590
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:36,420
Taoism is to follow your heart.

591
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:39,420
That's your fate.

592
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:42,420
No one can know that.

593
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:45,420
That's your fate.

594
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,420
No one can know that.

595
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:51,420
That's your fate.

596
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:54,420
No one can know that.

597
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:57,420
That's your fate.

598
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:00,420
No one can know that.

599
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:04,420
No one can know that.

600
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:34,420
Wow.

601
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,420
Wow.

602
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,420
So awesome.

603
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:39,420
The way you are,

604
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:42,420
you are the most beautiful.

605
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:45,420
Although you are a little green,

606
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:48,420
but you are just a sword.

607
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:51,420
Not a sword.

608
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:54,420
A sword? What kind of sword?

609
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:57,420
When you are in Mount Shushan,

610
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:00,420
you will understand what is the real sword.

611
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:03,420
What about the introduction?

612
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:07,420
You will become a great weapon.

613
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:10,420
But you will be far from the Taoism

614
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:13,420
for your cleverness.

615
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:17,420
The world is small,

616
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:21,420
but the world is not.

617
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:24,420
You are so clever.

618
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:29,420
Give me a good gift.

619
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:24,420
What should I do?

620
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:27,420
I am afraid that I will be defeated.

621
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:30,420
I am afraid that I will be defeated.

622
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:33,420
I am afraid that I will be defeated.

623
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,420
I am afraid that I will be defeated.

624
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:39,420
I am afraid that I will be defeated.

625
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:42,420
I am afraid that I will be defeated.

626
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:45,420
I am afraid that I will be defeated.

627
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:49,420
I am afraid that I will be defeated.

628
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:52,420
I am afraid that I will be defeated.

629
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:55,420
I am afraid that I will be defeated.

630
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:58,420
I am afraid that I will be defeated.

631
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:01,420
I am afraid that I will be defeated.

632
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:04,420
I am afraid that I will be defeated.

633
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:07,420
I am afraid that I will be defeated.

634
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:10,420
I am afraid that I will be defeated.

635
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:13,420
I am afraid that I will be defeated.

636
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:16,420
I am afraid that I will be defeated.

637
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:19,420
I am afraid that I will be defeated.

638
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:22,420
I am afraid that I will be defeated.

639
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:25,420
I am afraid that I will be defeated.

640
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:28,420
I am afraid that I will be defeated.

641
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:31,420
I am afraid that I will be defeated.

642
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:34,420
I am afraid that I will be defeated.

643
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:37,420
I am afraid that I will be defeated.

644
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:40,420
I am afraid that I will be defeated.

645
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:43,420
I am afraid that I will be defeated.
