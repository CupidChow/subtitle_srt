I'm not afraid of you.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Who is this person?

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Why do you punish me like this?

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What wrong have I done?

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,400
Who can tell me?

22
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,920
You're so humble.

23
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,760
You're so kind.

24
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,760
Brother Xiaoyao.

25
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,480
Brother Xiaoyao.

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,280
Taste骂

27
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,920
Ling Er.

28
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,320
Lady.

Who are you?

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,080
You are my wife.

38
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,080
Do you like me?

39
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,080
No.

40
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,080
Is it possible?

41
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,080
I love you.

00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,080
I love you.

44
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,080
Let's take a rest.

45
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,080
Come.

46
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,080
I made you some snacks.

47
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,080
Come.

48
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,080
Where do you want to go?

49
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,080
You can go anywhere.

50
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,080
Are you happy?

51
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,080
I am.

52
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,080
I will go wherever you like.

53
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,080
The snacks are so delicious.

54
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,080
Who made them?

55
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,080
It's you.

56
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,080
Aunt, I made them for my wife.

57
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,080
What did you call me?

58
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,080
It's been years.

59
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,080
It's your first time calling me aunt.

60
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,080
Ling'er, what's wrong with her?

61
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:16,080
Aunt, I cleaned the hall today.

62
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,080
You can take a rest.

63
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,080
What are you doing?

64
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,080
I don't have money for you.

65
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,080
I don't want anything.

66
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,080
You have been taking care of me for years.

67
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,080
I have a wife now.

68
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:50,080
I should grow up and take care of you and my beloved wife.

69
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,080
Are you dying?

70
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,080
No, my wife changed me.

71
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,080
I feel happy now.

72
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,080
Xiaoyao, are you all right?

73
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,080
I am fine.

74
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,080
Ling'er, you are too much.

75
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,080
I have been drinking for half my life.

76
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,080
I didn't pay the bill.

77
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,080
I didn't expect you to change.

78
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,080
It must be Bodhisattva.

79
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,080
It's so dangerous.

80
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,080
I have to burn the incense.

81
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:30,080
Let's go to the wedding.

82
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,080
My wife.

83
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,080
Look at the garden.

84
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:40,080
They are looking at us.

85
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,080
Brother Xiaoyao.

86
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,080
Brother Xiaoyao.

87
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,080
Brother Xiaoyao.

88
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,080
Brother Xiaoyao.

89
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,080
Brother Xiaoyao.

90
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,080
Brother Xiaoyao.

91
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,080
Brother Xiaoyao.

92
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,080
Give me your hand.

93
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:08,080
My wife, whatever you want, I can give it to you.

94
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,080
I don't believe you.

95
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,080
You are not a single person.

96
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,080
Why do you love me?

97
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,080
Only if you really love me,

98
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,080
this forest will be engraved on your hand.

99
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,080
If I don't love you,

100
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,080
she will be gone.

101
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,080
If you don't love me,

102
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,080
she will disappear.

103
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,080
I don't have any worries.

104
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,080
I won't leave you.

105
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,080
Even if I have to be separated,

106
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,080
I will still wait for you.

107
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,080
I will do my best.

108
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,080
I will always have a day

109
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,080
when I can wait for your news.

110
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,080
You will believe me.

111
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,080
My wife.

112
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,080
Are you not feeling well?

113
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,080
How about I find a doctor for you?

114
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,080
Brother Xiaoyao.

115
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:26,080
I will turn you back to normal.

116
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:34,080
I married a weak and kind wife.

117
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:40,080
How could I be normal?

118
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:51,080
My wife, I love you.

119
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,080
I don't have any worries.

120
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,080
I won't leave you.

121
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,080
I will always have a day when I can wait for your news.

122
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,080
You will believe me.

123
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,080
Only if you really love me,

124
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,080
this forest will be engraved on your hand.

125
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,080
If I don't love you,

126
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,080
she will be gone.

127
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,080
If I don't love you,

128
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,080
she will be gone.

129
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,080
If I don't love you,

130
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,080
she will be gone.

131
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,080
If I don't love you,

132
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,080
she will be gone.

133
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,080
I don't have any worries.

134
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,080
I won't leave you.

135
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,080
I will always have a day

136
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,080
when I can wait for your news.

137
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,080
You will believe me.

138
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,080
Only if you really love me,

139
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,080
this forest will be engraved on your hand.

140
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,080
If I don't love you,

141
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,080
she will be gone.

142
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,080
If I don't love you,

143
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,080
I will always have a day when I can wait for your news.

144
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,080
You will believe me.

145
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,080
You will believe me.

146
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,080
Only if you really love me,

147
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,080
this forest will be engraved on your hand.

148
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,080
The forest will be engraved on your hand.

149
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,080
Look at this.

150
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,080
You're here.

151
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,080
The forest is engraved on your hand.

152
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,080
If I don't love you,

153
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,080
this forest will be engraved on your hand.

154
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,080
Good.

155
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,080
A great sword.

156
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,080
You went to Nanzhao this time.

157
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,080
You will find a lot of difficulties on the way.

158
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:36,080
Take this sword with you.

159
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,080
I'm afraid of her.

160
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,080
She's afraid of me.

161
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,080
Your father left this to you.

162
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,080
She left this to you.

163
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,080
Why did she leave it to me?

164
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,080
Your father knew that you can't stay in this house.

165
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,080
He's afraid that you will leave the house someday.

166
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,080
It's good to have this sword with you.

167
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,080
Didn't they forget me?

168
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,080
You silly boy.

169
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,080
You can forget everything.

170
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,080
You won't forget your own child.

171
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,080
I only know that they left.

172
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,080
Don't you want to know why they left?

173
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,080
I don't want to know who cares about me.

174
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,080
I don't want to hear it.

175
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,080
Fine. I won't tell you.

176
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,080
But, Mr. Li.

177
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,080
If you want to know,

178
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,080
tell me.

179
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,080
Fine.

180
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,080
I'll tell you.

181
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,080
Some people don't listen.

182
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,080
Xiaoyao's parents

183
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,080
may not be a good parents.

184
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,080
But they can be called

185
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,080
a good family.

186
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,080
They can't be a good family.

187
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,080
They can't be a good family.

188
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,080
They can't be a good family.

189
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,080
More than ten years ago,

190
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,080
the family was called a good family.

191
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,080
They are his parents.

192
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,080
No wonder I'm a son of Tianzi.

193
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,080
Some people don't listen.

194
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,080
You are a bad woman.

195
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,080
You can hear it in the village.

196
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,080
I'll tell you.

197
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,080
The Dragon-cared-Demon-Eye?

198
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,080
You taught me this.

199
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,080
I taught you.

200
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,080
This is your father's third school.

201
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,080
This is your father's blood.

202
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,080
You should practice well.

203
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,080
This old man is so interesting.

204
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,080
You are a bad man.

205
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,080
You are a bad man.

206
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,080
Don't be like the old man.

207
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,080
You should know it.

208
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,080
You should know it.

209
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,080
I know.

210
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,080
I'll practice well.

211
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,080
I'll take care of you.

212
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,080
You are a bad man.

213
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,080
I'm the only one left.

214
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,080
I'm so afraid of the future.

215
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:04,080
I don't know how to explain it to the ancestors.

216
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,080
Okay, my dear.

217
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,080
I promise you.

218
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,080
I'll have ten monkeys every day.

219
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,080
I'll play with you.

220
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,080
Okay.

221
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,080
But you should be good at it.

222
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,080
Of course.

223
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,080
You are a bad man.

224
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,080
How about we find a man

225
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,080
and get into our family?

226
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,080
You are a bad man.

227
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,080
How dare you take my mother away?

228
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,080
You are a bad man.

229
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,080
I won't hit you.

230
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,080
You should find a man.

231
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,080
If there is no man in the family,

232
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,080
who will give you a beating?

233
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,080
Who will scold you?

234
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,080
Here you are.

235
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,080
Good luck.

236
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,080
Good luck.

237
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,080
Good luck.

238
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,080
I've never been so crazy.

239
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,080
You are so silly.

240
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,080
Have fun.

241
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,080
Good luck.

242
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,080
Good luck.

243
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,080
Good luck.

244
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,080
Good luck.

245
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,080
Trust me.

246
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,080
Thank you for your help.

247
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,080
You are so kind.

248
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,080
Send me a message.

249
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,080
I...

250
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,080
Good luck.

251
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,080
Good luck.

252
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,080
Good luck.

253
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,080
Good luck.

254
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,080
Trust me.

255
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,080
Of course, Li Ping is going to win.

256
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:30,080
But I am not doing this for money.

257
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,080
I am sending her to the southern state

258
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,080
for Miss Ling'er.

259
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,080
Do you understand?

260
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,080
I don't.

261
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,080
What are you talking about?

262
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,080
What do you mean?

263
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,080
I want to know

264
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,080
what is his relationship with her?

265
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,080
I...

266
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,080
Let me do it.

267
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,080
Xiaoyao and I have always been friends.

268
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,080
We are like brothers and sisters.

269
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,080
There is nothing else.

270
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,080
Xiaoyao is mine now.

271
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,080
Don't forget.

272
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,080
What am I doing?

273
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,080
You are so mean.

274
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,080
You are so mean.

275
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,080
I want to apologize to you two.

276
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:14,080
You always think I am husband and wife.

277
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,080
I am sorry.

278
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,080
Miss Ling'er.

279
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,080
Take care.

280
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,080
Remember to take good care of your sister.

281
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,080
I swear.

282
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,080
Miss Ling'er.

283
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,080
I am so worried.

284
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,080
I want to leave the country.

285
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,080
I want to see the world.

286
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,080
I am so worried.

287
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,080
I want to leave.

288
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,080
But...

289
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,080
Miss Ling'er.

290
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,080
I will come back.

291
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,080
I will come back.

292
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,080
I will come back.

293
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,080
I will come back.

294
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,080
I will come back.

295
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,080
I will come back.

296
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,080
You are so mean.

297
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,080
You are so mean.

298
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,080
What is wrong with you?

299
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,080
You just want to see the world.

300
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,080
You will be in trouble when he comes back.

301
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:14,080
You will be in trouble.

302
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,080
What's wrong?

303
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,080
What's wrong?

304
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,080
Where is Miss Ling'er?

305
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:33,080
That is where I grew up.

306
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,080
I have lived with my grandma.

307
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,080
I never left her.

308
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,080
It's where I lived with my grandma.

309
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,080
I've never left my brother.

310
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,080
Tell me, what can you see now?

311
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,080
It's the sky and the water.

312
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,080
I'll tell you.

313
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,080
I don't know if I can see it.

314
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,080
I saw the wild peach blossom in the mountains.

315
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,080
There's an old man there. His name is King Wu.

316
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,080
His daughter is Ling'er.

317
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,080
He'll be happy if he sees you.

318
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:30,080
So I'll send you back to Zhao City safely.

319
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,080
That's what you really want.

320
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:37,080
Ling'er, I'm so tired.

321
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,080
Ling'er, let's go inside.

322
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,080
It's so cold.

323
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:07,080
Why do you come in?

324
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,080
There are three stars.

325
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,080
Isn't it better?

326
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,080
Master, you know.

327
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,080
You want to bring back the idea

328
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,080
from the fairy island?

329
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,080
It's wrong.

330
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,080
But it's a bit different from my idea.

331
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,080
What do you mean?

332
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,280
Please come back.

333
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,000
You need time,

334
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,080
patience and etiquette.

335
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,680
I understand.

336
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,080
I'd like to go to the Central Plains myself.

337
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,640
Just find Anu back.

338
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,160
Yes.

339
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,600
With Anu,

340
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,440
you will definitely come back.

341
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,120
Anu.

342
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,720
Uncle Bai Ye.

343
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,520
Uncle Bai Ye.

344
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,400
What place do you want to sleep?

345
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,000
It's really comfortable here.

346
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,680
You come up too.

347
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,600
Uncle Bai Ye.

348
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,240
We are so funny.

349
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,640
Where do we go?

350
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,040
That's what people should be like.

351
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,640
Do you want to eat?

352
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,880
Do you really like to eat?

353
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,760
Of course.

354
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,640
In my favorite food,

355
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,000
I eat the first thing,

356
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,240
and sleep the second.

357
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,360
Uncle Bai Ye.

358
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,920
What's the story today?

359
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,600
Let's play a game today.

360
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,600
OK.

361
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,800
Everyone is smart.

362
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,840
Very smart.

363
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,800
What's your favorite

364
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,680
besides the first and second?

365
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,560
I think it's gone.

366
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,600
I remember.

367
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,840
The world is peaceful.

368
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,640
The world is peaceful?

369
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:37,240
You want to kill all the people in the world?

370
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,120
No.

371
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,760
The first thing Anu hates is war.

372
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,040
The first thing Anu hates is killing.

373
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,360
The first thing Anu hates is death.

374
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,280
No.

375
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,240
These are all the things Anu hates.

376
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,440
None of them is the first.

377
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,320
Uncle Bai Ye.

378
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,800
What's your favorite?

379
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,320
Not yet.

380
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:58,880
Where's the first one?

381
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,040
Not yet.

382
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,920
You don't like anything?

383
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,440
You can't say that.

384
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,040
What's your favorite?

385
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,200
My favorite thing

386
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,840
is over there.

387
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,680
Where?

388
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,000
That magic wand.

389
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,520
They are together again.

390
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,760
Have you seen it?

391
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,160
At the age of six,

392
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,520
my mother found that there are five stars in the sky.

393
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,680
She told me to see it.

394
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,880
But it seems that many people died.

395
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,440
And the people died.

396
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,480
This magic wand

397
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,760
will bring people happiness.

398
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,080
Really?

399
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,520
As long as there are six stars,

400
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,080
the world will be better.

401
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,440
Better?

402
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,360
Great.

403
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,040
What will happen?

404
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,840
There will be no war and no fool in the world.

405
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,240
Everyone is smart.

406
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,200
Everything is beautiful.

407
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,320
Then it's like Anu.

408
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,240
Great.

409
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,160
Where's the sixth star?

410
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,840
Over there.

411
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,840
It's too dark.

412
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,480
I can't see it clearly.

413
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,280
The sixth star

414
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,840
is our princess.

415
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,760
Princess is a star.

416
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,040
You can say that.

417
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,480
As long as the princess comes back,

418
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,840
she will show her power with magic wand.

419
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,720
A new state will appear.

420
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,640
No war?

421
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,520
No fool?

422
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,040
As long as the princess comes back,

423
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,240
everything will be fine.

424
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,040
Great.

425
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,400
Uncle Dai Yu,

426
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,080
although I don't know what you are talking about,

427
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,720
I will bring the princess back.

428
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,720
Where?

429
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,920
Over there.

430
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Ling'er, Ling'er, wake up.

431
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Ling'er.

432
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
We are almost there.

433
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,000
You are so sleepy.

434
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,320
Brother Zhan Yao,

435
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,520
you can't just nod your nose.

436
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,520
Why?

437
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,840
Because I only like to be nodded.

438
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Tap tap.

439
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,320
I'll help your dad.

440
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:34,920
Theكr,

441
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:42,720
I

442
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,720
Let's take a look.

443
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,720
Ling'er, look.

444
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,720
Hurry up.

445
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,720
Look at Ling'er.

446
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,720
Ling'er.

447
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,720
Brother Xiangyang.

448
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,720
Ling'er.

449
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,720
Ling'er.

450
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,720
Ling'er.

451
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,720
Ling'er.

452
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,720
Ling'er.

453
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,720
How dare you to harm my grandfather?

454
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,720
Do you know what you did?

455
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,720
Arrest him.

456
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,720
Yes.

457
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,720
Stop.

458
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,720
Are you all right?

459
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,720
I'm fine.

460
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,720
Move away.

461
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,720
How dare you to harm my grandfather?

462
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,720
Get out of here.

463
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,720
Stop.

464
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,720
You can leave.

465
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,720
Ling'er, are you all right?

466
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,720
I'm fine.

467
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,720
Why are you still burning?

468
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,720
I'm fine.

469
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,720
Find a doctor for him.

470
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,720
You're so stubborn.

471
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,720
If it weren't for him,

472
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,720
we wouldn't have been like this.

473
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,720
Ling'er, let's go.

474
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,720
Ling'er.

475
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,720
Let's go out and see the stars.

476
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,720
Did you see them?

477
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,720
I saw them.

478
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,720
You're annoying.

479
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,720
Miss, can I give you a hand?

480
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,720
All right.

481
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,720
Ling'er.

482
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,720
Ling'er.

483
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,720
Ling'er.

484
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,720
Ling'er.

485
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,720
Ling'er.

486
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,720
Ling'er, be careful.

487
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,720
Ling'er.

488
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,720
Ling'er.

489
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,720
Ling'er.

490
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,720
Ling'er, don't worry.

491
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,720
I'll go find the bottle.

492
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,720
Don't worry.

493
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,720
Ling'er, I'm sorry.

494
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,720
I'm sorry.

495
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,720
Is anyone there?

496
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,720
Is anyone there?

497
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,720
Is anyone there?

498
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,720
I'm going to find the bottle.

499
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,720
Open the door.

500
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,720
Open the door.

501
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,720
Is anyone there?

502
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,720
Ling'er.

503
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,720
Ling'er.

504
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,720
Ling'er.

505
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,720
Ling'er.

506
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,720
Ling'er.

507
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,720
Ling'er, don't do it.

508
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,720
Don't push.

509
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,720
Ling'er.

510
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,720
Ling'er.

511
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:57,720
Don't push.

512
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,720
Mom.

513
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,720
Don't push.

514
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,720
Mom.

515
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,720
What's wrong?

516
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,720
What's wrong?

517
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:32,720
I'm sorry.

518
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,720
I'm sorry.

519
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,720
Come back.

520
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,720
I'm sorry.

521
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,720
Don't hit me.

522
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,720
Brother Xiaoyang, don't hit me.

523
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,720
Don't blame yourself.

524
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:05,720
Brother Xiaoyang, it's not good for me.

525
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:11,720
If it wasn't for me, I wouldn't have been born.

526
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,720
Brother Xiaoyang, don't hit me.

527
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,720
Brother Xiaoyang, don't hit me.

528
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,680
I...

529
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,520
What?

530
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,280
Okay.

531
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,400
Brother Xiaoyao.

532
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,440
Brother Xiaoyao.

533
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,520
Don't say that.

534
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,520
You can leave now.

535
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,160
I 시�ve it.

536
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,520
Feng!

537
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,000
Come on.

538
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,040
Please take him away.

539
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,680
Brother Xiaoyao,

540
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,960
why are you still president?!

541
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,720
长安, They tried to rush tell me.

542
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,720
It was Older Brother who called me.

543
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,720
Why?

544
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:45,720
Older Brother told me that he wanted to return to Nanzhao.

545
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,720
He wanted to go home and see the Du Juanjuan.

546
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,720
So he called me and took him back.

547
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,720
No, you lied to me.

548
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,720
Look.

549
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,720
That's Nanzhao.

550
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,720
He's going home.

551
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,720
What?

552
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:21,720
He told me that he would wait for us at the Du Juanjuan in Nanzhao Palace.

553
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,720
Thank you, Brother Xiaoyao.

554
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,720
Great.

555
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,720
Let's go upstairs.

556
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,720
Older Brother, we will meet again.

557
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,720
Older Brother,

558
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,720
I will go back to see you.

559
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:39,720
The End

560
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,720
9997, 9998, 9999, 9

561
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,720
I'm so tired.

562
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,720
Try it.

563
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,720
I'll try it.

564
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,720
Try it.

565
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,720
One more piece.

566
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,720
It's good.

567
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,720
How is it?

568
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,720
The bun.

569
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,720
The bun.

570
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,720
The bun is good.

571
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,720
It's so hot.

572
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,720
What's wrong?

573
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,720
The bun is hot.

574
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,720
Are you okay?

575
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,720
It's so hot.

576
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,720
It's hot.

577
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,720
It's hot.

578
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,720
Hurry up.

579
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,720
Stop.

580
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,720
You little thing.

581
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,720
How dare you steal my food?

582
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,720
Brother, sister, forgive me.

583
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,720
I'm hungry.

584
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,720
Where are your father and mother?

585
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,720
My father and mother don't want me anymore.

586
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,720
I'm so tired.

587
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,720
You're so tired.

588
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,720
Come on.

589
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,720
I'll take you to the kitchen.

590
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,720
Come on.

591
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,720
Come on.

592
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,720
Come on.

593
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:10,720
Come on.

594
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:11,720
Come on.

595
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,720
You little thing.

596
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,720
You're so big.

597
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,720
Come on.

598
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,720
Come on.

599
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,720
I'm hungry.

600
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:46,720
He finished it.

601
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,720
Brother, sister, I'm hungry.

602
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,720
You're hungry again?

603
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,720
And...

604
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,720
Brother, I'm hungry.

605
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,720
What's this?

606
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,720
I know this kind of bone.

607
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,720
It's called a bone.

608
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,720
Bone?

609
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,720
What's the use?

610
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,720
I don't know.

611
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,720
I don't know.

612
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,720
Then just keep it.

613
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,720
I guess it can be used as a bait.

614
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,720
Do you have a way to take it?

615
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,720
What do you think?

616
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,720
I'm not hungry.

617
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,720
Boss.

618
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,720
Boss.

619
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,720
Boss.

620
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,720
Boss.

621
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,720
Come on.

622
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,720
What do you want to order?

623
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,720
I've told you so many times.

624
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,720
You're still here?

625
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,720
Sorry, sir.

626
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,720
Because the new shop is close to your place.

627
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,720
I'm here to see you.

628
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,720
I hope you can call me.

629
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,720
You're so silly.

630
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,720
Let me tell you.

631
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,720
We're not a small family.

632
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,720
I'm going to eat the most expensive dish in your shop.

633
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,720
The most expensive?

634
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,720
Of course.

635
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,720
I'm going to order a green vegetable fried beef.

636
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,720
How about it?

637
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,720
Is it expensive enough?

638
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,720
Do you have any other dishes?

639
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,720
Yes.

640
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,720
Two bowls of rice.

641
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,720
Two bowls of rice?

642
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,720
Wait.

643
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,720
What else?

644
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,720
A chopstick.

645
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,720
A chopstick.

646
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,720
Brother Xiang Yao.

647
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,720
Green vegetable fried beef is a very expensive dish.

648
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,720
Of course.

649
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,720
Dear fellow villagers.

650
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,720
We've had enough.

651
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,720
Please have a rest.

652
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,720
We're going to eat well today.

653
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,720
I'll take my leave.

654
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,720
Do you still remember me?

655
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,720
Yes, I do.

656
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,720
I'm just a scholar.

657
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,720
How are you?

658
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,720
I'm fine.

659
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,720
Thank you for your concern.

660
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,720
You're lucky.

661
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,720
You're lucky.

662
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,720
You're lucky.

663
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,720
You look like a hero I met ten years ago.

664
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,720
Wen Wen Wen.

665
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,720
Who's he?

666
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,720
Brother Xiang Yao.

667
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,720
He?

668
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,720
I'm just a literary and not a martial artist.

669
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,720
But you're not a heroine.

670
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,720
Thank you for your appreciation.

671
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,720
Thank you for your appreciation.

672
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,720
By the way,

673
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,720
I have some chicken soup over there.

674
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,720
Do you want to try it?

675
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,720
No, I've ordered some dishes for Brother Xiang Yao.

676
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,720
Have some soup.

677
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,720
It's warm.

678
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,720
It's good.

679
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,720
What's that?

680
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,720
Miss, please.

681
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,720
Brother Xiang Yao.

682
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,720
This is what I can eat every day.

683
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,720
Have a try.

684
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,720
I've ordered the most expensive dish.

685
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,720
Green vegetables with beef.

686
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,720
I'll have a meal.

687
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,720
Let's go back and drink.

688
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,720
Brother Xiang Yao, what are they laughing at?

689
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,720
Ling'er, wait for me here. I'll be right back.

690
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,720
How's it going?

691
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,720
Have you thought about it?

692
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,720
That girl is really a bad girl.

693
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,720
Of course.

694
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,720
I'm the one who's a bad girl.

695
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,720
Why hasn't Brother Xiang Yao come back?

696
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,720
I'm really angry.

697
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,720
You don't like this kind of scene?

698
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,720
It's too noisy.

699
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,720
You have to take care of yourself.

700
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,720
See you later.

701
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,720
Goodbye.

702
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,720
Is it dangerous for Lord Zhuang Yuan?

703
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,720
Ling'er.

704
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,720
You're waiting for me at the wine house?

705
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,720
Brother Xiang Yao, Lord Zhuang Yuan is in danger.

706
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,720
Really?

707
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,720
No way.

708
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,720
That's right.

709
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,720
Two men were really fierce just now.

710
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,720
They went to the back of the house with him.

711
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,720
I'm afraid they'll bully Lord Zhuang Yuan.

712
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,720
I think they're his subordinates.

713
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,720
No.

714
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,720
Let's go.

715
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,720
I'll give you this.

716
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,720
Come with me.

717
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,720
Go and have a look.

718
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,720
No.

719
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,720
Okay.

720
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,720
Lord Zhuang Yuan is helping me.

721
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,720
You can help me.

722
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,720
How is it?

723
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,720
Is it good?

724
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,720
Okay.

725
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,720
I'll go and have a look.

726
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,720
It's nothing serious.

727
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,720
Lord Zhuang Yuan.

728
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,720
Help me.

729
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:38,720
Why did you hit him?

730
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,720
He's so noisy.

731
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,720
He's pretending to be a devil.

732
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,720
What's wrong with you?

733
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,720
Me?

734
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,720
He's so serious.

735
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,720
Pei Jian.

736
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,720
You're so poor.

737
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,720
How much do you want me to pay?

738
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,720
Ten taels of silver.

739
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,720
There are a hundred men here.

740
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,720
You're badly injured.

741
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,720
You'd better take the money to see the best doctor.

742
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,720
I'll go and get them.

743
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,720
I'll go and get them.

744
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,720
I'll go and get them.

745
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,720
I'll go and get them.

746
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,720
I'll go and get them.

747
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,720
I'll go and get the best doctor.

748
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,720
He's so small.

749
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,720
You want ten taels of silver?

750
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,720
Yes.

751
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,720
I'll give him ten taels of silver.

752
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,720
Let me see.

753
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,720
You're not a paper.

754
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,720
What are you talking about?

755
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,720
I'm a minister.

756
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,720
I'm a minister.

757
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,720
I'm not leaving.

758
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,720
Go.

759
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,720
Thank you for saving my life.

760
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,720
Take care of the doctor.

761
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,720
What?

762
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,720
Other than telling me,

763
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,720
I'm just kidding.

764
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,720
You're so bold and bold.

765
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:48,720
You're not even able to tell me.

766
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,720
The doctor of Suzhou

767
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,720
is with you.

768
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,720
He's in Jingyuan.

769
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,720
You can live here.

770
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,720
You can save your life.

771
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,720
I want to save you and Ling'er.

772
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,720
Please.

773
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,720
Let's go.

774
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,720
It's so beautiful here.

775
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,720
It's so beautiful here.

776
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,720
It's not big enough.

777
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,720
But there are many servants

778
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,720
who live here.

779
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,720
There are many servants.

780
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,720
There are many servants.

781
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,720
They're all here.

782
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,720
Okay.

783
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,720
You have a lot of servants.

784
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,720
This is not my home.

785
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,720
What?

786
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:56,720
My home is Chang'an.

787
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,720
This is my home.

788
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,720
He must be a great person.

789
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,720
He's not that great.

790
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,720
Ling'er, I heard that

791
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,720
Suzhou beef noodle is delicious.

792
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:14,720
It's right in front of us.

793
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,720
Hurry up.

794
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:16,720
Hurry up.

795
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,720
Hurry up.

796
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,720
Don't go.

797
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,720
Don't run.

798
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,720
Don't go.

799
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:38,720
Why is the horse so powerful?

800
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,720
It's so pitiful.

801
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:42,720
We have to help them.

802
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,720
Okay.

803
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:44,720
We'll help you.

804
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,720
Let's see if we can get rid of the evil.

805
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:58,720
You two.

806
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:02,720
We really love each other.

807
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,720
Miss.

808
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,720
Please help us.

809
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:06,720
You don't deserve this.

810
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:08,720
Miss.

811
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:09,720
Please forgive us.

812
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:10,720
I've never stopped you two.

813
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:11,720
You have to take care of her.

814
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,720
You can't afford to eat and sit in the restaurant.

815
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:14,720
We can't afford you.

816
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,720
We're in a bad situation.

817
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,720
Brother Xiaoyao.

818
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,720
Help them.

819
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:19,720
Okay.

820
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:20,720
I'll go and help them.

821
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:21,720
Wait.

822
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:22,720
She's so powerful.

823
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:24,720
Don't be afraid.

824
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,720
I'm invincible.

825
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:28,720
Stop.

826
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,720
Stop.

827
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:44,720
Help, Xiaoyao.

828
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:47,720
Miss.

829
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:48,720
They're so pitiful.

830
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,720
Let them go.

831
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,720
I'll do whatever you say.

832
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:01,720
I'll go and help them.

833
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,720
Don't say anything.

834
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,720
I don't want to understand.

835
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:42,720
At least I still have a beautiful dream.

836
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:45,720
What do you say?

837
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,720
I really don't want to understand.

838
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,720
I finally understand.

839
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,720
I should let go.

840
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,720
Don't say anything.

841
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,720
I'll go and help them.
