It isn't the thing.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's the weak man again.

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's the wrong way.

Why didn't you just call me out on purpose?

50
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,280

You didn't let go of him?

59
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,280

64
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,280
He must be a native of Shushan.

65
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,280
Jiang Ming.

66
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,280
You're right.

72
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,280
Please wake up.

73
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,280
He's so cold.

74
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,280
He's been suffering for a hundred years.

75
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,280
He's been suffering for a hundred years.

76
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,280
He stayed in the city for a hundred years.

77
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,280
That day,

78
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,280
that moment,

79
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,280
he never left the country.

80
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,280
You can't go back to the capital.

81
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,280
Do you recognize your mistake?

82
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,280
I'll kill him first.

83
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,280

84
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,280

00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,280

88
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,280
Kill.

89
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,280
Xiaogong.

90
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,280
Xiaogong.

91
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,280

92
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,280

96
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,280

Xiaogong.

108
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,280
Xiaogong.

109
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,280
Let's go.

110
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,280
I'm so sorry.

111
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,280
Don't go to the Demon Hall.

112
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,280
Don't suffer again.

113
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,280
Go to the Jile Palace.

114
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,280
You'll be fine.

115
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,280

They are the same as yours.

00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,180
The heaven and the earth are endless.

Master!

198
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,180
Master!

199
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:35,180
Children! Children!

200
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,180
No!

201
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,180
No!

202
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,180
No!

203
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,180
No!

204
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,180
No!

205
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,180
No!

206
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,180
No!

207
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,180
My God!

208
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:03,180
I am the only one who is afraid of the world.

209
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:08,180
Children are innocent.

210
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,180
They are innocent.

211
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,180
My God!

212
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,180
No!

213
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:40,180
Please, Master and brothers,

214
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,180
and...

215
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,180
and Brother Jiang Ming,

216
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,180
please,

217
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:50,180
and don't be hurt.

218
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:18,180
No!

219
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,180
Master.

220
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,180
Master.

221
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,180
Master.

222
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,180
Master.

223
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,180
Master.

224
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,180
Master.

225
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,180
Master.

226
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,180
Don't cry,

227
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,180
I am fine.

228
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,180
No.

229
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:11,180
Nothing will happen to me.

230
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,180
I am saying you won't kill them.

231
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,180
Please, don't.

232
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,180
No.

233
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:23,180
I have been doing this for years.

234
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,180
I will do it myself.

235
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,180
I...

236
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,180
Master,

237
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,180
don't be afraid.

238
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,180
Master.

239
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:23,180
Master, let me die.

240
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:25,180
Let me die.

241
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,180
I want to be with you.

242
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:30,180
I want to be with you forever.

243
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,180
I will die for you.

244
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:38,180
I will die for you.

245
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,180
I will die for you.

246
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:44,180
I will die for you.

247
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,180
I will die for you.

248
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,180
I will die for you.

249
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:57,180
We will never be together.

250
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:00,180
We will never be in pain.

251
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,180
You can go.

252
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,180
I will die for you.

253
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:12,180
I have been doing this for years.

254
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,180
I will do it myself.

255
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:19,180
Go.

256
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,180
Master.

257
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,180
Master.

258
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,180
Master.

259
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,180
Master.

260
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:38,180
Master.

261
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:42,180
Master.

262
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:53,180
I was born to let my father be with me forever.

263
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:56,180
I didn't deserve to be a demon.

264
00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:00,180
Buddha is the first one to be a demon.

265
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:04,180
He did this to me.

266
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:09,180
My mother was seriously damaged.

267
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,180
She was not worried.

268
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:15,180
She was struggling for me.

269
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,180
She was suffering.

270
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,180
But three months later,

271
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:25,180
she couldn't bear to go to the forest.

272
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:29,180
You were born in three months.

273
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:35,180
My mother's root was half of the soil.

274
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:38,180
I was born in the ninth city.

275
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:41,180
I was born to be a demon.

276
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:44,180
I couldn't bear to be a demon.

277
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:47,180
I was forced to take her weapon.

278
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,180
That's why I became human.

279
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:53,180
But she was too weak to use her weapon.

280
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:56,180
I forgot that there was a human.

281
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,180
But she was not weak.

282
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:02,180
How can she be strong?

283
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:05,180
She has been suffering for 500 years.

284
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:12,180
Miss, we can understand your feelings.

285
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:15,180
We lost our mother and her.

286
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,180
Don't worry.

287
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,180
We will do our best to help you and Senior Jiang.

288
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,180
Right?

289
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:25,180
The only way is to let her king get the super power.

290
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,180
But I have a lot of fun.

291
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,180
Is that so?

292
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,180
Maybe it's fate.

293
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:34,180
We can't let outsiders in.

294
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:37,180
But we can't let them in.

295
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:40,180
We must help Senior Jiang.

296
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,180
You're right.

297
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,180
But I'm very stubborn.

298
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:49,180
Are you sure?

299
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:53,180
No matter what, we have to be stubborn.

300
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:56,180
We must help Senior Jiang.

301
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:59,180
What's more important is that no one can stop me.

302
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:03,180
I must get the power to save Ling'er.

303
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,180
Chou Dan, what's wrong?

304
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,180
Are you all right?

305
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,180
I'm fine.

306
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,180
What's wrong?

307
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:40,180
What's wrong?

308
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,180
What's wrong?

309
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,180
Don't scare me.

310
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,180
Chou Dan, are you all right?

311
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,180
Don't scare me.

312
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,180
Brother Li.

313
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,180
I'm fine.

314
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,180
I'm fine.

315
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,180
Let's go.

316
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,180
Brother Li.

317
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,180
Brother Li.

318
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,180
Who can come here to fight for me?

319
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,180
We are the two of us.

320
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,180
We are the two of us.

321
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:29,180
We are the two of us.

322
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,180
I'll go with you.

323
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,180
When men are in the police,

324
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,180
women should stay away from us.

325
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,180
Then you should be careful.

326
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:59,180
Who can come to answer me?

327
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,180
Uncle Jiang, I'm here.

328
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:08,180
Go to Miao Miao and Huang Wang first.

329
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,180
Then go to Chang Zi Ji first.

330
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:13,180
Then go to Chang Zi Xiong.

331
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:24,180
Are you okay?

332
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,180
I've lost.

333
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:55,180
I just want to talk to you.

334
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,180
This sword is useless.

335
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,180
I'll go with you.

336
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,180
I'll go with you.

337
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,180
I'll go with you.

338
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,180
I'll go with you.

339
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,180
I'll go with you.

340
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,180
I'll go with you.

341
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,180
I'll go with you.

342
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,180
I'll go with you.

343
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,180
I'll open everything.

344
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:26,180
After all, it's been 100 years.

345
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,180
Who are you?

346
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:38,180
Maybe I'm the one who can help you open a hundred years of a new life.

347
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,180
You?

348
00:29:49,180 --> 00:30:04,460
According to brothers who appraise Qin Yiling as Princess Qing

349
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,800
thank you

350
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:11,100
It is you

351
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,180
Older Brother

352
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:23,180
Father, I saw it. It's different from us.

353
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,180
Who did he see?

354
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:35,180
Senior, I'm sorry to say that I can't enter the Demon Tower in private.

355
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:39,180
I can't ask you to be at ease. Please forgive me.

356
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:42,180
Senior, are you okay?

357
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,180
You still call me Senior?

358
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,180
Of course.

359
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:52,180
You still think you don't understand?

360
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,180
What?

361
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,180
I don't deserve you.

362
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,180
Why?

363
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,180
Look.

364
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:58,180
My sin is very, very...

365
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:08,180
No, you didn't do anything bad.

366
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:10,180
Actually...

367
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:14,180
You saved dozens of brothers and our master.

368
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:17,180
They all gave birth to heaven and passed on to joy.

369
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:20,180
In order to avoid the suffering of the world.

370
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,180
What did you say?

371
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:26,180
Although they all died in your sword, they became innocent.

372
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,180
But they got the super power.

373
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:33,180
To get this chance, they were able to meet the heaven and earth.

374
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:38,180
You said everything I did was wrong.

375
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,180
Instead of saving them...

376
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,180
That's exactly what happened.

377
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,180
I'm sorry.

378
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,180
You're so ridiculous.

379
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:03,180
You did something wrong from the most reasonable angle in the world.

380
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:06,180
But we came out from the red light.

381
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:08,180
You did something good.

382
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:10,180
There are evidences and evidences.

383
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:13,180
There are evil and evil in the world.

384
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:17,180
All the disciples who sacrificed that day should have hated you.

385
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:20,180
But when they understood the truth,

386
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:23,180
they were grateful to you.

387
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:29,180
Do you know what you're talking about?

388
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:35,180
Is it really that hard to understand?

389
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:41,180
It seems like I need to give you some real examples.

390
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:17,180
Is it really about time for you to say something?

391
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,180
Master...

392
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:40,180
It's a huge millstone.

393
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,220
跳来跳来

394
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,660
Bachelor.

395
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,220
Sorry that...

396
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:15,380
Everyone, put them here.

397
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:19,300
si Unders tirar

398
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,360
Engineers, get in the presto handled

399
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,220
You still can't let her go, right?

400
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:49,060
Actually, she has already obtained it.

401
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,180
Really?

402
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,460
Actually, she has passed through the time of joy

403
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:55,460
earlier than the master and the brother.

404
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,860
But she is a demon.

405
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:00,220
A demon is just a form.

406
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:03,180
That day, when she gave you the gold,

407
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,180
you already obtained it.

408
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:08,580
What you said is true.

409
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,540
So you know the truth.

410
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,460
No matter if it's a human or a demon,

411
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:14,540
whether it's a ghost or a beast,

412
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,620
how can you not know it?

413
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,500
It's not limited.

414
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,220
She has already clearly understood

415
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,300
that no matter how much she sees it, she will be in the midst of

416
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:25,300
the demon, the ghost and the beast.

417
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,580
Good.

418
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:46,700
If what you said is true,

419
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:51,380
then that's great.

420
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:05,100
Senior Brother, let me help you to get on the horse.

421
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:13,580
Why can't I get on the horse?

422
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:20,580
Senior Brother, is there anything that I can't let go of?

423
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,460
Actually, everyone has forgiven her.

424
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:25,380
There is someone more important that can't forgive her.

425
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,580
Who?

426
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,980
Senior Brother, he himself...

427
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:37,980
Senior Brother, they have already let go of it.

428
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,780
There is only one left.

429
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:46,580
For the past 100 years, I have been staying that day.

430
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:56,180
Because I am still in the right and evil world.

431
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,980
I am afraid that I will be lost.

432
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:03,380
I really want to find the answer.

433
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:07,780
But I have never found it.

434
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:11,380
This is the last thing that I have done.

435
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:16,580
But it is a mess.

436
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:19,980
A mess.

437
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:26,180
Yes. Maybe this is your fate.

438
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:29,180
The fate of a girl is a blessing.

439
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:35,980
If you can handle it, you will have more gifts than other people.

440
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:47,180
That day, I was in the same closed door.

441
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:53,980
I was in the dark and dark world.

442
00:38:54,180 --> 00:39:00,380
Yes. Actually, if you pass that gate, you will definitely get it.

443
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:06,580
Unfortunately, I am too greedy. I can't save myself.

444
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:11,980
The heaven and earth are all in the dark and dark.

445
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:15,780
I am the one who caused all this.

446
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,980
I am not a person.

447
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:22,380
I am not a person. I am not a person.

448
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,780
I am a person who can't be saved.

449
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,780
Why am I meeting you today?

450
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,780
If I had met you earlier,

451
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:37,780
maybe all of you would have been in the dark.

452
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:40,780
I am not a person.

453
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:43,780
I am not a person.

454
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,780
I am not a person.

455
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,780
I am not a person.

456
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,780
I am not a person.

457
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,780
Maybe all of you...

458
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:59,780
No. It is hard to explain between us.

459
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:03,780
It is hard to define who is learning.

460
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:07,780
If it's not me, you and Miss Niu Yuan,

461
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,780
then I am not me.

462
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:14,780
You have been obsessed with it for 100 years.

463
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,780
It is a process.

464
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,780
It is a process of getting the gold.

465
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:21,780
The more dark it is, the more you will not be brave.

466
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:25,780
On the one hand, everything you have done 100 years ago is a mistake.

467
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:28,780
But you have become a blessing.

468
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,780
I was obsessed with everything.

469
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:35,780
Then I re-enacted my senior's plan.

470
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:40,780
Because you made me find the way out of the jade rice in the jade.

471
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:42,780
And I made a decision.

472
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:45,780
You saved my life today.

473
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:50,780
If it is not you, I will never be able to reach the end of the jade.

474
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:53,780
And you saved Niu Yuan.

475
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:57,780
If I did not touch you, he would not be able to raise himself.

476
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:00,780
He could only be saved in the jade ring.

477
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,780
The rest of us are the same.

478
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:08,780
Actually, our existence, including humans, demons, gods and demons,

479
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,780
are all dependent on each other.

480
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:15,780
We take the other person to recognize and feel our existence.

481
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:18,780
Do you remember the name of the Tao?

482
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:21,780
In fact, there is no bad or good.

483
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,780
There is no evil or good.

484
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:26,780
There is no ugly or beautiful.

485
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,780
When we are pursuing and recognizing beauty,

486
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,780
we need the existence of evil.

487
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:38,780
Evil is actually an important assistant to recognize beauty.

488
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:43,780
Now it seems that the jade rice is the main reason.

489
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:48,780
Because your existence is more successful for more people.

490
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:57,780
The ugly road is perfect.

491
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:02,780
The dark is bright.

492
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:07,780
Evil will be bright in life.

493
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:10,780
Yes, that is right.

494
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,780
Do I still have a chance?

495
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:18,780
The Tao is there.

496
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,780
It has always existed.

497
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:23,780
There is no time or place to return to.

498
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:26,780
You found it and you understand it.

499
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,780
You have got it.

500
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:36,780
Do you think so?

501
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:41,780
It was saved so that I can plan it.

502
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:44,780
I am~!

503
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:47,780
I have a girl named Luoren.

504
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,780
Luoren.

505
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,780
Luoren Posthumous Weavier.

506
00:42:54,780 --> 00:43:01,840
I also have a

507
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:03,180
Hahaha

508
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:04,380
Hahaha

509
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,080
Hahaha

510
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,760
Hahaha

511
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:10,980

519
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:33,420
Don't think about controlling me anymore.

520
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:35,060
Wei Ni Hao, do you know?

521
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:39,260
He is also in the phase we experienced before.

522
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:45,060
We should not experience it ourselves.

523
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,220
Only then can we understand.

524
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:50,500
We should use our power to let go.

525
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,100
You don't let him experience it.

526
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:55,700
How can he be confident?

527
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:58,100
You can follow him, but you can't let him understand.

528
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,980
He won't understand it one day.

529
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:01,980
He won't understand it one day.

530
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:07,420
It's my experience to break the cage.

531
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,260
Do you understand?

532
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:13,900
He is a great master.

533
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:16,260
Everything is a process.

534
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:19,500
He will be able to guide others.

535
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:24,100
Young man, practice hard.

536
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,340
You will be great.

537
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:29,180
I don't have your eyes.

538
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:32,140
We practice hard.

539
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:35,620
We can play with my evil woman.

540
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:44,380
No matter what, you should be brave.

541
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:47,820
What do you want to say?

542
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:49,620
Understand it yourself.

543
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,700
You will understand everything when you are there.

544
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:55,380
You are so strange.

545
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:57,580
Wan Er.

546
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:02,860
I met you only in the first year.

547
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:14,620
I have to

548
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:19,540
think of you carefully.

549
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:25,260
Thank you.

I'm afraid I'll be lost

555
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:38,180
Don't say anything

556
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:41,180
I don't want to understand

557
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:47,180
At least I still have a beautiful dream

558
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:51,180
Don't say anything

559
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:55,180
I really don't want to understand

560
00:46:55,180 --> 00:47:00,180
I finally understand that I should let go

561
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:04,180
Don't say anything

562
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:08,180
I don't want to understand

563
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:14,180
At least I still have a beautiful dream

564
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:18,180
Don't say anything

565
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:22,180
I really don't want to understand

566
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:27,180
I finally understand that I should let go
