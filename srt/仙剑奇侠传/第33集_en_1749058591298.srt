1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not afraid of you.

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Do you know what this is?

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I don't know.

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Not long ago,

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
ten years ago,

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
you wanted to change the history.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You didn't let Ling'er

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
return to the Fairy Island.

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You didn't let our brothers find her.

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You didn't even let yourself find her.

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You thought

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
everything was changing.

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Don't look at me.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm right.

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You hate me.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You hate me for not changing anything.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Why did you

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
send her to a safe place?

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
After you came back,

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
everything didn't change.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You did it?

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Do you know

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
you sent her to the Fairy Island?

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
No.

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The Fairy Island is in the east of Nanzhao.

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I sent her to the west that day.

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You found that

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
there was no sunset?

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Right?

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What do you think?

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Don't you think it's strange?

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
There is no such thing as strange.

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The most strange thing is that

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
you and your crazy men are living in this world.

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Don't you think

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
this is a strange thing?

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Don't be so stupid.

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You must be the one who is being weird.

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You're wrong.

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
There is a explanation.

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
The land we live in

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
is actually a garden.

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
A round ball.

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Do you think I'm as stupid as the others?

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Actually, it's a crime.

60
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
When you find out the truth,

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
you'll hate yourself.

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
That day,

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
you thought the place where you sent Ling'er

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
was the safest island in the west.

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But I tell you,

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
that is the real Fairy Island.

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Nonsense.

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I was going in the opposite direction.

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
How could I send her back?

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Then how do you explain

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
that everything didn't change?

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm not sure.

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm not sure.

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm not sure.

75
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Could it be that

76
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
the land we live in

77
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
is a garden?

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Xiao Yao

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
was so crazy

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
that she went around

81
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
and didn't see the sun.

82
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
She went west

83
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
and thought

84
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
she could go far away

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
but she didn't think

86
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
she could go back to the garden.

87
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You understand.

88
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You're not my brother.

89
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You should understand

90
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
that you can change the history.

91
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But you're not aware of it.

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Why did you come here?

93
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Why did you come here?

94
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Why did you come here?

95
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Why did you abandon me?

96
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Why?

97
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Because you'll be disappointed

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
if you answer the question.

99
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Why?

100
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Because you'll be disappointed

101
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
if you answer the question.

102
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Absolutely.

103
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Fine.

104
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I won't ask you.

105
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Tang Yu

106
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
please be careful.

107
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'll kick you to death

108
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
and you'll be mad.

109
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Why?

110
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Why did you come to the Moon Sect?

111
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I don't know

112
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
but you won't understand.

113
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The Moon Sect

114
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
made me understand that

115
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
the past is a nightmare.

116
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It made me know

117
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
what truth is.

118
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
How could you lie to her?

119
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You're the only ones who are.

120
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Have you ever thought

121
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
why the Moon Sect

122
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
didn't lock you up?

123
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm afraid

124
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
you're not aware.

125
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You'll be disappointed

126
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
if you answer the question.

127
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I won't be mad

128
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
if you answer the question.

129
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'll kick you to death

130
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
and you'll be mad.

131
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You'll be mad.

132
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Right.

133
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I almost forgot to tell you

134
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
that I'm looking for

135
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Ling'er and Shenggu.

136
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Don't forget that

137
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm your good friend.

138
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Bastard!

139
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You're the dog

140
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
that we need to fight.

141
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You're too much.

142
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Too much.

143
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Xiao Yao,

144
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
don't you feel anything?

145
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You're so angry

146
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
when you enter the Moon Sect.

147
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm just thinking

148
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
what Qi wants to do.

149
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What does he want to do?

150
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Maybe I can't accept

151
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Qi's leaving us.

152
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
But I always think

153
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Qi is doing something.

154
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Maybe he's still here.

155
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Why didn't I think of that?

156
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
We can't discuss

157
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
everything.

158
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
We'll talk about Qi's matter later.

159
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You should go back.

160
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Are you all right?

161
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Did something happen to the Moon Sect?

162
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
No.

163
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Did A'Nong come?

164
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
What happened?

165
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Qi told us that A'Nong is on the mountain.

166
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
He might be against us.

167
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Could it be that Qi's

168
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
is going to leave the mountain?

169
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
A'Nong, please wake up.

170
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
A'Nong,

171
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
don't you remember Tang Yu and Xiaobao?

172
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Tang Yu and Xiaobao,

173
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
if I can escape,

174
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'll marry you.

175
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Tang Yu and Xiaobao.

176
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
A'Nong.

177
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
A'Nong.

178
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
A'Nong.

179
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
A'Nong.

180
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
A'Nong.

181
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
A'Nong.

182
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Since he

183
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
still loves Tang Yu,

184
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
he let her go.

185
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Love.

186
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Love's power

187
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
is really so great?

188
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I don't believe it.

189
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
He can't win me.

190
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
He can't win me.

191
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You can't win me.

192
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You can't win me.

193
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Kill you.

194
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Love?

195
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Your father?

196
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Don't move.

197
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Or you'll be broken.

198
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Then why did he kill me?

199
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Love?

200
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
In this world,

201
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
there is no love at all.

202
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Love?

203
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Why are you staring at me?

204
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
What's going on?

205
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Nothing.

206
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's from the arrow-shaped hole.

207
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Really?

208
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Yes. You forgot.

209
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Does it hurt?

210
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It doesn't.

211
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Where is your father?

212
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
He's even more like your father.

213
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Your father likes to swim.

214
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Maybe he's swimming in the mountains.

215
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I'm not afraid.

216
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I have a line with him.

217
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'll call him.

218
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I think he must be drunk.

219
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
He must be drunk.

220
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
He doesn't even know what he's got.

221
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
He's so irresponsible.

222
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Brother Shen.

223
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
No, it's Mother Shen.

224
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
He must have run away again.

225
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
So he's sad.

226
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Don't blame him.

227
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
He knows he's wrong.

228
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
He's a bad guy.

229
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
He said so.

230
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Just forgive him.

231
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Okay?

232
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Okay?

233
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Okay?

234
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'll take care of Mother Shen.

235
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'll take care of Mother Shen.

236
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I won't let anyone bully you.

237
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Don't worry.

238
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Don't cry, Mother Shen.

239
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm happy.

240
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Mother Nanny,

241
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
you won't ignore me, right?

242
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
No.

243
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Yes.

244
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I'll always be your daughter.

245
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm so happy.

246
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I have Mother Nanny and Mother Shen.

247
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I'll always be your daughter.

248
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'm so happy.

249
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Brother Shen.

250
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Don't be sad.

251
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Brother Nanny, you're so good.

252
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Brother Nanny, you're really good.

253
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Why did it turn into this?

254
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm just curious.

255
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Did you hide something from me?

256
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
What is it?

257
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I think everyone seems to be weird.

258
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I think everyone seems to be weird.

259
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
What's wrong?

260
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I don't know.

261
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It seems that everyone suddenly loves me.

262
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm afraid that I will be hurt.

263
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Be careful.

264
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Actually, everyone loves me all the time.

265
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Everyone loves me all the time.

266
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
But you haven't found me.

267
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I was so childish and cruel.

268
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I was so immature.

269
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I knew how to eat and play.

270
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Forget it.

271
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I still miss the old me.

272
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
We can't return to the past.

273
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It's okay.

274
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
We create a good future together.

275
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Just a little bit.

276
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
But I hope you won't mind my uselessness.

277
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
How can it be?

278
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You are much more handsome than before.

279
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
You are much more handsome.

280
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Really?

281
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Yes.

282
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Anu wants to learn cooking.

283
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I want to be a little treasure forever.

284
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And I want to be by your side forever.

285
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You?

286
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I want to marry you.

287
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
You are kidding me again.

288
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I love you forever.

289
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
You marry me.

290
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Tang Yu Xiaobao.

291
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You can't bully Tang Yu Xiaobao.

292
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I miss you so much.

293
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Mr. Shenggu.

294
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Are you okay?

295
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I'm fine.

296
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Princess.

297
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
If you can,

298
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
can you go back and see your father?

299
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
What's wrong with him?

300
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
The people's support for him is not as good as before.

301
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
He feels very sad for this.

302
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I know.

303
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
If you don't stand by his side,

304
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I think father should make it clear

305
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
which side he should stand by.

306
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Master Li.

307
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
We are done for.

308
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I'm done for.

309
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Master Li.

310
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm done for.

311
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I'm done for.

312
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I'm done for.

313
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Milky Way.

314
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Please stand by me.

315
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Leader Sad حi.

316
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
No matter what we do,

317
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
we will break thisisation of the nobility and leave the Marquese Anyways.

318
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
We have no place where we belong.

319
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Drink it.

320
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Do you want to have a drink?

321
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Drink it for the last time.

322
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
You can say something.

323
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I'm on the sword.

324
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I believe this wine is bitter.

325
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
It's bitter.

326
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
A cup of wine.

327
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
A few pieces of qingyuan.

328
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I'll drink it with you.

329
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Cheers.

330
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Cheers.

331
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Cheers.

332
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
You haven't prepared it.

333
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Why?

334
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
You're too disappointed.

335
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Why?

336
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Cheers.

337
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
You'll regret it.

338
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
My chicken is dead.

339
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I don't want to see you again.

340
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Master Li.

341
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I've said it.

342
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
You'll regret it.

343
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Why?

344
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Why?

345
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Here you are.

346
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Why?

347
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Why did you fall down suddenly?

348
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Master Li.

349
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
You're willing to drink it?

350
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I'll drink it.

351
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I'll drink it.

352
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
What?

353
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Is he dead?

354
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I'm sorry.

355
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I'm so careless.

356
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I'm so careless.

357
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Can I be your friend now?

358
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
He's really dead?

359
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Great.

360
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Great.

361
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Great.

362
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Great.

363
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Great.

364
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Really great.

365
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Great.

366
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Great.

367
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
No one has come here.

368
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Except for His Majesty.

369
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
No one has come here with me.

370
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Are you happy?

371
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I'm not.

372
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Why?

373
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Because I know that

374
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I'm not the only one who is qualified to stand by you.

375
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I hope you can understand that

376
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
I'm not the only one.

377
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
From today on,

378
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
the words of the teaching master Liu

379
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
are the words of the teaching master.

380
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
The words of the teaching master Liu

381
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
are the words of the teaching master Liu.

382
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
May the teaching master be blessed.

383
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
May the teaching master be blessed.

384
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Uncle.

385
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Save him.

386
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:35,800
Brother He해도.

387
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,000
Brother, are you fine?

388
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Don't move.

389
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,280
What's wrong with you, Brother Xiaoyao?

390
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,080
Don't die, Brother Xiaoyao. Don't die.

391
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,080
No.

392
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,600
Mu Si Jie?

393
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,200
I understand.

394
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,600
I understand.

395
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,120
You…

396
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,760
This time, Ah Qi didn't kill me.

397
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:34,640
I think he should have his own plan.

398
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,440
Brother Jing Yuan told me that you are in danger.

399
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,680
Although the letter doesn't have the name,

400
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,080
But I know what he wrote.

401
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,080
He is still our good friend.

402
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,680
We still have seven months to fight together.

403
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,480
Did brother Qi

404
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,280
explain his plan?

405
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,200
No.

406
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,480
But since everyone thought I was dead,

407
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,560
we came here to retreat.

408
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,160
Retreat?

409
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,360
I want to use my death

410
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,160
to let all the people of Nanzhao know

411
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,200
the truth of the Moon Sect.

412
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,040
You are still so stubborn.

413
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,600
There are no more than six people today.

414
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,320
There are one million people.

415
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,960
He will make all donations to another.

416
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,800
I think it's been a small reason

417
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,040
to bring you two together.

418
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,760
So what if...

419
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,720
A little more,

420
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,420
and there will be five of you!

421
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,720
It's not going to hurt.

422
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,680
I came here to tell you

423
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:11,680
I have no other way to solve it.

424
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,680
I have thought about it.

425
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,680
I can solve anything with He Ping.

426
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,680
But Master Shi told me to understand one thing.

427
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,680
The world is right.

428
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,680
From ancient times,

429
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:35,680
the end must be passed the war to win.

430
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,680
I believe in it more and more.

431
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:47,680
Is it really necessary to bleed to the core

432
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,680
to have real He Ping?

433
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,680
If the war needs blood and sacrifice,

434
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,680
I am willing to be the first one.

435
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,680
Why?

436
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,680
The war is the way to win the people's happiness.

437
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,680
It's not the time to run away.

438
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,680
Look outside.

439
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,680
Your people are all standing up.

440
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:12,680
Can you still sit in the palace and not see them?

441
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,680
It's been ten years.

442
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,680
Master Baiyue has been sent here for ten years.

443
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,680
That's why the State of Nan Zhao is now like this.

444
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,680
Mother is dead.

445
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:27,680
Father, when will you wake up?

446
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,680
That's why you made a decision.

447
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:33,680
You are right.

448
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,680
You are right.

449
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,680
I was wrong.

450
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,680
That's why you left me.

451
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,680
The demon has been in my mind for ten years.

452
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:05,680
I will make a decision for myself.

453
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,680
Vi 바꿀

454
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,680
I intended to make the State of Nan come face to face

455
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:34,680
with the happiness of trusting in the people.

456
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,680
Where have you gone?

457
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:01,720
The real happiness is not about luck.

458
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,720
It's about your courage and faith.

459
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,720
To prove it.

460
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,720
The real happiness is not about the fate.

461
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,720
It's about the life.

462
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,720
It's about your faith.

463
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,720
To make it happen.

464
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,720
Even if it's life.

465
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,720
Let her go.

466
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,720
Your Majesty.

467
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,720
General Nan.

468
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,720
Yes.

469
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,720
I thank you for your teaching in three days.

470
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:39,720
It's not easy to be taught.

471
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:43,720
I'm sorry for your loss.

472
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,720
General Nan.

473
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,720
Be careful.

474
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,720
Don't worry.

475
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,720
I will succeed.

476
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,720
Your Majesty.

477
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,720
From now on, all the people of the country

478
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,720
can't participate in the campaign.

479
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:01,720
I will fight for my life.

480
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,720
There is a person who is so stupid

481
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,720
and annoying in the world.

482
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,720
He always wants to stop you from doing things.

483
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,720
Master.

484
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,720
Don't worry.

485
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:31,720
But this time, I was wronged.

486
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,720
Don't worry.

487
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,720
No matter what they do.

488
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:41,720
They will die soon.

489
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,720
Yes.

490
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,720
Soon.

491
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,720
Master.

492
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,720
Master.

493
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,720
Catch him.

494
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,720
General Nan.

495
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,720
Please say it.

496
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,720
Your Majesty has ordered

497
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,720
to seal the school of the Moon Sect.

498
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,720
All the people will be sent to the execution

499
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,720
to be punished.

500
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,720
I accept your order.

501
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,720
General Nan.

502
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,720
Why?

503
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,720
The star that disappeared will appear again.

504
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:59,720
Is Li Xiaoyao still alive?

505
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,720
The Moon Sect

506
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,720
The Moon Sect

507
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,720
The Moon Sect

508
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,720
He is really a genius.

509
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,720
He is really a genius.

510
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,720
He is really a genius.

511
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,720
He is really a genius.

512
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,720
He is really a genius.

513
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,720
He is really a genius.

514
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,720
He is really a genius.

515
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,720
He is really a genius.

516
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,720
He is really a genius.

517
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,720
He is really a genius.

518
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,720
He is really a genius.

519
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,720
It's true.

520
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,720
It's true.

521
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,720
He is really a genius.

522
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,720
I am sorry, my friend.

523
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,580
now

524
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,880
why

525
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:14,620
why is that sortir

526
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,280
Would it be...

527
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,600
the lyrics of the بلل من南plant retire?

528
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,320
I shall find out your intention...

529
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,320
Ways.

530
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,520
Have I yet 신부 thin Lucky on your back?

531
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,540
driving me riding my bike

532
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,580
Give a hand.

533
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:46,500
Prof. Liu.

534
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:51,160
I should go help you buy the Vera glass

535
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,060
Miss Lin

536
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:56,660
Run

537
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,760
Let's shoot

538
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:01,940
Yes

539
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:03,680
Lead official

540
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,020
Don't break the ability

541
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:08,540
THEN

542
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,900
Chief

543
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,240
Do you have any problem

544
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:13,960
Are you rejected

545
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:16,120
Something disturbed me

546
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:19,780
Come here. Let's have a chat.

547
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:21,380
Yes.

548
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:26,980
I just want to prove something.

549
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:30,580
Let's choose the train.

550
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:34,740
Ten L its ID,

551
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:36,800
Wen Robe,

552
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,420
and Song Zimang.

553
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:52,580
I think I see no one here.

554
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:55,960
The night's dead?

555
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:59,380
about the human body of the heart?

556
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:01,660
Yes.

557
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,100
Good boy.

558
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:07,260
Did you tear it?

559
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:11,260
Yes.

560
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:15,060
Good.

561
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,220
Tell me.

562
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:20,260
What's inside?

563
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:21,820
It's called

564
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:23,420
the death knot.

565
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:25,860
What did you say?

566
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,700
The body of the human body is in the same position as the heart.

567
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:32,100
It has a magical pulse.

568
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:34,900
If it is pierced by the sword,

569
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:38,100
it will not cause fatal injuries.

570
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:41,620
As long as it is pointed at the blood,

571
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:45,620
it will not be dangerous.

572
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:48,700
Is there such a magical pulse?

573
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:52,540
Yes.

574
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:58,980
It's here.

You are destined to have no future

599
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:44,180
It's a dream, a dream, a dream
