1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not afraid of you.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not afraid of you.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm not afraid of you.

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Anruan.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
People say

21
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I jumped out of the stone.

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But I know I'm not.

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I have a father.

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Anruan.

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Anruan.

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Don't be afraid.

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I must promise you

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I won't leave you anymore.

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Someone tumbles on you.

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'll teach him a lesson.

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Beat him. Beat him.

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I really mind that someone said I don't have a father.

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I often make my own face with my own beard.

34
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I just want to see a little bit of my father's face.

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
But I can't see it.

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I can't even imagine it.

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So I can't draw it at all.

38
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Look, Anluo.

39
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's okay.

40
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You'll see me every day.

41
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You'll know what I mean.

42
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Right?

43
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You don't want to cry?

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You don't want me to be angry and not forgive you?

45
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm afraid.

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm really afraid.

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You don't want to?

48
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
No, I don't want to say that.

49
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Anluo, I really regret it.

50
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I've never hugged you since I was a kid.

51
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'll carry you tonight.

52
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Come on, let's go.

53
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
No.

54
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Come on, let's go.

55
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
One, two, three.

56
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You're really grown up.

57
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Anluo, I have a lot of questions for you.

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What do you like the most?

59
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Tell me. I'll make it for you.

60
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Of course I like it.

61
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I like it.

62
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But you're a woman.

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'll take you to a drink.

64
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
What?

65
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Who are you?

66
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm Anluo.

67
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm a boy now. Let's go for a drink.

68
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Let's go.

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Xiao'er, come on.

70
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Here you are.

71
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You're still a girl.

72
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You're so ugly.

73
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm ugly. I'm born to you.

74
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm born because of you.

75
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You're even fighting with me?

76
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Did you hear that? My daughter is fighting with me.

77
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
This is enough.

78
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm so unlucky.

79
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I can do anything.

80
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Please go back.

81
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Enough for today.

82
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Please go back.

83
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Okay, let's go.

84
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Let's go.

85
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Let's go.

86
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Let's go.

87
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Dad.

88
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Dad.

89
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
This place has been empty for many years.

90
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's special for you.

91
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'll always remember this day.

92
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
There's nobody out there.

93
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Anluo.

94
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Don't say that.

95
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
She has no harm.

96
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Dad.

97
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm not afraid.

98
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Stop FinÐ¿ needs you.

99
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Good right, Dad.

100
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm afraid.

101
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Don't be afraid.

102
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
If you leave,

103
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'll catch up with you

104
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
when I have time.

105
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
If I have a future,

106
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I must

107
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
marry...

108
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
marry Tang Yu Xiao Bao.

109
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
No.

110
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I know I'm wrong.

111
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I won't say it again.

112
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I won't say it again.

113
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Tang Yu Xiao Bao!

114
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What are you doing?

115
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
No!

116
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Tang Yu Xiao Bao!

117
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Tang Yu Xiao Bao!

118
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Tang Yu Xiao Bao!

119
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Don't move!

120
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I don't want to play with you anymore.

121
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm so miserable.

122
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Please come out.

123
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Please come out.

124
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Come out.

125
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Please come out!

126
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Please come out!

127
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Please come out!

128
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Please come out.

129
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Please come out.

130
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Please come out.

131
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
My dear friend,

132
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
do you really miss her?

133
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You killed Tang Yu Xiao Bao.

134
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You killed her.

135
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You're so stupid.

136
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You killed Tang Yu Xiao Bao.

137
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Give her back to me.

138
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You tell me.

139
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
In the eyes of the world,

140
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I may be a bad person.

141
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
But in the eyes of animals,

142
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
we are all bad people.

143
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
In the world of Cang Qiong,

144
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
is there really a good person

145
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
who is bad?

146
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You're lying.

147
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You killed Tang Yu Xiao Bao.

148
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Give her back to me.

149
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Tang Yu Xiao Bao, you're dead.

150
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
She's in my house.

151
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
She's not dead?

152
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I came to see you.

153
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I just wanted to see you.

154
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
An Nu, you're home.

155
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You're home.

156
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
An Nu.

157
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
An Nu.

158
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Tang Yu Xiao Bao, I miss you so much.

159
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I don't like Li Xiaoyang at all.

160
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
What An Nu has always liked is Tang Yu Xiao Bao.

161
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'm sorry.

162
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I hurt you.

163
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm not good.

164
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm not good.

165
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You're all like this.

166
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You only understand regret after you make a mistake.

167
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Uncle Bai Yu, I beg you.

168
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It's An Nu's fault.

169
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
An Nu should be punished.

170
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Don't hurt Tang Yu Xiao Bao.

171
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Don't let her suffer again.

172
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Get up.

173
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You can talk slowly.

174
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Uncle Bai Yu, I beg you.

175
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I know you can save Tang Yu Xiao Bao.

176
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I beg you.

177
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yes.

178
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Really?

179
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But...

180
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
After I help you, you should help me.

181
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
That's how we can be fair.

182
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
As long as Tang Yu Xiao Bao wakes up,

183
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I can give up my life.

184
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
How can you do that?

185
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I never want to kill anyone.

186
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You know that.

187
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Then why did you hurt us twice?

188
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Did I hurt you?

189
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I thought this was a game.

190
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
But now...

191
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
How can I believe you?

192
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm so sad.

193
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I thought you know me best.

194
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I don't know you at all.

195
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
This is just a game.

196
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Is this a game?

197
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You're so cruel.

198
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Don't hate me.

199
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
An Nu, this is not suitable for you.

200
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I can't think of anything now.

201
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Please calm down.

202
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You know that.

203
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You know that I will never leave you.

204
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I will always love you and protect you.

205
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Right?

206
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I... I hurt him.

207
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Do you think he will come to save you this time?

208
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
What do you want?

209
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
The game before was so simple.

210
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Think about it.

211
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
If you think you're an unacceptable person,

212
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
will Tang Yu love you?

213
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
The person I hate the most?

214
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Today is a big test.

215
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
If you have a real love between you,

216
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
you can solve it.

217
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Are you willing to accept it?

218
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
If you're willing to accept it,

219
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I will save him right away.

220
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I'm willing to.

221
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Good.

222
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You have my word.

223
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'll do it.

224
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
An Nu, have you come back?

225
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You didn't find An Nu?

226
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
An Nu.

227
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
An Nu.

228
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Yidi, you're injured.

229
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Have a rest.

230
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
You...

231
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Give me back Yidi's life!

232
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
If you have the real life,

233
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I will only let you be punished and make a big mistake.

234
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Yidi told me that you did all this.

235
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Do you believe it?

236
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It's not your death today.

237
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
It's my king.

238
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Do you think you can really kill me?

239
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's not your fault, Yidi.

240
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Yidi, listen to me.

241
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Shi Gonghu is the most important person in the world.

242
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Nonsense!

243
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
You know it very well.

244
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
He treats you like a beggar.

245
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Don't you treat him like a human?

246
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Nonsense!

247
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You did this to me and your king.

248
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Then...

249
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
What if he wants to kill me?

250
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You're a man who's not willing to die.

251
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Why?

252
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
My only family in the world

253
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
is going to misunderstand me and hate me.

254
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
You're not worthy to be my brother.

255
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,000
The only mistake in my life is not killing you.

256
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You and your lover are so similar.

257
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Sous-titre

258
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Stop!

259
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
So what?

260
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,780
No one needs me

261
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,320
Then write the papers

262
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,840
That's all

263
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:46,200
You didn't get out, and you can't show GuaÙØ©

264
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,940
Guaì

265
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,940
Get out of my way!

266
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,940
Don't be angry, Yidi.

267
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:02,940
If you keep moving, you'll lose your neck.

268
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,940
What's wrong?

269
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,940
I'm Tang Yu Xiaobao.

270
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,940
Have a good chat with Yidi.

271
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,940
What did you do to Ah Nu?

272
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,940
What do you want?

273
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,940
We're just playing games.

274
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:55,940
This time, it's all about Ah Nu's consent.

275
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,940
Don't worry. I won't hurt Ah Nu.

276
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:07,940
No matter if it's a real animal or a mudflat,

277
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,940
or even a group of crows,

278
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,940
I've never thought of hurting your life.

279
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,940
What the hell are you doing?

280
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,940
Actually, I really want to thank you.

281
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:25,940
I've proved to you that I love this thing.

282
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,940
Are you crazy?

283
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:33,940
Every time you move, you make Ah Nu move.

284
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:38,940
But Ah Nu hurts you again and again.

285
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,940
This is between me and Ah Nu.

286
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,940
It has nothing to do with you.

287
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,940
Let her go. Don't make her stay.

288
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:53,940
You're the ones who are being so righteous.

289
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,940
You're just making me stay.

290
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,940
You're saying that you love each other.

291
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,940
Why?

292
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,940
You want to kill me?

293
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:09,940
And you're saying that you're regretting it?

294
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,940
Shut up!

295
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,940
I won't listen to your lies.

296
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,940
I won't be fooled by you.

297
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:22,940
Me? You're being taught by your heart.

298
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:27,940
Let's see how big your love is.

299
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:30,940
I really want to know

300
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,940
if between people,

301
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,940
is there really a legend that says

302
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,940
that you're not a fish?

303
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:42,940
If there really is,

304
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:46,940
is there really a living person like him?

305
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,940
Ah Nu, you're so naughty.

306
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,940
Why are you poisoning me with a knife?

307
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,940
I'll kill you.

308
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,940
Do you still love him?

309
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,940
Love?

310
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,940
I believe you.

311
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,940
Let me help you.

312
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,940
No!

313
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,940
If you're so naughty,

314
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,940
you'll have to cut off your double-edged sword

315
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,940
to save your life.

316
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,940
I, Tang Yu,

317
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,940
have no way

318
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:15,940
to get rid of your devil head.

319
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,940
I...

320
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,940
I don't want to see you.

321
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,940
I don't want to see you.

322
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,940
Your brother,

323
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,940
why are you suffering?

324
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,940
I don't want your corpse.

325
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,940
One day,

326
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:00,940
I'll bring Ah Nu back

327
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,940
and kill you.

328
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,940
I'll avenge my father.

329
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,940
Your brother,

330
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,940
I really appreciate you.

331
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:15,940
I'll wait for you here.

332
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,940
You go ahead.

333
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:39,940
Wait for me.

334
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:43,940
I'll come back to save you.

335
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,940
Why is the church so dirty?

336
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,940
Clean it up.

337
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,940
Yes.

338
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,940
Brother Qi,

339
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,940
why are you here?

340
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,940
What are you doing?

341
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,940
This is a devil's place.

342
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,940
Do you know?

343
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,940
I don't know you.

344
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,940
I'm just a little bit of a fool.

345
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,940
I'm just a little bit of a fool.

346
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,940
I don't know you.

347
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,940
Get out.

348
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,940
What?

349
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,940
Come with me.

350
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,940
Come with me.

351
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,940
The enemy of Moon Sect is my enemy.

352
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,940
Get out.

353
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:25,940
Get out!

354
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:29,940
Get out!

355
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,940
Get out!

356
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,940
Get out!

357
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,940
Get out!

358
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,940
I've been missing Ah Nu for the whole day.

359
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,940
Is there any accident?

360
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,940
No.

361
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,940
Master said he was drinking with Ah Nu here.

362
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,940
Maybe Ah Nu was eating here.

363
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:16,940
How could it be?

364
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,940
What did you forget?

365
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,940
So many things happened.

366
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:19,940
Ah Nu is so fun.

367
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,940
He won't be a little bit of a fool.

368
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,940
Call me Ah Nu again.

369
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,940
I've tried.

370
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:25,940
Ah Nu has no news.

371
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,940
I can't let anyone around me be in danger.

372
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:31,940
Ling'er, he'll be safe.

373
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,940
I'll go to the church.

374
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,940
He'll be safe.

375
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,940
Who wrote this?

376
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,940
Keep fighting.

377
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:48,940
Keep fighting.

378
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,940
After the bikes and walls,

379
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:09,940
Sungram Immortal soaps her head.

380
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,940
She won't stop fighting with you.

381
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,940
You're so good at fighting on the wall.

382
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:14,940
You deserve to die.

383
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:15,940
Let's fight.

384
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:16,940
Let's fight.

385
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:18,940
How are you?

386
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,940
Brother, how are you?

387
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,940
Tang Yu.

388
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:24,940
Tang Yu.

389
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,940
Father.

390
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,940
I'll take care of you.

391
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:32,940
Tang Yu.

392
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,940
Tang Yu.

393
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:42,940
Tang Yu.

394
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:13,940
How is it?

395
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:17,940
The Moon Sect has locked Tang Yu's wound with his magic power.

396
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,940
The wall is broken.

397
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,940
Only two magic powers are in his body.

398
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,940
He's not well.

399
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:25,940
The Moon Sect's magic power is at the level that we can imagine.

400
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:26,940
Yes.

401
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,940
Go.

402
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,940
Stop.

403
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:42,940
Are you crazy?

404
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:43,940
I'm not crazy.

405
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:44,940
Leave the State of Nan Zhao at once.

406
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:45,940
Don't come back.

407
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,940
Shi Si.

408
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,940
What's wrong with you?

409
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:52,940
Anu and Qi have become the puppet of Moon Sect.

410
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,940
Do you still want the Princess to be the leader of the devil?

411
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:56,940
What?

412
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,940
What did you say?

413
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,940
How is Anu now?

414
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,940
Anu's soul has been captured by Moon Sect.

415
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,940
He's completely under Moon Sect's control.

416
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:09,940
Damn it.

417
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:10,940
Damn it.

418
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:11,940
Damn it.

419
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:15,940
Let's go and save Anu and Brother Jin Yuan together.

420
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:21,940
What's wrong?

421
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:22,940
What's wrong with you?

422
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,940
Why don't you leave?

423
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:25,940
No need.

424
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:28,940
Just take Anu's body with me.

425
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,940
Xiaoyao.

426
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,940
Take Ling'er away from Nan Zhao.

427
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:34,940
Shi Fu.

428
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:35,940
We're not leaving.

429
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:37,940
You guys leave.

430
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:38,940
We'll leave right away.

431
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:41,940
What's wrong with you?

432
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,940
There's nothing wrong with you.

433
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:44,940
Anu's body is our body.

434
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,940
And all the citizens of the country are waiting for us to save him.

435
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,940
Are you blind or white-eyed?

436
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,940
Moon Sect is not working.

437
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,940
You know how powerful we are.

438
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:52,940
You're just dying.

439
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:53,940
He's afraid of death.

440
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:54,940
How can you do that?

441
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:55,940
If the Princess is not in danger,

442
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,940
who else can save Nan Zhao?

443
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,940
It's been ten years since the war broke out.

444
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,940
It's not the right time.

445
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,940
But you've experienced it yourself.

446
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:06,940
You know very well.

447
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:10,940
Do you want Ling'er to be like her mother?

448
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:13,940
And Ling'er's children.

449
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,940
Liu De is still alive.

450
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,940
He's not afraid of the fire.

451
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:38,940
We're leaving.

452
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:40,940
I won't.

453
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,940
Let's go.

454
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,940
I can't.

455
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:47,940
Let's go.

456
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:48,940
I can't go.

457
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:49,940
Let's go.

458
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:50,940
No.

459
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:51,940
You...

460
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:54,940
I'm sorry.

461
00:31:58,940 --> 00:31:59,940
I'm your husband.

462
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,940
You've never heard of him.

463
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:04,940
I said,

464
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:07,940
let's go.

465
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:17,940
Hold on.

466
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:25,940
Let's go.

467
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:26,940
Where are you going?

468
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:28,940
To save our daughter.

469
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:30,940
Don't act rashly.

470
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:37,940
Be careful.

471
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:38,940
Be careful.

472
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:39,940
Don't be.

473
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:06,940
Be careful.

474
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,940
Don't be.

475
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:22,940
Stop fighting.

476
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:23,940
My daughter is trapped here.

477
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:24,940
You call me a man?

478
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:37,940
Don't.

479
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:38,940
You know how to do this.

480
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:39,940
I'll make a big mess.

481
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:40,940
A'nuo is not my daughter.

482
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:41,940
She's your daughter.

483
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:44,940
Yuanqing.

484
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,940
I want to kill this woman.

485
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:47,940
Let's go.

486
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,940
Where are A'nuo and Jingyuan?

487
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,940
They haven't seen each other for ten years.

488
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,940
They still care about me.

489
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,940
They admire me.

490
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,940
They admire me.

491
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:18,940
They're just children.

492
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,940
They don't need to be involved.

493
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:21,940
Let them go.

494
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,940
You misunderstood.

495
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,940
I didn't beg them.

496
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,940
They can go freely.

497
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,940
If they want to leave,

498
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,940
I won't leave them.

499
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,940
It doesn't matter.

500
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:36,940
For our daughter,

501
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,940
I can give you a chance.

502
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,940
A'nuo.

503
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,940
It's your daughter.

504
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,940
Nonsense.

505
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,940
I'm A'nuo's mother.

506
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,940
You're lying.

507
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,940
It's a crime.

508
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:16,940
I didn't.

509
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:18,940
But I should believe

510
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:21,940
A'nuo or you.

511
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:22,940
A'nuo said

512
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:26,940
she's the daughter of the manatee.

513
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:30,940
How is it?

514
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:32,940
Yuanqing.

515
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:33,940
Yuanqing.

516
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:34,940
Third Brother.

517
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,940
You've been

518
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,940
in a lot of trouble for me.

519
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:40,940
You...

520
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,940
I've been silent for seventeen years.

521
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,940
Today is also the time.

522
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:47,940
I'm telling you.

523
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:50,940
Let my daughter go.

524
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,940
Otherwise,

525
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:53,940
I'll kill you.

526
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:57,940
Your Majesty.

527
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,940
It's clear that

528
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,940
there's an argument

529
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,940
in this palace where

530
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:08,940
two states are going to walk.

531
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,940
You'll ask Yuanqing

532
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,940
and the newly radish tree

533
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,940
to approach them.

534
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:22,940
In 18 years,

535
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,940
we need to kill Nonsense.

536
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,940
I'm along her Bureau night.

537
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,060
You don't want to leave?

538
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,340
I don't.

539
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,180
After you leave,

540
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:34,980
I'll come back to Baiyue.

541
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,300
You want to go with us?

542
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,620
Why did you abandon me?

543
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:39,140
I know I'm selfish.

544
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:40,900
Let me be selfish again, okay?

545
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,940
I've lost Yue Ru.

546
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,660
I've changed my mind.

547
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,180
I'm in a bad situation.

548
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,660
I can't let anyone be in danger.

549
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,540
Especially you.

550
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,020
Brother Xiaoyao.

551
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,820
Do you think I'll be safe?

552
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,660
Will I live a good life?

553
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,220
Will I be happy?

554
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:02,740
No.

555
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:07,580
I'll only live my life in pain.

556
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,940
I don't care.

557
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,900
I can't let you suffer anymore.

558
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,300
Brother Xiaoyao.

559
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:14,100
You didn't look like this.

560
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,140
You're more righteous than anyone.

561
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,500
You're kinder than anyone.

562
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,780
You're more confident than anyone.

563
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,500
Why do you look like this now?

564
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,900
What do you want me to do?

565
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,180
What can I do?

566
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,700
I can't let you be in danger again.

567
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,060
I can't lose you.

568
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:32,700
If I lose you,

569
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,300
you'll die.

570
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,820
I won't die.

571
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,660
Brother Xiaoyao.

572
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,700
I promise you.

573
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:56,980
I'll be with you

574
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:59,140
until you're born.

575
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:06,540
Li'er.

576
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,420
Brother Xiaoyao.

577
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,820
Let's go together.

578
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,940
Let's do everything together.

579
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,620
I want to be like you.

580
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:16,540
I'll do something for others.

581
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,260
Okay?

582
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,300
I...

583
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:23,980
Brother Xiaoyao.

584
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,380
Don't think about this anymore.

585
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,420
Believe in yourself too.

586
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,980
How about going and meet up with me first?

587
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:46,980
Mother!

588
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,260
Mother!

589
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:57,360
Ling'er, you're back.

590
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:01,060
Mother, I miss you so much.

591
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:04,460
Child, these days have been hard on you.

592
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,260
Ling'er didn't cry at all.

593
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,860
Old Master has been taking care of me.

594
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:12,060
Now, there's Brother Xiao Yao.

595
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:17,260
In your growing days, Mother has been not by your side.

596
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:19,260
You can't see that you're growing taller every day.

597
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,460
You're improving every day.

598
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,860
You can't even see that you're smiling.

599
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:26,460
You can't hear your smile.

600
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:30,460
Mother, look.

601
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:35,660
Ling'er, actually you did a great job.

602
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:38,860
The path of the female frog was not easy to follow.

603
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,860
Ling'er, I understand.

604
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,060
We're the female frog descendants.

605
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:48,660
All the people in the world are the children of the female frog descendants.

606
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,660
They're sold by the female.

607
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:54,660
They'll make our hearts ache like a butterfly.

608
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:00,660
Xiao Yao, I hope you can also sell us.

609
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,860
Xiao Yao wants to hear your older sister's voice.

610
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:13,460
The female frog's voice is a bitter sound.

611
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,860
But the bitterest is not the taste of flesh.

612
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:18,060
It's the taste of the dead.

613
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:22,860
The bitterest is the anger of the female.

614
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,860
Anger?

615
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:27,260
The people around you don't understand.

616
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,460
You have to fight alone.

617
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:36,660
Brother Xiao Yao, I beg you.

618
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,860
Don't be like my father.

619
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,460
Of course I won't.

620
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:46,460
But Ling'er, I won't let you suffer any more.

621
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:48,060
That's good.

622
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,060
Actually, it's not hard for us to leave.

623
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:54,260
But we'll always be in the past and in the future.

624
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:57,060
Xiao Yao, no matter what,

625
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,260
as long as you're the one who loves you the most,

626
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:02,260
all the bitterness will become sweet.

627
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:05,660
All the hatred and hatred will become blessing.

628
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:09,260
But, I know the path ahead is dangerous.

629
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:13,660
My close friends around me will die one by one.

630
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,660
Do you still want to continue?

631
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:18,660
I told you to go back to the past.

632
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:20,460
I told Ling'er to leave.

633
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,660
I didn't want you to change your life.

634
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,660
I changed Ling'er's whole fate.

635
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:27,060
I told her to avoid everything.

636
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:30,660
On the contrary, I just hope Ling'er can grow up well.

637
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,260
I want her to return to the South.

638
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:36,860
I want to save the children in the disaster.

639
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,660
I decided to stay here.

640
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,660
To protect my people.

641
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,660
It's not so hard.

642
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,660
It's not so hard.

643
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:01,660
Okay. Since you've decided,

644
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:03,660
I'll always be with you.

645
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:06,060
I'll be with you in the same way.

646
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,060
Xiao Yao.

647
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:12,460
The secret of the South State is in your hands.

648
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:17,060
I'll always protect you and bless you.

649
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:32,260
So, it's this.

650
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,260
Lao Lao!

651
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:38,260
We're back!

652
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,860
Do you still remember?

653
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,860
Of course.

654
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,860
How can I forget?

655
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:49,860
We're going to watch the Du Juan Flower with Lao Lao.

656
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,660
Lao Lao!

657
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,660
Are you okay?

658
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:00,660
Lao Lao will protect us.

659
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:04,660
Thank you, Xiao Yao.

660
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:21,660
This is a disaster.

661
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:24,660
The inside of the temple must be a mess.

662
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,660
Are you sure?

663
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:35,660
The current position of the temple is like the flag of the temple.

664
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:40,660
Don't you think it's unthinkable?

665
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:44,660
I want the whole world to be more beautiful.

666
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:47,660
You should have the same idea.

667
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:49,660
Everything is possible.

668
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,660
Everything is natural.

669
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,660
Isn't it better?

670
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:56,660
If one day,

671
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:59,660
the whole world will change,

672
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:01,660
would you like to try it?

673
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:04,660
Yes.

674
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:08,660
But, does this method exist?

675
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:11,660
It should.

676
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:13,660
I think,

677
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:16,660
this method will definitely exist.

678
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:24,660
This flag has already been given to the last.

679
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:26,660
What you mean is,

680
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:29,660
you're going to achieve your goal soon?

681
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:36,660
The most important person should also appear.

682
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:40,660
The most important person should also appear.

683
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:10,660
If this can continue,

684
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:13,660
how good would it be?

685
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:39,660
Your Highness.

686
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:41,660
This is...

687
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:43,660
According to His Majesty's order,

688
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:47,660
the princess will be rewarded for her special visit.

689
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:08,660
Are you ready?

690
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:10,660
Yes.

691
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:12,660
Let's go to the palace together.

692
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,660
Your Highness.

693
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:40,660
Your Highness.

694
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:42,660
Your Highness.

695
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,660
Your Highness.

696
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:46,660
Your Highness.

697
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:48,660
Your Highness.

698
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:50,660
Your Highness.

699
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,660
Your Highness.

700
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:54,660
Your Highness.

701
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:56,660
Your Highness.

702
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:58,660
Your Highness.

703
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:00,660
Your Highness.

704
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,660
Your Highness.

705
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:04,660
Your Highness.
