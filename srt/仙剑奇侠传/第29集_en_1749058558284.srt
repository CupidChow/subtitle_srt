1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to get back to the place I used to live.

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to get back to the place I used to live.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to get back to the place I used to live.

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to get back to the place I used to live.

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to get back to the place I used to live.

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm afraid I'll be able to get back to the place I used to live.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What is the purpose of this life?

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The reason why I'm here in front of you

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
is the blue-and-white eyes.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm waiting for you alone.

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The Blue-and-White Eyes

12
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Why?

13
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What happened?

14
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Water... Water is here. It's the Moon Sect Leader.

15
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
He brought the disaster to the South State of Zhao with no future.

16
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Let's kill him together. Let's go.

17
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Why? The Moon Sect Leader is also my own people.

18
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I should love him and change him.

19
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But why is he so cruel?

20
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
He sacrificed all his people for his own wildness?

21
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You still say you love him?

22
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Aren't you afraid of laughing at people?

23
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm afraid of it, you fool.

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I have the ability to change all this.

25
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I can change all the tragedies.

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Why do you still have to be obsessed?

27
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Obsessed?

28
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Little brother, without what I did today,

29
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
we wouldn't have taken this fate.

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I don't know the purpose of coming here.

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I just know to save you and your daughter.

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
No, it's not like that.

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
In the future, you and Ling'er will be the people of the Green Sect.

34
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Especially you.

35
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You are the source of all people's power.

36
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You are the next generation.

37
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You know everything.

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Let's go.

39
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Kill him with me.

40
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You take Little Brother to the palace.

41
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Call my daughter to leave.

42
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You face the Moon Sect Leader alone?

43
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
This is my only way to get rid of evil.

44
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Little brother, I know we are not the same generation.

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You can help me.

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Help my daughter achieve a big thing.

47
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Let's go together.

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Do you really think that these people suffer?

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I can only promise you to take my daughter away.

50
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Let her be safe.

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Ting'er.

52
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Ting'er.

53
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You...

54
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You...

55
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You...

56
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You...

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You are really...

58
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Are you a demon?

59
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
How could that be?

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
How could that be?

61
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Your Majesty, I don't have time to explain to you.

62
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Save my daughter.

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Let's go.

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Ting'er.

65
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Your Majesty,

66
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
your eyes are clear.

67
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Don't make others confused.

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Let's go.

69
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Little brother, why are you here?

70
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I am here to take care of you.

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Kill him.

72
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Who are you?

73
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The Queen of the Wuhu Sect.

74
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Let's go.

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Today, I will take revenge on you.

76
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Your Majesty.

77
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I won't let you touch my country again.

78
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Mother.

79
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Princess.

80
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Mother.

81
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Princess.

82
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Princess.

83
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Little brother,

84
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I just got out of the Wuhu Sect.

85
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I am going to kill you.

86
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I will kill you.

87
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You are a demon.

88
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You are a demon.

89
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You are a demon.

90
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I will take you to a safe place.

91
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I will take you to a safe place.

92
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I hope you can protect Ling'er and my father.

93
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Leave Nanjiao.

94
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Ting'er, I will help you.

95
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Brother Yixi, stop being stubborn.

96
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Just let me finish my own knife.

97
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Ting'er.

98
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Little brother,

99
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I will take care of you.

100
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Princess.

101
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Mother.

102
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Mother.

103
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Mother.

104
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Since I can't kill you,

105
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I will put you in the Wuhu Sect forever.

106
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Goodbye.

107
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
My country.

108
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
My knife.

109
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I don't want to go.

110
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I want to marry you.

111
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I don't want to go.

112
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I want to marry you.

113
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I want to marry you.

114
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I don't want to go.

115
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Ting'er, don't cry.

116
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I will come to you.

117
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I will come to you.

118
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I will come to you.

119
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I will come to you.

120
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I will come to you.

121
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Good girl.

122
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Old man.

123
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Promise me.

124
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Don't let Ling'er know about this.

125
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Let her be a normal girl.

126
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Can you?

127
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Don't worry.

128
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I won't let Ling'er go to her mother's path.

129
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Thank you.

130
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Thank you.

131
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Good girl.

132
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Don't cry.

133
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Look.

134
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Your Majesty.

135
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,240
Red

136
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Why there is red in the world?

137
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Ling'er.

138
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:18,600
I can't let Ling'er go through all the pain.

139
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,880
The history needs to be re-renewed.

140
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,600
Since the fairy tale is in the east,

141
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,000
we need to go to the west to find the best.

142
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,200
Brother, where are we going now?

143
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,000
I'll take you to a place in the west.

144
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,400
There are flowers and grass.

145
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,800
It's like a garden outside the city. It's beautiful.

146
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:49,000
Can Ling'er go home again?

147
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,600
That garden outside the city will be Ling'er's house in the future.

148
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,800
What about you, brother?

149
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,400
Let me think about it again.

150
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,600
Ling'er.

151
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,600
Hey, am I drunk?

152
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,400
Why isn't the sun setting?

153
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Will it fly into the earth's lens?

154
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Brother Feng Feng, let's go to that island.

155
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
The Great Wall

156
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Good boy, wait for me here.

157
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Senior, are you leaving?

158
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Can you promise me one thing?

159
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
What is it?

160
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Don't go to the Imperial College.

161
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Call a martial artist named Li Xiaoyao.

162
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
What? You have grudges with him?

163
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
No.

164
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
But please don't call him.

165
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
That's it.

166
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You are to blame.

167
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Who dares to blame me?

168
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You call me or not, I will.

169
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Don't be afraid.

170
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
This island is safe.

171
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
No one will come here.

172
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You are taking care of me and Princess.

173
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Please accept my respect.

174
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Get up.

175
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I am just doing the same thing.

176
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I have nothing to do with this.

177
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You are really a hero.

178
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Laolao, promise me one thing.

179
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Please say it.

180
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Don't let anyone enter this island.

181
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I am always like a princess.

182
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I will do my best to protect her.

183
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Brother, you are leaving.

184
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Ling, you are going to save her?

185
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Who?

186
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
A person I love.

187
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Brother, I can't bear to leave you.

188
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Ling, promise me.

189
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
From now on, you will live happily.

190
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
No matter what difficulties you face,

191
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
you have to smile.

192
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And listen to me.

193
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Brother, will you come to see Ling?

194
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Young Master, give her a chance.

195
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
What is this?

196
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
This is a seed.

197
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
When she is blooming,

198
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
she will come to see you.

199
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Really?

200
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It's a word.

201
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It's hard to guess.

202
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Remember,

203
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
you have to give her water every day.

204
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Take good care of her.

205
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Got it?

206
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Yes.

207
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I will give you a chance.

208
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Got it.

209
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I will give her water every day.

210
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
If so, she will bloom every day.

211
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Brother will come every day.

212
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Okay, say goodbye to her.

213
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Goodbye, brother.

214
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Goodbye.

215
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Brother.

216
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
What's your name?

217
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
My name is Li Xiaoyao.

218
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Goodbye, brother.

219
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I will wait for you here.

220
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
You are so stupid.

221
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Don't look at me.

222
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I am Li Xiaoyao.

223
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I will clean you up.

224
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Brother.

225
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Come here.

226
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
What's wrong?

227
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Brother, it's raining outside.

228
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Aren't you scared?

229
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I am Li Xiaoyao.

230
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I am not afraid of you.

231
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You are Li Xiaoyao?

232
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I am Li Xiaoyao.

233
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
The problem is one tael of water,

234
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
and the road is five taels of water.

235
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
The speed is ten taels of water.

236
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Are you always like this?

237
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
We know each other.

238
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I will give you a little.

239
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Of course we don't know each other.

240
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I just want to chat with you.

241
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Then don't bother me.

242
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You are so stupid.

243
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
You are so busy.

244
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Wait.

245
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
What is it?

246
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Can you show me this?

247
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
This is mine.

248
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I won't give it to you.

249
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Let me tell you.

250
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Do you know who I am?

251
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I am a famous hero.

252
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I will use this sword

253
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
to exchange for you.

254
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Okay?

255
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Really?

256
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Of course.

257
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
The hero speaks,

258
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
and the word is written.

259
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It's hard to guess.

260
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Okay.

261
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Here.

262
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Where is my candle?

263
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Here you are.

264
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Li Xiaoxia.

265
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
This is from Ma'er.

266
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I picked it up last night

267
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
at the lake.

268
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
So,

269
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I picked it up

270
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
ten years ago.

271
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Is it really the famous hero?

272
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
This man.

273
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
This man.

274
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
My wrist hurts.

275
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Can you show me?

276
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Where is it?

277
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Here.

278
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Why are you so careless?

279
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Take a look.

280
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Someone is picking flowers.

281
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Come and catch the big knife.

282
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Come on.

283
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Come on.

284
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It's a waste of time.

285
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You are picking flowers.

286
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It's him.

287
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It's him.

288
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
He is not a little man.

289
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Catch the sword.

290
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Catch him.

291
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Catch him.

292
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
You are so bold.

293
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Catch you to see the officials.

294
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You are so bold.

295
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
You are so bold.

296
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Catch him.

297
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You are so ridiculous.

298
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
You are so careless.

299
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
You are so careless.

300
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Stop.

301
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
You stole something.

302
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Which eye do you see?

303
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I stole it.

304
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
What's wrong?

305
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
What's wrong?

306
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Look.

307
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
What's wrong?

308
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It's him.

309
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
No wonder someone always kissed you.

310
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
It's the trick of you to steal something.

311
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Look how I clean it up.

312
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Why are you hitting him?

313
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Why are you hitting him?

314
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Listen to me.

315
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Miss Li didn't steal anything.

316
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I will pay for your loss.

317
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Why are you hitting him?

318
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Why are you hitting him?

319
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
What's the relationship?

320
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I met a fool.

321
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I don't know if he is unlucky or lucky.

322
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It's luck.

323
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Do you want to fight with me?

324
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
No.

325
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Take these.

326
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
What do you mean?

327
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
You are a monkey.

328
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Don't you like to eat red eggs?

329
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Let him eat more.

330
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
You are right.

331
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
If we weren't monkeys,

332
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
we would have been born.

333
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I wouldn't steal.

334
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
He must be crazy.

335
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Thank you.

336
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Thank you.

337
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Thank you so much.

338
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
What are you doing?

339
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Don't think I am a good bully.

340
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I am sorry.

341
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Wait.

342
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
What do you want?

343
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Can I go to your Yun Lai Yun Qu Inn?

344
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Go to the back door.

345
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Who are you?

346
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
My shop is open.

347
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
How do you know my name?

348
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Take these.

349
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I will open the shop.

350
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
He is crazy.

351
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Someone will give me money.

352
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I am lucky today.

353
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Take it.

354
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Thank you.

355
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Thank you.

356
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I am so lucky.

357
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I can open the shop.

358
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Goodbye.

359
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Brother.

360
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I don't know who you are.

361
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
But I will come to you

362
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
when my shop is open.

363
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Really?

364
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Really?

365
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I am a man.

366
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I am a man.

367
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I am a man.

368
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
You are the same.

369
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
You should not teach your little Xiao Yao.

370
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
So that she can be laughed at by others.

371
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Do we know each other?

372
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Yes.

373
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It has been 20 years.

374
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Don't say that.

375
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
You are like the stinky boy in my family.

376
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Of course.

377
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I will come back.

378
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
He is weird.

379
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
He is so kind.

380
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
He is so kind.

381
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I will take half of his money.

382
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Brother Feng.

383
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
What's wrong?

384
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Li Xiao Yao.

385
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
You finally understand

386
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
everything.

387
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Your Highness.

388
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Feng Ling Zhu and Feng Huang Dan.

389
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Take back the money.

390
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
This is my last gift.

391
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
This is the last gift

392
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
and my best wishes.

393
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

394
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
It's time to go back.

395
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I will fulfill all your wishes.

396
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Thank you.

397
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Your Highness.

398
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
These are all the children

399
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
who have waited for you.

400
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Only one person

401
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
can accept my wishes today.

402
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
They will be sent to our

403
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Baiyue Sect.

404
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
How dare you!

405
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
You are so rude.

406
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
You are not kneeling.

407
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Move aside.

408
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Little Qing.

409
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
charge.

410
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

411
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Everyone has never done this before.

412
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
We can't just do it.

413
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,720
It can't be helped.

414
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
You Paradира.

415
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Don't make me mad!

416
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,800
I believe in the Moon Sect.

417
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,800
You are right.

418
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,900
I never believed in the Moon Sect.

419
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,600
Why did you come here this time?

420
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,200
I chose to believe in you, Master.

421
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,600
Why?

422
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:06,600
Because you never believed in the Moon Sect.

423
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,800
How could you be so stupid?

424
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:14,100
Today, I have a new friend.

425
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,100
Let me bless you.

426
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,400
I will arrange you to work in the bamboo scroll.

427
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,700
Okay?

428
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,700
This is great. Thank you, Master.

429
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,100
I changed my history.

430
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,700
Ling'er should be still on that island.

431
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,500
She won't be here anymore, right?

432
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,700
Brother Xiao Yao, where are the phoenix eggs, green beans and those bamboo scrolls?

433
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,700
Ling'er...Is Ling'er still here?

434
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:04,100
Of course. Everyone is waiting for you. The princess is saved.

435
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,700
Ling'er?

436
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,500
Do you know the evil lady?

437
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,700
You brat. Have you gone crazy?

438
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,100
Do you know the evil lady?

439
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,400
Of course, I do know her.

440
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,900
Is...Is she dead?

441
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:49,100
I will never forget her.

442
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:53,100
She will always be in my heart.

443
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,100
Why is that?

444
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,100
I sent Ling'er to another island.

445
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,100
Why is she still here?

446
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,100
Why has everything not changed?

447
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,100
Is it true?

448
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:18,100
Is it true?

449
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:15,100
Master, let the princess come down.

450
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,100
Ling'er.

451
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,100
Xiaoyao, come here.

452
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,100
Brother Xiaoyao.

453
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,100
Brother Xiaoyao.

454
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,100
Brother Xiaoyao, I'm sorry.

455
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,100
I've been imploring you.

456
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:01,100
She killed Sister Yue Ru.

457
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,100
Why?

458
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,100
I told you everything.

459
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,100
How could it be like this?

460
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,100
What did you say?

461
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:21,100
Is everything just a fantasy?

462
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:24,100
But you took back those treasures.

463
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,100
What's going on?

464
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:34,100
Are you crazy? Where did you go?

465
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,100
I went back ten years ago.

466
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,100
What?

467
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,100
Ling'er.

468
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:46,100
You saw Xiaoyao when you were little.

469
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,100
It was really me.

470
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:52,100
Brother Xiaoyao, what's wrong?

471
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,100
I saw you.

472
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,100
And you.

473
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,100
You were in the South.

474
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,100
Ten years ago.

475
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,100
You were the one...

476
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:13,100
Dongyu Yujian Shu.

477
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,100
Was it you?

478
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,100
What are you doing there?

479
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:22,100
What's your relationship with the empress?

480
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,100
A'nuo.

481
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,100
Go and get some hot water.

482
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,100
But...

483
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,100
Go.

484
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,100
Let the princess rest.

485
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,100
You want to escape?

486
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:46,100
You want to stay here and not tell me?

487
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,100
I've told you many times that you're not in a good mood.

488
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,100
I warned you not to come here again.

489
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,100
You want to kill me?

490
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,100
You can leave.

491
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:02,100
But I must make it clear.

492
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,100
I have nothing to tell you.

493
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,100
Get out of here.

494
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,100
Not you.

495
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,100
Yuanqing.

496
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,100
A'nuo.

497
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:25,100
Who is your daughter?

498
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,100
Is she...

499
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:32,100
my daughter?

500
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:35,100
Mom.

501
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,100
Mom.

502
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,100
Mom.

503
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,100
Is my dad his?

504
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,100
Why don't you tell me?

505
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,100
Am I a daughter of the nine-legged fairy?

506
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,100
Tell me.

507
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,100
A'nuo, calm down.

508
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,100
I don't care.

509
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,100
Mom, tell me.

510
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,100
Master, what's going on?

511
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,100
Tell me.

512
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,100
Who am I?

513
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,100
Who am I?

514
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,100
Who am I?

515
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,100
The A'nuo you saw will cry.

516
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,100
I lost my weight on A'nuo.

517
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,100
As long as he sees her,

518
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:29,100
he will stop crying.

519
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:32,100
Until he admits that A'nuo is his daughter.

520
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,100
I knew it.

521
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,100
I just don't believe it.

522
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,100
Really?

523
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:55,100
Am I really your daughter of the nine-legged fairy?

524
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,100
Mom.

525
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:17,100
I've been asking you all these years.

526
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:19,100
Why?

527
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:23,100
I've been asking you since I first saw him 18 years ago.

528
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:26,100
I can't untie him now.

529
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,100
I'm sorry.

530
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:34,100
I'm sorry to have made you suffer.

531
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,100
Why are you here?

532
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,100
You are...

533
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,100
It's scary.

534
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:54,100
Is it because of the cause and the effect?

535
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:58,100
My doctor changed me 18 years ago because of a woman.

536
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,100
Her name is Qing'er.

537
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,100
She's the descendant of a female frog.

538
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,100
Why is the Nanzhao State

539
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,100
the most horrible disaster in the world?

540
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:12,100
Why is Qing'er and Yuan Qing

541
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,100
begging for the Nanzhao State?

542
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,100
I'm sorry.

543
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:51,100
Mom.

544
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,100
What's the scare for?

545
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,100
Drat!

546
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,100
What kind of horror is this?

547
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,100
And...

548
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,080
At any rate,

549
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,460
The Third Prince

550
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,840
Why a dumb prince

551
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,680
is going to see hisÉ

552
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,260
May Thessalonica help the Emperor

553
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,580
to apologize

554
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:16,580
I should report to you the great kindness of the Nanzhao State.

555
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:18,580
Please go.

556
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,580
Thank you, Your Majesty.

557
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,580
What's your name?

558
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,580
My name is Qing'er.

559
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:39,580
This is my sister, Mingyan Qing.

560
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,580
Qing'er, Yuanqing.

561
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,580
You are not feeling well.

562
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,580
Sit down.

563
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,580
Thank you, Your Majesty.

564
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,580
Come on. Bring the gifts.

565
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:04,580
These precious gifts are given to you by His Majesty.

566
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:08,580
I and my sister only wanted to bring the Nanzhao State's Ziming to the border.

567
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,580
I never thought about it.

568
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,580
Please take these gifts back.

569
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:16,580
I didn't expect you two to have the power.

570
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:19,580
You are so brave and bold.

571
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,580
I appreciate it.

572
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,580
This is our duty.

573
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,580
You don't have to appreciate it.

574
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:30,580
You two, I have something else to do.

575
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:33,580
As long as it's a good thing, as long as it's for the people,

576
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,580
we will do what His Majesty asks.

577
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,580
Great.

578
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:41,580
I want to ask you two to serve the country.

579
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:44,580
As the symbol of the Nanzhao State.

580
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:50,580
I hope you two can be the same.

581
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:54,580
I will teach you to give out all the love and care for the country.

582
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:02,580
I am grateful to Your Majesty for your kindness.

583
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:06,580
I am just afraid that the burden of our country will make His Majesty disappointed.

584
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:09,580
I won't look at the wrong person.

585
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:12,580
I am afraid that there will be no one to look at.

586
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,580
You two, please consider it first.

587
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,580
Why?

588
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:26,580
His Majesty wants to ask you to love him.

589
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:28,580
Why?

590
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,580
He wants to...

591
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,580
I do.

592
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:40,580
I am the happiest person in the world.

593
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:47,580
But before that, I have a request.

594
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,580
Say it.

595
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,580
I will agree to whatever request.

596
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,580
I hope that Your Majesty can give me three months.

597
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:56,580
I want to help the country to understand the world.

598
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,580
Okay.

599
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,580
Thank you, Your Majesty.

600
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,580
I also have a request.

601
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,580
Please say it.

602
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,580
The country is in a bad mood.

603
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,580
I can't go with you.

604
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:12,580
On the way, I need someone to help me.

605
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:17,580
Someone to help me.

606
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:24,580
Don't forget that you are happy.

607
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:28,580
I like the smile on your face.

608
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,580
Your Majesty.

609
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,580
I understand.

610
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,580
I am sorry.

611
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,580
I don't want to see you again.

612
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,580
I am sorry.

613
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,580
I am sorry.

614
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,580
I am sorry.

615
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,580
I am sorry.

616
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,580
I really can't understand.

617
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:16,580
I met a man who I really love.

618
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:19,580
His ambition has locked my heart.

619
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:23,580
I know that I will fall into the fire this time.

620
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,580
I forgot who I am.

621
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:32,580
I only know that I have fallen into their story.

622
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:35,580
I became a senior.

623
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,580
I became my senior.

624
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:44,580
I feel like I have experienced a new love.

625
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:49,580
Why does he appear in front of me?

626
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:53,580
Why does he fall in love with my senior?

627
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,580
I am sorry.

628
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,580
This is...

629
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,580
For you.

630
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,580
See if it is useful.

631
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:13,580
Tell me if it is useful.

632
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,580
Understand?

633
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,580
At this moment,

634
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,580
I will reveal myself to my senior.

635
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:24,580
I will be like my senior.

636
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:26,580
I will fall into the fire.

637
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,580
I will experience everything that my senior has experienced.

638
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:33,580
This world really has a love that is not suitable for me.

639
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:36,580
Where is the sea and the earth?

640
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,580
When we reach the end of the world,

641
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,580
we will find the smile of our hearts.

642
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:43,580
We will be happy.

643
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:53,580
The sky is clear.

644
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,580
I will keep waiting for you.

645
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:57,580
I will be determined.

646
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:00,580
I will wait for your news.

647
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:05,580
There will always be a day when you will believe me.

648
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:07,580
I love you.

649
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:09,580
I miss you.

650
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:13,580
In my heart, I can't be apart from you.

651
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:16,580
I will be in this world.

652
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:19,580
I will meet the owner of another half of the world.

653
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:22,580
I will be waiting for you.

654
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:25,580
I will be waiting for you.

655
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:42,580
In my heart,

656
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:44,580
the fire that has been burning

657
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,580
has been burning to the other side.

658
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:48,580
We both burn.

659
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:51,580
I can't be apart from you anymore.

660
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:53,580
I will be waiting for you.

661
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:05,580
We will be the first birds to fly in the sky.

662
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:08,580
We will fly over the mountains.

663
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:10,580
We will also cross the rivers of the mountains.

664
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:13,580
We will go to the end of the world

665
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:15,580
to see the end of the world.

666
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:17,580
We will always fly.

667
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:18,580
We will always fly.

668
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:20,580
We will always be there for you.

669
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:23,580
We all know that this is the time of the sea.

670
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,580
It is not the time for the rain.

671
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,580
This is the mark of our eternity.

672
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:53,580
I will be waiting for you.

673
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:56,580
I will be waiting for you.

674
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:59,580
I will be waiting for you.

675
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:02,580
I will be waiting for you.

676
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:05,580
I will be waiting for you.

677
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:08,580
I will be waiting for you.

678
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:11,580
I will be waiting for you.

679
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:14,580
I will be waiting for you.

680
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:17,580
I will be waiting for you.

681
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:19,580
I will be waiting for you.

682
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:22,580
I will be waiting for you.

683
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:25,580
I will be waiting for you.

684
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:28,580
I will be waiting for you.

685
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:31,580
I will be waiting for you.

686
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:34,580
I will be waiting for you.

687
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:37,580
I will be waiting for you.

688
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:40,580
I will be waiting for you.

689
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:43,580
I will be waiting for you.

690
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:46,580
I will be waiting for you.

691
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:49,580
Don't say anything.

692
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:54,580
I really don't want to know.

693
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:59,580
I just want to know that I have to let go.
