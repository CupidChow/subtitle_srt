Right, we've been here for so many days.

What are they talking about?

93
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,640
Go on.

94
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,640
I have something to tell you.

95
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,640
Go on.

96
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,640
Princess, Yifu said that Li Xiaoyao is not dead.

97
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,640
You need to think of a way.

98
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,640

00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,640
Go on.

103
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,640
You can't do anything.

104
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,640
I won't take you.

105
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,640

He's coming.

113
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,640

00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,640
Go on.

115
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,640
Go on.

116
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:51,640
Why is it like this? No one cares about Anu.

117
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:59,640
Anu wants it too! Anu wants it too!

118
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,640

119
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,640

124
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,640
Big Happy! You bad woman! You bully my man and hurt my woman first!

125
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:33,640
You want to take my woman's man? I'll bite you to death!

126
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,640
I'm bored! What's so fun about this?

127
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,640
It's fun to play with a wife. If you're bored, just go to hell.

128
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,640
You won't be bored.

129
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,640
You bastard!

130
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,640
You're so good! You dare to hit my woman's man!

131
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,640
I won't let you live!

132
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,640
Why did you hit me in Suzhou?

133
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,640
What are you doing?

134
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,640
You bastard! I'll beat you to death!

135
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,640
Brother Tang Yu, don't be nervous. There will be more chances in the future.

136
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,640
Thank you, Princess.

137
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,640

Thank you.

139
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,640
Brother Xiaoyao, have some meat.

140
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,640
What are you talking about?

141
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,640
Do you have a novel for him?

142
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,640
Brother Xiaoyao, you're so filial!

143
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,640
You forgot the old love so quickly. You're with me now.

144
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,640
You're so greedy!

145
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,640
Brother Xiaoyao, you're so filial!

146
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,640
You're so filial!

147
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,640
You forgot the old love so quickly. You're with me now.

148
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,640
You're so greedy!

149
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,640
Open your mouth!

150
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,640
Open your mouth!

151
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,640
You're a pervert!

152
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,640
Enough!

153
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,640
Everyone knows that even if the woman is dead,

154
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,640
I won't ask you to be so ugly and lazy.

155
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,640
Don't ask me to help you.

156
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,640
You're so filial!

157
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,640
Brother Tang Yu, thank you.

158
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,640
You can't eat anything for dinner.

159
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,640
Thank you, Princess.

160
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,640
I won't play with you. I'm not a good girl.

161
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,640
I want to drink some wine.

162
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,640
We have a flower street here.

163
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,640
It's suitable for young people to play with.

164
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,640
Okay, go with me.

165
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,640

Go?

169
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,640
Don't forget to come back to practice tomorrow morning.

170
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,640
He's so rich.

171
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,640
He knows that he doesn't have money to drink.

172
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,640
I know.

173
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,640
Son, take this.

174
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,640
Go.

175
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,640
I want to go, too.

176
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,640
I want to go, too.

177
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,640
Why do you want to drink wine?

178
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,640
Leave it to me.

179
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,640
I'll clean it up and brush it off.

180
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,640
Brush it off? I won't do it.

181
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,640
What? You've never been here?

182
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,640
I've never been here.

183
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,640
You're even more shy than our A-xi.

184
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,640
I'll call you 14.

185
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,640
What do you mean?

186
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,640
What do you mean?

187
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,640
Let's go.

188
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,640
Where are you?

189
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,640
Come on, I want you to drink with me.

190
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,640
One more.

191
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,640
Thank you, Ye Ning.

192
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,640
Actually, Tang Yu has someone in his heart.

193
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,640
You finally admit it.

194
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,640
Why are you so surprised?

195
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,640
Tell me.

196
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,640
What did you do to him?

197
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,640
Nothing.

198
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,640
Nothing?

199
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,640
Then what did he do to you?

200
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,640
Why are you so nervous?

201
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,640
It's between us.

202
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,640
What's between you and him?

203
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,640
Tell me.

204
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,640
What did he do to you?

205
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,640
I'm sorry to say it here.

206
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,640
If you don't, I'll kill you.

207
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,640
He kissed me.

208
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,640
Kissed you?

209
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,640
What else?

210
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,640
Li, did you drink too much?

211
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,640
Do you want to take a rest?

212
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,640
Answer me!

213
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,640
We've made a date.

214
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,640
A date?

215
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,640
I'll kill you!

216
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,640
Brother!

217
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,640
I'll kill you!

218
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,640
Is this the order I made between you and Anu?

219
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,640
Anu?

220
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,640
Tell me.

221
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,640
What did you say to him?

222
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,640
He kissed you.

223
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,640
He's Anu.

224
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,640
Who else?

225
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,640
Where's Ling'er and you?

226
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,640
Where's Ling'er?

227
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,640
Ling'er is the princess of the High Court.

228
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,640
I'm just a humble official.

229
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,640
You mean Anu?

230
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,640
Anu?

231
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,640
Anu is good.

232
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,640
Anu is good!

233
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,640
Anu is the best!

234
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,640
Shisi, I like you.

235
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,640
I really like you.

236
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,640
Li, are you okay?

237
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,640
I'm fine.

238
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,640
I just misunderstood you.

239
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,640
Let's drink.

240
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,640
Come on, cheers!

241
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,640
Cheers!

242
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,640
You haven't eaten for three days?

243
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,640
I'm so happy!

244
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,640
What?

245
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,640
You've been treating me well.

246
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,640
You've been eating for ten years.

247
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,640
You can't eat without a meal.

248
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,640
This is my first time being a young man!

249
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,640
What did you say?

250
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,640
Li, thank you.

251
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,640
Shisi, you're so funny!

252
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,640
Li, why did you call me Shisi?

253
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,640
Listen, I have a friend.

254
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,640
He's so like you.

255
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,640
You were so childish in the inn.

256
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,640
You were even more childish than him.

257
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,640
You were even more stupid.

258
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,640
I'm used to calling him Aqi.

259
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,640
You're more serious than him.

260
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,640
So I called you Shisi.

261
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,640
So that's what happened.

262
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,640
Aqi!

263
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,640
Master Li, you're making me laugh.

264
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,640
Why are you here?

265
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,640
I said you're here.

266
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,640
You're here again.

267
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,640
Master Li, why are you here?

268
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,640
Master Li, I'm dizzy.

269
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,640
Why are you still so weak?

270
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,640
Master Li, you're...

271
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,640
You're the best.

272
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,640
Shisi, this handsome guy is my disciple, Aqi.

273
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,640
Shisi.

274
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,640
Don't eat.

275
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,640
Shisi, I'm Liu Jingyuan.

276
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,640
Hello.

277
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,640
I'm Tang Yu.

278
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,640
I want to meet you.

279
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,640
So you were in the inn that day.

280
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,640
We're so lucky.

281
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,640
Can we have dinner?

282
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,640
Aqi, you're finally here.

283
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,640
I'm so happy.

284
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,640
Master Li, you're drunk.

285
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,640
No.

286
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,640
Aqi, you called me Huang Litu Sun in Chang'an.

287
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,640
Why are you here?

288
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,640
The information about the people in the palace

289
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,640
was left by the Crown Prince.

290
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,640
It's been a few hundred years.

291
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,640
The Crown Prince has been promoted.

292
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,640
His Majesty cares about the people.

293
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:31,640
So he sent Jingyuan to collect new information.

294
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,640
So I'm here.

295
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,640
Is that so?

296
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,640
You still don't understand?

297
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,640
By the way, I just saw your book.

298
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,640
You know the words of the South State.

299
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,640
I really don't understand.

300
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,640
It's easy.

301
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,640
Really?

302
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,640
Maybe I'm from the South State.

303
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,640
Then please teach me a lot of things.

304
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,640
You're welcome.

305
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,640
If I didn't read the book,

306
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,640
I wouldn't understand.

307
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,640
But I'll help you with anything.

308
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,640
Thank you.

309
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,640
Brother Liu, you're a Talisman, right?

310
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,640
Awesome.

311
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,640
I'm sorry.

312
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,640
Awesome.

313
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,640
I'm sorry.

314
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,640
Okay.

315
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,640
What's the meaning of being a Talisman?

316
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,640
Let me tell you.

317
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,640
My disciple is a Chinese.

318
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,640
He's a bit stupid.

319
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,640
But the book is the first.

320
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,640
How is it?

321
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,640
You don't know it?

322
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,640
Awesome.

323
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,640
Awesome.

324
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,640
Sorry.

325
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,640
Awesome.

326
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,640
Qi, listen.

327
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,640
Now we live with Ling'er and your cousin.

328
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,640
How about living with us?

329
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,640
I was supposed to live in the perfect inn.

330
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,640
Now I move to live with you.

331
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,640
That's great.

332
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,640
Perfect inn is the perfect inn in the whole province.

333
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,640
I was supposed to help you.

334
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,640
But I was surrounded by people.

335
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,640
So it's you, Brother Liu.

336
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,640
Awesome.

337
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,640
Awesome.

338
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,640
Please.

339
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,640
Awesome.

340
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,640
Awesome.

341
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,640
Awesome.

342
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,640
Hey, you.

343
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,640
Here.

344
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,640
This is my disciple, Qi.

345
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,640
Open the room for him.

346
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,640
You're a young hero.

347
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,640
You have such a big disciple.

348
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,640
Awesome.

349
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,640
Awesome.

350
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,640
Qi.

351
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,640
Open the room for Qi.

352
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,640
Okay.

353
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,640
Brother Jingyan.

354
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,640
Cousin.

355
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,640
Miss Ling'er.

356
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,640
Cousin.

357
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,640
Cousin.

358
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,640
Long time no see.

359
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,640
How are you?

360
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,640
Listen.

361
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:37,640
This time Jingyuan is here to make a test for my disciple.

362
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,640
So my master is here.

363
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,640
Your disciple?

364
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,640
He's the emperor's old man.

365
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,640
So he's the emperor's teacher.

366
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,640
Brother Jingyuan.

367
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,640
Ling'er has a lot to say to you.

368
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,640
Yes.

369
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,640
I have a lot to say to you.

370
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,640
I have a lot.

371
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,640
A'nuo.

372
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,640
Do you know Qi?

373
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,640
Not really.

374
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,640
I'm only two years old.

375
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,640
Okay.

376
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,640
Let's all come to my room together.

377
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,640
I think you must have some feelings.

378
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,640
And you shouldn't say it out loud.

379
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,640
Yes.

380
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,640
I see.

381
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,640
I'm your cousin.

382
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,640
I have something to tell you.

383
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,640
Okay.

384
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,640
Come one by one.

385
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,640
Okay.

386
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,640
I'm your cousin.

387
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,640
I have something to tell you.

388
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,640
Okay.

389
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,640
Come one by one.

390
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,640
Okay.

391
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,640
My cousin.

392
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,640
How are you?

393
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,640
Brother Chou has separated from Ling'er.

394
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,640
Isn't this a good thing for you?

395
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,640
Chou has been looking for Ling'er everywhere.

396
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,640
He's been through a lot.

397
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,640
He's been to Jiangshi,

398
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,640
Yangzhou, and Hamajin.

399
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,640
He's been through a lot.

400
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,640
He's been talking about his separation.

401
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,640
Have you ever thought about how much he has done for him?

402
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,640
He's been thinking about his sins

403
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,640
when he was drunk.

404
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,640
Do you know how much he has done for him?

405
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,640
I'm not talking about Ling'er.

406
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,640
I'm talking about how to stop them from dating

407
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,640
when they're in trouble.

408
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,640
Can't they be together?

409
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,640
Is it the best way to separate?

410
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,640
Maybe she has met a lot of things

411
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,640
on the road.

412
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,640
She's changed her mind.

413
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,640
She's changed a lot of things.

414
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,640
Is it less than what she has met?

415
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,640
She hasn't changed.

416
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,640
Why did she change?

417
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,640
Who was she?

418
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,640
She said she loved Xiao Yao.

419
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,640
What?

420
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,640
She's not going to be a good girl now?

421
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,640
She's not going to be a good girl now?

422
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,640
She's going to be a good girl now?

423
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,640
My cousin.

424
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,640
Love is never fair.

425
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,640
She can even say

426
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,640
she's the most unfair and unreasonable person in the world.

427
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,640
Okay.

428
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,640
It's not fair to love.

429
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,640
It's not fair to love.

430
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,640
It's fair to be separated.

431
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,640
Do you know

432
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,640
every move she makes

433
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,640
is a great shock and harm to the enemy?

434
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,640
But she's always been like this.

435
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,640
The pain in the enemy's heart

436
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,640
is getting worse.

437
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,640
Then she sprinkle salt on it.

438
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,640
Do you know

439
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,640
how bad the enemy is?

440
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,640
How painful and painful she is?

441
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,640
Do you know how an enemy is?

442
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,640
He's always

443
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,640
trying to act in a good way

444
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,640
every day.

445
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,640
But in the evening,

446
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,840
When he's alone in the room,

447
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,440
he will cry.

448
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,360
It's just that I asked him

449
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,640
and he knew so much about

450
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,880
Master Li's matter.

451
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,600
That is to say,

452
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,080
you are now

453
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,160
not very good.

454
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,920
It's not good to be a bad person.

455
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,080
It's not the same.

456
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,200
Cousin,

457
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,400
you've worked hard.

458
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,600
Cousin,

459
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,680
you are great.

460
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,600
You can love someone like that

461
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,480
and make him happy.

462
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,480
Although you know

463
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,840
the end of his happiness

464
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,640
is not for you.

465
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,440
Maybe

466
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,200
it's a lesson from Cousin.

467
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,560
We have to accept our fall.

468
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,820
Sweetie,

469
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,440
how about your divorce?

470
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:18,440
Love is not like knowing each other.

471
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:22,440
Miao Mei, just sleep well.

472
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,440
Let time solve all the problems.

473
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:34,440
Love is not like knowing each other.

474
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,440
Love is not like knowing each other.

475
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,440
Love is not like knowing each other.

476
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,440
What are you doing?

477
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,440
Are you helping?

478
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,440
Of course I am helping you.

479
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,440
Then why did you drink with Li Xiao Yao?

480
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,440
What are you doing?

481
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,440
You drive me mad.

482
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,440
What should we do?

483
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,440
Or we'll see Master Shi Zhang

484
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,440
and he'll say you again.

485
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,440
Wrong!

486
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,440
What are you talking about?

487
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,440
Master Shi Zhang taught me.

488
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,440
Wrong!

489
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,440
You're talking about monkey power.

490
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,440
You're wrong in every action.

491
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,440
Sorry.

492
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,440
No.

493
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,440
You're not wrong.

494
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,440
You only eat after practicing a hundred times.

495
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,440
I see.

496
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,440
Great!

497
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,440
Tang Yu didn't get scolded by Master.

498
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,440
Why?

499
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,440
Didn't you get scolded by Master?

500
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,440
You're so stupid.

501
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,440
Young Master Shi.

502
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,440
You've worked hard.

503
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,440
It's so delicious.

504
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,440
It's delicious.

505
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,440
You went to drink again last night?

506
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,440
It's your fault.

507
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,440
Young Master Shi.

508
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,440
We've been here for many days.

509
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,440
Can we leave now?

510
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,440
Yes.

511
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,440
Should we leave now?

512
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,440
You must be having fun.

513
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,440
Yes.

514
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,440
There are many good places you went to yesterday.

515
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,440
What else?

516
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,440
Tell us.

517
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,440
There's a mountain in the east.

518
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,440
It's as beautiful as the sky.

519
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,440
Really?

520
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,440
Let's go together.

521
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,440
Yes.

522
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,440
It's a pity.

523
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,440
Let's go together.

524
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,440
Let's go together.

525
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,440
Let's go together.

526
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,440
Master Shi.

527
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,440
We've been here for two days.

528
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,440
Let's go together.

529
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,440
Brother Jingyuan.

530
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,440
Let's chat with Ling'er.

531
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,440
Qi.

532
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,440
Come here.

533
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,440
I'll teach you a lesson.

534
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,440
Brother Jingyuan.

535
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,440
Long time no see.

536
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,440
Ling'er is very concerned about you.

537
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,440
Ling'er.

538
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,440
Have you forgotten that we're iron-tree-tree-tree?

539
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,440
Young Master Li.

540
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,440
Wait.

541
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,440
Ling'er.

542
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,440
I don't dare to say that

543
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,440
girls should be a little bit reserved.

544
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,440
Brother Jingyuan.

545
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,440
Ling'er really has something to say to you.

546
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,440
The dead man has already decided.

547
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,440
You say it.

548
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,440
I've seen it.

549
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,440
It's okay.

550
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,440
I don't have a watch.

551
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,440
Let me tell you.

552
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,440
Brother Jingyuan.

553
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,440
I want to play with you.

554
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,440
Brother Jingyuan.

555
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,440
Long time no see.

556
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,440
Brother Jingyuan.

557
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,440
Brother Jingyuan.

558
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,440
Qi seems to be having a good time.

559
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,440
Everyone is playing with him.

560
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,440
Don't.

561
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,440
Little Wen.

562
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,440
Big fast.

563
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,440
When will you come?

564
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,440
Then we'll see when you leave.

565
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,440
Don't you want to leave now?

566
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,440
We have to solve the problem in time.

567
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,440
Heartless.

568
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,440
Disappointment.

569
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,440
Disappointment.

570
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,440
Where?

571
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,440
What are you talking about?

572
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,440
What's the point?

573
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,440
Think of a way.

574
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,440
You bad woman.

575
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,440
You bully my man.

576
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,440
You bully my woman.

577
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,440
You bully my woman.

578
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,440
You bully my woman.

579
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,440
You even protect my woman.

580
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,440
You're so selfish.

581
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,440
Do you want to be scared?

582
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,440
I'm scared.

583
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,440
I'm scared.

584
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,440
I'll beat you to death.

585
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,440
What should we do?

586
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,440
Qi is so fierce.

587
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,440
Brother Jingyuan.

588
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,440
Don't be scared.

589
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,440
Don't be scared.

590
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,440
Okay.

591
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,440
It's rare to have good friends together.

592
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,440
Let's play a game.

593
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,440
Let's play the game.

594
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,440
This game is called

595
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,440
fate.

596
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,440
Qi is so stupid.

597
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,440
He will have a stupid idea.

598
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,440
What?

599
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,440
He's so stupid.

600
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,440
But it's Brother Jingyuan's idea.

601
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,440
I'm sorry to refuse.

602
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,440
I want to play.

603
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,440
I want to play.

604
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,440
I want to play.

605
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,440
I want to play.

606
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,440
This game is very simple.

607
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,440
Close your eyes.

608
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,440
Then take a direction.

609
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,440
Go forward.

610
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,440
You have to count 50 times in your heart.

611
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,440
Keep walking.

612
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,440
Whoever is there

613
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,440
can meet the other person before the marriage.

614
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,440
This means

615
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,440
he has a fate with that person.

616
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,440
Everyone, get ready.

617
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,440
Close your eyes.

618
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,440
Go.

619
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,440
Come here.

620
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,440
Hello, my sister.

621
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,440
You want to scare Zi Yuan?

622
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,440
My sister.

623
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,440
Are we fated to meet?

624
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,440
No.

625
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,440
Who is fated to meet?

626
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,440
That's right.

627
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,440
Although this is just a game,

628
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,440
my sister has to follow the rules.

629
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,440
Brother Tao,

630
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,440
why do you play this game?

631
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,440
We play together all day.

632
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,440
What chance

633
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,440
do you have

634
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,440
to get along with Master Li and Miss Ling'er?

635
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,440
You know the chance

636
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,440
to talk to them?

637
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,440
The one who knows me

638
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,440
is the fated sister of Yue Ru who is smart and gentle.

639
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,440
Yes.

640
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,440
What?

641
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,440
Remember to follow the rules.

642
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,440
A'nu, what a coincidence.

643
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,440
We meet again.

644
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,440
Tang Xiaobao,

645
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,440
we are so fated to meet.

646
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,440
A'nu,

647
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,440
I didn't expect we meet again.

648
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,440
What?

649
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,440
Why are you following me?

650
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,440
Brother A'nu,

651
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,440
are you ok?

652
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,440
Brother A'nu,

653
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,440
what a coincidence.

654
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,440
Miss A'nu,

655
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,440
please stand up.

656
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,440
Sister A'nu,

657
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,440
are you ok?

658
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,440
Sister A'nu,

659
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,440
please stand up.

660
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,240
I don't know.

661
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,240
What will happen to my princess and your master?

662
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,640
If they can have a talk, that's great.

663
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,240
I've been talking about this for a long time.

664
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,040
But Ling'er's sister is so stubborn.

665
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,240
It's hard to say.

666
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,940
You have many rules.

667
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,140
You're a religious person, right?

668
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,440
I'll walk by myself.

669
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,440
You'll walk by yourself?

670
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,240
Then we're really very human.

671
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,440
It's hard.

672
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,440
It's hard.

673
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,440
It's hard.

674
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,440
It's hard.

675
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,440
What should we do?

676
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,640
I'll walk by myself.

677
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,440
It's a human tree.

678
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,440
You must stop.

679
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,440
You must stop.

680
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,240
I'll walk by myself.

681
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:08,240
Why aren't they talking?

682
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,240
I've let my brother down.

683
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,240
Yes.

684
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:23,240
Actually, my heart...

685
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,240
hurts so much.

686
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,240
It hurts so much.

687
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,240
You...

688
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,240
Sir.

689
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,240
You two are good people.

690
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,240
You're the one who's with me.

691
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,240
Okay?

692
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,240
Seven years.

693
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,240
Seven years.

694
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,240
We're all in the phase of a marriage.

695
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:01,240
But one day, he told me he'd break up with me.

696
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,240
He said he couldn't say anything.

697
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,240
He said he was in a bad mood.

698
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:10,240
He said we're different people.

699
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,240
I'm so sorry.

700
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,240
What's the difference?

701
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,240
We're different people.

702
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,240
It's good to be apart.

703
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,240
You two don't understand.

704
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,240
Nothing's the difference.

705
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,240
I just broke up with him.

706
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,240
With him?

707
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,240
Yes.

708
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,240
We're good people now.

709
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,240
We can still come out and play.

710
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,240
Yes.

711
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,240
How can we do that?

712
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,240
Why not?

713
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,240
We're friends.

714
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,240
You're lying.

715
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,240
I thought we could do that.

716
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,240
I thought he'd come out and eat.

717
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:59,240
But he cried and told me

718
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,240
we can't continue like this.

719
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,240
We promised we'd never see each other again.

720
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:07,240
But we couldn't stand it.

721
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,240
Why did you break up?

722
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,240
He had his own difficulties.

723
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,240
I didn't want to make things difficult for him.

724
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,240
But after we broke up,

725
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,240
we still cared about each other.

726
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,240
But sometimes, we really hurt each other.

727
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,240
What should I do?

728
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,240
What should I do?

729
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,240
What should I do?

730
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,240
Help me.

731
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,240
Why didn't I see your mouth empty?

732
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,240
Of course.

733
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,240
I like it.

734
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,240
How many meals did you eat today?

735
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,240
You're lying.

736
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,240
I only ate two.

737
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,240
It's the eighth.

738
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,240
I forgot.

739
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,240
It's like a white meal.

740
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,240
Why are you back so early?

741
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,240
It's bitter.

742
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,240
Stop there.

743
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,240
Qi, Shisi.

744
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,240
We're going to find the night bird.

745
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,240
Who's the night bird?

746
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,240
Who's the night bird?

747
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,240
It's a very wild and noisy bird.

748
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,240
Go.

749
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,240
Go and enjoy yourself.

750
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,240
You bastard. I want to go.

751
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,240
I want to go.

752
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,240
Why do you want to spend the night?

753
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,240
Go back and take a rest.

754
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,240
Take a rest again?

755
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,240
Come here.

756
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,240
Come here.

757
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,240
Come here.

758
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,240

Mr. Huang He.

770
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,240

771
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,240

772
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,240
Mr. Huang He.

773
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,240

774
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,240

Do you know who I am?

779
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,240
I don't know.

780
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,240
Then let me tell you.

781
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,240
I'm the master of this man.

782
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,240
Master, you're so old.

783
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,240
Master Li.

784
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,240
Master Li.

785
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,240
Can you leave?

786
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,240
I...

787
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,240
You don't want to leave?

788
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,240
I didn't mean that.

789
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,240
Then leave.

790
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,240
Master Zhang.

791
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,240
Can you let me relax for two days?

792
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,240
Do you really feel a little bit relaxed?

793
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,240
Okay?

794
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,240
It's not easy to leave me out.

795
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,240
I'm going to the hospital.

796
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,240
I'm the master of this man.

797
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,240
I'm here to see you.

798
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,240
You hit me.

799
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,240
What are you doing?

800
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,240
Why are you always staring at me?

801
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,240
I'm not.

802
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,240
It's you.

803
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,240
How dare you, Miss Yu Longfei.

804
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,240
You think you're so great?

805
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,240
You're a big-headed man.

806
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,240
You're a man.

807
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,240
You're a man.

808
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,240
You're a man.

809
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,240

00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,240
You're a man.

817
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,240
You're a man.

818
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,240
Why aren't they coming back?

819
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,240
Go away.

820
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,240
You're a man.

821
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,240
Don't run.

822
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,240
What are you doing?

823
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,240
You're a man.

824
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,240
You're a man.

825
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,240
Let me go.

826
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,240
I just finished the car.

827
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,240
I'll clean it up.

828
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,240
Come on.

829
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,240
Let's go.

830
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,240
Let's go.

831
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,240
Miss Yu Longfei.

832
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,240
Miss Yu Longfei.

833
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,240
Stop.

834
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,240
You've touched me enough.

835
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,240
Why don't we play a game?

836
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,240
Okay.

837
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,240
Stop.

838
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,240
Let's play the hit-and-run game.

839
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,240
Hit-and-run game.

840
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,240
Hit-and-run game.

841
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,240
I don't believe you.

842
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,240
You can't say it when you drink too much.

843
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,240
It's not easy to force me to drink so much.

844
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,240
My heart is beating fast as it's getting a lot more heavy.

845
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,240
Make up for it.

846
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,240
dramatic

847
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,240
Remember to go home.

848
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,240
Don't sleep.

849
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,240
Dear,

850
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,240
Let's go home.

851
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,240
Let's go.

852
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,240
Let's go.

853
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,240
Let's go.

854
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,240
Let's go.

855
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:48,740

862
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:15,900
Yidang What?

00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:16,340
I'mOld

864
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,340
I'm here.

865
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:20,340
So you're the young master of the 14th Emperor.

866
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:23,340
You're here to invite me.

867
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:26,340
Why do you even call my name?

868
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:28,340
I'm a high-class player.

869
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:32,340
I'm a good player.

870
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,340
I'm a new player.

871
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:41,340
Master Li, your name is so common.

872
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:50,340
I've been fried by you.

873
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,340
It hurts.

874
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:54,340
You're so lucky.

875
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:57,340
I told you to bring that bastard out to play.

876
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:59,340
You refused to die.

877
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,340
Now, you're a woman.

878
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,340
You called yourself a bastard.

879
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,340
You're so quick.

880
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,340
You're too much.

881
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,340
Master, you're the only one who can eat the poison.

882
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,340
It hurts.

883
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,340
You're so lucky.

884
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:18,340
I've invited you to eat more than 20,000 noodles.

885
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:20,340
Brother Xiaoyao.

886
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:23,340
Master Li.

887
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:27,340
I'm so lucky.

888
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:30,340
Come on.

889
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:35,340
Master Li, you're the most lucky.

890
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,340
Why didn't I drink?

891
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,340
Master Li, you're the most lucky.

892
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:43,340
More than 2 people in double standard are the best.

893
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:47,340
You are the most lucky.

894
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:00,340
You're so lucky.

895
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:07,340
You can sleep in...

896
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:09,340
I'm going to sleep.

897
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:11,340
I'm going to sleep.

898
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:13,340
I'm going to sleep.

899
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:20,340
I'm going to sleep.

900
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:28,340
I'll teach you to use the piano.

901
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,340
Are you okay?

902
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:35,340
I'm okay.

903
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:40,340
Don't worry, Mr. Zhang.

904
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:42,340
I'll clean it up.

905
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:09,340
I'll clean it up.

906
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:17,340
Why are you looking for a second-hand piano?

907
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:20,340
Shh.

908
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:36,340
It's so quiet at night.

909
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,340
Why are you so quiet?

910
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:50,340
What are you doing?

911
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:54,340
A'nuo, A'nuo, don't pick the kid.

912
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:20,340
Miss Li, such a good evening.

913
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,340
Qi and Chi.

914
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:46,340
Let's drink.

915
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:50,060
Let's go.

916
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,580
Son,

917
00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:01,060
Let's enjoy ourselves.

918
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:10,920
Go.

919
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,260
And I?

920
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:16,820
Sorry to disappoint you.

921
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:56,340
I'm afraid that I'll be lost in the future

922
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:00,340
Don't say anything

923
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:03,340
I don't want to understand

924
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:10,340
At least I still have a beautiful dream

925
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:13,340
Don't say anything

926
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:17,340
I really don't want to understand

927
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:23,340
I finally understand that I should let go

928
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:27,340
Don't say anything

929
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:30,340
I don't want to understand

930
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:37,340
At least I still have a beautiful dream

931
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:41,340
Don't say anything

932
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:45,340
I really don't want to understand

933
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:49,340
I finally understand that I should let go
