1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of you.

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of you.

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of you.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of you.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of you.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of you.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of you.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of you.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of you.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of you.

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm not afraid of you.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm not afraid of you.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not afraid of you.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm not afraid of you.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm not afraid of you.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm not afraid of you.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not afraid of you.

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Why don't you go and find cousin?

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yes.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm sorry for my sister-in-law's relationship.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm sorry to bother you.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What are you looking at?

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Mrs. Liu gave it to me.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I should have taken it to see the book.

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Is it from the doctor?

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Look, there's a secret.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Did you remember what A Ji told us?

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
There's a special place on the heart of the person.

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Even if it's torn, it won't be a problem.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I remember.

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Cousin Biao saved Mr. Xiao.

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Look, there's a secret.

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Do you still remember it?

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
No.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
After the student is ill, he keeps reading the book.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I want to see if I can help him.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
If I did, I would have found it long ago.

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It wouldn't have turned out like this.

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What? Are you worried about him?

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And Ling'er.

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Ling'er, you should save Zijing and Hu Lu tomorrow.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'll help Biao.

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
No.

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Then you can stay with him.

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
No?

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What about me?

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What do you want?

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'll stay with him.

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And then we'll save Ling'er.

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You...

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Didn't I tell you?

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You can't do that.

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Didn't I tell you?

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You should help me.

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
But someone said that I hate him the most.

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Really?

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But...

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'll be very stupid without you.

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Where's my ring?

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Give me one.

62
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You're so beautiful.

63
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I told you I won't drink.

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What are you doing?

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Get out of here.

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Be careful.

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
What's wrong?

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You're getting mad again?

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's normal to fight.

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Don't worry.

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yuanyi told us about the cause of the disaster.

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
She's so pitiful.

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Come, have a talk with me.

74
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Let me do it.

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Why?

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I still miss you.

77
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You're not a martial artist.

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
But you're still healthy.

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Qi, did you really get hurt?

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yes.

81
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You told me that

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
someone would do the eyebrows before lying.

83
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What happened?

84
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You really want me to tell you the truth?

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm sleepy.

86
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm really sleepy.

87
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm going to bed.

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Good night.

89
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm sleepy.

90
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Brother Xiaoyao.

91
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Brother Xiaoyao.

92
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Ling'er, I miss you so much.

93
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I want to take you away.

94
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
We're the same world.

95
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
We'll never be apart.

96
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I can't go back.

97
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I can't go back.

98
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I can't go back.

99
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I can't go back.

100
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I can't go back.

101
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I can't go back.

102
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I can't go back.

103
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
We...

104
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Thank you, Brother Xiaoyao.

105
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You're always the one

106
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
who knows me the most.

107
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Maybe this is the blow to me.

108
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I really hope that you can forget her.

109
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Forget everything.

110
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Ling'er.

111
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Ling'er.

112
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Ling'er.

113
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Ling'er.

114
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I won't go with you.

115
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I won't go. I'll go with you.

116
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Father.

117
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'll ask you again.

118
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Are you going or not?

119
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm not going. Unless you kill me.

120
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I dare not.

121
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Brother, please say something.

122
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
What else?

123
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Father, you're so wrong.

124
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'll ask you again.

125
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
What do you want?

126
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I want to go with you to Mount Zu and save Ling'er.

127
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Come out with me.

128
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'll talk to you in private.

129
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Okay.

130
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Chou Dan.

131
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yu Ru.

132
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
There are some things that are better without you.

133
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm a fool.

134
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I don't know what you did to me.

135
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
But don't think about me.

136
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I know that you're in love with that girl.

137
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm telling you.

138
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I can forgive the past.

139
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
But from now on,

140
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
you can't meet that girl again.

141
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's hard to kill me.

142
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
If you can block my arrow today,

143
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I won't ask you and Ru'er about it again.

144
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
If you're just a coward,

145
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'll shut up today.

146
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Don't delay my daughter's life.

147
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
If you really have the ability,

148
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
take out your arrow.

149
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Go.

150
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Get out of the way.

151
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Then you'll be punished.

152
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Maybe I'm too much.

153
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Can she really leave after saving her life?

154
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It has nothing to do with that girl.

155
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's the best to be together.

156
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You can really bear to see

157
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
another girl in her heart.

158
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Maybe she's even higher than you.

159
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You can really love someone who's innocent.

160
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Even if you're second in her heart,

161
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
even if you're even lower than her.

162
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You're really a coward.

163
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You can really bear to see another girl in her heart.

164
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You can really bear to see another girl in her heart.

165
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
If you really have the ability,

166
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
take out your arrow.

167
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Then you'll be punished.

168
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I can.

169
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Since I took out Lingjia Bao,

170
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I've known it.

171
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
The first reason I started to take out my arrow

172
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
was to save Lingya.

173
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
But there were so many things going on.

174
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I've been thinking about it.

175
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I've been thinking about it.

176
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
We've changed.

177
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
We've grown up.

178
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Ling'er might be the one who always cares about you.

179
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
They're the best friends after they've been together.

180
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
But what I want is just a small love in my heart.

181
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I just want to be with her and be with her.

182
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Then I'll be satisfied.

183
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Chou Dan.

184
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Chou Dan.

185
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Chou Dan.

186
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Chou Dan, are you okay?

187
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Of course.

188
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Dad, you're so bully.

189
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Ru'er, I'll ask you again.

190
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Do you have to be with this person?

191
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Dad, do you still remember what you said to Mrs. Liu ten years ago?

192
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Master Ling, three years have passed.

193
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
You should be sad.

194
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Do you really want to be lonely for life?

195
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I don't know about Zi Xian and I.

196
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Although he's a man of his own,

197
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
his style is still alive in my heart.

198
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Forever, forever.

199
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Love is always in the hands of the special.

200
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Dad, love is always in the hands of the special.

201
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Love is always in the hands of the special.

202
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Dad, please forgive me for being unfilial.

203
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
But I hope you can leave.

204
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I'm a grown-up.

205
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm going to marry him.

206
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm sorry.

207
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Come on.

208
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
We're not married yet.

209
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Come on.

210
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Dad, he's already injured.

211
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
What's the point of being a little bit of a pain?

212
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
You can't even hold a little wind and a little waves.

213
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
What's the big deal?

214
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I... I'm fine.

215
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
But...

216
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
No problem.

217
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Dad!

218
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Chou Dan!

219
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Don't disturb him.

220
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Dad!

221
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Thank you, Chief Lin.

222
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I saw you just now in the six-star合一.

223
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You were very determined to leave my sword.

224
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It seems you know the reason.

225
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I was in the drug field and had a full 12-star.

226
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
If you really get into the drug field,

227
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I promise you you're already dead.

228
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I'll let you live.

229
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I've known you since you were a child.

230
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
You're like a jellyfish.

231
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You've never eaten a bitter melon.

232
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I hope you can take good care of him.

233
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Dad.

234
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Stop talking.

235
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Don't forget.

236
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
We're not even a couple.

237
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
If you dare to ruin our Yue Ru,

238
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I'll lose to you.

239
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Dad.

240
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Let's go.

241
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'll go.

242
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Let's go.

243
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Chief Lin, don't worry.

244
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I'll come back and visit you.

245
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
All this time,

246
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I haven't treated my dad well.

247
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I didn't even pour tea for him.

248
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I only spoke to him.

249
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'll let him know what I mean.

250
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I think you two

251
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
are just a couple.

252
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
What do you mean?

253
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'm afraid of him.

254
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'll respect you in the future.

255
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
If you're good to me,

256
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm just afraid of my dad.

257
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I'll be free.

258
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
What if I'm not?

259
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
What do you mean?

260
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm thinking

261
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
when we find Ling Er,

262
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I'll take you to the mountains and rivers

263
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
to see the beautiful scenery and taste the beautiful scenery.

264
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I finally got revenge for my dad.

265
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Now, I can announce it in public.

266
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I don't love Li Xiaoyang.

267
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I don't love Li Xiaoyang.

268
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I don't love Li Xiaoyang.

269
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I don't love Li Xiaoyang.

270
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Yuezhu.

271
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I don't love you.

272
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I don't love you.

273
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I don't love you.

274
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Why are you so rude?

275
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Did I fall in love with you?

276
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You're not shy.

277
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Li Xiaoyang is not shy.

278
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You're the one who should be with me.

279
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I knew it.

280
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Don't blame me.

281
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You'll be punished if you follow me.

282
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You'll be punished if you follow me.

283
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
You'll be punished if you follow me.

284
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I'm afraid of you.

285
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I've told you the wind and rain will be strong.

286
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Then,

287
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
if you don't have the money to buy a umbrella,

288
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
let's go together.

289
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
You'll believe me.

290
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I love you.

291
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I miss you.

292
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I miss you.

293
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I can't compare with you.

294
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
That's good.

295
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
The date is settled.

296
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
We'll eat together.

297
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
We'll play together.

298
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Okay.

299
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
We'll play together.

300
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
We'll play together.

301
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I remember

302
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
the face.

303
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
A'nuo.

304
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Don't say it again.

305
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm getting hungry.

306
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
No.

307
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I must say it.

308
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
These are my goals.

309
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I want to think about what I like.

310
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I'll live on with my strength.

311
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Tell me what you like.

312
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I remember

313
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
the sugar in the jade.

314
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Water.

315
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Water.

316
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
A'nuo.

317
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Don't sleep.

318
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
You can't wake up if you sleep.

319
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Water.

320
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Help!

321
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Who's coming to save us?

322
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm coming.

323
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
A'nuo.

324
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I'm sorry.

325
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
A'nuo.

326
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
A'nuo.

327
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
You...

328
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Why are you here?

329
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I...

330
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I just helped the Prime Minister to pick some herbs.

331
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I'm leaving.

332
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Why is he sleeping so soundly?

333
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Go.

334
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
There's a demon.

335
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
How many times do I have to say it?

336
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Get out of here!

337
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
You're a bastard.

338
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
You can't live.

339
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Prime Minister.

340
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I'm going to kill you.

341
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I'm going to kill you.

342
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I'm going to kill you.

343
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I'm going to kill you.

344
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I'm going to kill you.

345
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Prime Minister.

346
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I just want you to get better.

347
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
You said it.

348
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
The demon is on me.

349
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I'll die.

350
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
You said it.

351
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
The poison of the Eastern Lady

352
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
is not medicine.

353
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
But why?

354
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Why do you still give me these useless medicines?

355
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
What?

356
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
They're useful.

357
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I've used these medicines to cure the poison.

358
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I'll find a way to make you live.

359
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
You've been taking a rest for 300 years

360
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
to get these medicines.

361
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
In the end,

362
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I'll still die.

363
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
You sacrificed yourself

364
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
because of me.

365
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Don't stay with me.

366
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Go away.

367
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
No!

368
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Prime Minister.

369
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
If it wasn't for you,

370
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I'd be dead in the hand of the poisoned pig.

371
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I wouldn't leave you.

372
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I wouldn't leave you even if I died.

373
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I just saved a fox.

374
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I accidentally bitten the pig.

375
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I didn't bite the pig.

376
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I didn't use the medicine.

377
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
You don't need to make the medicine.

378
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
You don't need to sacrifice yourself.

379
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Prime Minister.

380
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Listen to me.

381
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I've figured out a way.

382
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I'll go to the forest over there.

383
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I'll go to the far place.

384
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I can use my spirit to save you.

385
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I'll save you.

386
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Listen to me.

387
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
If you use your rest for the past 1000 years to save me,

388
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
even if you save me,

389
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I won't let myself live.

390
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Prime Minister.

391
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:53,580
Take care of your

392
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
mother, Sister Franky.

393
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
The medicine is all broken.

394
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
What?

395
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
The flower in the garden is also broken by the East.

396
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Then what should I do to save her?

397
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Sister Cai Yi, come with us.

398
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Come in.

399
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Master, cousin.

400
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Brother, you came just in time.

401
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I have something to tell you.

402
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Don't you think it's strange?

403
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I just threw the bullet.

404
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
I care about Cai Yi.

405
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I have my own village.

406
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Why don't we go and drink some wine?

407
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Let's go and save her.

408
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
You haven't seen yourself like this.

409
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
You need to rest.

410
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I've slept too much these days.

411
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I'm so sleepy.

412
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
You came.

413
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
You didn't have the chance to have a good drink with you.

414
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Maybe in the future,

415
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
you won't have this chance.

416
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
How could that be?

417
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
The man is the husband.

418
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Today is today. Tomorrow is tomorrow.

419
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
If you're interested in the land,

420
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I'm happy to accompany you.

421
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I came to Chang'an to visit you.

422
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I didn't expect that.

423
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
So soon, we'll drink together.

424
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I don't care.

425
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Please come to my house to visit me.

426
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I'm afraid that I'll be the only one to visit you.

427
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Why?

428
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Because I'll be with you

429
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
sooner or later.

430
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Your cousin?

431
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I have many choices.

432
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
There are so many beautiful women in Chang'an.

433
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Seeing you two like this,

434
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
as cousin and disciple,

435
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
I'm relieved.

436
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,000
If you don't want me,

437
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I'll be fine.

438
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
We'll save Ling'er.

439
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Right?

440
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Of course.

441
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
That's great.

442
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
We can be family.

443
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
We can be friends.

444
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
We can be friends.

445
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
We can be friends.

446
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
We can be friends.

447
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
You've worked hard.

448
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I'll be your disciple.

449
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Do you remember?

450
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
We went to the hospital.

451
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
We were saved.

452
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
We ate chicken and grapes.

453
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I'm afraid I'll be too shy to take a look.

454
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
The sun is setting.

455
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
The river is flowing.

456
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I'm looking back.

457
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
The past is also a dream.

458
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,000
I can't walk to the end.

459
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
I can't hold back.

460
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Even though Jungle Xiao's father has never been around,

461
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
abundantly work for freedom.

462
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
iking has washed the path.

463
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
The snow is inhabitant.

464
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
shortest past passed.

465
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
In order to open theабот of the world,

466
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I didn't think there was still the scenes music relationships.

467
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Oh, honey.

468
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,780
Go on.

469
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,480
Come on.

470
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,260
Honglei,

471
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,900
why did you keep preparations for that

472
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
If we keep going, we'll get in trouble.

473
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
What should we do?

474
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Leave here first.

475
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Can we really find the antidote?

476
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
We can.

477
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
It should be over there.

478
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
The gold coins are not for the grass.

479
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Here.

480
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Where is the dead man?

481
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Why is he so ugly?

482
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Why is he so familiar?

483
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Who dares to say I'm dead?

484
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Master!

485
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Master! Master, why are you here?

486
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Master!

487
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
You're master?

488
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Yes, he's my master.

489
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Where is master?

490
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Master! Master!

491
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Master!

492
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I'll introduce myself to you.

493
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Master!

494
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
You...

495
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

496
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
There's no master here.

497
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I'll call you master.

498
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
You come down first.

499
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
It's hard to talk to you like this.

500
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I won't come down.

501
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I won't come down either.

502
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Don't call me master.

503
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Okay, okay. I'm afraid of you.

504
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
You come down first.

505
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Hey, hey, hey.

506
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Actually, I only taught you.

507
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I've played it once.

508
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I taught you to read the fur.

509
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
It's not what you said.

510
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Nananana.

511
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I won't be responsible for you.

512
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Hurry up.

513
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Okay, okay, okay.

514
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
I'm afraid of you.

515
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Then come down.

516
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Then don't call me master.

517
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Okay.

518
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Okay.

519
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
How do you find it?

520
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I'm going to call you master.

521
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Master.

522
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Master.

523
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Master.

524
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Master.

525
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Master.

526
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Master.

527
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Master.

528
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Master.

529
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Master.

530
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Master.

531
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Stop.

532
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Forget it.

533
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
You can call me whatever you like.

534
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Call me master or disciple.

535
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Call me master or disciple.

536
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Call me master.

537
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Call me master.

538
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
That's good.

539
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Master.

540
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Come on.

541
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
You're a bad guy again.

542
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
You're so cheap.

543
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Hey, hey, hey.

544
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Master, master.

545
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I'll tell you this later.

546
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I'm going to save him.

547
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Who's so unlucky?

548
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
He's called Liu Jingyuan.

549
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
He's in the small village.

550
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
My cousin.

551
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
We're looking for antidote.

552
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
This one?

553
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
The antidote.

554
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
You're so good.

555
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Senior, help me.

556
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I'm not interested.

557
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
It's too simple.

558
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
The problem can be solved by children.

559
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I'm sleeping now.

560
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Hey.

561
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Master, listen to me.

562
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
He's my disciple.

563
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
He's your disciple.

564
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Hey.

565
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
He's been caught by the monster.

566
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Senior, help me.

567
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Where is he going?

568
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
What's he thinking?

569
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
How do I know?

570
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
He's...

571
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Why?

572
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Why is he here?

573
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Master, what are you doing?

574
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
None of your business.

575
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Then let's go.

576
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Don't run.

577
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Master.

578
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
A'Qing, are you okay?

579
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
A'Qing.

580
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Hey, wake up.

581
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
No wonder my cousin will treat you.

582
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
You have a conspiracy.

583
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Those antidotes are poison, right?

584
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
No.

585
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Listen to me.

586
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Don't explain.

587
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I'm going to avenge my cousin.

588
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Master.

589
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Listen to me.

590
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Listen to me.

591
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Don't talk nonsense.

592
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Master, you go first.

593
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I'll take care of you.

594
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
There are more antidotes.

595
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Come to the killing machine.

596
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I'm here.

597
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
You go save the person.

598
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Be careful.

599
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Master.

600
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Master, you'll get better.

601
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I'll cure you.

602
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
A'Qing.

603
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
No.

604
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Master, you have to believe me.

605
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
No matter what,

606
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I'll cure you.

607
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I'll cure you.

608
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
You're so mean.

609
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Tell me.

610
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Why did you kill my cousin?

611
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Master, you didn't kill him.

612
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
If you don't tell me,

613
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I'll kill you.

614
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,000
You can't even make a flower.

615
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
You misunderstood.

616
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Master was poisoned by a poison.

617
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
He's been poisoned to the six talismans.

618
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Master is trying to save him.

619
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I'll give you one last chance.

620
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
What's the purpose of poison my cousin?

621
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Anyway,

622
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
I'll die in your hands

623
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,000
in the end.

624
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
You think you're a fool.

625
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
You go ahead.

626
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
But I'll tell you.

627
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Only master can save him.

628
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
If you stop him,

629
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
master will die.

630
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Master.

631
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Why is he gone?

632
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
What's this place?

633
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Where are you going?

634
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Be careful.

635
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Be careful.

636
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Master, hold on.

637
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Master.

638
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Master.

639
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Master.

640
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Master.

641
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
It's a pig's heart.

642
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I still like you.

643
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
You call me the only wife.

644
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Master.

645
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Now you have master.

646
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
You forget me.

647
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
What a pity.

648
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I'll tell you.

649
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
The flowers in the garden

650
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
were all given to me by me.

651
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
You can't be a beggar.

652
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
You're a husband.

653
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
You're so fierce.

654
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
If you use your true power

655
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
to save your husband,

656
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I think he's not bad.

657
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
I think we can fight like this.

658
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I'm hurt.

659
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
But you're my husband.

660
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I'll save you.

661
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Master.

662
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Master.

663
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Master.

664
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Master.

665
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Master.

666
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
Master.

667
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Master.

668
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Master.

669
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Master.

670
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Master.

671
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Master.

672
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
I owe you.

673
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
I'm sorry, Master.

674
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Master,

675
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Master was very heartless

676
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,000
when you were pregnant with my son.

677
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Master Feng said

678
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
you could bring him back to his異 weirler.

679
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
But

680
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:31,760
heHi,

681
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I'm joking.

682
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
He is not a couple.

683
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
He's not a couple.

684
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
He want to be my husband.

685
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
But the fact is

686
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
you need his help.

687
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Really?

688
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
That's good.

689
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Because I only want to eat you.

690
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,000
That's why I have enough courage to save him.

691
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I could have saved him.

692
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
But did you hurt me?

693
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Did I have to use my own power to save him?

694
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I'm asking you. In this world, who will use their own power to save a mortal?

695
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
You didn't lie to me. You really can save him.

696
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
How long can you keep on supporting him?

697
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
You can still trust me, but who else?

698
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
What?

699
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Have you thought about it?

700
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Goodbye.

701
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
My dear.

702
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I'm sorry.

703
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Goodbye.

704
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I'm sorry.

705
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I'm destined to have no future for you.

706
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I'm a lost blank.

707
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Don't say anything.

708
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I don't want to understand.

709
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:40,000
At least I still have a beautiful dream.

710
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I really don't want to understand.

711
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:50,000
I finally understand that I should let go.

712
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I really don't want to understand.

713
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:00,000
At least I still have a beautiful dream.

714
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
I really don't want to understand.

715
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
At least I still have a beautiful dream.

716
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Don't say anything.

717
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
I really don't want to understand.

718
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I finally understand that I should let go.
