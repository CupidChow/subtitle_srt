00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
This is all true.

51
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
This is all true.

52
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Why are you so stupid?

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Why?

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You have to come here.

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Ling'er, I remember everything.

64
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Ling'er, wake up.

65
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000

Ling'er.

73
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000

76
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Ling'er.

77
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Ling'er.

78
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Don't worry.

79
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Ling'er.

80
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000

84
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,400
I'm afraid I'll be late.

85
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,400
I'm afraid I'll be late.

86
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,400
I'm afraid I'll be late.

87
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,400
I'm afraid I'll be late.

88
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,400
I'm afraid I'll be late.

89
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,400
I'm afraid I'll be late.

90
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,400
I'm afraid I'll be late.

91
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,400
I'm afraid I'll be late.

92
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,400
I'm afraid I'll be late.

93
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,400

I'm afraid I'll be late.

99
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,400
Brother Xiaoyang.

100
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,400
Brother Xiaoyang.

101
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:58,480
aran

102
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,780
Ling'er

103
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,800
He's right.

104
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,560
King Shiyo is my lifeguard.

105
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,720
I will ftnk you aheavy on thanks.

106
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,420
If neither have I killed the late leader,

107
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:45,160
two children will already have death wish upon me.

108
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,760
Come on, let me through!

109
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:51,920
Brother Xiao Yao?

110
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,960
Trouble of the world

111
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,160
Brother Xiaoyao

112
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,160
Ling'er

113
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,160
Ling'er, listen to me

114
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,160
We will be together forever

115
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,160
No matter what you become

116
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,160
Whether it's life or death

117
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:36,160
We will be together forever

118
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,160
We will never leave

119
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,160
Brother Xiaoyao

120
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,160
Why

121
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,160
Why did I think about everything

122
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,160
I was wrong again

123
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,160
I shouldn't have come back

124
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,160
I shouldn't have come back

125
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,160
I tell you

126
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,160
You can't leave me

127
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,160
You can't leave me

128
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,160
No

129
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,160
I don't care

130
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,160
I don't care anything

131
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,160
What about Sister Yue Ru

132
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,160
I don't care

133
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,160
I don't care

134
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,160
No

135
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,160
You can't just say you don't care

136
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,160
You can't just think of others

137
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,160
You can't just say you don't care

138
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,160
I'm happy only if I'm happy

139
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,160
I really don't care

140
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,160
Maybe

141
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,160
I've forgotten who I am

142
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,160
I've forgotten who I am

143
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,160
Sister Yue Ru

144
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,160
Don't be like this

145
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,160
Ling Xiaoyao

146
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,160
You are the most pitiful one

147
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,160
You are the most pitiful one

148
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,160
Chouden

149
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,160
You are all me

150
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,160
I don't care

151
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,160
Can you tell me

152
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,160
Why did you do this to us

153
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,160
Why

154
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,160
Why

155
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,160
Look at you

156
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,160
What are you crying for

157
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,160
I'm the one who did it

158
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,160
Don't think about anything

159
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,160
Go out first

160
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,160
Everything

161
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,160
We can talk about it when we go out

162
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,160
The house has been torn

163
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,160
Only the broken interior is not enough

164
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,160
We can leave

165
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,160
No matter what

166
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,160
We have everything

167
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,160
Go

168
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,160
Go

169
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,160
What are you doing

170
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,160
What are you doing

171
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,160
You go

172
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,160
No

173
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,160
No

174
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,160
No

175
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,160
Do you know it together

176
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,160
I'll tell you later

177
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,160
This house has been torn

178
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,160
No

179
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,160
Ruonuyue

180
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,160
How is it

181
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,160
Is it ready

182
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,160
What is this place

183
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,160
This is the house of Nanzhao

184
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,160
Why am I here

185
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,160
Anu brought you back with me

186
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,160
He said there is a way to save the orphan

187
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,160
Where are they

188
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,160
Ling'er is in the room next door

189
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,160
Where are you going

190
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,160
I'm going to see her

191
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,160
Don't go

192
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,160
Anu and Aunt will take care of her

193
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,160
You can't do much

194
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,160
Come and rest

195
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,160
Where is she

196
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,160
Did you find her

197
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,160
Did you find her

198
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,160
I found her

199
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,160
Is there a way to save her

200
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,160
What's wrong with her

201
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,160
What's wrong with her

202
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,160
Her ceiling

203
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,160
Is broken

204
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,160
What

205
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,160
No way

206
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,160
What do you mean

207
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,160
She's dead

208
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,160
No way

209
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,160
She's really dead

210
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,160
I'm telling you

211
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,160
She can't die

212
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,160
I'm telling you

213
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,160
She's dead

214
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,160
Ling Yueru

215
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,160
Is really dead

216
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,160
Ling Yueru

217
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,160
Ling Yueru

218
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,160
I killed her

219
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,160
I killed her

220
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,160
Someone warned me

221
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,160
They said they can't get her

222
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,160
Someone told me

223
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,160
Someone will die

224
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,160
Someone told me

225
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,160
I thought I was not afraid of anything

226
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,160
I killed Yueru

227
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,160
I killed Yueru

228
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,160
I killed Yueru

229
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,160
Xiaoyao

230
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,160
Don't blame yourself

231
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,160
I killed Yueru

232
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,160
I killed her

233
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,160
It's me

234
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,160
If

235
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,160
I didn't go to the county magistrate to find the immortal

236
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,160
She wouldn't be so miserable

237
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,160
Lao Lao wouldn't die

238
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,160
And the fairy sisters of the county magistrate

239
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,160
If I didn't go to find Yueru

240
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,160
She's still in the family of Suzhu

241
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,160
She's trying to get her husband back

242
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,160
I killed Yueru

243
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,160
I killed Yueru

244
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,160
I killed her

245
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,160
I killed her

246
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,160
Have you said enough

247
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,160
Have you said enough

248
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,160
I killed Yueru

249
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,160
I killed Yueru

250
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,160
I killed Yueru

251
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,920
I have not learned the feel of living these days generally.

252
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,760
But today it's almost gone.

253
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,940
You don't know it.

254
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,000
Not at all.

255
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,600
It's probably because you didn't know.

256
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,560
When you posted the video on your website,

257
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,220
itommated with saying,

258
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,080
even theploaders might have seen it gently.

259
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,760
Where did it go?

260
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,160
You won't go into that lock-and-match.

261
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,760
You'll be safe and sound.

262
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,760
I... I'm a brother.

263
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,360
I don't listen to what I hear.

264
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,360
I should listen to what I hear.

265
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,560
I didn't listen.

266
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,160
I should listen to what others say.

267
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,360
I didn't listen either.

268
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:11,760
I shouldn't have taught you two martial arts.

269
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,560
I...

270
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,960
I'm wrong.

271
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,960
I should die.

272
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,960
I should die.

273
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,560
It's not your fault.

274
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:37,360
You hate me, right?

275
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,160
Xiao Yao.

276
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,560
I'm sorry.

277
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,960
Where are you going?

278
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,960
I'm going to pick up Ling'er.

279
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,960
Stop!

280
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,560
I'm going to pick up Ling'er.

281
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,560
I'm going to pick up Ling'er.

282
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,560
I'm going to pick up Ling'er.

283
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,560
Stop!

284
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,960
You have to let her rest.

285
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,960
You can't help her.

286
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,960
I don't want anyone to leave me.

287
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,960
Xiao Yao!

288
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,960
Ling'er!

289
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,960
Xiao Yao!

290
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,960
Ling'er!

291
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,960
Ling'er!

292
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,960
Ling'er!

293
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,960
Xiao Yao, you can't do this.

294
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,960
Ling'er!

295
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,960
Ling'er!

296
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,960
Get out!

297
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,960
No!

298
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,560
Get out!

299
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,760
Get out!

300
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,560
Calm down first.

301
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,960
I must save Ling'er.

302
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,560
You're going to ruin her.

303
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,960
You have to let her rest.

304
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,960
Don't blame me.

305
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,960
You have to let everyone love you.

306
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,960
You have to go one by one.

307
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,960
Then you can rest.

308
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:19,160
Why so anxious?

309
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,260
What is this?

310
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,160
I can't help it.

311
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,760
That's enough.

312
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,160
Feel free to use this web.

313
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,560
Don't go too far at these times.

314
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,960
I'm going to Around.

315
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,160
I'm going to keep trying to protect Ling'er.

316
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,660
Ling'er, go.

317
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,360
Don't go too far, Luo Zhang.

318
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,360
I'm sorry.

319
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,360
Master.

320
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,360
How is Linghe?

321
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,360
I can only find five-legged pearl, phoenix egg shell and seven-legged stone.

322
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,360
I can save him.

323
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,360
Can I save the nine-legged pearl and the seven-legged pearl first?

324
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,360
I must attack all of them to make it work.

325
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,360
I'll go right away.

326
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,360
There are phoenix and seven-legged pearl in the female temple.

327
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,360
They are also in charge of phoenix and fire-legged pearl.

328
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,360
You can try the fish-water pearl.

329
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,360
Chou Xiaozi.

330
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,360
I'm sorry.

331
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,360
I'm sorry.

332
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,360
I'm sorry.

333
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,360
Chou Xiaozi.

334
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,360
Be careful.

335
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,360
Father.

336
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,360
What did you call him?

337
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,360
Father.

338
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,360
Senior Jinxin used to save Anu.

339
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,360
Anu said that if someone saves him, he will be his father.

340
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,360
That's all?

341
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,360
Anu.

342
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,360
I want to ask you.

343
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,360
Who is your mother?

344
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,360
You ask too much.

345
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,360
Didn't you say too little?

346
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,360
We meet again.

347
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,360
We haven't seen each other for ten years.

348
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,360
Don't you remember?

349
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,360
It's you.

350
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,360
I'm going to avenge the mayor.

351
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,360
Why?

352
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,360
You are still so impulsive.

353
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,360
Why?

354
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,360
Everyone is here to misunderstand me.

355
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,360
The mayor told me personally.

356
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,360
You killed him.

357
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,360
I killed my father.

358
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,360
I'm the closest person in the world.

359
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:24,360
Do I have a happier life than you?

360
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,360
Actually, I came here to thank you.

361
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,360
You gave me the biggest risk.

362
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,360
You never found a way.

363
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,360
What did you say?

364
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,360
You helped me.

365
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,360
You gave me a big chance.

366
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,360
Thank you.

367
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,360
You humiliated me.

368
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,360
I'm not going to die today.

369
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,360
I'm the king.

370
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,360
Can you really hurt me?

371
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,360
Sorry to keep you waiting.

372
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,360
Excuse me.

373
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:38,520
You are so mean. Don't be so mean.

374
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,000
I'm here for a favor.

375
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,080
Do you still remember your mother's grace and kindness?

376
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,920
You have already believed in the god of the moon.

377
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:51,440
I'm not a disciple of the moon.

378
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,200
I came here for the princess of Nanzhao.

379
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:59,280
If she didn't help the mother, she wouldn't have survived.

380
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:03,200
You mean Zhao Heng, the daughter of Qing'er?

381
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,240
Yes.

382
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,040
You are here for saving the country?

383
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,040
Yes.

384
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,640
I've been here for thousands of years.

385
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,640
I've waited for you for a long time.

386
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,160
Really? Can you help me?

387
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,960
Your son is seriously injured.

388
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,600
Uncle Sheng said he would have to fill the seven spiritual points,

389
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,480
Phoenix eggs and five spiritual beads.

390
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,720
That's too much.

391
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,320
The task of the princess of Nanzhao is complete.

392
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,440
I'll give it to you in the future.

393
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,720
Thank you.

394
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,120
Your Highness.

395
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,120
Your Highness.

396
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,160
I'm seriously injured.

397
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,160
I came here to ask for help.

398
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,160
Li Xiaoyao.

399
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,160
Your Highness.

400
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,160
You are finally here.

401
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,160
You knew I would come.

402
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,160
Please help me.

403
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,240
You are the only one who can save her.

404
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,760
Please tell me.

405
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:40,160
The power of the Moon has reached the unimaginable.

406
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,160
She has been cursed by her.

407
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,440
I can't do anything.

408
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,520
How could that be?

409
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,760
Do you want to know?

410
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,440
I just want to find the way to save Ling'er.

411
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,440
Or when you know everything is coming and going,

412
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,040
you will know what to do.

413
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,680
As long as I can save Ling'er, I can try anything.

414
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:04,000
This is a tragic past of our Nanyu family.

415
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,640
Can you do anything for Ling'er?

416
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,760
I will.

417
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,600
Okay.

418
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,760
You can get up first.

419
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:18,280
I'll let you know everything on that day.

420
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,880
But remember.

421
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:23,280
You can't let them see you.

422
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,280
You can't change anything.

423
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:34,880
Everything has been changed ten years ago.

424
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,680
We haven't seen each other for ten years.

425
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,680
We won't forget it.

426
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,680
No wonder he said we left.

427
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,680
Your Majesty.

428
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,680
You can start.

429
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,680
You can start.

430
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,680
You can start.

431
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,680
You can start.

432
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,680
You can start.

433
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,680
You can start.

434
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,680
You can start.

435
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,680
You can start.

436
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,680
You can start.

437
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,280
You can start.

438
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,680
Please.

439
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,680
Please.

440
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:45,680
The Empress of Beiplayful will be an ally to this family.

441
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,680
She won't leave.

442
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,680
Are you sure?

443
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,680
Go to the name.

444
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,680
By the name.

445
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,680
Your Majesty!

446
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,680
Your Majesty!

447
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,680
Your Majesty!

448
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,680
Your Majesty!

449
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,680
Your Majesty!

450
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,680
Your Majesty!

451
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,680
Your Majesty!

452
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,680
I'm sorry.

453
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,680
Your Majesty, I never blamed you.

454
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,680
For Your Majesty,

455
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,680
I can't do anything.

456
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,680
Your Majesty!

457
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,680
She is the mother of the Dianfu State.

458
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,680
She is the mother of the Dianfu State.

459
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,680
Go!

460
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,680
Go!

461
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,680
Go!

462
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,680
Go!

463
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,680
Go!

464
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,680
Go!

465
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,680
Master.

466
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:50,680
Why do you think that the Empress is the demon?

467
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,680
Your Majesty.

468
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,680
You are confused by the demon.

469
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,680
You want to investigate it?

470
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,680
Kill him!

471
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,680
Kill him!

472
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,680
Kill him!

473
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,680
Kill him!

474
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,680
Kill him!

475
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,680
Kill him!

476
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,680
Kill him!

477
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,680
Your Majesty.

478
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,680
You can't turn back.

479
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,680
You can make a decision.

480
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,680
No.

481
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,680
I can't make this decision.

482
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,680
Our people are confused by the demon.

483
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,680
You and I can't do anything.

484
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,680
Kill the Empress.

485
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,680
Kill the Empress.

486
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,680
Kill the Empress.

487
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,680
Kill the Empress.

488
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,680
Kill the Empress.

489
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,680
Kill the Empress.

490
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,680
Kill the Empress.

491
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,680
Kill the Empress.

492
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,680
Kill the Empress.

493
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,680
Who dares to hurt Qing'er?

494
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,680
Master.

495
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,680
Chief Mo.

496
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,680
What do you want?

497
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,680
You are a fool.

498
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,680
You even brought your wife to the court.

499
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,680
I did it because I was not happy.

500
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,680
What? You are dying?

501
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,680
Although my son hates me,

502
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,680
I won't run away.

503
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,680
Even if I sacrifice my life to get back their family,

504
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,680
I don't want them to be confused by the demon.

505
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,680
Look at them.

506
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:36,680
You think you can make them feel guilty?

507
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,680
Even the Emperor is hesitating.

508
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,680
I believe that His Majesty won't abandon me.

509
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,680
Even if I die today,

510
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,680
he will accept our common ideals

511
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,680
and take care of the country.

512
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,680
This demon is a commoner.

513
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,680
Kill him.

514
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,680
Kill him.

515
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,680
Mingzhuai.

516
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,680
You are all crazy.

517
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,680
You are not afraid of the red and white.

518
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,680
Listen to me.

519
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:12,680
He is the representative of the country.

520
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,680
The descendant of the female frog.

521
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,680
How can you kill him?

522
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,680
He is the descendant of the female frog.

523
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,680
The demon who poisoned the spirit.

524
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,680
You are the one who poisoned the spirit.

525
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,680
No.

526
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,680
Kill him.

527
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,680
Kill him.

528
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,680
Kill him.

529
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,680
Kill him.

530
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,680
Kill him.

531
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,680
Kill him.

532
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,680
You can't kill him.

533
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,680
Stop.

534
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,680
Kill him.

535
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,680
Little brother.

536
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,680
Who are you?

537
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,680
I am here to stop your conspiracy.

538
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,680
That is the female companion of the demon.

539
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,680
Kill him.

540
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,680
Kill him.

541
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,680
Stop.

542
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,680
You are so ridiculous.

543
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,680
All of you, step back.

544
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,680
Step back.

545
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,680
Step back.

546
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,680
Uncle.

547
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,680
Are you annoyed?

548
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,680
I dare not.

549
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,680
I will give you the final face.

550
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,680
Go.

551
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,680
You can't do this.

552
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,680
Who are you?

553
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,680
Do not worry.

554
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,680
If you kill the empress, the consequence will be terrible.

555
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,680
Why should I believe you?

556
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,680
Go.

557
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,680
I won't go, Your Majesty.

558
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,680
If they are in trouble, please punish them.

559
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,680
Are you crazy?

560
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,680
You go.

561
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,680
Fine.

562
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,680
If I should see you suffer,

563
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,680
Your Majesty, it's time to make a decision.

564
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:16,680
Kill him! Kill him!

565
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:21,680
Kill him! Kill him!

566
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:26,680
Kill him! Kill him!

567
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:31,680
Kill him! Kill him!

568
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,680
Kill him! Kill him!

569
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,680
Kill him! Kill him!

570
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,680
Kill him! Kill him!

571
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,680
Shut up!

572
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:57,680
I will keep the Empress in prison for three days.

573
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,680
No!

574
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,680
Take him down!

575
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,680
Stop!

576
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:04,680
Little brother, you won't understand me.

577
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,680
Go.

578
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,680
Empress, you won't understand me either.

579
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,680
If this really happens,

580
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,680
pain will last forever.

581
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,680
I won't go either.

582
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,680
For your daughter,

583
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,680
I won't let you accept this fate.

584
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,680
Take them away.

585
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,680
Move! Move!

586
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,680
Move! Move!

587
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,680
Who is this girl?

588
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,680
Where did she come from?

589
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,680
Don't be like this. We can't leave.

590
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,680
I understand.

591
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,680
You can't use my martial arts to use your power.

592
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,680
How can you use us?

593
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,680
You don't understand.

594
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,680
You can be a brave man.

595
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,680
We can't escape.

596
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:08,680
Yes, I don't understand.

597
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,680
Don't tell me those tricks.

598
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,680
I'm happy to be the brave man in your mouth.

599
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,680
I know it.

600
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:18,680
You're the one who took away my love.

601
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,680
I don't feel like I'm taking away your love.

602
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,680
You're never my lover.

603
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,680
Enough!

604
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,680
Qing'er, what do you want?

605
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,680
Let's go.

606
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,680
Did you know that you were waiting for death?

607
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,680
You can change everything.

608
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,680
Why you don't do that?

609
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,680
Yes, I can change everything.

610
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,680
I'll pay for it.

611
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,680
I'd like to share the burden of the emperor.

612
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,680
Emperor, why don't you say

613
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,640
I'll remove the secrets I can't reveals even in my heart!

614
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,280
Get up.

615
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,680
Maybe you are right.

616
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,680
I have also suspected you.

617
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,680
But as a monarch,

618
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:39,680
I can't let this matter be a big deal.

619
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:43,680
Do you know?

620
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,680
I can't let the emperor's crime be a crime.

621
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,680
The emperor is right.

622
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,680
But if he is you,

623
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,680
he is a monster.

624
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:01,680
Impossible.

625
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,680
If you don't believe me,

626
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,680
I will prove it to the emperor.

627
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:09,680
I don't understand

628
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,680
why you can be so calm now.

629
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,680
I understand.

630
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,680
I can be a little bit more mature.

631
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,680
I can be a little bit more mature.

632
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,680
I can be a little bit more mature.

633
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,680
My progress is not because of the good things.

634
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,680
It's because everything can't disturb my heart.

635
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,680
So I can give up my life and death.

636
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,680
I can be calm.

637
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:39,680
I just want you to remember

638
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,680
I won't give up on the love of the world.

639
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,680
What should you do?

640
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,680
Who are you?

641
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:51,680
Why do you stop all this?

642
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,680
I came here for your daughter.

643
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,680
Now everything will be ruined.

644
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,680
Your daughter will walk the same path as you.

645
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:09,680
Who are you?

646
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,680
I have a good relationship with you.

647
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,680
We will meet again.

648
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,680
Crazy.

649
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:20,680
You two are crazy.

650
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,680
The world is crazy.

651
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,680
I won't listen to you anymore.

652
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,680
I just want to ask you

653
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:33,680
do you want your daughter

654
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:35,680
to bear the same fate as you?

655
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,680
If my daughter can carry everything

656
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,680
just like me,

657
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:44,680
I think it's a blessing.

658
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:46,680
This is a disaster.

659
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:49,680
I hope you can go with me

660
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:51,680
to change this.

661
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:57,680
The real trouble system is also out.

662
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,680
I am excited.

663
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:19,680
Hold on.

664
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:21,680
Cute.

665
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:23,680
Do I look pretty?

666
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,680
to protect your reputation!

667
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:27,680
The future you have

668
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:34,680
is a dream that has disappeared

669
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:38,680
Don't say anything

670
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:41,680
I don't want to understand

671
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:48,680
At least I still have a beautiful dream

672
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:52,680
Don't say anything

673
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:55,680
I really don't want to understand

674
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:00,680
I finally understand that I should let go

675
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:03,680
Don't say anything

676
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:08,680
I don't want to understand

677
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:15,680
At least I still have a beautiful dream

678
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:19,680
Don't say anything

679
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:23,680
I really don't want to understand

680
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:28,680
I finally understand that I should let go
