I love you.

98
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,200
I want to meet you.

99
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,200
In my heart,

100
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,200
I can't compare with you.

101
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,200
We have been through the heavy world together.

102
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,200
We have seen the rich and beautiful world.

103
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,200
We have been together for a long time.

104
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,200
The world has changed because of us.

105
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,200
We have become more and more united.

106
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,200
I give it to you.

107
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,200
Let's go.

108
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,200
We have been through the ups and downs.

109
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,200
He didn't let go of my hand.

110
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,200
We have been holding each other.

111
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,200
We have walked every new and exciting path.

112
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,200
I started to believe that

113
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,200
we will be together.

114
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,200
The world is full of sea and sea.

115
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,200
It's not the same as before.

116
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,200
The world is full of sea and sea.

117
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,200
It's already in our hearts.

118
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,200
I'm leaving.

119
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,200
Why?

120
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,200
Go back to your place.

121
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,200
You can't go back.

122
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,200
Here.

123
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,200
It's your home.

124
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,200
Sorry.

125
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,200
No.

126
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,200
It's not me.

127
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,200
I belong to you.

128
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,200
Marry me.

129
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,200
But I've already engaged to someone else.

130
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,200
What will happen then?

131
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,200
Do you know that?

132
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,200
I want to be someone else's wife.

133
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,200
He is the national emperor of the Nanzhao State.

134
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,200
I don't care.

135
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,200
I know I love you.

136
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,200
You love me.

137
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,200
No.

138
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,200
I can't love you.

139
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,200
I don't care.

140
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,200
I can't love anyone else.

141
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,200
This is not what I promised.

142
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,200
You promised to give them happiness.

143
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,200
But what about you?

144
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,200
You don't want to give yourself happiness?

145
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,200
What's the promise?

146
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,200
Because he...

147
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,200
You want to betray your destiny.

148
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,200
You want to betray the person you love.

149
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,200
You want to betray your heart.

150
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,200
But this is a trap.

151
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,200
I don't care.

152
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,200
I don't want you to leave me.

153
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,200
I want to be someone else's wife.

154
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,200
I want to be someone else's wife.

155
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,200
I want to be someone else's love.

156
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,200
You are so beautiful.

157
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,200
We can finally be together.

158
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,060
I can just flash through air.

159
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,900
Fly in the dark with the power of all theadtion

160
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,080
Party

161
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,260
who are you

162
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,800
Old people's home.

163
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,600
What is this place?

164
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,200
I want to see my heart.

165
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,000
Everything will be fine tomorrow.

166
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,200
It's impossible.

167
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,400
It's my life's pursuit of true love.

168
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,500
If you want to pursue, you have to get it.

169
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,200
That's true love.

170
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,800
If you don't understand,

171
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,300
you will naturally think you haven't entered the Tao.

172
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,300
Tomorrow is your real time.

173
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,600
You will understand everything.

174
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,100
Old people's home.

175
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,000
Old people's home.

176
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,900
Old people's home.

177
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,100
Who is this old man's home?

178
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,400
What is going on tomorrow?

179
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,700
How is this the Tao of my life?

180
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,700
What's wrong with you?

181
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,900
I don't know. I don't know.

182
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,100
Ruozhuang. Ruozhuang.

183
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,900
I want to go back.

184
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,500
или

185
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,500
Jing'er.

186
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,400
I don't want anyone to leave me behind.

187
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,700
Will you take me to see her?

188
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,200
Did you hear me? She can't hide from me.

189
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,900
If I can't see her, I won't leave.

190
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,700
Sorry.

191
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,100
I won't leave you anymore.

192
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,100
I love you.

193
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:33,900
Let her go. I don't care, I don't care.

194
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,900
I'm not leaving.

195
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,020
We'll be together forever.

196
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,500
I won't let you suffer again.

197
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,460
Where are you going?

198
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:42,780
Where are you going?

199
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,660
I'm going to find Brother Ruozhuo.

200
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,340
I'm going to...

201
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,220
You're muddleheaded.

202
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,580
You're not a Ruozhuo.

203
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,580
Sorry.

204
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,140
I'm Mo Yixi.

205
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,860
How could this happen?

206
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,580
How could I know?

207
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,940
You asked me, I didn't know.

208
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,540
Take me to see him, okay?

209
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,340
I'm sorry.

210
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,780
I'm Mo Yixi.

211
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,780
I'm sorry.

212
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,780
I'm Mo Yixi.

213
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,300
Why?

214
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,060
How could I know?

215
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,260
You asked me, I didn't know.

216
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,420
Take me to see him, okay?

217
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,380
I'll go by myself.

218
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,380
I'll take you there.

219
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,020
Why?

220
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,500
Is love a blessing?

221
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,620
Brother Ruozhuo.

222
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:45,460
Qu Zequan, Wang Zechi, Ma Zeying, Bi Zexin, Shao Ze De, Du Ze Huo.

223
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,460
Qu Ze...

224
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,020
Why?

225
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,300
Why did you come here?

226
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,260
I came here just to ask for a reason.

227
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,260
Get lost!

228
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,260
I can forgive you for everything.

229
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,020
I can forgive you for calling me a fool.

230
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,380
I can forgive you for being a fool and not saying goodbye.

231
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,420
I can forgive you for giving up on me and running back to Mount Shu.

232
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,820
But I can't forgive you for being a fool.

233
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,780
I just didn't give me a good reason at this moment.

234
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:20,020
Tell me, why?

235
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,740
I...

236
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,420
I just want to ask for a reason.

237
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,380
I want to be with you.

238
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,900
Because only then can I have the love of the world.

239
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,460
I can have the love of the seven emotions.

240
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,060
I want to have it on purpose.

241
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,940
Because only then can I let go.

242
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,460
If your feelings are not true,

243
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,500
then you never had it.

244
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,740
You have no ability.

245
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,500
You have no right to let go.

246
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,100
Do you love me?

247
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,140
Do you love me?

248
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,380
I know you love me.

249
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,380
I can feel it.

250
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,220
Come with me.

251
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,980
We will be together forever.

252
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,020
Stop talking.

253
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,140
Stop talking.

254
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,940
Come back to me.

255
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,980
Brother Ruo Zhe.

256
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,860
Don't tempt me again.

257
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,220
What is it?

258
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,460
Why did you get it?

259
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,260
Brother Yi Xi, I beg you.

260
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,260
Please help him.

261
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,180
He is choosing the coffin.

262
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,100
Put it down.

263
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,540
He will be here.

264
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,380
Anyway, he will come to me.

265
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,380
No.

266
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,380
How can we help him?

267
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,660
We can save him.

268
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,220
But he is the only one.

269
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,420
Why do I have to have it?

270
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,580
If I don't have the power to have it,

271
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,860
then I don't have to let go.

272
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,820
If I don't let go,

273
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,820
then I don't have the will to let go.

274
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:01,180
I have the power, the wealth, the power, the fame, the love.

275
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,380
I have all of these.

276
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,620
How wonderful it feels.

277
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,380
No.

278
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,620
I can't.

279
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,220
I don't want to go back.

280
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,100
I can't let go.

281
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:13,860
I can't go back.

282
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,860
I can't go back.

283
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,460
I don't want to let go of all these.

284
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,980
I don't want to go back to the old me.

285
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,380
I don't want to be greedy.

286
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,420
I don't want to be greedy.

287
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,940
Brother Zun Zun, don't.

288
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,940
We are the people of the world.

289
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,260
We are in the human world.

290
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,940
We have the seven emotions and six desires.

291
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,500
What is wrong?

292
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,100
Why do you have to get it?

293
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,340
Pours?

294
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,140
Who are you?

295
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,980
Who are you?

296
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,980
Who are you?

297
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,600
Robotjen

298
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,360
Robotjen

299
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,460
They are...

300
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,860
They are!

301
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:17,020
슬Eu

302
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,980
I've got it

303
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,080
That's the real essence of getting water up

304
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,220
Brother Ruozhou, you...

305
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,220
Jing'er, I love you.

306
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,220
Come on.

307
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,220
Can I?

308
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:16,220
Jing'er, close your eyes and feel everything around you.

309
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,220
Brother Ruozhou, I love you.

310
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:18,220
I feel that every kind of things in the Four Seasons are their breathing and their lives.

311
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,220
This is your grace.

312
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:26,220
Because you are the mother of the land, and you are the descendant of the female frog.

313
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,220
You already know that, right?

314
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,220
Brother Ruozhou, you are so kind.

315
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,220
I'm not afraid of you.

316
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,220
I'm the descendant of the female frog.

317
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,220
You already know that?

318
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:46,220
I already knew that when I first met you.

319
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,220
Am I very kind?

320
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,220
No.

321
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:53,220
You just don't have a real right to look at you.

322
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,220
My right?

323
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,220
You and I know that it's not a common right.

324
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:03,220
So your love for me is also a common love.

325
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:06,220
It's a great love, but not a small one.

326
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,220
Just like what you feel,

327
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:14,220
the plants and animals in the human world have their lives.

328
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,220
They all need love.

329
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:20,220
So your love for me is not to stay on the love of my children,

330
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:24,220
but to all the attention and love of all life.

331
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:29,220
Protecting them, giving them a good life, is your right.

332
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:34,220
It's hard to leave when the female frog knows it's bitter.

333
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,220
But as long as you see the things that are there,

334
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:42,220
the bitter and heavy life is worth it.

335
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,220
I understand.

336
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:50,220
Brother Ruozhou, I love you.

337
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,220
Just like all the things in my world.

338
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,220
Although I saw you,

339
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,220
I don't understand anything.

340
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,220
I don't want to understand.

341
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:07,220
I'm too much in love with people.

342
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,220
How can I do that?

343
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,220
They all found their way out.

344
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,220
I'm getting deeper and deeper.

345
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,220
I can't tell if I'm a weakling or a demon.

346
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,220
I'm still a woman.

347
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,220
I can't let go of my feelings for Qing'er.

348
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,220
But I always don't want to.

349
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,220
I still have to send Qing'er back to Nanzhao.

350
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,220
After we were separated,

351
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,220
Qing'er would never be pregnant as I already said.

352
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,220
Looks like they don't even need her anymore.

353
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,220
I had high fears...

354
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,220
since the time you went out with Qing'er.

355
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:00,220
They gave me hope and lead me back.

356
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,220
As long as we find the other half's owner,

357
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:08,220
they will be blessed and will cry for their lives.

358
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,220
Just like us.

359
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:15,220
Brother Yi Xi, I think you misunderstood.

360
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,220
No.

361
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:21,220
And this curse will indeed be with us.

362
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:24,220
Maybe I was burned at one moment.

363
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:29,220
But after this failure, I have already become another person.

364
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,220
Now, I am no longer pursuing these things.

365
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,220
There is more important thing waiting for me to do.

366
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:44,220
Qing Yuan, that mission is too heavy.

367
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,220
Let them leave together.

368
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:54,220
Let's go far away to find our place.

369
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,220
That is my mission.

370
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,220
My path.

371
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:03,220
I will do my best.

372
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,220
I will give this to you.

373
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:20,220
I wish you find someone you love.

374
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:26,220
At this moment, I am also a person of life.

375
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:29,220
I just want to continue this feeling.

376
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,220
I don't want to be able to do it.

377
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,220
I don't want to be able to do it.

378
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,220
Let's go with me.

379
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,220
I don't care if it's a hallucination or anything else.

380
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,220
I just don't want you to go back.

381
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,220
Why are you so stubborn?

382
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,220
I am not happy.

383
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,220
Don't you understand now?

384
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,220
You haven't woken up yet?

385
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:12,220
You are the one who doesn't understand.

386
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,220
You said it in a deep voice.

387
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,220
You know the real meaning of life.

388
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:22,220
You know the meaning of life.

389
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,220
Why are you back?

390
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,220
Why do you have to repeat the emperor's pregnancy?

391
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,220
Didn't you say that you have been in love with people?

392
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,220
You are lying.

393
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,220
That is my path.

394
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,220
You won't understand what I am saying now.

395
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,220
I just hope that you don't think about it.

396
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,220
You should know clearly that there is nothing between us.

397
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,220
We have never loved each other.

398
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:53,220
Remember, you are Mo Yixi.

399
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,220
You are Mo Yixi.

400
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,220
Yes, I know.

401
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,220
You don't have to say it again.

402
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,220
Okay.

403
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:11,220
I will tell you the identity of an outsider.

404
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,220
If...

405
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:25,220
If the emperor knows you are not loyal to him,

406
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,220
what will you do?

407
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,220
What will you do?

408
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,220
You will be dead.

409
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:39,220
If that is the case, I will face it.

410
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,220
I am destined to be able to go.

411
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,220
Go.

412
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,220
What?

413
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:04,220
The bad guys from Shoushan said that I have nothing to say.

414
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,220
But you are a young man.

415
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,220
What are you saying?

416
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,220
What are you saying?

417
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,220
What are you saying?

418
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,220
Don't you understand?

419
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,220
I am not going to face the emperor.

420
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,220
I am not going to be single and accept his love.

421
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:32,220
I just hope that you don't think about me with the idea of an outsider.

422
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:41,220
Yes, I am an outsider.

423
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,220
I really don't understand.

424
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,220
But...

425
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,220
In my world,

426
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:04,220
people should have love and hatred.

427
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:11,220
Qing, come with me.

428
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,220
He left.

429
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,220
What is the knife?

430
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,220
You are the knife.

431
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,220
Your Majesty, can you tell me a story?

432
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,220
Okay, tell me.

433
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:06,220
I took the knife from your hand to replace the knife.

434
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:09,220
We heard aorts stories about the young man.

435
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:12,220
I am not going to kill you.

436
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:19,220
I will think about it.

437
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,220
I will never stop.

438
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:28,220
You...

439
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:31,220
It must be a very beautiful story.

440
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:36,220
I've never felt that way before.

441
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,220
I know that...

442
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:46,220
I've always felt the best feeling in this world.

443
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:53,220
It's a pity that I can't bring this feeling to you.

444
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,220
I'm sorry.

445
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,220
Why should I say sorry?

446
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:05,220
I've given up on you in this world.

447
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,220
It's okay.

448
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,220
You'll come back eventually. You didn't give up.

449
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:14,220
I believe that you didn't abandon me at the last moment.

450
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,220
Don't you mind?

451
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,220
I mind.

452
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:25,220
I can't let you be happy in the future.

453
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:28,220
Do you know that I've been waiting for you?

454
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:32,220
Even if you refuse me now, I'll still wait for you.

455
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:38,220
The Queen of Nanzhao State only has you.

456
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:44,220
I used to think of you as a little person.

457
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:48,220
I won't forgive myself for being selfish.

458
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:53,220
I forgive you for coming back to me?

459
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:00,220
Actually, I've decided to shoulder my own fate.

460
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:03,220
I won't forget the day I promised you.

461
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:07,220
I'll do anything for the country and the country.

462
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:13,220
Even if you're not with me now, I'll still walk on.

463
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,220
You left me for a while.

464
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:24,220
I realized that if there's a common ideal and a common goal,

465
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:27,220
you can leave together.

466
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:30,220
It's a happy thing.

467
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:35,220
Qing, you're the one I'm destined to be.

468
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:42,220
But if I don't have the right, I won't force you.

469
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,220
How can you do that?

470
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,220
This is my best decision in my life.

471
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:52,220
Be my wife and the Queen.

472
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:55,220
Be my wife and the Queen.

473
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:59,220
Stay with me and bring happiness to the world.

474
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,220
Okay?

475
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,220
I object!

476
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,220
Get out!

477
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,220
How dare you!

478
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,220
You're confused, Brother Xi.

479
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,220
I object!

480
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,220
Stop!

481
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,220
You're my guest.

482
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,220
You're impolite.

483
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,220
Master Shi.

484
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,220
You may leave.

485
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:42,220
Chief, Qing and I will have a long life.

486
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,220
We'll have a long life.

487
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:50,220
We'll have to practice together.

488
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:56,220
I won't pursue this matter today.

489
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:59,220
I'll be the chief of the sect.

490
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:05,220
I'll take care of the wedding.

491
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:16,220
I'll leave you forever.

492
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:21,220
I'll be the Queen of the south.

493
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,220
I'll be the Queen of the south.

494
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,220
I'll be the Queen of the south.

495
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,220
Don't ask why.

496
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,220
Love is the blessing.

497
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:37,220
You'll become a despicable person.

498
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:41,220
You'll lose your life.

499
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:48,220
You'll lose your life.

500
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,220
Love.

501
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:46,220
I'm the first time I drink with you.

502
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:50,220
It feels so good.

503
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,220
It feels so good.

504
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,220
It's my first time.

505
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,220
I give it all to you.

506
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:04,220
We met in our dreams.

507
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:09,220
It's over in my dreams.

508
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,220
It's perfect.

509
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:21,220
I love you.

510
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,220
I like you.

511
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,220
Chief.

512
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,220
Chief.

513
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,220
Chief, what's the matter?

514
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,220
Why do you call me Chief?

515
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:58,220
Don't you call me Brother Yi Xi?

516
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,220
I like you.

517
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,220
Chief.

518
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,220
Liya.

519
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,220
Liya.

520
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:12,220
Chief, please respect me.

521
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,220
I'm fine.

522
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,220
I'm leaving.

523
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,220
Chief.

524
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:38,220
It's the Empress who asked me to come to see you.

525
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,220
Don't be late.

526
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:46,220
She asked me to remind you again.

527
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:50,220
You're not Ying Ruo Zhuo, not the Chief of Sword City.

528
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,220
You're Mo Yi Xi, the Chief of the City.

529
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,220
Liya.

530
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:59,220
It's okay.

531
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:01,220
I'm not worried.

532
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:07,220
How would the Saintess of the Sacred Realm know the love of the people?

533
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,220
Forget it.

534
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,220
You're right.

535
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:15,220
I've never tried it.

536
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,220
But I know what's going on.

537
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,220
You...

538
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,220
You know?

539
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,220
They're so hungry.

540
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,220
Eat something and wake up.

541
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,220
Everyoneون,

542
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:46,220
I'm here with you.

543
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:49,220
I enjoy coming on time.

544
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,220
com on time.

545
00:32:55,220 --> 00:33:00,100
Yan knitting

546
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,880
Pe bullets

547
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:11,400
You're still dare to say that you know what happened

548
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:24,980
You are against the characteristics of female

549
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,980
I'm not Mo Yixing!

550
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:39,980
I'm Du Gujianxian!

551
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,980
I'm Du Gujianxian!

552
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,980
I'm Du Gujianxian!

553
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:56,980
I'm Ying Ruozhuo.

554
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,980
I'm Ying Ruozhuo!

555
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:11,980
I'm not Mo Yixing.

556
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,980
I'm the one you love!

557
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,980
I'm Wu!

558
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,980
Sir!

559
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,980
Sir!

560
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,980
Wait!

561
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,980
I'm not Mo Yixing.

562
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,980
I'm not...

563
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,980
What is this place?

564
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:24,980
Sir!

565
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,980
Don't call me that!

566
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,980
Don't call me that.

567
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,980
I'm not Ying Ruozhuo.

568
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:35,980
I'm not Ying Ruozhuo.

569
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,980
Fine.

570
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,980
Don't do this.

571
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,980
Don't leave me.

572
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,980
Stay with me.

573
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,980
Don't do this.

574
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,980
Don't reject me.

575
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,980
Don't reject me.

576
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,980
Don't leave me.

577
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,980
I'm not Ying Ruozhuo.

578
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,980
I love you.

579
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,980
I love you.

580
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,980
Don't leave me.

581
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,980
Fine?

582
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,980
Qing'er.

583
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,980
Yixi.

584
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,980
Don't make trouble.

585
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:02,980
Look carefully. I'm Yuanqing.

586
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,980
I'm the real her.

587
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,980
I'm the real her.

588
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,980
This is the real feeling.

589
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,980
I'm the real her.

590
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,980
I'm the real her.

591
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,980
I'm the real her.

592
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,980
I'm the real her.

593
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,980
I'm the real her.

594
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,980
I'm the real her.

595
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,980
I'm the real her.

596
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,980
I'm the real her.

597
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,980
I'm the real her.

598
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,980
I'm the real her.

599
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,980
I'm the real her.

600
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,980
I'm the real her.

601
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,980
I'm the real her.

602
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,980
I'm the real her.

603
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,980
I'm the real her.

604
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,980
I'm the real her.

605
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,980
I'm the real her.

606
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:31,980
No problem.

607
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,980
If yixi said no to my wind.

608
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,980
So I can see how feelings is.

609
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:42,980
But only what they can fill up the head again.

610
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,980
I certainly can think it's alright.

611
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,980
No business to look into.

612
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,980
I have plans and we can do whatever you want.

613
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,980
I...I...

614
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,980
How could I do this?

615
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,980
How could I do this?

616
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,980
I...I...

617
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,980
I...

618
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,980
I...

619
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,980
I...

620
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,980
I...

621
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,980
I'm so bad at this.

622
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,980
I...

623
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,980
I...

624
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:54,980
I was trapped for 18 years by these unbearable reasons.

625
00:40:55,980 --> 00:41:00,980
In addition to escaping, I couldn't find the way out.

626
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:05,980
I didn't expect that this secret that I buried in my heart

627
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:08,980
would still be in the past.

628
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:17,980
You wretch! You still keep talking!

629
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,980
That night,

630
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,980
she took my bones and gave birth to them.

631
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,980
Get out of here!

632
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:30,980
Anu is now so old.

633
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:32,980
She should know the truth.

634
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,980
Get out!

635
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:37,980
Say it again. I won't kill you!

636
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:43,980
I know that I owe you too much.

637
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,980
So you hit me with a few punches.

638
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:49,980
But I won't let her say it out loud.

639
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,980
I won't let her do it.

640
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:55,980
Enough! Stop arguing!

641
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:58,980
I beg you.

642
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,980
If you continue like this,

643
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,980
I'll make an excuse.

644
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,980
Please tell me the truth.

645
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,980
Do it.

646
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,980
Yes,

647
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,980
I'm your mother.

648
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:43,980
I was naive and though she'd come back,

649
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:47,980
I knew that he would accept a true person.

650
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:53,980
But then I realized that I had to accept the true person.

651
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:58,980
You grew up in the mansion.

652
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:02,980
This secret has reached the point where it cannot be solved.

653
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:06,980
If I continue to do it, it will only become a ugly thing.

654
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:09,980
I once thought that I don't want it.

655
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:13,980
But I can't do it.

656
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:21,980
Shi Sanwei has overcome all the pain for me.

657
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:30,980
He would rather talk behind my back and protect me all the time.

658
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:32,980
He would raise me up.

659
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:38,980
And I can only be a strict master in the growing of Anu.

660
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:42,980
Anu!

661
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:44,980
Anu!

662
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,980
Anu!

663
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:41,980
Anu!

664
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,980
Anu!

665
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,980
Anu!

666
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:47,980
Anu!

667
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:49,980
Anu!

668
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:51,980
Anu!

669
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,980
Anu!

670
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:55,980
Anu!

671
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:57,980
Anu!

672
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,980
Anu!

673
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:01,980
Anu!

674
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:03,980
Anu!

675
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:05,980
Anu!

676
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:07,980
Anu!

677
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:09,980
Anu!

678
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:11,980
Anu!

679
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:13,980
Anu!

680
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:15,980
Anu!

681
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:17,980
Anu!

682
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:19,980
Anu!

683
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:21,980
Anu!

684
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:23,980
Anu!

685
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:25,980
Anu!

686
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,980
Anu!

687
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:29,980
Anu!

688
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:31,980
Anu!

689
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,980
Anu!
