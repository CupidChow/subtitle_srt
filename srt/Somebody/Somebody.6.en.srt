NEW MESSAGE FROM WAITING FOR YOU

00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:33,783
THIS MAZE WAS SO HARD,
BUT I SOLVED IT FIRST!

3
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,035
BRO!
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

4
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:36,453
DID YOU LEAVE THE CHAT ROOM?

5
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,086
DID YOU WASTE JAE-MAN?

6
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:49,049
WHY DID YOU THROW AWAY MY WHEELCHAIR?

7
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,231
Bitch is nuts.

- Good morning.
- Oh, morning.

10
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,212
Thank you for your hard work.

11
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:30,024
There will be a lot of dust blowing
into the office on demolition day.

12
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,050
You think I would be able to set up...

13
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,760
a small barrier?

14
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:36,513
Just... in the back, there.

15
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:37,889
Mmm, it's okay with me.

16
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:41,142
- Ah, thank you.
- Thank you for the drinks.

Oh.

19
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,825
<i>By any chance...</i>

20
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:42,620
<i>Is it you? Really?</i>

21
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,917
<i>Are you okay?</i>

22
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,837
<i>You didn't get hurt, did you?
I looked everywhere for you.</i>

23
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,714
<i>I looked around and around.</i>

24
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:55,925
<i>Then, when I went to the parking lot
and saw your car, you weren't there.</i>

25
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:57,969
<i>Did you get home safely?</i>

26
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,430
<i>You must be really mad at me.</i>

27
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:03,141
<i>But I feel like it's fate
that we got reconnected like this.</i>

28
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,185
Bullshit, man...

29
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,312
But I'll show you.

30
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:09,898
<i>I don't know about fate.</i>

31
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,400
<i>but I did think about your body.</i>

32
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,571
<i>Do you wanna meet?
I'll apologize in person.</i>

33
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,489
<i>Let's meet here tomorrow.</i>

34
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,993
<i>It's Euljiro 8th Street, building 32.</i>

<i>Yeah, what is it?</i>

37
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,025
<i>Hey, how is
the investigation on Somebody going?</i>

38
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:55,902
<i>Why are you
so interested in it?</i>

39
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,987
<i>- Come on!
- What?</i>

40
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,739
<i>Will you please tell me?</i>

41
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,658
<i>You like steak, right?</i>

42
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,181
<i>Ugh, why do you keep trying
to bribe me with beef?</i>

43
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,454
<i>I need you to meet with me.
Please.</i>

44
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:11,977
IF I'M LATE...
TAKE THE STEAK AND EAT IT AT HOME.

45
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:14,087
<i>Take the steak and eat it at home.</i>

46
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,089
<i>I suddenly started craving noodles,</i>

47
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:20,260
<i>so I'm going to Princess Snacks in
Euljiro, the must-try place for ramen.</i>

MAY, YEAR OF THE WHITE HORSE, SEONG YUN-O
MARCH, YEAR OF THE BLUE DOG, KIM SUM

49
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,298
Why do you want to help these people?

50
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:07,181
Sum is a... really good friend.

51
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:14,355
There is evil surrounding her, and so, uh...

52
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,191
I think I should help her.

53
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:21,279
If you are going
to mess with these people,

54
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,448
there's a chance you might get hurt, or...

55
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,033
you might get cursed.

56
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,619
Are you sure you still want to help her?

57
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,499
Yeah.

58
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,501
I hope that you have two lives.

59
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:40,840
You might survive, but your body
will deal with the consequences.

60
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,260
Maybe it's not what you should do.

61
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,929
I have to help her.

62
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,726
Well, there is nothing I can do
to stop you on this.

63
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:56,189
Could you just try and help
make this easier for me?

64
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:01,361
I don't want to see my child suffer
or get hurt by an evil spirit, okay?

65
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:04,530
If you were me, would you want that?

66
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,992
But you'll have to watch regardless.

67
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:09,577
Hmm.

68
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,000
Hmm...

69
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,294
Exorcism...

Kim Sum.

72
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:35,288
Call your boyfriend when
I get to the top of the <i>jakdu.</i>

73
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,457
Okay, I will.

74
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,503
Where is that dumb cocksucker?

75
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,800
HEY, I'M HERE!

76
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,191
<i>You're there already?
I just bought coffee.</i>

77
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,610
<i>I'm on my way over now.
Do you like pastries?</i>

78
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:52,656
Seriously.

79
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,243
Someone left the door open.

80
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,410
Miss!

81
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:57,912
What are you doing here?

82
00:08:58,704 --> 00:08:59,705
Get out of here.

83
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,166
This place is getting demolished soon.

84
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,752
- Get out of here.
- Sir, you need to come out soon.

85
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:07,046
- It's busy enough. Let's go.
- Come on.

86
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,132
- On the way.
- There's a ton of dust.

87
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,528
- I got everything.
- We're behind schedule.

88
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,312
- We don't have much time.
- Come on.

89
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:16,865
- We really have to go.
- How did that lady get in here?

90
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,725
- Hurry it up.
- Let's get moving.

91
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,729
Should somebody tell her
what's going on?

92
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,272
You take care of that? Great.
Okay, quick. You do that.

93
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:39,412
It's the year of the white cow,

94
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:42,915
the 11th lunar month...

95

...and the ninth day of the month.

96
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:48,754
This is for Kim Sum.

97
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,175
Please get rid of all the evil spirits
in this world.

98
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,262
I present this ritual
to the skies and to the earth.

99
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,514
May you accept it.

100
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,849
Now, shoo.

101
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,451
I WANT TO SEE YOU. LET'S MEET!

102
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:02,054
<i>Wait just a little bit longer.</i>

103
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,580
<i>I bought a bunch of macarons
to make up for everything.</i>

104
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,290
<i>Almost there.</i>

105
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,584
Jeez.

106
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,186
Bow down.

107
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,168
Hey, miss!

108
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:37,590
If you go straight that way,
you'll find the way out, okay?

109
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:38,674
Go straight!

110
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:05,825
Hmm.

111
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,289
WHERE ARE YOU?

112
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,506
THEY'RE TEARING THE PLACE DOWN
I MOVED SOMEWHERE ELSE

113
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,007
ANSWER ME
PICK UP THE PHONE

114
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,094
I'LL GIVE YOU THREE MINUTES

115
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,642
Ah, shit!

116
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:50,120
Gods of Heaven and Earth, look over us.

117
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,872
She goes on the straw cutter stage.

118
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,542
Please don't let your child get hurt.

119
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,545
Deliver her from punishments
and evil spirits.

120
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:01,257
Please look over your child
as she walks on the straw cutter.

121
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:05,177
And General,
please save Sum, for she is your child.

122
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:45,885
Don't let her get hurt.

123
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:49,555
Please let her finish the walk
and come down safely.

124
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:50,973
Don't let her get hurt.

125
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,308
I beg you.

126
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,393
Please don't let her get hurt, General.

127
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:35,601
<i>Hey.</i>

128
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,482
<i>Hello? Sum?</i>

129
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:42,650
<i>Hello?</i>

130
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:01,835
Going up!

131
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,079
Sir, we're headed down now as we speak.

132
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,584
"Amateur's work."

133
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:47,047
Well, you're not an amateur.

134
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,716
"Amateur's work."

135
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,729
Oh, shit... What the hell?

136
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:04,898
<i>Sir! On... on the wall...</i>

137
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:07,943
<i>- Sir!</i>
- Hey, you okay? Come back.

138
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,028
<i>- Sir!</i>
- What's goin' on?

139
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,529
<i>There's an ear here, sir!</i>

140
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,322
<i>It... it seems to be a human ear!</i>

141
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,366
<i>Human ears! Human ears!</i>

142
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,370
Slow down. I can't understand
what you're saying.

143
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,181
Uh, sir, down here! There's an ear here!

144
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,599
PROFESSOR MIN'S EAR

145
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:40,768
It's definitely a human ear.

146
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,882
SEONG YUN-O, KIM SUM

147
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:13,926
Hey.

148
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,804
What's going on? You okay?

149
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:20,682
Fuck!

150
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,643
Ah, fuck!

151
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,396
Ah, fuck!

152
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,293
Excuse me!

153
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,360
Pick up.

154
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,195
Wait a sec.

155
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,322
Gotta go. She's not picking up her phone.

156
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,409
What is going on?

157
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,710
I think I can find her.

158
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:45,767
Samantha?

159
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,522
I... I need... a favor.

160
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,649
Something I really need to know.

161
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,782
Hey, no! I am still in here!

162
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:44,993

163
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,162
I'm still inside here!

164
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,043
Please help!

166
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:07,766

00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,104
I'm still inside here!

168
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,775
I'm still inside here!

169
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:52,055
Uh, excuse me.
Have you been waiting for Yeong Gi-eun?

170
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,474
- Oh, yeah.
- Ah. Here you go, sir.

171
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:56,852
Uh...

172
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:44,607
Oh.

173
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:45,710
Fuck.

174
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,272
Oh.

175
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,651
Hey! Right here!

176
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:53,445
I need help here!

177
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:55,530
Help me!

178
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:01,369
I'm still in here!

179
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,663
Don't go!

180
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,004
Over here!

181
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,146
Someone please help!

182
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:36,029
<i>Sorry, the coffee got cold.</i>

183
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:38,198
<i>I'll buy you another. I'll be a tad late.</i>

184
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:24,869
Shit.

185
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,711
You son of a whore!

186
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:35,505
Where'd you go? Come out of here!

187
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:37,382
Come out!

188
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:41,177
Come out now!

189
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:43,637
Hey!

190
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:46,933
You bastard cock.

191
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,938
Ah.

192
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:08,997
There you go.

193
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,805
Ah.

194
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:28,975
You angry?

195
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,359
Shh. Why so quiet?

196
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,531
Is there anything
you want to know about me?

197
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:46,576
Probably...

198
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:49,411
Huh.

199
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,042
Why did you abandon me?

200
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,295
Ah!

201
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,300
You know why?

202
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:07,514
Are you... curious about that?

203
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,390
Well, then.

204
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,770
Then I should give you a serious answer.

205
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:17,482
So, you!

206
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,485
Stupid bitch...

207
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,406
You bitch, you required a wet tissue, huh?

208
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:33,081
You should have asked politely.

209
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:40,004
You wouldn't have helped
even if I had asked.

210
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:46,886
Gosh, seriously.

211
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,848
You would have just abandoned me.

212
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,516
Do you...

213
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:55,144
think abandonment would
even be wasted on you?

214
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,734
The thing about abandonment is...

215
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:06,322
someone has to love you, mmm,
for you to feel abandoned.

216
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:12,704
For instance...

217
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:16,124
when a mom has a baby in her womb,

218
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,626
or after raising her kids for a while.

219
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:30,346
Did she leave ya?

220
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:37,020
Your mother left you, right?

221
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,939
Broken child.

222
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:50,074
You should be proud
for trying to crawl out of here.

223
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:56,998
Shh.

224
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,795
But...

225
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:06,716
Why would you be curious about that?

226
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:09,635
Hmm?

227
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:15,391
Why would you be curious about that?

228
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,765
Let's just not meet anymore.

229
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:09,195
Please!

230
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:12,824
Hey, Sum.

231
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:17,412
Is this your police friend
that came by the other day?

232
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,830
Yeah.

233
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:24,919
Well, her call was dropped,
at 3:53 in the evening in Euljiro.

234
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,756
I'll say.

235
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:31,758
Okay.

236
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,429
Make sure to call me if you need anything.

237
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,180
Mm-hm.

238
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:54,532
IF I'M LATE...
TAKE THE STEAK AND EAT IT AT HOME.

239
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:56,951
I SUDDENLY STARTED CRAVING NOODLES.

240
00:33:57,035 --> 00:34:00,955
SO I'M GOING TO PRINCESS SNACKS
IN EULJIRO, THE MUST-TRY PLACE FOR RAMEN.

241
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,209
PRINCESS SNACKS
EULJIRO 8-GIL, JUNGBUK-GU, SEOUL

242
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:09,172
<i>Your call has been forwarded
to an automated voice message...</i>

243
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:29,067
PRINCESS SNACKS

244
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,739
It says it's scheduled
for demolition.

245
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:37,116
- Uh...
- Where are we?

246
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:41,329
- Talk to me, please.
- Ugh, just hold on!

247
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,092
THE PACIFIC JEWELRY

248
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,358
Hm?

249
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:24,163
Oh.

250
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:26,582
Um...

251
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,039
Oh!

252
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:11,335
Oh, hey. Is that Gi-eun's wheelchair?

253
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:18,259
- It is!
- Excuse me, sir!

254
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,261
Where is the owner of this wheelchair?

255
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:24,515
I don't know. Someone brought it outside
since it's not broken or anything.

256
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,601
It looked like they were
going to come back for it.

257
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:27,768
- Uh, inside there?
- Yeah.

258
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:36,569
What's that?

259
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:38,487
It's blocked again?

260
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:43,576
Come on!

261
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,204
Why stop the exorcism early?

262
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,687
- An explanation would be nice.
- What are you talking about?

263
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,893
- Gi-eun is in danger!
- I know. That's why we're here.

264
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,168
We can save her now.

265
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:54,754
So you should tell me
what's going on right now.

266
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,756
Was that guy you called
before your boyfriend?

267
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:58,216
Why do you want to know that, huh?

268
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:01,010
Answer the question.
Was it your boyfriend you called?

269
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:07,558
The guy who hurt Gi-eun
with the limp dick. They're the same.

270
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,730
- You're wrong.
- I'm wrong?

271
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:14,190
Yeah. You're wrong.

272
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:15,691
Ah. How do you know, huh?

273
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,693
'Cause he doesn't have a limp dick, okay?

274
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:20,404
I get it.

275
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,116
So you made an app
that you used to sleep with a guy.

276
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,161
You even shared him. You should be proud.

277
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,330
Watch what you say to me.

278
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,250
- Yeah, I got 'em.
- All right, great.

279
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,144
- This street...
- Come on, guys.

280
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,294
It's not him.

281
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:39,048
- I trust you. Gi-eun's the priority.
- Who are you, ladies?

282
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:41,425
How did you get in here? Get out of here.

283
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:44,220
It's dangerous.
This isn't the place to play around.

284
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:46,847
Get out of here, ladies.
We want to get off work.

285
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:47,932
Wait a minute.

286
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:54,897
- Why?
- Hold on. I think I hear something.

287
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:56,482
What is it?

288
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,482
Come on. How can you go in there
without a second thought?

289
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:21,382
Get out of there!

290
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,968
Ugh, I told you, there's someone in here!

291
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:25,386
Oh, jeez.

292
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:28,055
They're saying someone's in there.

293
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:16,686
Yeong Gi-eun!

294
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:20,106
Gi-eun!

295
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:22,818
Gi-eun!

296
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:24,862
Gi-eun!

297
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:30,868
Yeong Gi-eun!

298
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,536
Gi-eun!

299
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,539
Yeong Gi-eun!

300
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:37,917
Help me!

301
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:46,217
Yeong Gi-eun!

302
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,219
Here!

303
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:56,811
Yeong Gi-eun!

304
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:57,978
Mok-won!

305
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,109
Gi-eun!

306
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,738
Oh!

307
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:08,823
Mok-won.

308
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:22,044
Hey, why did you come here?
To meet someone?

309
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,840
You need to treat your wheelchair
with care.

310
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:28,634
- You can't just leave your chair!
- I didn't just leave it!

311
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:30,678
Shouldn't you ask me if I'm okay first?

312
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:33,013
- You look fine!
- What...

313
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:34,974
What happened?

314
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:37,351
Someone was burning incense.

315
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:40,688
The smell led me to you.

316
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:44,150
I thought you were dead.

317
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:48,487
You okay? It's okay.

318
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,156
It's all okay.

319
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:52,533
Hey, hey, careful.

320
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,960
- Sh, sh.
- Watch your head.

321
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,038
Uh, get the wheelchair.

322
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:06,172
- Oh, careful.
- Oh, just a second, please.
