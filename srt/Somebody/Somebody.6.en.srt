THIS MAZE WAS SO HARD,
BUT I SOLVED IT FIRST!

00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,035
BRO!
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

5
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:36,453
DID YOU LEAVE THE CHAT ROOM?

6
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,086
DID YOU WASTE JAE-MAN?

7
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:49,049

-Good morning.
-Oh, morning.

14
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,212
Thank you for your hard work.

15
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,964
There will be a lot of dust blowing
into the office on demolition day.

16

You think I would be able to set up…

17
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,760
a small barrier?

18
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:36,513
Just… in the back, there.

19
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:37,889
Mmm, it's okay with me.

20
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:41,142

Are you okay?

31
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,837
You didn't get hurt, did you?
I looked everywhere for you.

32
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,714
I looked around and around.

33
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:55,925
Then, when I went to the parking lot
and saw your car, you weren't there.

34
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:57,969
Did you get home safely?

35
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,430
You must be really mad at me.

36
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:03,141
But I feel like it's fate
that we got reconnected like this.

[Gi-eun] I don't know about fate.

40
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,400
but I did think about your body.

41
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,571
[Yun-o] Do you wanna meet?
I'll apologize in person.

42

47

[Gi-eun] Hey, how is
the investigation on Somebody going?

48
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:55,902
[Bul-gwang] Why are you
so interested in it?

-[Gi-eun] Come on!
-[Bul-gwang] What?

50
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,739
[Gi-eun] Will you please tell me?

51
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,658
You like steak, right?

52
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,160
[Bul-gwang] Ugh, why do you keep trying
to bribe me with beef?

53

Please.

TAKE THE STEAK AND EAT IT AT HOME.

I suddenly started craving noodles,

57
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:20,260

Sum is a… really good friend.

63

There is evil surrounding her, and so, uh…

64
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,191
I think I should help her.

65
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:21,279
If you are going
to mess with these people,

66
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,448
there's a chance you might get hurt, or…

67

you might get cursed.

68
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,619
Are you sure you still want to help her?

69
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,499
Yeah.

70
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,501
I hope that you have two lives.

71
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:40,840
You might survive, but your body
will deal with the consequences.

72
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,260
Maybe it's not what you should do.

73
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,929
I have to help her.

74
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,726
Well, there is nothing I can do
to stop you on this.

75
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:56,189
Could you just try and help
make this easier for me?

76
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:01,361
I don't want to see my child suffer
or get hurt by an evil spirit, okay?

77

If you were me, would you want that?

78

what's going on?

Do you…

309
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:55,144
think abandonment would
even be wasted on you?

00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,734
The thing about abandonment is…

312
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:06,322
someone has to love you, mmm,
for you to feel abandoned.

-[Mok-won] Excuse me, sir!

365
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,261
Where is the owner of this wheelchair?

366
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:24,515
I don't know. Someone brought it outside
since it's not broken or anything.

367
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,601
It looked like they were
going to come back for it.

368
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:27,768
-Uh, inside there?
-Yeah.

369
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:36,569
[Sum] What's that?

370
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:38,487
It's blocked again?

371
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:40,740
[Mok-won sighs]

372
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:43,576
Come on!

373
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,204
Why stop the exorcism early?

374
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:48,664
-An explanation would be nice.
-What are you talking about?

375
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,833
-Gi-eun is in danger!
-I know. That's why we're here.

376
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,168
We can save her now.

377
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:54,754
So you should tell me
what's going on right now.

378
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,756
Was that guy you called
before your boyfriend?

379
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:58,216
Why do you want to know that, huh?

380
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:01,010
Answer the question.
Was it your boyfriend you called?

381
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:04,013
[gasps]

382
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:07,558
The guy who hurt Gi-eun
with the limp dick. They're the same.

383
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,730
-You're wrong.
-I'm wrong?

384
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:14,190
Yeah. You're wrong.

385
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:15,691
Ah. How do you know, huh?

386
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,693
'Cause he doesn't have a limp dick, okay?

387
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:20,404
I get it.

388
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,116
So you made an app
that you used to sleep with a guy.

389
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,161
You even shared him. You should be proud.

390
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,330
Watch what you say to me.

391
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,250
-[man 1] Yeah, I got 'em.
-[man 2] All right, great.

392
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,085
-[man 3] This street…
-[man 1] Come on, guys.

393
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,294
It's not him.

394
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:39,048
-I trust you. Gi-eun's the priority.
-Who are you, ladies?

395
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:41,425
How did you get in here? Get out of here.

396
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:44,220
It's dangerous.
This isn't the place to play around.

397
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:46,847
Get out of here, ladies.
We want to get off work.

398
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:47,932
Wait a minute.

399
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:54,897
-Why?
-Hold on. I think I hear something.

400
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:56,482

without a second thought?

Get out of there!

405
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,968
Ugh, I told you, there's someone in here!

406
00:38:24,051 --> 00:38:25,386
[man] Oh, jeez.

407
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:28,055
They're saying someone's in there.

408
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:16,562

Hey, why did you come here?
To meet someone?

426
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,840
You need to treat your wheelchair
with care.

-You can't just leave your chair!
-I didn't just leave it!

Someone was burning incense.
