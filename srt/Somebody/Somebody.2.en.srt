00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,512
[man 1] Let's move on
to our next presenter.

2
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,723
-[man 2] Great job.
-[applause]

3
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:21,813
[clears throat]

4
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:28,236
Every single year, hundreds of thousands
of humans visit Napo's beautiful beach.

5
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,488
And on that beach, off to the side,

6
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:34,367
and though they don't blend well,

7
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,703
two silos stand there.

8
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:38,663
What does this mean?

9
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,000
What shall we do with the silos?

10
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:46,087
So please take a moment
to listen to this recording.

11
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:53,303
[air whooshes rhythmically]

12
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:04,981
[metal clanks]

13
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,767
[Yun-o, echoing] Ah!

14
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,229
[Yun-o laughs]

15
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:47,524
[echoing] Ah!

16
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,443
[echoing] Hello, hello.

17
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:54,322
TSC Architecture says hello.

18
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:58,159
Seong Yun-o is my name.

19
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:03,456
Ah!

20
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:14,008
[air whooshes rhythmically]

21
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:25,478
-Looks like amateur work.
-[laughs]

22
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:26,563
[woman] Professor!

23
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:37,991
What's it sound like?

24
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,078
[chuckles] It is the sound

25
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,497
that is inside a silo

26
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,376
that is 20 meters wide and 50 meters high.

27
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,671
When you enter this beautiful silo,

28
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:57,760
even the smallest sound of your breath
is reflecting off the rusting iron.

29
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,973
You feel the sound of your own breath.

30
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,726
Your breath in a way
you have never felt before.

31
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,853
[gentle music plays]

32
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:09,272
How long have the rusted iron plates

33
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,483
been holding out
inside of this lonely silo?

34
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,070
Almost 50 years.

35
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:21,576
They have been waiting
for your air and your voice for 50 years.

36
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,828
Waiting to hear your breath.

37
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,955
[gentle music continues]

38
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,541
[man] Yeah, sounds good. Here's my card.

39
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,339
For you.

40
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,677
-It's heavy.
-[woman grunts]

41
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,263

42
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,349
[gentle music continues]

43
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:56,194
SOMEBODY

44
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,162
Change back the entrance?

45
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,333
We're gonna have to change
the whole structure now.

46
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:15,505
Think of all the people and clients
who will be upset.

47
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,842
-What's the point in all of that, huh?
-[man] What?

48
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:23,846
No one's life is that great anyway.

49
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,391
We'll all be forgotten with time.

50
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:31,562
Is there anything that we value more than…

51
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,442
Than leaving a true lasting legacy?

52
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,444
[sighs]

53
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:42,991
We have to at least strive for that,
because it's important.

54
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,617
[cell phone rings]

55
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,620
TSC DIRECTOR
MISSED CALL

56
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:54,377
Yeong-hoon, go peek out the window.

57
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,631
It's time to get back to Earth.
Our space trip was fun.

58
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,176
Yun-o, get a hold of yourself.

59
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:08,725
[cell phone beeps]

60

61
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:17,066
[woman] Na-eun, don't wait for me.
Get some sleep.

62
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:17,984
Mm.

63
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,534

74
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:41,150
[Na-eun] Huh? I was just looking
at those fireworks.

75
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,069
[15] Really?

76
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,988
[Na-eun chuckles] Yes!

77
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,282
You must be close by.

78
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,701
Did you see the fireworks?

79
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,704
[15 chuckles] They were
right in front of me.

80
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,125
[Na-eun] No way.
Are you the one that set them off?

81
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,044
[15] Yeah. Drinking alone
can get pretty boring.

82
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,630
I wanted to set the sky on fire.

83
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:06,050
[Na-eun] Wow, thanks
for brightening up my day.

84
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,051
It means a lot.

85
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,387
[15] You having a hard day?

86
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,099
[Na-eun] Actually, every day
kind of sucks.

87
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,059
Life is boring.

88
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:18,312
LIFE IS BORING… LOL

89
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,234
ACCEPT VOICE CHAT WITH 15?

90
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,735
[cell phone chimes]

91
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:25,987
[clears throat]

92
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:33,995
[15] Why is life boring?

93
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:36,747
[Na-eun] Well,

94
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,168
I came here to follow my dream,

95
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:44,964
but now my dream has vanished, and I'm
already over 30 years old. [chuckles]

96
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,550
If someone looks at me warmly,
treats me well,

97
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:51,637
gives me nice gifts sometimes,
I just fall for them.

98
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:57,101
But when the relationship changes,
I'm left confused and alone.

99
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:00,646
[Na-eun sighs]

100
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:06,777
But today I saw something
that reminded me of my failed dream.

101
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,698
So I feel worse.

102
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:12,617
It's so annoying.

103
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,035
[chuckles]

104
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,414
[Na-eun] Honestly, I'm jealous.

105
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:22,835
I'm just so tired of everything now.

106
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,798
[Yun-o] There's not much I can say
to comfort you.

107
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,009
I'm sorry.

108
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:36,557
[Na-eun laughs awkwardly] We're strangers,
but I guess I overshared. I'm embarrassed.

109
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,309
I'll set off fireworks for you.

116
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,467
-Uh, were you--
-[Na-eun] Right?

117
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,722
[boy] No, wait, this is mine.

118
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:32,780
Can you buy these?

00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:41,622
Agh! Ow!

00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:59,640
Hey, Yun-o, you wanna try
a bottle of Napo soju?

123
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:01,350
-Yeah.
-Okay.

124
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,769
-Excuse me!
-Yes.

125
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,063
Question. What is the soju called here?

126
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,356
Samhak soju.

127
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,651
[chuckles] Great. Can we get one for us?

128
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:11,569
Sure.

129
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:16,532
There's a table over there.
Would you wanna move over there?

130
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,162
-Yeah.
-Great. [laughs nervously]

You don't care.

I'll tell you what he said. Hm.

even manage it?"

That's what he said. [laughs]

00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:11,966
I killed the cat.

Am I a monster?

366
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,640
No, not at all.

367
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,351
I told you to do it.

368
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,897
I know you wanted to help the cat.

369
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,192
So it wouldn't suffer.

370
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:31,778

So I found this place that I really like.

396
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:18,754
The pool is like the ocean.

400
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:36,105
I can get over there in the wheelchair.
I'll be there soon.

401
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:38,482

-[Gi-eun sighs]

408
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:01,797
Cool, but maybe it's not the pool
I wanna see.

409
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:04,633
I'd prefer to see your face.

Is something wrong?

419
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,391
Had a crazy dream last night.

-You were there.

421

Did I die? [gasps] Jeez.

422
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:02,525
[chuckles] That's not it.

423
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:05,027
[inhales] It's fine
now that I heard your voice.

424
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,405
[woman 1] I'm really creeped out.
Do I need to be careful?

425
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:09,698
Someone is calling.
I'll call you back, okay?

426
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:16,914
Um, yes, hello?

427

There were a lot of customers today.

00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:27,258
Uh, just my dream last night
had you in it, so I'm calling you.
