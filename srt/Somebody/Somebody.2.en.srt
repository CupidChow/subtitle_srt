1
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,564
<i>Let's move on
to our next presenter.</i>

2
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,723
<i>Great job.</i>

3
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:28,236
Every single year, hundreds of thousands
of humans visit Napo's beautiful beach.

4
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,488
And on that beach, off to the side,

5
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:34,367
and though they don't blend well,

6
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,703
two silos stand there.

7
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:38,663
What does this mean?

8
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,000
What shall we do with the silos?

9
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:46,087
So please take a moment
to listen to this recording.

10
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,767
Ah!

11
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:47,524
Ah!

12
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,443
Hello, hello.

13
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:54,322
TSC Architecture says hello.

14
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:58,159
Seong Yun-o is my name.

15
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:03,456
Ah!

16
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:25,478
Looks like amateur work.

17
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:26,563
Professor!

18
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:37,991
What's it sound like?

19
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,078
It is the sound

20
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,497
that is inside a silo

21
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,376
that is 20 meters wide and 50 meters high.

22
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,671
When you enter this beautiful silo,

23
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:57,760
even the smallest sound of your breath
is reflecting off the rusting iron.

24
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,973
You feel the sound of your own breath.

25
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,726
Your breath in a way
you have never felt before.

26
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:09,272
How long have the rusted iron plates

27
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,483
been holding out
inside of this lonely silo?

28
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,070
Almost 50 years.

29
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:21,576
They have been waiting
for your air and your voice for 50 years.

30
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,828
Waiting to hear your breath.

31
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,541
Yeah, sounds good. Here's my card.

32
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,504
For you.

33
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,677
It's heavy.

34
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:56,194
SOMEBODY

35
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,162
Change back the entrance?

36
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,333
We're gonna have to change
the whole structure now.

37
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:15,505
Think of all the people and clients
who will be upset.

38
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,842
- What's the point in all of that, huh?
- What?

39
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:23,846
No one's life is that great anyway.

40
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,391
We'll all be forgotten with time.

41
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:31,562
Is there anything that we value more than...

42
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,442
Than leaving a true lasting legacy?

43
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:42,991
We have to at least strive for that,
because it's important.

44

TSC DIRECTOR
MISSED CALL

45
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:54,377
Yeong-hoon, go peek out the window.

46
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,631
It's time to get back to Earth.
Our space trip was fun.

47
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,176
Yun-o, get a hold of yourself.

48
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:17,066
Na-eun, don't wait for me.
Get some sleep.

49
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,150
Mm.

00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,282
<i>You must be close by.</i>

61

<i>Did you see the fireworks?</i>

62
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,704
<i>They were
right in front of me.</i>

63
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,125
<i>No way.
Are you the one that set them off?</i>

64
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,044
<i>Yeah. Drinking alone
can get pretty boring.</i>

65
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,630
<i>I wanted to set the sky on fire.</i>

66

<i>Wow, thanks
for brightening up my day.</i>

67
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,134
<i>It means a lot.</i>

<i>You having a hard day?</i>

69
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,099
<i>Actually, every day
kind of sucks.</i>

70
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,059
<i>Life is boring.</i>

71
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:18,312
LIFE IS BORING... LOL

72

ACCEPT VOICE CHAT WITH 15?

73

<i>Why is life boring?</i>

74
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:36,913
<i>Well,</i>

75
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,168
<i>I came here to follow my dream,</i>

76
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:44,964
<i>but now my dream has vanished, and I'm
already over 30 years old.</i>

77
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,550
<i>If someone looks at me warmly,
treats me well,</i>

78
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:51,637
<i>gives me nice gifts sometimes,
I just fall for them.</i>

79
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:57,101
<i>But when the relationship changes,
I'm left confused and alone.</i>

80
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:06,777
<i>But today I saw something
that reminded me of my failed dream.</i>

81
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,698
<i>So I feel worse.</i>

82
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:12,617
<i>It's so annoying.</i>

83
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,414
<i>Honestly, I'm jealous.</i>

84

85

<i>There's not much I can say
to comfort you.</i>

00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,133
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

87
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:36,557
<i>We're strangers,

No, wait, this is mine.

Agh! Ow!

96
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,374
Hey, you bastard!

97
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:59,640
Hey, Yun-o, you wanna try
a bottle of Napo soju?

98
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:01,516
- Yeah.
- Okay.

99
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,769
- Excuse me!
- Yes.

100
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,063
Question. What is the soju called here?

101
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,356
Samhak soju.

102
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,651
Great. Can we get one for us?

103
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:11,735
Sure.

104
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:16,532
There's a table over there.
Would you wanna move over there?

105
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,162
- Yeah.
- Great.

106

Fucker.

111

with you.

113
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,506
Didn't you just say that you love him?

114
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,218
He loves another.

115
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,849
You don't care.

116
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,895
Fine,
I'll tell you what he said. Hm.

117
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:32,400
This is what he said.

118
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:39,907
"You can hear the sound of your breath
that is reflected in the silo?"

119
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:43,369
"That's one person
when they go in."

120
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:47,081
"Crap. How many people enter? Just one?"

121
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:54,547
"Cultural spaces that can't even pay
their own maintenance costs?"

122
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,882
"Would the local government
even manage it?"

123
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:03,180
That's what he said.

124
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,684
"Amateur's work."

125
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,020
Well, you're not an amateur.

126
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:14,942
"Am-a-teur's work."

127
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,486
<i>Professor, can you see me?</i>

128
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,740
<i>Do you see what I'm wearing?</i>

129
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:57,937
Huh?

130
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:00,356

Hey, Na-eun, you...
You'll need some spanking today, huh?

This...

138
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:55,431
What?

139
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:53,864
Please, help!

NOT TOO LONG AGO.

163
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:12,576
Mysterious.

164
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,496
<i>With a wheelchair?</i>

165
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,092

SANGDONG POLICE STATION

167
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,194
I did what the group chat
told me to do,

168
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:50,030
and I made 230% profit with the crypto!

169
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:53,033
I put in ten million won
and earned 23 million. 23 million!

170
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:54,784
So I couldn't think rationally!

171
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,829
So the smishing text, you clicked on it?

172
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,332
I did. That's what they said to do.

173
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,501
Your report has been filed.

Let me write down what I told you, okay?

Okay. Send us the file soon.

I'M IN A WHEELCHAIR TOO!

189
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,533
HAVE YOU EATEN YET?

190
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,719
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU, CUCKOO

<i>Where is it?</i>

196
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:36,404
YOU SAID YOU WANT TO SWIM.
SO I'LL TAKE YOU SWIMMING!

197
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,239
<i>All right, I'll trust you.</i>

198
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:08,895
I was sitting there.

199
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,108
I know. You kept it warm for me.

200
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,327
This is yours,

201
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,455
and this one is mine.

202
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:50,311
All of the bottles in this bar,

203
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:51,812
they're all mine.

204
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:54,274
I'm friends with the bartender.

205
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,735
If you wanna drink some of it...

206
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:01,698
give this to her.

207
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,327
I AM INSTRUCTOR LEE YOON.

208
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:12,459
If I drink all of them?

209
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:18,256
If you drink any of them,
my friend over there will call me.

210
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,217
Then I'll come...

211
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,598
just like this.

212
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:28,850
And if you're drunk...

213
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,074
I'll totally stress out.

214
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,370
Do whatever you want.

215
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:18,525
Can you drop me off in front
of the convenience store? Yeah, here.

216
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:27,283
Oh. We're already here.

217
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:30,118
Goodbye.

218
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:33,790
You're just going to, uh, leave?

219
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:36,584
I have to be at work really early.

220
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,586
What do you do?

221
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:45,885
I can drive you to work in the morning
if you want.

222
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:59,023
Would you give... your contact info?

223
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,445
See ya.

224
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,791
<i>What are you looking for
on Somebody?</i>

225
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:27,005
<i>I want to connect with people.</i>

226
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,049
<i>How?</i>

227
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:36,139
<i>Rather than how, you should be asking who.</i>

228
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:40,435
<i>Who do you want to connect with?</i>

229
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:44,480
<i>People who can understand me.</i>

230
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:50,069
<i>What would you have done
about the cat?</i>

231
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:56,117
<i>I'd probably do the same as you.</i>

232
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:01,914
<i>It's exactly
what you're thinking now, yes.</i>

233
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:03,708
<i>Do it.</i>

234
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:11,966
<i>I killed the cat.</i>

235
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,178
<i>Am I a monster?</i>

236
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,640
<i>No, not at all.</i>

237
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,351
<i>I told you to do it.</i>

238
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,897
<i>I know you wanted to help the cat.</i>

239
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,192
<i>So it wouldn't suffer.</i>

240
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:31,943
<i>Great job!</i>

241
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:33,863
<i>You did good.</i>

242
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:38,951
<i>Where are you now?
I need to see your face.</i>

243
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:41,079
<i>I'll be right over.</i>

244
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,168
<i>Is this supposed to be funny?</i>

245
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:49,462
<i>Oh.</i>

246
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:52,840
<i>I go out and do ribbon cuttings.</i>

247
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,914
<i>Yes, I'll call you
when I get there.</i>

248
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:51,083
WHEEL ME
ARE YOU ON YOUR WAY?

249
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,668
<i>I'm almost there.</i>

250
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,356
ACCEPT VOICE CHAT WITH WHEEL ME?

251
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:03,447
<i>Let's talk on voice chat.
It'll free up your hands.</i>

252
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:06,658
Okay.

253
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:11,539
I crossed the bridge,
um, and heading down to you right now.

<i>Ah, okay.</i>

255
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:15,668
<i>So I found this place that I really like.</i>

256
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:18,754
<i>The pool is like the ocean.</i>

257
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,359
- Mm.

Wow. Looks wonderful.

<i>Isn't it?</i>

260
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:36,105
I can get over there in the wheelchair.
I'll be there soon.

261
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:38,482
<i>Yeah,

262
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,653
<i>Keep on coming down
until you're next to the black greenhouse.</i>

00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:44,905
Oh, okay.

264
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,079
Oh.

265
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:56,250
<i>The swimming pool.</i>

266
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,793
<i>Look.</i>

267
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:01,797
Cool, but maybe it's not the pool
I wanna see.

268
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:04,633
I'd prefer to see your face.

269
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:08,429
Whoa.

I'm doing pretty good.</i>

276

<i>Is something wrong?</i>

277
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,391
Had a crazy dream last night.

278
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,684
<i>- A dream?</i>
- You were there.

279
00:39:56,894 --> 00:40:00,773
<i>- What sort of dream?
- Did I die? Jeez.</i>

280
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:02,525
That's not it.

281
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:05,027
It's fine
now that I heard your voice.

282
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,405
<i>I'm really creeped out.
Do I need to be careful?</i>

283
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:09,698
Someone is calling.
I'll call you back, okay?

284
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:16,914
Um, yes, hello?

<i>Oh, hey.
Mok-won, did you call me?</i>

<i>There were a lot of customers today.</i>

287
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,379
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

288
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:27,258
Uh, just my dream last night
had you in it, so I'm calling you.

289
