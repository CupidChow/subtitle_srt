-Hello.
-Hello. I'm Kim Seon-yong, the attorney.

192
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:25,307
She needs to come down to the station
and fill out a report.

193
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:29,019
The doctor said she should,
um, rest at the moment.

194
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:32,022
You can talk to her after that.
We can arrange a date.

195
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,901
Yeah, but why don't we just chat a moment?

196
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,611
Maybe a cup of coffee.

197
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:41,198
Well, you already know
the whole situation, so…

198
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:45,077
-Okay. All right then.
-[Kim Seon-yong] Yeah.

00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,656
Sum, hey, shall we do cards? Hm?

202
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:24,616
[chuckles] Let's go.

203
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:28,245
-Here.
-[Sum] You feel pain when you get hurt.

204
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:29,830
Pain. Hm.

205
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:31,498
Good job. Okay.

206
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:33,417
Here.

207
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,504
Mm.

208
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,631
Mm.

209
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,175
It's fear.

210
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:46,054
When people are scared, they make a face.

211
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,558
Like this one here.

212
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:52,936
Tell me why it's purple like that.

213
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,397
Because she's scared and frightened.

214
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,066
Breathing isn't easy when scared.

215
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,860
If circulation is not good,

216
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:02,863
the blood in you won't move
the way we want it to.

217
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:04,406
[chuckles] And that

218
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:07,034
could turn your face purple.

Sum.

237

What are you doing?

238
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:24,152
[Sum] I wanted to see
if your face would turn purple.

[Sum's mother] Yeah?

244
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,392
Something you wanna tell me, Sum?

245
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,811
Yeah. Can I do it to you again?

246
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,817

WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

254
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,259
Why are you… [gasps]

255
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:53,927
…doing this to me?

256
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:58,890
DID YOU SAY SOMETHING BEFORE THAT?

257
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:02,102
OR DID YOU DO SOMETHING?

258
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,483
I KILLED HIM.

259
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:14,573
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID AS HE WAS DYING.

260
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:21,955
BUT AT THAT MOMENT…

261
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:35,093
I FELT EUPHORIA.

YOU DON'T WANT OTHERS TO KNOW?

267
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:02,287
OH… RIGHT. I FORGOT.

Sum, take the day off, get some rest.

This is my routine.

276

I only rest when it's scheduled,
and today is not scheduled.

That's not what I…

278

00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:13,968
-Who are you looking for?
-I have to find them.

362
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,846
There's problems though.
I don't have the number.

363
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,140
We only found him by chance.

364
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:22,351
We had planted someone
by the restaurant he was at.

365
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:23,561
Very fun.

366
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:26,939
-You're so amazing.
-[Gi-eun] Who are you looking for?

367
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,984
You've never been curious about anyone.

368
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,027
For sure.

369
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:33,738
But it's different this time.

370
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:35,907
That's why I went.

371
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:37,700
What do you mean?

372
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,869
The news. That's me.

373
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:42,330
What?

374
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:44,540
Hey!

375
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:48,336
Are you… Are you crazy? Come over here!

376
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:49,879
You must be out of your mind.

377
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:52,715
Hey, are you okay?

378
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:53,633
Mm.

379
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:58,721
Yeah. You almost died!

380
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:04,727
Sum, you're looking for the person
who lured and tried to rape you?

381
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,605
-What's got into you?
-Mm.

382
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,274
[Gi-eun sighs]

383
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:13,444
So it's true that Somebody's
personal information can't be leaked.

384
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,655
That's not necessarily the case, but

385
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:20,326
I don't have Somebody's information
available to me.

386
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:24,997
So, Sum, you really couldn't get
that wheel me's user information?

387
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:25,957
Yeah.

388
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:30,753
Apologies. I doubted you.

389
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:33,548
Doubted me, huh? But why?

390
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:35,341
[Mok-won] Well…

391
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:38,386
So…

392
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:41,764
Hm.

393
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,981
You wanna find the person who did this.

394
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,861
And you want to make him suffer.

395
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,114
Hm.

396
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:01,367
[Sum] How are you going to kill him?

397
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,871
Knife? Gun? Poison?

398
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,789
So Sum is all in, huh?

399
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,167
First,

400
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:12,086
hm, let's lure him in then.

401
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,131
-Mm.
-To a place that's good for us.

402
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:18,968
We should also stake out the restaurant,
and the place in the picture.

403
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:20,178
And follow him.

404
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,306
You're like a cop, Gi-eun. You're amazing.

405
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,184
Are you planning to kill him right away?

406
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:29,478
Are you angry enough to kill him?
Or just messing around?

407
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:34,025
What will you do when you see him?
Have him reimburse you for the wheelchair?

408
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:36,986
Maybe gonna sue? How? And for what though?

409
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:38,905
Pressing charges won't work.

410
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:43,868
We don't have enough physical evidence,
so it probably makes him dangerous.

411
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,239
Should I put it out?

412
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:24,367
Can shamans read minds?

413
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,827
You think shamans are gods?

414
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,704
Don't you get possessed by spirits?

415
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,748
Sure I do. Though I'm not a god.

416
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,334
You need to talk to me.

417
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:43,261
You perform rituals for people
as a shaman?

418
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,763
You get paid much?

419
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:49,892
Um, what, a-are you making me
fill out taxes now?

420
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:53,145
If you have a problem with it
or think it's unfair,

421
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,605
take it up with the gods.

422
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:58,234
Then when are you a god,
and when are you not a god?

423
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:01,570
I need to make sure to ask you things
when you are a god.

424
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:05,449
Well, it feels
like a god is always around.

425
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:08,869
But there are situations where…

426
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:13,749
Where it's stronger. Wild. Understand? Hm.

427
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:19,130
Like last time, when you brought a knife,
or when I call on the General probably.

428
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:23,134
When possessed,
is it possible you are heavier?

429
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:26,929
[Mok-won chuckles]

430
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,764
Seriously?

431
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,266
I want to measure it.

-[Mok-won laughs]
-It's a curious matter.

433
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,063
Perhaps you can

434
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:38,941
sense something from me also?

435
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:41,944
Why do you ask?

436
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:46,490
Ever since I was young,
people have said that I was

437
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:47,908
like a monster.

438
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:53,289
But if you see it,
perhaps you can expel it somehow.

439
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,722
[Mok-won] I do sense an evil spirit.

440
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:11,682
A spirit?

441
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:14,977
Can you tell me what he wants?

442
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:21,942
"Can I get the knife?"

443
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:25,654
"I love knives."

"If you are carrying that blade
all the time,

447
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:38,250
you'll want to use it someday."

448
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:44,590
Definitely I sense that.

WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO WITH SUM?

542
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:06,068
SEX. I WANT TO TAKE OFF ALL HER CLOTHES
AND TOUCH HER.

543
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:12,074
I WANT TO BITE AND SUCK ALL OVER HER BODY.

I WANT TO HUG HER, TOUCH HER,
FUCK HER FACE, SMELL HER SCENT FOREVER.

545
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:22,250
[Yun-o] Sex. I want to take off
all her clothes and touch her!

Murder!

I want to go around
killing everyone with Sum.

550

00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:47,025
Listen. I really don't know any of
the other men that were at the warehouse.

555
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:49,277
The girl I found on Somebody
and matched with

556
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:51,405
wanted to role-play gang rape,

557
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:54,825
so I just went there, okay?

558
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:58,870
[man] We will share the details
after the investigation is complete.

559
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:01,623
[reporter] Police have requested
information from the app developers

560
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:03,917
about the third person
who lured the victim.

561

The investigation will continue
once the victim recovers.

[Bul-gwang] Professor Min?

Yes.

[ominous music plays]

567
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:27,482
-[Min] Hello.
-Yes, hello.

568
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:33,405
We're here to ask you some questions
about the disappearance of Oh Na-eun.

569
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:37,242
You and her talked the night she vanished,
is that right?

570
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:39,911
-Yes, we met--
-[man] Where should I put these?

571
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:41,288
-There.
-[man] Okay.

572
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:42,414
And had a drink together.

573
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:44,791
-Where did you go?
-A sushi joint.

574
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:47,544
Someone over at city hall recommended it.

575
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:49,421
And then?

576
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:51,673
Then what?

577
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:53,133
And next, huh?

[ominous music continues]

579
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:57,471
Professor Min. That's who she went to see.

580
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:04,478
I received a message saying it was
about something important, so I went.

581
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:08,732
Well, I don't know who it was, but I was
smashed in the head with something,

582
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:10,776
and then I awoke at the doctor's.

583
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:13,320
What then?

-Huh?
-Look here.

587
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:22,412
I became Vincent van Gogh.

588
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:24,539
And my back is shot.

589
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:27,667
And so?

590
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:32,172
So instead of hassling me,
you should look for that thug.

591
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:33,965
Jeez.

592
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:35,926
[Bul-gwang] Have you ever been
inside a silo?

593
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:38,470
Mm.

594
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:39,971
The stairs,

595
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:42,390
they look pretty dangerous.

596
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:46,061
Well, they would look dangerous
to your kind of people, so…

597
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:50,190
I was curious.

598

599
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,110
What then, huh?

600
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:55,403
[exhales] I went in.

602
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:58,448
And saw something…

603
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:01,785
Something quite fascinating.

[ominous music intensifies]

605
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:12,420
[Yun-o] An ear.

606
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,884
There was an earlobe
that was torn off and hanging.

Whose is it?

00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:32,315
Aren't you curious?

611
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,901
[scoffs]

612
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,903
Human ears.

613
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:41,158
What had they been listening to in there?

614
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:46,288
What's your relationship with the girl?

615
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,331
She's just a student.

616
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,501
Jeez.

618

[Min] Excuse me.

I'm in pain right now.

00:52:57,465 --> 00:52:59,426
Uh, if you're done talking,

621
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:01,761
can you leave, okay?

622
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:02,679
All right.

00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:11,771
Professor Min's hand when we parted…

624
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:13,607
Shaking.

625
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:15,025
Wh-- Why?

626
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:17,402
Why was it shaking?

627

Ah, I

628
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:21,656
focused on ears.

629
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:22,574
Jeez.

He can't fool us.

00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:28,955
Na-eun and Professor Min
were definitely lovers.

Who would be the most upset
when they find out?

Well, uh… Uh…

00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:38,673
Um, boyfriend?

635

Her girlfriend?

You know, there's a lot of lesbians
around these days. [chuckles]

637
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,727
She made her last call to Professor Min.

638

Na-eun is alive still.
