[Sum] What did you talk about with Yun-o?

00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:24,566
YUN-O SAID HE WANTS TO SAVE
ABANDONED DOGS AND CATS

WHAT HE WANTS TO DO WITH YOU

Well, since you were honest,
I think I'll forgive you then.

00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,507
Well, I guess

35

00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,127
To swear a bunch.

64
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,089

Kim Sum took the day off today.

I can't call her either.

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,329
That's very strange.

00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:41,831
Isn't that right?

100
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:42,748
Yeah.

101
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,334
[Samantha] You said you know something

102
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,878
about the person who disappeared
while using Somebody?

103
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,799
You should go to the police station
for that, though.

[Samantha chuckles awkwardly]

107
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,351
So now I think
that some person took my phone,

108
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:06,105
and then they logged in
to my Somebody account and deleted it.

109
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:09,817
So I was really hoping
that you could get it back.

Though I don't know.

Once a user's account data is wiped,

120
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,724
there's a process
that deletes it on the server.

121
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,478
Uh, then there's the issue with backups,

122
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,855
so I'm not sure it will work, okay?

Were you the one who broke Someone?

394
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,828
[Yun-o] You should just ask
why I broke it.

395
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,917
[Sum] It's probably because you found out

396
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,462
that Someone can remember
the things you wrote and erased.

397

because I was with you.

418
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,672

[Mok-won] Oh, she's my friend.
But why is she here?

423
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:58,270
So you had plans?

424
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,523
I should get going.

425
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:03,776
Get home safe. I'll call you.

426
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:04,693
[Yoon] Yeah.

427
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:12,910
[Sum] I need to talk to you.

-Mm-hm.

What's this about?

430
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:43,232
You said that I'd hurt someone
if I was carrying a knife, didn't you?

431
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,362
And you said
your power gets stronger around knives.

432
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:50,906
Okay, so?

433
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:53,951
Are you turning these in?

434
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,580
Are you going to give them away?

435
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:34,783
Explain.

436
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:41,248
It doesn't look like
anyone could really get killed with that…

437
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:45,169
but why does it make me sick?

438
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,049
Please help, Mok-won.

439
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,804
I just don't want him to leave me alone.

440
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:01,393
Still, suppose I do kill him? What then?

441
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:03,604
I finally found him.

442
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:08,317
I think that I found someone just like me
after all these years.

443
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:09,735
I'm scared.

444
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:25,960
[Mok-won] I'll make you a talisman.

445
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,555
Is there something stronger?
