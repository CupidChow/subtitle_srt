1
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:16,683
HI

2
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:18,518
<i>What did you talk about with Yun-o?</i>

3
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:24,566
YUN-O SAID HE WANTS TO SAVE
ABANDONED DOGS AND CATS

4
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:28,737
AND MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT LONELY!

5
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:34,701
HE SAID YOU PURIFY HIS HEART!

6
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,579
BUT... SUM!

7
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:42,375
WHEN I ASKED HIM
WHAT HE WANTS TO DO WITH YOU

8
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:48,131
YUN-O TYPED THIS AND THEN ERASED IT...

9
00:00:54,429 --> 00:01:00,560
SEX, I WANT TO TAKE OFF ALL HER CLOTHES
AND TOUCH HER.

10
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:07,609
I WANT TO BITE AND SUCK ALL OVER HER BODY.

11
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:14,240
I WANT TO HUG HER, TOUCH HER,
BURY MY FACE AND SMELL HER FOREVER.

12
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:44,437
SOMEBODY

13
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,107
YUN-O

14
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,359
<i>Yun-o, this is Kim Sum.</i>

15
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:52,362
<i>I wanna talk. I have so much to say.</i>

16
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:53,947
<i>Come to me.</i>

17
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,310
You need to go through immigration.

18
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,397
Do you want to come in?

19
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:33,027
- Yes.
- How long will you be staying here?

20
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,156
I don't quite know.

21
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:40,451
Are you carrying
any drugs or weapons?

22
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:44,205
Any criminal cases you were involved in?

23
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,458
Yeah.

24
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,710
Really?

25
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,755
Well, since you were honest,
I think I'll forgive you then.

26
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,507
Well, I guess

27
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,178
as long as you don't ever leave me alone.

28
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,804
You swear, okay?

29
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:01,847
Yeah.

30
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,683
I need a good hug.

31
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,909
SOMEONE: HELLO

32
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:37,337
WHAT DOES SUM USUALLY HAVE FOR BREAKFAST?

33
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,922
WHOLE WHEAT BREAD!

34
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,990
How did you know
that I eat whole wheat bread?

35
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,325
I don't know.

36
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,914
There's something I wanna do.

37
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:15,665
What is it?

38
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,127
To swear a bunch.

39
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:21,089
To yell curse words while we have sex.

40
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,303
Okay.

41
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,057
Strip down then. Come on.

42
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,236
Come on then.

43
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,146
You're fucking delicious.

44
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,774
I'm going to eat you, motherfucker.

45
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:23,525
You get it?

46
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:30,199
Did you wanna take off my clothes?

47
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:34,370
Hug me, fuck me, touch me...

48
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,874
and smell me forever?

49
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:47,758
Someone can hold on
to things that you write and erase.

50
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,892
Didn't know that, did you?

51
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:03,024
Do it more, motherfucker.

52
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,069
Do it.

53
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,948
Do it harder. Fuck me harder.

54
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:47,109
Wait, it is? Is it really your own work?

55
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:23,062
<i>- This is Spectrum. How can I help?</i>
- Hi. I'd like to meet the CEO?

56
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:25,273
I'm calling about setting up a meeting.

57
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,860
Hello.

58
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,074
Kim Sum took the day off today.

59
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,660
I can't call her either.

60
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,329
That's very strange.

61
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:41,831
Isn't that right?

62
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:42,914
Yeah.

63
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,353
You said you know something

64
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,878
about the person who disappeared
while using Somebody?

65
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,799
You should go to the police station
for that, though.

66
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:54,051
Well, I am an officer.

67
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,386
Oh.

68
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,351
So now I think
that some person took my phone,

69
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:06,105
and then they logged in
to my Somebody account and deleted it.

70
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:09,817
So I was really hoping
that you could get it back.

71
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,278
How unfortunate.

72
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:18,701
Sadly, we don't retain data from accounts
that have been deleted. Sorry.

73
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,749
I just need to see the chat history.

74
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:27,084
That's all I'd need access to.
Nothing more.

75
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:35,635
So I'll look into it and do what I can.

76
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,470
Though I don't know.

77
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,555
Once a user's account data is wiped,

78
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,724
there's a process
that deletes it on the server.

79
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,478
Uh, then there's the issue with backups,

80
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,855
so I'm not sure it will work, okay?

81
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:51,025
We will do the best
that we possibly can for you.

82
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,944
I'll get to work on this
and then give you a call.

83
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:55,445
Only because

84
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,324
Sum likes you a lot.

85
00:10:58,407 --> 00:10:59,950
Mm.

86
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,150
Do you know what my hobby is?

87
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:36,277
Yeah.

88
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,280
I know it all.

89
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:40,199
You said it's murder.

90
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:43,703
Do you want to go around
killing people with me?

91
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,129
Yeah.

92
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,382
Okay.

93
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:02,930
It'd be fun.

94
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:06,976
Mm.

95
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:54,815
<i>Hey, Gi-eun.</i>

96
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:58,569
Try to make this real quick, okay?
I'm super busy right now.

97
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:01,572
You know the men in Namyeong-dong?
The ones who keep quiet.

98
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,742
Can you put me in contact
with someone who's trustworthy?

99
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,702
<i>It could be someone you worked with.</i>

100
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,453
Jeez.

101
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:13,375
<i>Yeah. This guy works fast
and never talks to anyone.</i>

102
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,630
<i>I'm hanging up now.
Drinks are on you later.</i>

103
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,803
OPEN ON SOMEBODY

104

FINGER
CONNECTING VIDEO CALL

105
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:39,609
Hello there.

106
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,988
FINGER

107
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,659
What? Is this thing working or not?

108
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:48,410
<i>What do you want?</i>

109
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,582
<i>Come on, come on. What do you want?</i>

110
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:58,587
WHEEL ME

111
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,090
I want to see all the records
from this account.

112
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:05,427
<i>Make it bigger.
Bigger. Bigger so I can see!</i>

113
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,680
Uh, here you go.

114
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,978
<i>Do you want me to send things
as I find them,</i>

115
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,397
<i>or do you want it all at once?</i>

116
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:20,442
As you find them, please. It's important.

117
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,236
Hold on.

118
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:24,779
Just a minute.

119
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:28,450
Uh, how did we get connected on Somebody
if we didn't match?

120
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,744
Did you hack the phone?

121
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:35,207
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Through the program's matching code.

122
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:43,924
<i>If I couldn't even do this,
people wouldn't look for my help.</i>

123
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,342
No way!

124
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,138
How do I pay you in the end though?

125
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,731
Huh? What?

126
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,233
I pay you in crypto?

127
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:09,158
Uh, I know a thing or two
about cryptocurrency,

128
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,454
but I've never seen
a website like the one you sent.

129
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,042
<i>Why are you talking right now?</i>

130
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,754
<i>You're really, really, really
making me mad!</i>

131
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,840
<i>If you deliver just one fimitcoin,</i>

132
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,426
<i>I can get you information
about all of his accounts.</i>

133
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,970
<i>And there's an additional charge
of one fimitcoin</i>

134
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:34,266
<i>for every backed-up text, photo,
or video restored. Understood?</i>

135
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,518
Oh, I see.

136
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,191
Then...

137
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,236
Then I should make an account now.

138
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,574
After that, I'll call you.

139
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,624
- What? What do you want?
<i>- Hey, so...</i>

140
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:04,088
You trust this person, right?
I mean, they're asking me to pay in crypto

141
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:07,299
on a weird trading platform.

142
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,551
If you don't need this,
you don't have to do it.

143
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,929
If you agreed to it,
you should have faith.

144
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:15,808
<i>If it turns out to be a scam,
you can just investigate it, right?</i>

145
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:18,978
Okay.

146
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,730

<i>My name is Yun-o.</i>

<i>Why do you think
Sum invited me over to her house?</i>

156
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:17,281
I'M NOT SURE. IT'S THE FIRST TIME
SHE'S INVITED A MAN OVER.

157
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,544
<i>Obviously, she called me over

<i>Why are you laughing?</i>

162
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:54,276
HAHAHAHA
I'LL LEAVE IT TO YOUR IMAGINATION.

163
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,034
<i>If you don't know
the whole story, don't laugh.</i>

164
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:06,538
IF YOU COULD CHANGE ONE THING
FROM YOUR CHILDHOOD, WHAT WOULD IT BE?

165
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,836
<i>Do you really want to know?</i>

166
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,840
I THINK IT WILL HELP US GET CLOSER!

167
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,729
That's nothing you need to know.

168
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:33,857
Shit chatbot!

169
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,039
YOU

170
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,926
YOU ARE

171
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,565
YOU ARE GOING TO DIE

172
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,988
THAT CAN HAPPEN.

173
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,993
IT'S OKAY.

174
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,897
- Can I have a Jack and Coke?
- Sure.

175
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:13,809
On the tab?

176
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:17,938
I'm a regular, but

177
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,650
I always came so I could see you.

178
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:27,781
Your earrings aren't identical.

179
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:35,205
This is fashion right here!

180
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:37,582
Wait, so,

181
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:42,087
do you think I put on these earrings
and then ran over just for you?

182
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,004
Really?

183
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:45,966
Uh, no.

184
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,689
I thought you weren't interested,

185
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,316
and I found someone new.

186
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,288
Yet you came here still.

187
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,257
I waited so long for you.

188
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:37,726
Uh.

189
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,202
Doesn't this place creep you out?

190
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:41,706
Why? You think you'll see a ghost?

191
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,294
It's been three years with the General.

192
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,214
And almost ten years now

193
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,259
since I first got my power.

194
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,678
I'm not scared.

195
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,768
You weren't afraid when you asked me

196
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,353
to come over here?

197
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,569
I was so scared.

198
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,870
Let's go, okay?

199
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,706
The people who come here

200
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,501
and ask you
to take responsibility for their lives

201
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,128
must be totally desperate.

202
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,052
And you listen to all of them,

203
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,014
holding their problems in so close.

204
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,686
It makes me think that you

205
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,272
had to feel extremely alone,

206
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,943
not being able
to share your work with people.

207
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:04,706
Get out of there.

208
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:07,208
Why? I like it here.

209
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:09,668
Yoon, come on.

210
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:11,795
Get over here.

211
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:21,723
Hm.

212
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:22,806
I got you.

213
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,311
So you're a shaman.

214
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,069
I'll protect you.

215
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,740
Stop with the sweet talk.

216
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:41,992
No way.

217
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,122
I will be...

218
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,334
your talisman.

219
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,115

How did you do it?</i>

231

<i>Forget it. Jae-man will be first place
again anyway, so you should just give up.</i>

<i>You should just ask
why I broke it.</i>

286
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,930
<i>It's probably because you found out</i>

<i>that Someone can remember
the things you wrote and erased.</i>

Or I could just go
early in the morning.

298
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:37,500
Time went by so quickly.

299

No one's telling you to leave.

300
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,462
I lost track of time
because I was with you.

I have work.

Oh, she's my friend.
But why is she here?

305
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:58,270
So you had plans?

306
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,523
I should get going.

307
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:03,776
Get home safe. I'll call you.

308
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:04,859
Yeah.

309
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:12,910
I need to talk to you.

310

- Yoon, I'll call you, okay?
- Mm-hm.

311
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,183
What's this about?

312
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:43,232
You said that I'd hurt someone
if I was carrying a knife, didn't you?

313
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,362
And you said
your power gets stronger around knives.

314
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:51,072
Okay, so?

315
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:53,951
Are you turning these in?

316
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,580
Are you going to give them away?

317
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:34,783
Explain.

318
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:41,248
It doesn't look like
anyone could really get killed with that...

319
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:45,169
but why does it make me sick?

320
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,049
Please help, Mok-won.

321
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,804
I just don't want him to leave me alone.

322
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:01,393
Still, suppose I do kill him? What then?

323
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:03,604
I finally found him.

324
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:08,317
I think that I found someone just like me
after all these years.

325
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:09,859
I'm scared.

326
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:25,960
I'll make you a talisman.

327
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,555
Is there something stronger?

328
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:43,018
A ritual?

Your lover?

332
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:14,466
Did the General say anything?

I just want the Somebody ID and password
for the kid in the video.

341
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:28,832
<i>I thought
you were an officer of the law.</i>

342
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:29,916
Mm-hm.

"Dude, where are you right now?"

372
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:20,360
Dude, you've got the right to remain
silent, and the right to an attorney.

I'm not gonna be downloading Somebody.

Why not?

380
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,299
I just don't want to.

381
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:26,718
But Somebody's how I found you.

382
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,805
- Do you think I should download it?
- Mm.

383
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:35,435
My, uh, ID number is "11,"
so you can be "12."

384
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:37,770
