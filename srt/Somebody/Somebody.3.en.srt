1
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:31,072
Cool, but maybe it's
not the pool I wanna see.

2
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:33,616
I'd prefer to see your face.

3
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:52,427
SOMEBODY

4
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,269
Hello.

5
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,064
Hello to you.

6
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,024
Nice to meet you.

7
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,198
Would you like to come down?

8
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,621
How did you get down there?

9
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:20,872
Whoosh! I dove in.

10
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,959
You're lying!

11
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:29,005
Maybe you're right.

12
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:33,343
But there's another lie...
that you don't know about me.

13
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,685
You got a girlfriend, don't you?

14
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:52,529
The actual lie...

15
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:12,005
This...

16
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,469
I'm sorry, I...

17
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:20,931
I was just...

18
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:22,850
I was...

19
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,562
I was curious about you

20
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:26,980
and wanted to meet you,

21
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:29,274
so I lied about that.

22
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:31,567
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:36,865
How can I trust you?

24
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:40,534
Well...

25
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,166
I don't know.

26
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,092
So, did you say you wanted to swim?

27
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:06,603
Shall we... swim together?

28
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,026
Uh... Can I...

29
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:16,821
get a little closer... to you?

30
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,433
Man, you were scared.

31
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:56,486
May I carry you?

32
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,890
GENERAL MOK-WON

33
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,501
Take my underwear off.

34
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,294
Eat me out now.

35
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,004
Mmph...

36
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:53,615
Stop.

37
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:06,796
To be honest...
I don't have any feeling there.

38
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,470
Did you know that you're...

39
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,559
the first person since
the accident to touch me?

40
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,063
Thank you.

41
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,075
Do I feel good?

42
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:28,497
Is it okay?

43
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,590
Touch me right there.

44
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,244
How did you... get your scar?

45
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,421
I have one on my back too.

46
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,467
Yours looks pretty big.

47
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,764
It must have hurt, seeing how big it is.

48
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,059
It hurt for me, too.

49
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:38,234
When I'm sitting in a wheelchair,
I get bruises on my thighs and calves.

50
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,736
Well, you saw that earlier, right?

51
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,283
Right?

52
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,078
Oh...

53
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,749
Can you get me a wet wipe?

54
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,753
Hm?

55
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,756
Get me a wet wipe?

56
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:07,096
Hm? Are you asleep?

57
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,269
Get me a wet wipe?

58
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,521
Hm?

59
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,579
Don't be long.

60
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:48,679

61

62

68
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,907
Where are you, you fucker?

69
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,242
Hey!

70
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:36,036
What happened to my wheelchair?

71
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,123
Damn it.

Damn it.

76

Fuck.

77

Damn it!

78
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,234
Excuse me.

79
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:14,653
Who is it?

80
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:21,076
- Can you come out for a moment?

Okay.

84

Oh, the smell.

85
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:34,339
- Ah, did you pee?
- No, I didn't.

86

Thank you.

Hey, why weren't you answering?
Where'd you put your phone?

91

- Don't know.

- You're gonna yell, huh?
- Damn it!

101
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:39,196
Your wheelchair, where is it?
I'll get it, okay?

102
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,620
Are you really
not gonna say anything?

103
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,914
You wanna stay here or not?

104
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,376
Hey, did some guy take your wheelchair?

105

and so many would come to shop here,

that it got crowded to the point

00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:10,105
I was almost killed.
Because of a guy on Somebody.

168
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,899
His ID is "wheel me."

169
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:14,818
His picture is a wheelchair.

170
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,612
Son of a bitch.

171
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,864
That wheelchair,
just thinking about it, I...

172
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,077
Get me his information, Kim Sum.

173
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:28,248
Kim Sum? You've never called me that.

174
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:30,959
You curse more now.

175
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,752
Sounds bad on you.

176
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,217
I can't give you personal information
from Somebody, you know that.

177
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:42,345
Still, it's good you're okay, though.

178
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:46,015
You could've been really hurt. Or worse.

179
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,394
Forget it.

180
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:53,481
If you wont help me,
I guess I'll just handle it, then.

181
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:02,282
Thank you for showing up.

182
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,493
It means a lot.

183
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,079
Don't mention it.

184
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,373
Guess it's been a while
since I've seen you.

185
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:12,709
You're welcome.

186
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:33,021
You need to meet with Gi-eun again.

187
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:42,215
Your old home is gone. What happened?

188
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:46,219
- Mmm.
- Your dad must've done some renovations.

189
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,095
Yeah.

190
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,810
You can get around in your wheelchair.

191
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:27,719
<i>Gi-eun.</i>

192
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:38,354
Uh...

193
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:44,527
Oh? You're here already?

194
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:50,658
Look at all these packages, Gi-eun.

195
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,245
Did you two talk?

196
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,750
It's nice to be together
after a long time, right?

197
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:04,923
- Mok-won.
- Thank you.

198
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,696
Are you glad you're at work again?

199
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,740
Mm.

200
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,121
Yeah, but still,

201
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:40,917
you telling a friend with an injured back
they weren't trying enough...

202
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,502
That sounds harsh to me, so...

203
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:46,839
It's true that she wasn't
trying hard enough.

204
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,968
She wasn't doing
what her doctors said to do,

205
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:53,763
and all she did was lay in bed, not
even thinking about going to work again.

206
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:58,643
Well, at times, just coming
over and staying for a while,

207
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:00,770
that would've been nice of you.

208
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,486
Cheers.

209
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:13,198
Hey.

210
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,587
I didn't have anyone to tell me that.

211
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,175
Because it was always you who did.

212
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:37,140
After what happened, you wouldn't
talk to me at all. Just silence.

213
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:41,811
I'm sorry, Gi-eun.

214
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:44,605
I didn't know.
It was because I didn't know.

215
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,160
Cheers.

216
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:01,664
Cheers.

217
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,475
Hold on a sec.

218
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,067
Cheers.

219
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,572
So, what'd you do with this guy?

220
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,574
Hm?

221
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:38,993
Told you.
That she'd come around from curiosity.

222
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,708
- So, you're curious?
- Mm.

223
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,005
Mmm...

224
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,038
You've gotten better!

225
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:27,250
Gosh, you're both so horny.

226
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:28,543
Really!

227
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:30,920
Ah, seriously.

228
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:34,132
- What?
- Seriously.

229
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,342
Ah, it didn't end well, but...

230
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:41,597
I'm happy to hear that you still
got to have a fling with someone anyway.

231
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,142
Remember how you said I...

232
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,060
should put it to use?

233
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,939
So how did it feel to put it to use?

234
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:56,237
And since his profile pic was
a wheelchair, could he not walk?

235
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,489
Then how did he have sex?

236
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:01,325
Did his back muscles work that well?
I know yours don't.

237
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,786
Or did you two just use your hands?

238
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,331
So...

239
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:09,250
you wanna know what...

240
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,960
the sex we had was like?

241
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:17,091
Mmm...

242
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,301
Uh...

243
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,470
He was in a wheelchair, but...

244
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,723
he was a liar.

245
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:26,851
He was probably over 190 centimeters tall.

246
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,645
And he had broad shoulders.

247
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:32,356
Why was he in a wheelchair? To trick you?

248
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,860
Mmm... He wasn't trying to trick me.

249
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:38,696
I guess he just wanted to... bond with me.

250
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,699
I liked him, he was really nice.

251
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:47,538
Still, I bet he thought he would scare me
like that if he approached me first.

252
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:52,460
I guess he thought
that my body would crumble or something.

253
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,462
So he didn't really know how to start.

254
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:59,800
But his hand touching my waist
was so soft and gentle.

255
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,220
I love guys that have soft hands.

256
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,431
He took his hands...

257
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:07,725
and he held onto me here,

258
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:10,686
then the shoulders,

259
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,314
and right here.

260
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:17,568
Yeah. And went slow... down,
and touched my chest.

261
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,546
- Like this, really softly...
- How did he do that?

262
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,365
How did he touch
all of them at the same time?

263
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:24,450
Is he Shiva? Does he have four arms?

264
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:25,451
Hey.

265
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:28,496
In that moment,
he wasn't one, but two whole Shivas.

266
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,373
It was, like... aah!

267
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:31,707
Oh!

268
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:39,632
And then, whew!
I fell asleep wrapped in his arms.

269
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:43,261
Jeez, you two really are
true friends, huh?

270
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,846
Yeah, we've always been good friends.

271
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:49,308
I couldn't think,
I was just so damn horny.

272
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:54,021
And it was like all the cells in my body
suddenly awakened.

273
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,440
But then...

274
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:00,111
that's when the fun really started.

275
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,320
How was that?

276
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:03,989
"Take...

277
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:06,742
my underwear off now."

278
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:11,330
"Eat...

279
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,375
me out."

280
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:19,255
He went down slowly,

281
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:21,257
and touched

282
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,634
my waist,

283
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,261
and legs...

284
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:38,941
And then,

285
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:43,404
I thought things were getting really good.

286
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:47,783
But he didn't get hard at all.

287
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,578
At all? Oh, really?

288
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:52,454
Yeah.

289
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,667
So I tried my best.

290
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:00,796
Mmm. Gave it my all, and yet...

291
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,673
it just stayed so soft.

292
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,845
I've never met
someone who couldn't get hard.

293
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:11,057
Then was it like Michelangelo's <i>David?</i>

294
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:22,610
It would have been nice
if it had just ended there.

295
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:27,698
But that jerk decided
to throw away my wheelchair.

296
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,535
So that's why I'm looking for him.

297
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,385
How do you feel about her?

298
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:51,722
What?

299
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,268
I don't get what made you lie about this.

300
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:02,608
Is it fun to mess with her?

301
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,360
You're funny.

302
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:07,779
Well,

303
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:09,990
she's your best friend.

304
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:16,372
But you decided not to tell her...
what happened exactly.

305
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,625
I won't ask you about it anymore.

306
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:23,712
You know you can just...
call me if you need anything.

307
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:32,888
Hold on.

308
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:37,226
A shaman should know
without me telling them.

309
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:50,990
<i>I mopped the floor today.</i>

310
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:54,201
SOMEONE: NO WONDER IT FELT REFRESHING!
HAHAHA

311
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:57,997
<i>Gi-eun is going to come hang out.</i>

312
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:03,461
DID YOU MAKE UP WITH GI-EUN?

313
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:07,089
YOU MISSED HER A LOT.

314
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,049
<i>Yeah.</i>

315
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,885
<i>And I met someone</i>

316
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:14,472
<i>with Asperger's on Somebody.</i>

317
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,310
DO YOU HAVE ASPERGER'S?

318
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:23,230
I'M A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT, AND IT FEELS
LIKE I HAVE A KNIFE STUCK IN MY HEART.

319
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:31,238
I KNOW... I USED TO WANT TO KILL EVERYONE
WHO REACTED NEGATIVELY TOWARD ME.

320
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:34,575
I LIKE READING, SO I KEPT TO MYSELF.
IT HELPS ME FORGET EVERYTHING.

321
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,246
<i>It felt like looking at myself
from ten years ago.</i>

322
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:42,249
WHEN YOU MADE ME?

323
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,333
<i>Yeah!</i>

324
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,128
<i>I want to help them.</i>

325
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:52,635
THE ECCENTRIC CHILD, ASPERGIRL

The Eccentric Child, <i>by Aspergirl?</i>

So, actually, my job is as a fund manager.

Ah... The thing is, I want to get married

I came here to pick up a cellphone.

Ah, the cellphone. Just a minute.

Not really sure.

Okay, so, when did you get this, huh?

363
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:08,163
It's been, I guess... close to five days?

364
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,002
And do you recall
grabbing it off the street?

365
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:16,171
Or did someone pick it up
and leave it here with you?

366
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:20,884
I don't touch the floor.
You know how dirty the floor is?

- Why are there so few customers?

370
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:42,823
Is today a good day or not a good day?

And who would I meet?

390
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,737
There was just a lady with red lipstick.

391
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:07,574
And she didn't seem
to know much of anything, either.

Well, old ladies don't like you.
