00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,328
I'm working very hard. [laughs]

194
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:20,041
Well, everyone enjoy the movie?

195
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,126
[all] Yes.

196
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,462
Do any of you know him at all?

Ah, no way! [chuckles]

199
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:31,219
I heard that back when this
shopping center was really great,

200
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,890
that the business was so good
and so many would come to shop here,

201
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:39,060
that it got crowded to the point
that you could barely move around.

202
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,313
I was hoping you could share
experiences

203
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:43,315
or anything like that from back then.

204
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:44,399

Where is Gi-eun?

218
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:32,841
Hold on.

219
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,176
Why did you bring a knife?

220
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:38,221
-What?
-Oh, it's a little one.

221
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:42,684
Don’t bring those in my house,
no matter the size of your blade.

The General makes his business

[Mok-won] Kim Sum.

229
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,961
I want you to help find a Somebody user.

230
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:57,008
Can you do that?

231
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:58,593
No.

232
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,184
-What are you doing?
-Hey.

233
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:10,105
I was almost killed.
Because of a guy on Somebody.

234
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,899
His ID is "wheel me."

235
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:14,818
His picture is a wheelchair.

236
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,612
Son of a bitch.

237
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,864
That wheelchair,
just thinking about it, I--

238
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,077
Get me his information, Kim Sum.

239
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:28,248
Kim Sum? You’ve never called me that.

240
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:30,959
You curse more now.

241
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,752
Sounds bad on you.

242
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:39,217
I can't give you personal information
from Somebody, you know that.

243
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:42,345
Still, it's good you're okay, though.

244
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:46,015
You could've been really hurt. Or worse.

245
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,394
Forget it.

246
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:53,481
If you wont help me,
I guess I'll just handle it, then.

247
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:02,282
Thank you for showing up. [sighs]

248
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,493
It means a lot.

249
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,079
Don't mention it.

250
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:10,373
Guess it's been a while
since I've seen you.

251
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:12,709
You're welcome.

00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:42,215
Your old home is gone. What happened?

257
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:46,219
-Mmm.
-Your dad must've done some renovations.

258
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:47,971
Yeah.

259
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,810
You can get around in your wheelchair.

260
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:20,962

266
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:44,527
Oh? You're here already?

267
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:48,448
[gasps]

268
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:50,658
Look at all these packages, Gi-eun.

269
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,245
Did you two talk?

270
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,750
It's nice to be together
after a long time, right?

271
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:04,923
-Mok-won.
-Thank you.

272
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,696
Are you glad you're at work again?

273
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,616
Mm.

274
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,121
Yeah, but still,

275
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:40,917
you telling a friend with an injured back
they weren't trying enough…

276
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,502
That sounds harsh to me, so…

277
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,170
[pouring]

278
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:46,839
It's true that she wasn't
trying hard enough.

279
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,968
She wasn't doing
what her doctors said to do,

280
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:53,763
and all she did was lay in bed, not
even thinking about going to work again.

281
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:58,643
Well, at times, just coming
over and staying for a while,

282
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:00,770
that would've been nice of you.

283
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,486
Cheers.

284
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:13,074
Hey.

285
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,587
I didn't have anyone to tell me that.

286
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,175
Because it was always you who did.

287
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:37,140
After what happened, you wouldn't
talk to me at all. Just silence.

288
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:41,811
I'm sorry, Gi-eun.

289
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:44,605
I didn't know.
It was because I didn't know.

290
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,036
Cheers.

291
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:01,664
[Sum] Cheers.

292
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,475
Hold on a sec.

293
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,067
[Mok-won] Cheers.

294
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,572
So, what'd you do with this guy?

295
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,574
Hm?

296
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:38,993
Told you.
That she'd come around from curiosity.

297
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,288
[laughs]

298
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:43,331
[both chuckle]

299
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,708
-So, you're curious?
-Mm.

300
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,005
[Gi-eun] Mmm…

301
00:34:58,346 --> 00:34:59,931
[moans]

302
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,814

[moans]

305
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,038
You've gotten better!

306
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,123
[laughing]

307
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:27,250
Gosh, you're both so horny.

308
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:28,543
Really!

309
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:30,920
Ah, seriously.

310
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:34,132
-[Mok-won] What?
-Seriously.

311
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,342
Ah, it didn't end well, but…

312
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:41,597
I'm happy to hear that you still
got to have a fling with someone anyway.

313
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,142
Remember how you said I…

314
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,060
should put it to use?

315
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,939
So how did it feel to put it to use?

316
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:56,237
And since his profile pic was
a wheelchair, could he not walk?

317
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,489
Then how did he have sex?

318
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:01,325
Did his back muscles work that well?
I know yours don't.

319
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,786
Or did you two just use your hands?

320
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,331
So…

321
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:09,250
you wanna know what…

322
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,960
the sex we had was like?

323
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:13,963
[Gi-eun laughs]

324
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:17,091
Mmm…

325
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,301
Uh…

326
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,470
He was in a wheelchair, but…

327
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,723
he was a liar.

328
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:26,851
He was probably over 190 centimeters tall.

329
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,645
And he had broad shoulders.

330
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:32,356
Why was he in a wheelchair? To trick you?

331
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,860
Mmm… He wasn't trying to trick me.

332
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:38,696
I guess he just wanted to… bond with me.

333
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,699
I liked him, he was really nice.

334
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:47,538
Still, I bet he thought he would scare me
like that if he approached me first.

335
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:52,460
I guess he thought
that my body would crumble or something.

336
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,462
So he didn't really know how to start.

337
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:59,800
But his hand touching my waist
was so soft and gentle.

338
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,220
I love guys that have soft hands.

339
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,431
-[sighs]
-He took his hands…

340
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:07,725
and he held onto me here,

341
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:10,686
then the shoulders,

342
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,314
and right here.

343
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:17,568
Yeah. And went slow… down,
and touched my chest.

344
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,487
-Like this, really softly--
-How did he do that?

345
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,365
How did he touch
all of them at the same time?

346
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:24,450
Is he Shiva? Does he have four arms?

347
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:25,451
[Gi-eun] Hey.

348
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:28,496
In that moment,
he wasn't one, but two whole Shivas.

349
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,373
It was, like… aah!

350
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:31,707
[gasping] Oh!

351
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:34,752
[sighs]

352
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:39,632
And then, whew!
I fell asleep wrapped in his arms.

353
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:43,261
Jeez, you two really are
true friends, huh?

354
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,846
Yeah, we've always been good friends.

355
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:49,308
I couldn't think,
I was just so damn horny.

356
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:54,021
And it was like all the cells in my body
suddenly awakened. [gasps]

357
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:56,440
But then…

358
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:00,111
that's when the fun really started.

359
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,320
How was that?

360
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:03,906
"Take…

361
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:06,742
my underwear off now."

362
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:11,330
"Eat…

363
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,375
me out."

364
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:19,255
He went down slowly,

365
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:21,257
and touched

366
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,634
my waist,

367
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:25,261
and legs…

368
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:26,387
[gasps]

369
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,347
[moaning]

370
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:38,941
And then,

371
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:43,404
I thought things were getting really good.

372
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:47,783
But he didn't get hard at all.

373
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,578
At all? Oh, really?

374
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:52,413
[Gi-eun] Yeah.

375
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,667
[sighs] So I tried my best.

376
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:00,796
Mmm. Gave it my all, and yet…

377
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,673
it just stayed so soft.

378
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:04,925
[sighs]

379
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,845
[Sum] I've never met
someone who couldn't get hard.

380
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:11,057
Then was it like Michelangelo's David?

381
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:22,610
[sighs] It would have been nice
if it had just ended there.

382
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:27,698
But that jerk decided
to throw away my wheelchair.

383
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,535
So that's why I'm looking for him.

384
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,385
How do you feel about her?

385
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:51,722
What?

386
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,268
I don't get what made you lie about this.

387
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:02,608
Is it fun to mess with her?

388
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,360
You're funny.

389
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:07,613
Well,

390
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:09,990
she's your best friend.

391
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:16,372
But you decided not to tell her…
what happened exactly.

392
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,625
I won't ask you about it anymore.

393
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:23,712
You know you can just…
call me if you need anything.

394
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:32,888
Hold on.

395
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:37,226
A shaman should know
without me telling them.

396
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:50,990
[Sum] I mopped the floor today.

397
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:54,201
SOMEONE: NO WONDER IT FELT REFRESHING!
HAHAHA

398
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:57,997
[Sum] Gi-eun is going to come hang out.

399
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:03,461
DID YOU MAKE UP WITH GI-EUN?

400
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:07,089
YOU MISSED HER A LOT.

401
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,049
Yeah.

402
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,885
And I met someone

403
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:14,472
with Asperger's on Somebody.

404
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,310
DO YOU HAVE ASPERGER'S?

405
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:23,230
I'M A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT, AND IT FEELS
LIKE I HAVE A KNIFE STUCK IN MY HEART.

406
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:31,238
I KNOW… I USED TO WANT TO KILL EVERYONE
WHO REACTED NEGATIVELY TOWARD ME.

407
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:34,575
I LIKE READING, SO I KEPT TO MYSELF.
IT HELPS ME FORGET EVERYTHING.

408
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,246
It felt like looking at myself
from ten years ago.

409
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:42,249
WHEN YOU MADE ME?

410
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,167
Yeah!

411
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,128
I want to help them.

412
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:52,635
THE ECCENTRIC CHILD, ASPERGIRL

413
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:56,555
Do you know the book called
The Eccentric Child, by Aspergirl?

414
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,974
I was really into that book
in high school.

415
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,268
I feel at ease when I read it.

416
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:10,110
If you need it, let me know.

417
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:12,363
I'll lend it to you.

418
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,865
Who do you--
Who else do you want to see?

419
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:17,368
It's in your imagination.
Who else do you want to see?

420
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:18,994
-Uncle?
-Uncle?

421
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:22,414
So, actually, my job is as a fund manager.

422
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:24,625
So if I took out a loan…

423
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:30,172
Ah… The thing is, I want to get married
to my beautiful girl.

424
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:33,342
She's only risking her love,
and yet you gamble destiny.

425
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,054
Hah!

426
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:42,142

427
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:53,237
[sighs] I'm not sure.

428
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,949
I don't know
if you still have this opportunity ahead.

429
00:42:58,158 --> 00:43:01,161
And the General
has absolutely nothing to tell you.

430
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:04,748
Let me see your fortune
with some of your blood.

431
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,875
Let me see, now.

432

[Mok-won] Hmm…

435
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:39,491
You don't have luck in wealth anymore.

436
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,201

441
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:10,939
Excuse me.
I came here to pick up a cellphone.

442
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:12,941
Ah, the cellphone. Just a minute.

443
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:16,570
[sighs]

444
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:23,410
Ah. I don't have much cash, though…

445
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:29,291
Three thousand, three…

446
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,046

448
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:40,177
When did you get this phone?

449
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,595
Not really sure.

450
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,937
Ah, let me get some of that.

451
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,355
Gimbap, ten rolls?

452
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:54,316
For takeout?

453
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:56,777
Of course!

454
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:04,243
Okay, so, when did you get this, huh?

455
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:08,163
It's been, I guess… close to five days?

456
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,002
And do you recall
grabbing it off the street?

457
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:16,171
Or did someone pick it up
and leave it here with you?

458
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:20,884
I don't touch the floor.
You know how dirty the floor is?

459
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,733
-Goodness, Miss Gong-ju.
-Hello!

460
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:38,444
-Give us some budae jjigae and somaek.
-We're here!

461
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:41,029
-Goodness, I am so hungry today.
-Why are there so few customers?

462
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:42,823
Is today a good day or not a good day?

463
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:44,366

Ma'am, I sent the wrong amount.

471
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:17,274
I put 300,000 instead of 30,000.

472
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:19,985
Well, there's nothing we can do.

473
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:21,862
I paid in advance.

474
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:24,031
I'll just come here a lot. That okay?

475
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:42,132
Gi-eun.

476
00:46:43,258 --> 00:46:44,843

Did you meet anyone there?

481
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:01,276
[sighs] And who would I meet?

482
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,737
There was just a lady with red lipstick.

483
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:07,574
And she didn't seem
to know much of anything, either.

484
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:10,035
Well, old ladies don't like you.

485

[Gong-ju] It's very late, though.

491
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:32,724
[Yun-o] I know.

492
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:35,644
[Gong-ju] Then you have to eat
what I give you.

493
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:38,188

I'm fine.

-Huh?

He's eating here now.

Mm-hm.

500
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:55,372

Oh, I wish I could see his face
a little more. Damn.

502
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:59,334

Sorry, I think
I'll have to go without eating.

And your food's done.

Come on, General, why do you keep calling?
I sent you a picture.

You sure it's that bastard?

517
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:48,383
Yeah, I heard the owner lady.

"A young lady came
to pick up the phone last week."

519

I can't really get a good look
at his face in that one.

520

Can you get one
where you can see it better?

521
00:48:55,223 --> 00:48:56,141
His face?

522
00:48:57,684 --> 00:49:00,312
Ah, shit, his damn shoulders are so wide.

523
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:01,647
Hey.

524
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:03,231
We need his face.

Let go and let's talk. Yeah?

Ah, this guy already ate and left.

545
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,204
Where did he go?

546
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:42,873
Hey. [clears throat]

547
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:46,043
I'll stay on the lookout for you.
Starting today, don't worry.

548
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:48,462
Yes, yes, yes. Bye. Bye.
