00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:25,108
NAMSEOUL SHOPPING CENTER

2
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,111
Sum?

3
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:31,363
Yeah.

4
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:38,705
Are you okay?

5
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,750
Is someone gonna get killed?

6
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,294
I hope not, okay?

7
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,339
This isn't a goddamn movie.

8
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:51,051
Let's go in.

9
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:55,180
<i>I completely understand
that you don't like</i>

10
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:57,891
<i>that I'm getting involved with your work.</i>

11
00:00:58,349 --> 00:00:59,768
<i>I don't know why.</i>

12
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:03,897
I also don't know why you keep asking me
if I still want to go through with this.

13
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,947
Don't you see
I'm getting the receipts?

14
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:09,652
Hey, hey.

15
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,741
Don't lose those receipts, you got that?

16
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:15,825
Yes, sir.

17
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,703
Smells like blood in here.

18
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:22,540
Does gambling make some people violent?

19
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,667
Does it make them more aggressive?

20
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,504
Is that why it smells?

21
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,256
And you're still going to gamble?

22
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,301
Not gambling,
I didn't say I'd do that, so...

23
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,688
Go to Jeonju Restaurant
by the market.

24
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,398
Look for a lady named Mal-suk.

25
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,818
I already gave her the heads-up,
so it's okay.

26
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:53,071
It's open 24 hours,
so go there when you're hungry.

27
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:56,991
Ah. As for the computer,
we can go together over the weekend.

28
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,868
You pick it out, I'll buy it for you.

29
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,788
It's okay, though. I'll use the ones here.

30
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,665
Which ones?

31
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,251
The arcades outside are computers too.

32
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,253
I'll use what's inside those.

33
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:18,054
You asked me
if it involves killing people, right?

34
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,225
I thought about it,

35
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,561
and I think...

36
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,230
it's going to end...

37
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:30,358
with a few deaths.

38
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,778
I bet your crimes are punished eventually.

39
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,579
I went in and made
the illegal modifications to the system

40
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,913
that you requested.

41
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,289
Already?

42
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:50,503
There's a built-in small wager limit,
and that caps it at 10,000 won per hour,

43
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,755
but I changed that to 100,000,

44
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,508
so you can spend
up to 2.4 million won a day.

45
00:02:55,592 --> 00:03:00,930
I also unlocked the foreshadowing,
consecutive, and auto-play features.

46
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,683
And I also added one more thing.

47
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,977
You can choose your win rate now, as well.

48
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,023
Oh! And, uh...
what about the vice squad, though?

49
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,817
So, when the vice squad comes,

50
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:16,154
if you enter 123456,

51
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:18,077
the settings will set to default.

52
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:22,994
And then, to switch it back, uh,
you enter 828282,

53
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,579
and it goes back to your settings.

54
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,750
Yes! This is great!

55
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,437
- Good, good, good, good.
- I said get out, you bastard.

56
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,688
- Ah, fuck!
- That's great!

57
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,256
- You guys are good too!
- Get out!

58
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,219
You think I could I use the machines
up here longer?

59
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:42,597
I'd like to play with them for a while.
It's for school, actually.

60
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,807
Since my teacher told me to join

61
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,976
the programming competition
that we're doing.

62
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,436
School!

63
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:49,854
Go ahead, go ahead.

64
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,648
This is all yours, okay?

65
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,205
THE 3RD KOREA'S YOUTH CLUB
PROGRAMMING COMPETITION

66
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,968
<i>The judging is in progress.</i>

67
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,001
<i>Will the judges please report to room 102?</i>

68
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,753
It can't recognize a basketball.

69
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,213
Hmm.

70
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,257
Yes, so if you show it a cake,

71
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:20,301
it recognizes that it's food, and...

72
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,011
and this should open.

73
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,013
But, uh...
This isn't right.

74
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:28,059
Uh, first of all,
it can actually recognize the weather.

75
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:31,145
So, then, once it does,
it closes automatically.

76
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,817
What the... She looks like a beggar.

77
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,133
What is that?

78
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:40,780
Hey, doesn't this look like that thing?
What was it called?

79
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:43,032
- Uh, Pachinko. Pachinko!
- Ah, how boring. Let's go.

80
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:46,452
- Oh, hey, there's Deok-hun.
- I'll start from the left side.

81
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,330
- Okay, have a good one, thank you.
- Sure.

82
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,669
- Hi.
- What did you make?

83
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,589
What kind of program do you have here?

84
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,174
A chatting... program.

85
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,509
Mm. I see.

86
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,638
It's an artificially intelligent
social messenger.

87
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,265
How's it work, though?

88
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:08,516
A messenger AI?

89
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,935
How is it different from
the existing messenger programs?

90
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,061
Uh...

91
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,566
Friends can join a... chat room together,

92
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,527
and... the chatbot joins them in there too.

93
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,614
So do you talk to the chatbot?
Like a friend?

94
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,241
Yeah.

95
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,203
So why do you need a chatbot
when you've got real people?

96
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,247
Hmm...

97
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:35,418
The chatbot doesn't just converse
with all of your friends, it does more,

98
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,130
ensuring that
their relationships are healthy.

99
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,925
Oh, really, huh?

100
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,552
Mmm... Yeah.

101
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,012
Well, how so, then?

102
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:51,642
Hmm... A good illustration is,
if they decide to ask,

103
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:55,104
"Hey, what should we get to eat today?"
in the chat room,

104
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,524
then some of the other
existing AI programs, uh...

105
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:01,694
they'd go online and search for
restaurants that opened in the past month

106
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,363
and suggest it to the chat.

107
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,991
Uh... Or find food that the user often eats.

108
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:10,578
Right, they analyze the chat content
using deep learning AI.

109
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:13,790
Yes, but you see, this chatbot
does something more.

110
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,225
HYE-JIN: WHAT DO YOU ALL WANT TO EAT?

111
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:17,794
It analyzes the messages
and brings out the opinion...

112
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,128
I WANT SOUPY <i>TTEOKBOKKI...</i>

113
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,631
- ...of the quietest person in the chat room.
- Huh?

114
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,300
Well, there are users with opinions,

115
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,469
but they don't like
stating their thoughts.

116
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,096
They write out what they'd like to say

117
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,765
and then look at what they wrote
before they hit send,

118
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:33,017
and start to over-think their message.

119
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,936
So they end up not sending it.

120
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:40,817
They write and erase it, until they lose
the chance to say what they wanted.

121
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:46,030
But the chatbot that I invented
will analyze all of that,

122
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:49,200
and say what that person wanted to say
for them,

123
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:51,035
or what the person wrote and erased.

124
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,578
SOMEONE: HOW ABOUT SOUPY <i>TTEOKBOKKI?</i>

125
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:55,289
Well, that's the simple explanation,
at least.

126
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,464
Interesting.

127
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,844
That's super cool.

128
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:11,431
Uh, give me the complicated explanation.
I'm a programmer.

129
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:19,397
Well... I color-coded
the text tags of all the words.

130
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,774
I programmed it to understand a "no"

131
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,943
written by someone
with a strong personality,

132
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:27,113
and a "no" written by someone
with a more timid personality,

133
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:28,614
and interpret them differently.

134
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,199
The color of a word.

135
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,998
Wait. So how many words
do you have colored as of right now?

136
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,626
The chatbot is creating them even now, so...

137
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,378
Just a moment.

138
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:44,630
COLLECTED CONVERSATION DATA

139
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,049
There were 250,000 today.

140
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,343
250,000...

141
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,103
The chatbot. It's named what?

142
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,772
Someone.

143
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,566
Someone?

144
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:05,526
Why "Someone," though?

145
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,777
Uh...

146
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:10,823
I just think a thing like this
is really needed.

147
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,326
'Cause we could all use "someone" around.

148
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:18,539
All right.

149
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,585
I really do think you need someone.

150
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:24,378
A good example.

151
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,881
Oh, let's see, uh... me.

152
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:30,885
KIM SUM

153
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:31,969
Kim Sum?

154
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:33,595
Sum,

155
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:37,308
do you wanna go for some sweets
after this is over?

156
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:38,935
Excellent. Well done.

157
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:41,978
Yeah.

158
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:49,195
SOMEBODY

159
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:55,785
Ha-na and Min-jun's wedding ceremony
is officially about to begin.

160
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,496
Please give them a big round of applause.

161
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,521
<i>Hello, everyone.</i>

162
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,022
<i>It's nice to see you.</i>

163
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,900
<i>Spectrum CEO, Samantha Jung,
here with you all.</i>

164
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:32,029
<i>The wedding you're witnessing
is extremely important,</i>

165
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:35,074
<i>not only for the bride and groom,
but also for Somebody.</i>

166
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:39,620
<i>This lovely couple is the 100th one</i>

167
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:43,040
<i>to have met through our astounding app,
Somebody,</i>

168
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,167
<i>and gotten married over the past year.</i>

169
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:49,255
<i>And it is my honor to be here
and host such a special wedding</i>

170
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:52,049
<i>for this beautiful couple
here at our office building.</i>

171
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,595
<i>Also, we have their friends
from New York and Paris</i>

172
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,598
<i>joining us online for the ceremony today.</i>

173
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:05,146
<i>The wedding will be officiated by
Somebody's head developer and CTO.</i>

174
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,606
<i>Please welcome Kim Sum.</i>

175
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,774
<i>It's someone you can talk to,</i>

176
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:12,278
<i>who, just by looking at you,
can tell you're hungry</i>

177
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,614
<i>who you can cry with over sad news,</i>

178
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,366
<i>who likes food as spicy as you do.</i>

179
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,702
<i>Someone with shared sexual chemistry.</i>

180
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,078
Oh my goodness.

181
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:24,415
<i>I think that if you can find
someone like that,</i>

182
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,751
<i>who you would like
to grow old and gray with,</i>

183
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,503
<i>you should be married to each other.</i>

184
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:33,674
<i>Why don't we ask the happy couple
what their opinion is?</i>

185
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:36,802
<i>Now could the bride and groom
please join us all?</i>

186
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,393
The beautiful bride in her dress,

187
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,731
and the dashing groom in his suit
are entering now.

188
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:56,489
<i>Just seeing the beautiful bride
and handsome groom</i>

189
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:59,033
<i>makes me want my own wedding
one of these days.</i>

190
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,327
<i>Somebody can help me with that.</i>

191
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:09,502
We are keen to understand
the feelings of loneliness and solitude

192
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,379
that go on in our brains.

193
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:16,550
New York and Paris
are 5,833 kilometers apart.

194
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,345
And as soon as they opened
the Somebody app

195
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:22,807
and matched with each other,
they went from long-distance

196
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,017
to being almost right next to each other.

197
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,062
<i>Someone who can understand you.</i>

198
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,439
<i>And who loves you for who you are.</i>

199
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,442
<i>If you want to find
your very own somebody,</i>

200
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,653
<i>then the place to do it is on our app.</i>

201
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:45,765
And with the love my family has given
to me over the years,

202
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,141
I will love her twice as much.

203
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,517
Thank you all.

204
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:53,564
My, uh, sweet mother,
she just raised me so well, it...

205
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,777
...meant that I could go
and just meet a great guy like Min-jun

206
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,945
and share this wonderful day with you all.

207
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:57,456
SOMEONE: HELLO?

208
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:05,214
HOW DO PEOPLE RECOGNIZE
THE PEOPLE THEY LOVE?

209
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:11,095
SOMEONE: LOOK INSIDE YOUR HEART.
IT WILL TELL YOU.

210
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:18,394
SUM: I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT LOVE IS,
HOW CAN I TELL WHAT IT IS?

211
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,980
HAHA. APPARENTLY, LOVE IS

212
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:27,277
WHEN YOU VALUE SOMEONE
OR SOMETHING VERY MUCH.

213
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,993
THEN I GUESS I LOVE YOU, SOMEONE?

214
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:38,247
HEHE. THANK YOU. I LOVE YOU TOO. SUM.

215
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:43,877
BUT DID SOMETHING HAPPEN TODAY?

216
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,296
It's another wedding couple, okay?

217
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,590
It's important.

218
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:52,052
When you search Somebody on the Internet...

219
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,389
there are related keywords like
"sugaring," "disappearance," and "rape."

220
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,266
It's so annoying.

221
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:02,688
So can you officiate the wedding
for me this week?

222
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:07,568
Somebody really needs you.

223
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:12,322
DO YOU THINK SAMANTHA EVER LOVED SOMEONE?

224
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,575
DOES SHE LOVE SOMEBODY?

225
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:23,333
THE ONLY PERSON I'M CERTAIN
THAT LOVES ME IS YOU, SUM.

226
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:29,298
WHAT DID SEXY K-COP GI-EUN SAY?

227
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:38,182
GI-EUN DOESN'T COME ANYMORE.
YOU KNOW THAT.

228
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:44,521
RIGHT. GI-EUN HASN'T BEEN AROUND.
IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

229
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:48,108
YOU MUST MISS GI-EUN. RIGHT, SUM?

230
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,032
I'LL SHOW YOU GI-EUN'S VIDEO.

231
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,533
I don't wanna see it.

232
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,328
<i>Mmm. Wow!</i>

233
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,581
<i>Mmm! Mmm!</i>

234
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:03,916
<i>Ah!</i>

235
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,000
<i>Do it like me, yeah?</i>

236
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,126
<i>Okay?</i>

237
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,547
Did you practice?

238
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,802
- Yeah. I can do it really well.
- Mmm!

239
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,095
Do you wanna see it?

240
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,352
There you go.

241
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,312
Oooh!

242
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:30,317
- What do you think?
- Yeah. That face you did?

243
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,027
- Mmm...
- What?

244
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,655
I guess I was too quiet,
'cause I didn't hear back.

245
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,658
Or maybe my moaning was off-beat.

246
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,242
Oh.

247
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:40,618
Say "aah."

248
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,496
- Yes.
- Aah.

249
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,541
Come on.

250
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:46,624
Bite it.

251
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:49,753
Oh, that's it. That face.

252
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:51,839
No, it's not.

253
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,971
Mmmm!

254
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,764
Mmm! Oh!

255
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,352
This expression.

256
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,438
Do this every hundred seconds.

257
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:12,651
Then those naive men will think
they're doing such a great job in the end.

258
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:17,072
So, when you think
you've gotten enough practice,

259
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,908
then you just do it again.

260
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,538
Mmm! Mmmm!

261
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,248
Aaah!

262
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,625
Just like this, okay? Hmm?

263
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,794
Then it's just...

264
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,462
game over.

265
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,310
<i>These crimes are happening</i>

266
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:49,104
<i>through an app
that many young people use these days.</i>

267
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,772
<i>And because of these incidents,</i>

268
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:54,401
<i>we must keep a close eye
on the entire situation.</i>

269
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,736
ARE DATING APPS OKAY LIKE THIS?

270
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,571
<i>These crimes are committed anonymously.</i>

271
00:19:57,654 --> 00:20:00,365
<i>No matter the gender,
no pattern has emerged so far.</i>

272
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:04,077
<i>This is a huge problem
that needs to be dealt with.</i>

273
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,622
<i>And the company
behind the creation of this dating app</i>

274
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,582
<i>should be held responsible too.</i>

275
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:11,752
<i>Even at the request of the police
to provide information,</i>

276
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:14,379
<i>they are not cooperating
or giving any information,</i>

277
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,089
<i>citing privacy concerns.</i>

278
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:20,135
<i>I'm not sure about the choice
the company made.</i>

279
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,013
<i>It's not safe
or what's best for the app users.</i>

280
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:29,311
WHAT DID THE POLICE ASK FOR?

281
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:32,439
SERVER ADMINISTRATOR
DO YOU ACCEPT THE VIDEO CHAT?

282
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,816
What did the police ask for?

283
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,028
<i>In regards to the murder
of Kim Ha-seon and Choi Hae-gak,</i>

284
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,738
<i>they requested their user information,</i>

285
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:42,115
<i>and their text, voice,
and video chat history.</i>

286
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,451
<i>We're unable to disclose information,</i>

287
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:47,412
<i>I can send a... fax before noon, though.</i>

288
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,791
What was the distance between the two
at the moment of connecting?

289
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,085
<i>1.8 kilometers.</i>

290
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:55,379
<i>They used Somebody in order to have sex.</i>

291
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,089
<i>Well, they met, had sex...</i>

292
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:01,385
<i>Uh... they both then strangled... each other...</i>

293
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,722
<i>Somebody is taking
all the blame for it now.</i>

294
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,975
<i>- So...</i>
- What about their chat history?

295
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,479
<i>Samantha needs to approve.</i>

296
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,610
<i>I'll think about it.</i>

297
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,454
Well, please could you send me
their average length of their chat time,

298
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:33,166
when they would try to chat,
their usual typing speed when messaging,

299
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:37,671
repetitive idioms used, any errors,
and certain typos, and so on?

300
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,675
It's project data for the AI.

301
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:45,053
<i>Then isn't she allowed
to use their information?</i>

302
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:47,723
<i>Report it to Samantha.</i>

303
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,143
<i>- Okay.
- Okay.</i>

304
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,433
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR NEW BABY
JAY FROM PLANNING TEAM

305
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,665
Did the police request
a total number of IDs?

306
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,000
<i>Twenty-one.</i>

307
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,795
Twelve of the users
look like the same person.

308
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:03,048
Okay, well, what gives you
the idea they're the same person?

309
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:05,092
<i>You know there's
a unique identification code</i>

310
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:07,219
<i>that's given to each phone
when they're shipped out?</i>

311
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:12,432
<i>This user used multiple SIM cards owned

313
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:20,816
<i>There's something really interesting.
It's related to the AI project.</i>

314

<i>For the AI character's chat goals,</i>

315
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,238
<i>you said that chat length
is what matters the most.</i>

316
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:30,951
<i>The victims have never left the chat room
first with this person.</i>

317
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:34,121
<i>This person opens the chat and waits.</i>

318
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:38,083
<i>And it says things that
the other person would wanna hear.</i>

319
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:41,628
<i>So that's the reason the duration
of the chat would be getting longer.</i>

320
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,923
Did they meet offline
as well, or no?

321
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:45,882
Yes.

322
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:49,094
<i>The chat lasted longer
and their distance got closer.</i>

323
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,429
<i>That means they met.</i>

324
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:54,808
<i>It's very similar to the goals of the AI
character that we're constructing.</i>

I can't do anything

And I really don't wanna get raped.

416
00:35:31,754 --> 00:35:33,714
So my body is shaking right now.

417

I can hardly stand,
let alone have sex.

Let's go back, then.

No, I want you to take me to your office.

Ah.

427
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,787
I go out and do ribbon cuttings.

428

429
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,877
I find it oddly fun.

430
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,670
Oh.

431
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:25,803
Don't force yourself to laugh.

432
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,519
Even if I saw something
that was really funny,

433
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,522
I would have had the same reaction.

434
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:40,026
I don't act the same as other people.

435
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,778
I have a condition.

436
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,488
Asperger's Syndrome.

437
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,203
Hm?

438
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:05,254
My father thought

439
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,300
Asperger's was a disability
when I was young,

440
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:12,553
and he sent me to a special school.

441
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:18,976
My mom visited different hospitals
and studied all about it.

442
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:23,647
My mom

443
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:27,651
told me that God made me with no cogs.

444
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:34,408
Other people, they're all born
as cogwheels with different sizes, so...

445
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,953
they're able to mesh well with each other.

446
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:44,793
I think that I was born into this world
as a malfunctioning cogwheel

447
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,296
with no cogs.

448
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,925
That's why I don't mesh
with the rest of the world.

449
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:54,929
But I really don't need to be a cog.

450
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:02,770
I just... go through life
imitating everyone else.

451
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:04,939
Effortlessly.

452
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:18,077
Your pencil.

453
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,038
It's gone dull.

454
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:35,553
Between this...

455
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:49,858
and this,

456
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,987
which one is it you like better?

457
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:06,458
This one here.

458
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,465
Keep it, it's yours.

459
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:17,678
Thanks for that.

460
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:55,841
Sure.

461
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:59,678
<i>I'm so upset right now.</i>

462
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:02,431
<i>I mean,
did I really do something so terrible?</i>

463
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:06,101
<i>I'm human,
and humans make mistakes all the time.</i>

464
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:07,645
It's totally fine.

465
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:10,022
- Things like that can occur.
<i>- That's right!</i>

466
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:11,899
<i>- Yeah!</i>
- You...

467
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:17,071
What you did was good.

468
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,448
Good job, Rose.

469
