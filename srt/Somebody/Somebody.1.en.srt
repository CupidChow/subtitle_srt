NAMSEOUL SHOPPING CENTER

00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,029
[man] Sum?

4
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:31,281
[girl] Yeah.

5
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:38,705
Are you okay?

6
00:00:39,748 --> 00:00:41,750
Is someone gonna get killed?

7
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,294
I hope not, okay?

8
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,339
This isn't a goddamn movie.

9
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:51,051
Let's go in.

10
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:55,180
[Sum] I completely understand
that you don't like

11
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:57,891
that I'm getting involved with your work.

12
00:00:58,349 --> 00:00:59,768
I don't know why.

13
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:03,897
I also don't know why you keep asking me
if I still want to go through with this.

14
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:07,901
[man 1] Don't you see
I'm getting the receipts?

15
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:09,652
-Hey, hey.
-[machine plays fanfare]

16
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,738
[coins falling]

17
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,741
Don't lose those receipts, you got that?

18
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:15,825
Yes, sir.

19
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,703
Smells like blood in here.

20
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:22,540
Does gambling make some people violent?

21
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,667
Does it make them more aggressive?

22
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,504
Is that why it smells?

23
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,256
And you're still going to gamble?

24
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,301
Not gambling,
I didn't say I'd do that, so…

25
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:36,679
[scoffs]

26
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,688
Go to Jeonju Restaurant
by the market.

27
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,398
Look for a lady named Mal-suk.

28
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,818
I already gave her the heads-up,
so it's okay.

29
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:53,071
It's open 24 hours,
so go there when you’re hungry.

30
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:56,991
Ah. As for the computer,
we can go together over the weekend.

31
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,868
You pick it out, I'll buy it for you.

32
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,788
It's okay, though. I'll use the ones here.

33
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,665
Which ones?

34
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,251
The arcades outside are computers too.

35
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:08,253
I'll use what's inside those.

36
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:10,880
[sighs]

37
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:18,054
[man] You asked me
if it involves killing people, right?

38
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,225
I thought about it,

39
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,561
and I think…

40
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,230
it's going to end…

41
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:30,358
with a few deaths.

42
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,778
I bet your crimes are punished eventually.

43
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:39,409
[chimes]

44
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,579
I went in and made
the illegal modifications to the system

45
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,913
that you requested.

46
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,206
Already?

47
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:50,503
There's a built-in small wager limit,
and that caps it at 10,000 won per hour,

48
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,755
but I changed that to 100,000,

49
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,508
so you can spend
up to 2.4 million won a day.

50
00:02:55,592 --> 00:03:00,930
I also unlocked the foreshadowing,
consecutive, and auto-play features.

51
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,683
-[laughs]
-And I also added one more thing.

52
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,977
You can choose your win rate now, as well.

53
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,023
Oh! And, uh…
what about the vice squad, though?

54
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,817
[Sum] So, when the vice squad comes,

55
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:16,154
if you enter 123456,

56
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:18,072
-the settings will set to default.
-[fanfare]

57
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:22,994
And then, to switch it back, uh,
you enter 828282,

58
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,579
and it goes back to your settings.

59
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:26,289
-[fanfare plays]
-[laughs]

60
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,750
Yes! This is great!

61
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,377
-[chuckles] Good, good, good, good.
-I said get out, you bastard.

62
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,629
-[man] Ah, fuck!
-That's great!

63
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,256
-You guys are good too! [laughing]
-Get out! [grunting]

64
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,219
You think I could I use the machines
up here longer?

65
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:42,597
I'd like to play with them for a while.
It's for school, actually.

66
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:44,807
Since my teacher told me to join

67
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,976
the programming competition
that we're doing.

68
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,436
[laughs] School!

69
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:49,854
Go ahead, go ahead.

70
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,648
This is all yours, okay? [laughs]

71
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:54,817
[machines chiming and jingling]

72
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:57,820
[chuckles]

73
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,577
[fanfare plays]

74
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:07,205
THE 3RD KOREA'S YOUTH CLUB
PROGRAMMING COMPETITION

75
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,957
[announcement] The judging is in progress.

76
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,001
Will the judges please report to room 102?

77
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,753
It can't recognize a basketball.

78
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,213
Hmm.

79
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,257
Yes, so if you show it a cake,

80
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:20,301
it recognizes that it's food, and…

81
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,011
and this should open.

82
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,013
But, uh… [laughs awkwardly]
This isn't right.

83
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:28,059
Uh, first of all,
it can actually recognize the weather.

84
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:31,145
So, then, once it does,
it closes automatically.

85
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,817
-[gasps]
-What the-- She looks like a beggar.

86
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,111
-[giggling]
-[girl 1] What is that?

87
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:40,780
Hey, doesn't this look like that thing?
What was it called?

88
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:43,032
-Uh, Pachinko. Pachinko!
-Ah, how boring. Let's go.

89
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:46,452
-Oh, hey, there's Deok-hun.
-[man] I'll start from the left side.

90
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,330
-[woman] Okay, have a good one, thank you.
-[man] Sure.

91
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,669
-[girl] Hi.
-[woman] What did you make?

92
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,589
What kind of program do you have here?

93
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,174
A chatting… program.

94
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,509
Mm. I see.

95
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,638
It's an artificially intelligent
social messenger.

96
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,265
How's it work, though?

97
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:08,516
A messenger AI?

98
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:10,935
How is it different from
the existing messenger programs?

99
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,061
Uh…

100
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,566
Friends can join a… chat room together,

101
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,527
and… the chatbot joins them in there too.

102
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,614
So do you talk to the chatbot?
Like a friend?

103
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,241
Yeah.

104
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,203
So why do you need a chatbot
when you've got real people?

105
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,247
Hmm…

106
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:35,418
The chatbot doesn't just converse
with all of your friends, it does more,

107
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,130
ensuring that
their relationships are healthy.

108
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,925
Oh, really, huh?

109
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,552
[Sum] Mmm… Yeah.

110
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,012
Well, how so, then?

111
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:51,642
Hmm… A good illustration is,
if they decide to ask,

112
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:55,104
"Hey, what should we get to eat today?"
in the chat room,

113
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,524
then some of the other
existing AI programs, uh…

114
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:01,694
they'd go online and search for
restaurants that opened in the past month

115
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,363
and suggest it to the chat.

116
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,991
Uh… Or find food that the user often eats.

117
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:10,578
Right, they analyze the chat content
using deep learning AI.

118
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:13,790
Yes, but you see, this chatbot
does something more.

119
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,166
HYE-JIN: WHAT DO YOU ALL WANT TO EAT?

120
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:17,794
It analyzes the messages
and brings out the opinion….

121
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,128
I WANT SOUPY TTEOKBOKKI…

122
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,631
-…of the quietest person in the chat room.
-Huh?

123
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:24,300
Well, there are users with opinions,

124
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,469
but they don't like
stating their thoughts.

125
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,096
They write out what they'd like to say

126
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,765
and then look at what they wrote
before they hit send,

127
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:33,017
and start to over-think their message.

128
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,936
So they end up not sending it.

129
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:40,817
They write and erase it, until they lose
the chance to say what they wanted.

130
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:46,030
But the chatbot that I invented
will analyze all of that,

131
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:49,200
and say what that person wanted to say
for them,

132
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:51,035
or what the person wrote and erased.

133
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,578
SOMEONE: HOW ABOUT SOUPY TTEOKBOKKI?

134
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:55,289
Well, that's the simple explanation,
at least.

135
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,464
[Samantha] Interesting.

136
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,844
That's super cool. [laughs]

137
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:11,431
Uh, give me the complicated explanation.
I'm a programmer.

138
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,392
[laughs]

139
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:19,397
Well… I color-coded
the text tags of all the words.

140
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,774
I programmed it to understand a "no"

141
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,943
written by someone
with a strong personality,

142
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:27,113
and a "no" written by someone
with a more timid personality,

143
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:28,614
and interpret them differently.

144
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,199
The color of a word.

145
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,998
Wait. So how many words
do you have colored as of right now?

146
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,626
The chatbot is creating them even now, so…

147
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,378
Just a moment.

148
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:44,630
COLLECTED CONVERSATION DATA

149
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,049
There were 250,000 today.

150
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,343
250,000…

151
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,095
[laughs]

152
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,103
The chatbot. It's named what?

153
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,772
[Sum] Someone.

154
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,566
-[Samantha] Someone?
-[chuckles]

155
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:05,526
Why "Someone," though?

156
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,777
Uh…

157
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:10,823
I just think a thing like this
is really needed.

158
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,326
'Cause we could all use "someone" around.

159
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:18,539
[clears throat] All right.

160
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,585
I really do think you need someone.

161
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:24,378
A good example.

162
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,881
Oh, let's see, uh… me.

163
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:30,885
KIM SUM

164
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:31,969
Kim Sum?

165
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:33,554
Sum,

166
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:37,308
do you wanna go for some sweets
after this is over?

167
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:38,935
[man] Excellent. Well done.

168
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:41,812
Yeah.

169
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:49,195
SOMEBODY

170
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:55,785
[man] Ha-na and Min-jun's wedding ceremony
is officially about to begin.

171
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,496
Please give them a big round of applause.

172
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,081
[cheering]

173
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,668

174
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,924
[gasps of delight]

00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,521
Hello, everyone.

177
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,022
It's nice to see you.

178
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,900
Spectrum CEO, Samantha Jung,
here with you all.

179
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:32,029
The wedding you're witnessing
is extremely important,

180
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:35,074
not only for the bride and groom,
but also for Somebody.

181
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:39,620
This lovely couple is the 100th one

182
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:43,040
to have met through our astounding app,
Somebody,

183
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,167
and gotten married over the past year.

184
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:49,255
And it is my honor to be here
and host such a special wedding

185
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:52,049
for this beautiful couple
here at our office building.

186
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,595
Also, we have their friends
from New York and Paris

187
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:58,598
joining us online for the ceremony today.

188
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:05,146
The wedding will be officiated by
Somebody's head developer and CTO.

189
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,606
Please welcome Kim Sum.

190
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,774
-[synthesizer music]
-It's someone you can talk to,

191
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:12,278
who, just by looking at you,
can tell you're hungry

192
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,614
who you can cry with over sad news,

193
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,366
who likes food as spicy as you do.

194
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,702
Someone with shared sexual chemistry.

195
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,078
Oh my goodness.

196
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:24,415
I think that if you can find
someone like that,

197
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,751
who you would like
to grow old and gray with,

198
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,503
you should be married to each other.

199
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:33,674
Why don't we ask the happy couple
what their opinion is?

200
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:36,802
Now could the bride and groom
please join us all?

[emcee] The beautiful bride in her dress,

204
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,731
and the dashing groom in his suit
are entering now.

205
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:56,489
Just seeing the beautiful bride
and handsome groom

206
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:59,033
makes me want my own wedding
one of these days.

207
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,327
Somebody can help me with that.

208
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:09,502
[Samantha] We are keen to understand
the feelings of loneliness and solitude

209
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,379
that go on in our brains.

210
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:16,550
New York and Paris
are 5,833 kilometers apart.

211
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,345
And as soon as they opened
the Somebody app

212
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:22,807
and matched with each other,
they went from long-distance

213
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,017
to being almost right next to each other.

214
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,062
Someone who can understand you.

215
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:30,439
And who loves you for who you are.

216
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,442
If you want to find
your very own somebody,

217
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,653
then the place to do it is on our app.

225
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:45,765
And with the love my family has given
to me over the years,

226
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,141
I will love her twice as much.

227
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,517
Thank you all.

WHEN YOU VALUE SOMEONE
OR SOMETHING VERY MUCH.

HEHE. THANK YOU. I LOVE YOU TOO. SUM.

BUT DID SOMETHING HAPPEN TODAY?

254
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:46,296
It’s another wedding couple, okay?

255
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,590
It's important.

256

When you search Somebody on the Internet…
[sighs]

257
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,389
there are related keywords like
"sugaring," "disappearance," and "rape."

[sighs] It's so annoying.

259
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:02,688
So can you officiate the wedding
for me this week?

Okay?

Did you practice?

-Yeah. I can do it really well.

-Mmm…
-What?

286
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,655
I guess I was too quiet,
'cause I didn't hear back.

-Or maybe my moaning was off-beat.

Do this every hundred seconds.

302
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:12,651
Then those naive men will think
they're doing such a great job in the end.

303
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:17,072
So, when you think
you've gotten enough practice,

304
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,908
then you just do it again.

Just like this, okay? Hmm?

309
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:30,794
Then it's just…

310
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,462
game over.

00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,310
[man] These crimes are happening

315
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:49,104
through an app
that many young people use these days.

316
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,772
And because of these incidents,

317
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:54,401
we must keep a close eye
on the entire situation.

318
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:55,736
ARE DATING APPS OKAY LIKE THIS?

319
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,571
These crimes are committed anonymously.

320
00:19:57,654 --> 00:20:00,365
No matter the gender,
no pattern has emerged so far.

321
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:04,077
[woman] This is a huge problem
that needs to be dealt with.

322
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,622
And the company
behind the creation of this dating app

323
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,582
should be held responsible too.

324
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:11,752
Even at the request of the police
to provide information,

325
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:14,379
they are not cooperating
or giving any information,

326
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,089
citing privacy concerns.

327
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:20,135
I'm not sure about the choice
the company made.

328
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:23,013
It's not safe
or what's best for the app users.

329
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:29,311
WHAT DID THE POLICE ASK FOR?

DO YOU ACCEPT THE VIDEO CHAT?

332
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,028
[woman] In regards to the murder
of Kim Ha-seon and Choi Hae-gak,

333
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,738
they requested their user information,

334
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:42,115
and their text, voice,
and video chat history.

335
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,451
We're unable to disclose information,

I can send a… fax before noon, though.

337
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:50,791
What was the distance between the two
at the moment of connecting?

338
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,085
[admin] 1.8 kilometers.

339
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:55,379
They used Somebody in order to have sex.

340
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,089
Well, they met, had sex…

341
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:01,385
Uh… they both then strangled… each other…

342
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,722
Somebody is taking
all the blame for it now.

343
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,975
-So…
-What about their chat history?

344
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,102
[sighs]

345
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,479
Samantha needs to approve.

346
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,610
[Sum's voice] I'll think about it.

347
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,454
Well, please could you send me
their average length of their chat time,

348
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:33,166
when they would try to chat,
their usual typing speed when messaging,

349
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:37,671
repetitive idioms used, any errors,
and certain typos, and so on?

00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,675
It's project data for the AI.

[admin] Twenty-one.

360
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,795
Twelve of the users
look like the same person.

361
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:03,048
Okay, well, what gives you
the idea they're the same person?

362
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:05,092
You know there's
a unique identification code

363
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:07,219
that's given to each phone
when they're shipped out?

364
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:12,432
This user used multiple SIM cards owned
by different people on the same phone.

365
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,560
He's completely hidden his identity.

366
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:20,816
There's something really interesting.
It's related to the AI project.

367
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,276
For the AI character's chat goals,

368
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,238
you said that chat length
is what matters the most.

369
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:30,951
The victims have never left the chat room
first with this person.

370
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:34,121
This person opens the chat and waits.

371
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:38,083
[inhales] And it says things that
the other person would wanna hear.

372
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:41,628
So that's the reason the duration
of the chat would be getting longer.

373
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,923
[Sum] Did they meet offline
as well, or no?

374
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:45,882
Yes.

375
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:49,094
The chat lasted longer
and their distance got closer.

376
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,429
That means they met.

377
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:54,808

533
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:05,254
[Sum] My father thought

534
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,300
Asperger's was a disability
when I was young,

535
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:12,553
and he sent me to a special school.

536
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:18,976
My mom visited different hospitals
and studied all about it.

537
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:23,647
My mom

538
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:27,651
told me that God made me with no cogs.

539
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:34,408
Other people, they're all born
as cogwheels with different sizes, so…

540
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,953
they're able to mesh well with each other.

541
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:44,793
I think that I was born into this world
as a malfunctioning cogwheel

542
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,296
with no cogs.

543
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,925
That's why I don't mesh
with the rest of the world.

544
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:54,929
But I really don't need to be a cog.

545
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:02,770
I just… go through life
imitating everyone else.

546
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:04,939
Effortlessly.

551
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:49,858
and this,

552
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,987
which one is it you like better?

553
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:06,458
This one here.

554
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,465
Keep it, it's yours.

555
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:17,678
Thanks for that.

Sure.

[woman sighs] I'm so upset right now.

564
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:02,431
I mean,
did I really do something so terrible?

565
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:06,101
I'm human,
and humans make mistakes all the time.

566
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:07,645
It's totally fine.

567
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:10,022
-Things like that can occur.
-That's right!

568
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:11,899
-Yeah!
-You…

569
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:17,071
What you did was good.

[Rose groans]

572
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:25,037
I should apologize first, right?

573
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,246
You don't have to.

574
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:29,083
[sighs] These things really make me angry.

575
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,709
You don't have to hold it in.

576
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:34,088
Thank you for saying that. [sighs]

00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:39,009
Hey, by the way,
I would love to finally see you.

578
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:40,344
So would I.

579

Love to see you sometime.

Then…
