1
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:23,690
Hey, I really just can't. I can't.

2
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:25,567
Let's go clubbing, okay?

3
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:30,196
- What?
- I wanna drink some whiskey too.

4
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:32,949
And dance to get rid of all this energy.

5
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,702
Don't you think Gi-eun might want
to take a bath

6
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:38,329
and warm herself up inside
instead of going out?

7
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,041
Oh, no.

8
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,877
I can get warm under the club lights.
Let's go.

9
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:45,378
Sounds good.

10
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,047
Let's go, then.

11
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:58,600
SOMEBODY

12
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:18,078
- Why are you drinking so much?
- Aah!

13
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,537
Oh!

14
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,873
Oh! Aah!

15
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,041
Cheers.

16
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,168
Me too?

17
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,504
Hey, get out of my way!

18
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:31,925
Is she okay?

19
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,720
Hey! I survived!

20
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,555
Let's dance.

21
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,689
Whoo!

22
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,443
Hey, Kim Sum.

23
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:13,299
<i>Hey.</i>

24
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,384
It's me.

25
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,889
Euljiro development site.

26
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,725
You need to go there right now.

27
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,317
There is a dead body near a restaurant.

28
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,364
But hey, I didn't die, so...

29
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,412
Mok-won.

30
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:44,914
Oh?

31
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,749
Lock the door when you leave.

32
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,709
Thank you, Tae-u.

33
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,419
Don't drink too much.

34
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,004
Do you...

35
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,674
know what was the hardest thing
after the accident?

36
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:59,512
I did everything in rehab
to get my legs working again, but...

37
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,183
my mom cried just looking at me.

38
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,811
She cried
when I was exercising like crazy.

39
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:10,899
She would cry when I used to scream at her
about how I didn't want to go on.

40
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,777
And when I went to Eun-pyeong after it all

41
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:18,198
and yelled at him,
saying that I'd overcome this

42
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:21,075
and that I want him
to keep my position unoccupied,

43
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,954
she cried because of how pitiful I looked.

44
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:26,623
Shit.

45
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,127
I was the best at ruining her life,
seriously.

46
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,965
At least I survived today,
but, hoooo-ly shit!

47
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,551
If Mom found out.

48
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,930
Don't say anything. 'Kay?

49
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,515
- You got that?
- We won't, we won't.

50
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:50,313
As I crawled
out of the development district

51
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,315
and took the cold air...

52
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,527
...into my lungs...

53
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:03,618
...I was wondering, "What kind of person
would that bastard's mother be?"

54
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,747
Bet his mother wasn't
always crying all the time.

55
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,835
Maybe he was neglected
when he was a little kid?

56
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,923
'Cause that might explain how this guy...

57
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,426
could turn into... such a psycho.

58
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:26,057
Was it really a lot better to have a...
mom who cries for me?

59
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:27,892
Hmm.

60
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,230
So...

61
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,609
you think,

62
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,862
if his parents had raised
their kid and loved him right,

63
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:43,116
then this guy could've ended up
actually being somewhat okay?

64
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,200
Mm-hm.

65
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:48,037
Hey, you recall
when I constructed that shrine?

66
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:49,998
My mom and I lived together

67
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:53,209
because she was helping me do it,
all day and night.

68
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,546
And when she fell asleep,
I would go sneak out to clubs with a girl.

69
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,132
Jeez. You bad girl.

70
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:02,927
But when I came home drunk in the morning,
she was already cooking breakfast for me

71
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:08,433
What I'm saying is, even
if your parents give you a lot of love,

72
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,518
people can't change who they are.

73
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,687
No, they don't want to change.

74
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:19,736
Anyway, that's just my opinion
on everything going on, so...

75
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,156
And Gi-eun, I have to ask a question.

76
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,950
Why do you keep bringing things up
that soften our hearts?

77
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,415
Okay, listen to me.

78
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,750
So now...

79
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:39,255
we are going to use that
to catch the little prick.

80
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,174
Use what, though, Gi-eun?

81
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:44,093
We're going to catch him
with the concept of motherhood?

82
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,346
Mmm. Motherhood.

83
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:50,183
Did he tell you about his mother?

84
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,810
How do you even know all this?

85
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,105
So who will act as his mother, though?

86
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,357
Fuck.

87
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,027
Hmm. Mom?

88
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,410
Okay, I got it.

89
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,706
First, I'll write a talisman
that will lure the man to us.

90
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,750
- Huh?
- And...

91
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,628
as for that talisman...

92
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,548
- Huh?
- Let's put it on Sum.

93
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,303
A talisman? What?

94
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,387
Yeah.

95
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:31,932
And?

96
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,186
Sum, do you accept?

97
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,896
Mmm...

98
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,689
I can't be the mom.

99
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:39,899
Ah, no!

100
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:43,236
That's exactly why
the talisman is going on you.

101
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,115
Hey, Kim Sum.

102
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:51,828
You two are definitely not alike at all.

103
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,413
He's different?

104
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,914
Let's get sober,

105
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,708
then, tomorrow, we crush this guy.

106
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,838
Now, we need a good idea
so we can trap him like a rat.

107
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,590
That's all you need to think about, okay?

108
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,674
Okay.

109
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,219
Bring 'em in.

110
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,477
I need more time
to think about this.

111
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,243
EULJIRO 4TH DISTRICT

112
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,832
This is driving me nuts, seriously.

113
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:41,586
I told you to stop
because we need to secure the crime scene.

114
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,588
You can't continue
with the demolition here.

115
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,673
I'm telling you that we stopped!

116
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:47,516
You're keeping me here
till such a late hour.

117
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,677
- You should be apologizing to me.
- Jeez.

118
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,721
FORENSICS

119
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:52,930
Sir! I found it.

120
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:58,019
- Detective, take a look.
- Did you find it?

121
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,398
Oh, no...

122
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,699
What's up?

123
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,701
<i>Gi-eun.</i>

124
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:19,373
So I've been thinking about it,
and I thought I should tell you, so...

125
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:24,086
The guy you met at the pool.

126
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:28,341
<i>I think he's Sum's boyfriend.</i>

127
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,470
Well, why do you think that?

128
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,265
Did you sense it with your powers?

129
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:40,520
<i>I asked the General and he showed me.</i>

130
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,230
<i>I definitely saw it.</i>

131
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,530
There are a lot of grudgeful
spirits around him.

132
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,951
The smell of incense won't go away.

133
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,204
He's dangerous.

134
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,831
Really dangerous.

135
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:22,937
Hmm.

136
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,904
SEOUL SANGDONG POLICE STATION

137
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,288
Gi-eun.

138
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,832
What? Damn it.

139
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,458
Hey, thanks for the gift box...

140
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,752
By the... by the way, what happened to you?

141
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,170
What the...

142
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,840
- What?
- Move out of the way for a second.

143
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,429
Does that car have a handicap sticker?

144
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:57,763
- This one?
- Look.

145
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,018
- I don't think it does.
- It doesn't, right?

146
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,979
Damn it!

147
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,690
Ugh, what kind of an asshole...

148
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,943
What kind of a thoughtless bastard
parked in the handicap spot?

149
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,278
Damn idiots!

150
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,614
There were
no fingerprints on the body.

151
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:19,035
The autopsy report. It says that
she was strangled to death that day,

152
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,370
but there's nothing there, so...

153
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,790
Also, her spine was completely broken.

154
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,085
This isn't your average psycho.

155
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:31,714
But why did you go there, huh?

156
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,158
You didn't just stumble into that?

157
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:43,434
BODY FOUND DURING DEMOLITION
OF EULJIRO REDEVELOPMENT SITE

158
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:51,525
Huh.

159
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,330
Hi.

160
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,016
Uh...

161
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,901
You just barged in here
without any kind of warning?

162
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,112
You should say thanks.

163
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,281
I'm just doing you a favor, you know.

164
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:42,493
What do you mean? And tell the truth.

165
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,208
I was waiting patiently
for you to see he's our guy.

166
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:52,461
Or maybe you're just
pretending that he's not because...

167
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,256
you want to believe he's not.

168
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,300
Do you feel like you'll die without him?

169
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:01,387
It's really enough
to put your own life at risk, is it?

170
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,182
It's not him, I said that.

171
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,059
And I can prove it.

172
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:08,685
Ah!

173
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:12,940
You guys were curious about his mom.
I might be able to ask him about that.

174
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:15,609
Hey, Kim Sum.

175
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,779
YUN-O

176
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:27,580
<i>Hello? What's up?
You don't ever call at this time.</i>

177
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:30,916
Can I... ask you a question?

178
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,001
<i>Ah...</i>

179
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,503
<i>- What is it?</i>
- Yun-o.

180
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,255
You know how...

181
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:40,885
I told you my mom said I was born
a cog wheel, but with no cogs?

182
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,970
<i>Uh, yeah. What about it, Sum?</i>

183
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,765
What was your mom like, Yun-o?

184
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:51,228
<i>Well, uh... she was...</i>

185
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,730
<i>...a total tiger mom.</i>

186
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,858
<i>I took private lessons three times a week.</i>

187
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:59,069
<i>She would take me around
on ten-minute intervals.</i>

188
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,489
<i>She was always next to me.</i>

189
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,785
That makes me so happy.

190
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,372
<i>Ah, my mom</i>...

191
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,291
<i>was hard to handle.</i>

192
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,044
Oh, I'm so sorry.

193
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,548
<i>Oh, and was it Samantha?</i>

194
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,592
<i>I got a call from Spectrum.</i>

195
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:25,513
<i>She said she wants to renovate
the building and build an extension.</i>

196
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,848
- Samantha said that?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

197
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:31,227
<i>So I'm going to go visit Spectrum soon.</i>

198
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,231
Oh, well, I'll see you later, then.

199
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,358
<i>Yeah, I'll see you then.</i>

200
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,913
Happy now? Please leave.

201
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,167
Is it left or right?

202
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,044
What are you doing?

203
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,632
Should I ask the General?

204
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:05,302
Spectrum's General Kim Sum, please guess.

205
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,388
Left? Or is it right?

206
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,641
I don't get why you're being this way.

207
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,853
Why the ritual?

208
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,647
What did you want from it?

209
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:22,278
You could've checked in on him
if you wanted.

210
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,280
Somebody's yours, after all.

211
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,283
Why aren't you doing it?

212
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,743
Or maybe it's already done?

213
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,208
- Left.
- What?

214
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:43,966
My left?

215
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,052
Or...

216
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,975
Want it back, then?

217
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,645
What if the General wasn't with you,

218
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,356
and if you weren't a shaman?

219
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:05,404
You could meet people
and live the happy life that you want.

220
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,908
That's what I'm doing right now.

221
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:14,121
I really don't want you risking
your life over him, understand?

222
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,706
You don't have to fret.

223
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,793
Everyone on Earth will
be punished for their sins.

224
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,592
I will go as far as I want.

225
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,898
I'm taking this.

226
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,788
LIGHT AND SHADOW, I LIKE THEM ALL

227
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:51,695
<i>What's wrong?</i>

228
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:53,864
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

229
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,200
<i>No.</i>

230
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:57,951
<i>Are...</i>

231
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,369
17: DO IT.

232
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:00,746
<i>...you okay now?</i>

233
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:01,747
VIDEO CHAT

234
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,499
MY NUMBER.
I WANT TO HEAR YOUR VOICE.

235
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,167
<i>There anything I can do?</i>

236
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:07,920
<i>I'll do whatever.</i>

237
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,671
SOMEBODY SERVER

238
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,757
<i>There's someone I want to find.</i>

239
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,219
<i>Why find this person?</i>

240
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,638
<i>When I think about it,</i>

241
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,682
<i>I hate them so much
that I want to kill them.</i>

242
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,644
<i>But then,
they seem to know me really well.</i>

243
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,855
<i>So that's why I want to find them.</i>

244
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,774
<i>I'm jealous.</i>

245
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,359
<i>I am.</i>

246
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:35,864
<i>But if you ask me to help you, I will.</i>

247
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,035
<i>Should I go there now?</i>

248
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,037
Huh?

249
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:46,542
<i>No. I have something to do
right now, actually.</i>

250
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,378
<i>I'll see you another time.</i>

251
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:05,811
You...

252
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,982
bother me too much.

253
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,068
I have to do something.

254
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,504
<i>Yun-o is supposed
to come to the office tomorrow.</i>

255
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:36,508
<i>If you're that curious,
you guys can come and see for yourselves.</i>

256
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:39,845
<i>What are you going to do?</i>

257
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:48,562
Then I guess I'll go to Spectrum tomorrow.

258
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,106
Hmm.

259
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,569
Mm-hm.

260
00:19:58,614 --> 00:19:59,614
Okay.

261
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,867
We'll see each other then.

262
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,880
This is like a strange love triangle.

263
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,633
Gi-eun, Sum, and that bastard.

264
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,636
Then what are you?

265
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,473
Me?

266
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:32,314
You know, even <i>The Three Musketeers</i>
is about four people.

267
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,777
Then what does that make you?

268
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:43,075
I'm the one
who's attached to you at the hip.

269
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,452
Mmm!

270
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,160
- Uh...
- Shall we go in?

271
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,318
Thank you.

272
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:03,905
All right.
This is the Spectrum Hall entrance.

273
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,908
- Oh!
- Thank you for coming, Mr. Seong Yun-o.

274
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,411
Yeah. It's my pleasure.

275
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:13,540
And what is special at Spectrum is that
our office is clear and unrestricted.

276
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:18,128
It's very different from other
common offices with partitioned cubicles.

277
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:20,756
Ah! Here's something interesting.

278
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,216
This is a candy bar

279
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,511
that shows how employees feel
at the beginning of the day.

280
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,182
They place their candy
in a container on the wall,

281
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:32,476
and that represents how they feel today,

282
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,686
whether it be anger,
happiness, sadness, or whatever.

283
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,021
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

284
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,606
Then can I...

285
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,859
take one of these, is that okay?

286
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:42,486
Are you afraid of something?

287
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:44,196
No!

288
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,699
Ah. We also have a bar there.
Would you like a cup of tea?

289
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,618
- Sure.
- Let's go.

290
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:04,049
Uh, if I may be completely honest,

291
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:06,732
I hope we can see each other
more often now that you have visited.

292
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:08,719
Yeah.

293
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:13,892
Uh, also, uh... Just a moment. U-cheol?

294
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:15,811
Yes?

295
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:16,978
Let's talk more soon.

296
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,439
- Uh, this is chief of operations.
- Ah.

297
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,066
- Ah.
- And this is Mr. Seong Yun-o.

298
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,335
- Ah, I see.
- Nice to meet you.

299
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:25,278
- Nice to meet you.
- Contact him for all general issues.

300
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:28,323
- Along with anything else operational.
- Ah, okay.

301
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:32,661
- Here's my card. Feel free to contact me.
- Uh, yes, thank you.

302
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,788
- Thank you.
- Of course.

303
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,380
Mmm.

304
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:47,634
So then, are we done
with our discussion for today?

305
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:49,803
Got places to go?

306
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:54,015
Well it's just that there's this friend...
She actually works here with you.

307
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,934
- Oh, you don't say?
- Yeah.

308
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,603
And who's your friend?

309
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,772
Her name's Kim Sum.

310
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,151
Our CTO, Kim Sum, really?

311
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,528
Yes, uh... so we're going to meet afterward.

312
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:07,611
Oh!

313
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:12,284
Well, we're done talking for now.
Do you want me to show you to her office?

314
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,703
- Oh, I'd appreciate that.
- Let's go.

315
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:15,912
Okay.

316
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:21,793
Ah.

317
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:22,878
Here.

318
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:28,300
I'm pretty sure
this isn't my friend's office, so...

319
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,012
I thought you and I were friends also.

320
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,934
As a friend, I'd like us to talk.

321
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:41,605
Can you talk with me for a bit
and then go meet with Kim Sum?

322
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,233
Yeah, sure.

323
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:47,319
Ah. Let's go in.

324
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,365
Ah, you can sit right here.

325
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:04,669
Hm.

326
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:08,548
You used the phone
of the missing graduate student Oh Na-eun

327
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:12,093
to create an account
under the username Agape.

328
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:18,266
Sending messages to four hooded men,
inviting these guys to the Culture Center.

329
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:25,440
Shall we put this up on that wall
so we can get a good look?

330
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:28,485
Sum can discuss this up here with us.

331
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:36,201
What I'm saying is,
I want you to stop seeing Sum.

332
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:39,955
I don't want to hand over personal
information to the authorities,

333
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,624
since it won't look good
for the organization either.

334
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,795
I don't care who you meet

335
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:48,964
or what you do with them.

336
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,715
I can give you protection.

337
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,885
It's useful to us, got it?

338
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,137
So...

339
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,890
stay inside that boundary.

340
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:01,935
With one condition.

341
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:05,605
Stop all of your communication
with Kim Sum.

342
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:11,736
Then, I think us two will start...
a great friendship.

343
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,613
How does that sound to you? Huh?

344
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:22,997
Are you...

345
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,501
really going to tell her?

346
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,630
I'll decide based on how you act.

347
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,135
Uh...

348
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:36,761
You shouldn't tell her.

349
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,139
Then...

350
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,100
don't meet her ever again.

351
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:43,643
Hmm.

352
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:52,526
I mean...

353
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,531
Sum knows already.

354
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,248
Aah!

355
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:28,707
Is Sum...

356
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,210
yours?

357
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:35,714
Yes, she is.

358
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,134
She's not an adult yet.

359
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:43,263
That's why she's so valuable.
I have to protect her.

360
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:48,977
If we lose her, then Somebody
will fall with her. Do you want that?

361
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,990
If there is no Somebody,

362
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,075
Sum will be free then.

363
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:06,326
No.

364
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:11,458
Somebody is Sum's everything.

365
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,567
Sum's freedom...

366
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,407
Does she know Agape?

367
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:49,621
You have to be lying.

368
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:01,716
KIM SUM: HEADING OUT NOW.
I WILL SHOW YOU.

369
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:05,261
GI-EUN: I DON'T THINK IT'S THE SAME GUY
OH, I DON'T KNOW!

370
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,596
BE CAREFUL ANYWAY

371
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:10,099
STAND BY, I'LL SEND YOU A PICTURE

372
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,026
Yes, this is Yeong Gi-eun.

373
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,945
<i>Gi-eun, did you see the picture?</i>

374
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,947
No, that's not the guy.

375
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:07,949
<i>This isn't him?</i>

376
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,159
<i>Uh...</i>

377
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:13,413
Hey, that's Sum's boyfriend?

378
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:16,374
<i>She came out with him, arm in arm.
I'm hanging up.</i>

379
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:17,542
Yes?

380
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:44,694
<i>Yun-o. Listen to me carefully.</i>

381
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:47,363
Someone is outside waiting for you.

382
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,034
She's the shaman
that you were on the phone with.

383
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:54,037
<i>What should we do?</i>

384
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,697
Have a seat.

385
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:31,616
Okay.

386
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:33,952
Uh...

387
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:40,375
Listen. If you take
a single step outside this room,

388
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:43,878
I will kill you.

389
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:54,346
Look.

390
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:58,226
I'll use something like this to kill you.

391
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,313
Cut you into chunks

392
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,774
and put you in a safe.

393
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:09,570
Got it?

394
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,824
Yes, yes.

395
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:39,559
LIEN BEING EXERCISED, CRIMINAL CHARGES
WILL BE FILED FOR OBSTRUCTION

396
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:32,171
- Have you been well?
- Not really.

397
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,384
All right, then.

398
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,598
I am well, so...

399
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:49,397
It was snowing hard when I heard that...
you were in a jail cell.

400
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,358
NIV ENGLISH-KOREAN STUDY BIBLE

401
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:55,862
I thought you were locked up
because of the gambling den,

402
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:57,613
so I went looking for you.

403
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,283
I went to Jeonju Restaurant.

404
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,661
There were forsythias. It was spring.

405
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:10,501
The lady there told me that you went
to prison because you killed someone, so...

406
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,426
Mm-hm.

407
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:22,597
Did that person
really deserve to die, though?

408
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,515
No.

409
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:31,105
Then it's okay to die when
you commit a terrible crime?

410
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:39,780
People face the consequences
for their crimes. You said that.

411
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:49,874
Can you forget those you killed?

412
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,001
Like everything else you do?

413
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:55,463
No, I can't.

414

Hello.

418
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,367
What's with the QR code outside?

419
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,495
- Oh, it's for that app Somebody.
- "Somebody"?

420
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,834
It's a really popular
dating app these days.

421
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:15,918
Oh, really?

422
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,963
Upload a picture
of you working out.

423
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,216
You'll have tons of matches
in just, like, a minute.

424
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,843
Oh, she's so pretty.

425
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,221
Mmm, so you're into
this type of woman.

426
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,472
Yes.

427
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:31,076
- Okay, come on.
- Let's move on to the next one.

428
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,144
Look at you,
getting all excited.

429
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:35,730
- I don't want to look at guys.
- Okay, okay.

430
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:37,982
- Mmm.
- Oh, she's so hot.

431
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:40,026
Your taste in women
is different to mine.

Uh...

456
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:21,705

Wow.
