Hey, I really just can't. I can't.

3
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:25,567
Let's go clubbing, okay?

[whimpers]

5
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:30,196
-What?
-I wanna drink some whiskey too.

6
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:32,949
And dance to get rid of all this energy.

7
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,702
Don't you think Gi-eun might want
to take a bath

8
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:38,329
and warm herself up inside
instead of going out?

9
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,041
Oh, no.

10
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,877
I can get warm under the club lights.
Let's go.

11
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:45,378
[Mok-won] Sounds good.

12
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,047
Let's go, then.

13
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:58,600

-[Mok-won] Why are you drinking so much?
-Aah!

16
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,537
Oh!

17
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,873
Oh! Aah!

18
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,041
Cheers.

19
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,168
-Me too?
-[Gi-eun laughs]

20
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,504
Hey, get out of my way!

21
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:28,922
[laughing]

22
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:31,925
Is she okay?

23
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:35,720
Hey! I survived!

24
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,555
Let's dance.

26
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,689

00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,443

[Bul-gwang] Hey.

31
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,384
It's me.

32
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,889
Euljiro development site.

33
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,725
You need to go there right now.

34
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,317
There is a dead body near a restaurant.

35
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,364
But hey, I didn't die, so…

36
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,119
[hangs up]

37
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,329

38
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:44,914
Oh?

39
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,749
Lock the door when you leave.

40
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:47,709
Thank you, Tae-u.

41
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,419
[Tae-u] Don't drink too much.

42
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,004
Do you…

43
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,674
know what was the hardest thing
after the accident?

44
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:59,512
I did everything in rehab
to get my legs working again, but…

45
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,183
my mom cried just looking at me.

46
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,811
She cried
when I was exercising like crazy.

47
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:10,899
She would cry when I used to scream at her
about how I didn't want to go on.

48
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,777
And when I went to Eun-pyeong after it all

49
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:18,198
and yelled at him,
saying that I'd overcome this

50
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:21,075
and that I want him
to keep my position unoccupied,

51
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,954
she cried because of how pitiful I looked.

52
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:26,623
Shit.

53
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,127
I was the best at ruining her life,
seriously.

54
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,046
[laughs]

55
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,965
At least I survived today,
but, hoooo-ly shit!

56
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,551
If Mom found out.

57
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:39,719
[sniffles]

58
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,930
Don't say anything. 'Kay?

59
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,515
-You got that?
-We won't, we won't.

60
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:46,768
[Gi-eun groans]

61
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:50,313
As I crawled
out of the development district

62
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,315
and took the cold air…

63
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,067
[inhales]

64
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,527

[exhales]

66
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:03,618
…I was wondering, "What kind of person
would that bastard's mother be?"

67
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,747
Bet his mother wasn't
always crying all the time.

68
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,835
Maybe he was neglected
when he was a little kid?

69
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,923
'Cause that might explain how this guy…

70
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,426
could turn into… such a psycho.

71
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:26,057
Was it really a lot better to have a…
mom who cries for me?

72
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:27,892
Hmm.

73
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,230
So…

74
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,609
you think,

75
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,862
if his parents had raised
their kid and loved him right,

76
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:43,116
then this guy could've ended up
actually being somewhat okay?

77
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,200
Mm-hm.

78
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:48,037
Hey, you recall
when I constructed that shrine?

79
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:49,998
My mom and I lived together

80
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:53,209
because she was helping me do it,
all day and night.

81
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,546
And when she fell asleep,
I would go sneak out to clubs with a girl.

82
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,132
[sighing] Jeez. You bad girl.

83
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:02,927
But when I came home drunk in the morning,
she was already cooking breakfast for me

84
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,345
[sighs]

85
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:08,433
What I'm saying is, even
if your parents give you a lot of love,

86
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,518
people can't change who they are.

87
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,687
No, they don't want to change.

88
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:19,736
Anyway, that's just my opinion
on everything going on, so…

89
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,156
And Gi-eun, I have to ask a question.

90
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,950
Why do you keep bringing things up
that soften our hearts?

91
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,994
[both laugh]

92
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,415
[Gi-eun] Okay, listen to me.

93
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,750
So now…

94
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:39,255
we are going to use that
to catch the little prick.

95
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,174
Use what, though, Gi-eun?

96
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:44,093
We're going to catch him
with the concept of motherhood?

97
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,346
[Gi-eun] Mmm. Motherhood.

98
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:50,183
-[sighs]
-Did he tell you about his mother?

99
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,810
How do you even know all this?

100
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,105
So who will act as his mother, though?

101
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,357
Fuck.

102
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,027
Hmm. Mom?

103
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,410
[sighs] Okay, I got it.

104
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,706
First, I'll write a talisman
that will lure the man to us.

105
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,750
-Huh?
-And…

106
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,628
as for that talisman…

107
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,548
-Huh?
-Let's put it on Sum.

00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:23,549

109
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,303
A talisman? What?

110
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,304
Yeah.

111
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:31,849
And?

112
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,186
[Mok-won] Sum, do you accept?

113
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:36,896
[Sum] Mmm…

114
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,689
I can't be the mom.

00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:39,899
Ah, no!

116
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:43,236
That's exactly why
the talisman is going on you.

117
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,115

118
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:51,828
You two are definitely not alike at all.

123
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,838
Now, we need a good idea
so we can trap him like a rat.

124
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,590
That's all you need to think about, okay?

125
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,633
Okay.

126
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,219

You didn't just stumble into that?

181
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:43,434
BODY FOUND DURING DEMOLITION
OF EULJIRO REDEVELOPMENT SITE

182
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,690
[murmuring]

183
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:51,525
Huh.

184
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,330
Hi.

185
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:17,760
[sighs]

186
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,016
-Uh…
-[Mok-won exhales]

187
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,901
You just barged in here
without any kind of warning?

188
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,112
You should say thanks.

189
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,281
I'm just doing you a favor, you know.

190
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:42,493
What do you mean? And tell the truth.

191
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,497
[sighs]

192
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,208
I was waiting patiently
for you to see he’s our guy.

193
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:52,461
Or maybe you're just
pretending that he's not because…

194
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,256
you want to believe he's not.

195
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,300
Do you feel like you'll die without him?

196
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:01,387
It's really enough
to put your own life at risk, is it?

197
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,182
It's not him, I said that.

198
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,059
And I can prove it.

199
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:08,519
Ah!

200
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:12,940
You guys were curious about his mom.
I might be able to ask him about that.

201
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:15,609
Hey, Kim Sum.

202
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:18,779
YUN-O

203
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,531
[ringing tone on speaker]

204
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:27,580
Hello? What's up?
You don't ever call at this time.

205
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:30,916
Can I… ask you a question?

206
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,001
Ah… [chuckles]

207
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,503
-What is it?
-Yun-o.

208
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,255
You know how…

209
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:40,885
I told you my mom said I was born
a cog wheel, but with no cogs?

210
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,970
Uh, yeah. What about it, Sum?

211
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,765
What was your mom like, Yun-o?

212
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:51,228
Well, uh… she was… [sighs]

213
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,730
…a total tiger mom.

214
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,858
I took private lessons three times a week.

215
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:59,069
She would take me around
on ten-minute intervals.

216
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,489
She was always next to me.

217
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:02,907
[Sum laughs]

218
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,785
That makes me so happy.

219
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:08,496
[Yun-o laughs]

220
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,372
Ah, my mom…

221
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,291
was hard to handle.

222
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,044
Oh, I'm so sorry.

223
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,548
Oh, and was it Samantha?

224
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,592
I got a call from Spectrum.

225
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:25,513
She said she wants to renovate
the building and build an extension.

226
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,848
-Samantha said that?
-Yeah.

227
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:31,227
So I'm going to go visit Spectrum soon.

228
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,231
Oh, well, I'll see you later, then.

229
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,358
Yeah, I'll see you then.

230
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:39,902
[hangs up]

231
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,913
Happy now? Please leave.

232
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,167
Is it left or right?

233
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,044
What are you doing?

234
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,632
Should I ask the General?

235
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:05,302
Spectrum's General Kim Sum, please guess.

236
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,388
Left? Or is it right?

237
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,641
I don't get why you're being this way.

238
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,853
Why the ritual?

239
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,647
What did you want from it?

240
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:22,278
You could've checked in on him
if you wanted.

241
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,280
Somebody's yours, after all.

242
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,283
Why aren't you doing it?

243
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,743
Or maybe it's already done?

244
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,912
[sighs]

245
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,208
-Left.
-What?

246
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:43,966
My left?

247
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:47,970
Or…

248
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,975
Want it back, then?

249
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,645
What if the General wasn't with you,

250
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,356
and if you weren't a shaman?

251
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:05,404
You could meet people
and live the happy life that you want.

252
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,908
That's what I'm doing right now.

253
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:14,121
I really don't want you risking
your life over him, understand?

254
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,706
You don't have to fret.

255
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,793
Everyone on Earth will
be punished for their sins.

256
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,592
I will go as far as I want.

257
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,178
[clicking knife handle]

258
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,898
[sighs] I'm taking this.

259
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:42,775
[door opens]

260
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,819
[clicking knife handle]

261
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,738
[door closes]

262
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,283
[sighs]

263
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,760
[upbeat Korean pop song]

264
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,788
LIGHT AND SHADOW, I LIKE THEM ALL

265
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:51,695
[Yun-o] What's wrong?

266
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:53,864
Is something wrong?

267
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,200
[Sum] No.

268
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:57,951
Are…

269
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,369
17: DO IT.

270
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:00,746
…you okay now?

271
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:01,747
VIDEO CHAT

272
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,499
MY NUMBER.
I WANT TO HEAR YOUR VOICE.

273
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:05,167
There anything I can do?

274
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,585
[gasps]

275
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:07,920
I'll do whatever.

276
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,671
SOMEBODY SERVER

277
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,757
[Sum] There's someone I want to find.

278
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,219
[Yun-o] Why find this person?

279
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,638
[Sum] When I think about it,

280
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,682
I hate them so much
that I want to kill them.

281
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,644
But then,
they seem to know me really well.

282
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,855
So that's why I want to find them.

283
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,774
[Yun-o] I'm jealous.

284
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:29,900
[scoffs]

285
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,318
[Yun-o] I am.

286
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:35,864
-But if you ask me to help you, I will.
-[laughs]

287
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,035
[Yun-o] Should I go there now?

288
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,037
Huh?

289
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:46,542
[Sum] No. I have something to do
right now, actually.

290
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,378
I'll see you another time.

291
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:51,922
[breathing shakily]

292
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,384
[groans softly]

293
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,889
[gasping]

294
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:05,811
You…

295
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,982
bother me too much.

296
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,068
I have to do something.

297
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,696
[sighs]

298
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,504
[Sum] Yun-o is supposed
to come to the office tomorrow.

299
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:36,508
If you're that curious,
you guys can come and see for yourselves.

300
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:39,845
What are you going to do?

301
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:48,562
Then I guess I'll go to Spectrum tomorrow.

302
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,106
Hmm.

303
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,569
Mm-hm.

304
00:19:58,614 --> 00:19:59,531
Okay.

305
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,867
We'll see each other then.

306
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,544
[Mok-won gasps]

307
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,880
This is like a strange love triangle.

308
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,633
Gi-eun, Sum, and that bastard.

309
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,636
Then what are you?

310
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,390
Me?

311
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:32,314
You know, even The Three Musketeers
is about four people.

312
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,777
Then what does that make you?

313
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:43,075
I'm the one
who's attached to you at the hip.

314
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,910
[both laugh]

315
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,370
Mmm!

316
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,169
[underwater sounds]

317
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,150
-[Yun-o] Uh…
-[Samantha] Shall we go in?

318
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,318
[Yun-o] Thank you.

319
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:03,905
All right.
This is the Spectrum Hall entrance.

320
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,908
-Oh!
-Thank you for coming, Mr. Seong Yun-o.

321
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,411
-Yeah. It's my pleasure.
-[both chuckle]

322
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:13,540
And what is special at Spectrum is that
our office is clear and unrestricted.

323
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:18,128
It's very different from other
common offices with partitioned cubicles.

324
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:20,756
Ah! Here's something interesting. [laughs]

325
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,216
This is a candy bar

326
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,511
that shows how employees feel
at the beginning of the day.

327
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,182
They place their candy
in a container on the wall,

328
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:32,476
and that represents how they feel today,

329
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,686
whether it be anger,
happiness, sadness, or whatever.

330
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,021
-[Yun-o] Mmm.
-[Samantha] Mmm.

331
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,606
Then can I…

332
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,859
take one of these, is that okay?

333
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:42,486
Are you afraid of something?

334
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:44,196
-[laughing] No!
-[laughs]

335
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,699
Ah. We also have a bar there.
Would you like a cup of tea?

336
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,618
-[Yun-o] Sure.
-[Samantha] Let's go.

337
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:04,049
Uh, if I may be completely honest,

338
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:06,718
I hope we can see each other
more often now that you have visited.

339
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:08,553
Yeah.

340
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,138
[chuckles]

341
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:13,892
Uh, also, uh… Just a moment. U-cheol?

342
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:15,811
Yes?

343
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:16,978
Let's talk more soon.

344
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,439
-Uh, this is chief of operations.
-Ah.

345
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,066
-Ah.
-And this is Mr. Seong Yun-o.

346
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,275
-Ah, I see.
-Nice to meet you.

347
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:25,278
-Nice to meet you.
-Contact him for all general issues.

348
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:28,323
-Along with anything else operational.
-[U-cheol] Ah, okay.

349
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:32,661
-Here's my card. Feel free to contact me.
-Uh, yes, thank you.

350
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,788
-[Samantha] Thank you. [chuckles]
-Of course.

351
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,460
[Yun-o sighs]

352
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,380
-[chuckles]
-Mmm.

353
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:47,634
So then, are we done
with our discussion for today?

354
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:49,803
Got places to go?

355
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:54,015
Well it's just that there's this friend…
She actually works here with you.

356
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,934
-Oh, you don't say?

Her name's Kim Sum.

360
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:04,151
Our CTO, Kim Sum, really?

361
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,528
Yes, uh… so we're going to meet afterward.

362
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:07,571
Oh!

363
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:12,284
Well, we're done talking for now.
Do you want me to show you to her office?

-Oh, I'd appreciate that.

[Samantha] Ah.

367
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:22,878
Here.

368
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:28,300

this isn't my friend's office, so…

373
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:41,605
Can you talk with me for a bit
and then go meet with Kim Sum?

374
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,233
Yeah, sure.

to create an account
under the username Agape.

Shall we put this up on that wall
so we can get a good look?

385
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:28,485
Sum can discuss this up here with us.

[laughs]

387
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:36,201
What I'm saying is,
I want you to stop seeing Sum.

388
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:39,955
I don't want to hand over personal
information to the authorities,

389
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,624
since it won't look good
for the organization either.

390
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,795
I don't care who you meet

391
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:48,964
or what you do with them.

392
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,715
I can give you protection.

393
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,885
It's useful to us, got it?

394
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,137
So…

395
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,890
stay inside that boundary.

396
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:01,935
With one condition.

397
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:05,605
Stop all of your communication
with Kim Sum.

398
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:11,736
Then, I think us two will start…
a great friendship.

399

really going to tell her?

403
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,630
I'll decide based on how you act.

[sighing] Uh…

405
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:36,761
You shouldn't tell her.

406

Then…

407
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,100

yours?

418
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:35,714
Yes, she is.

419
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:39,134
She's not an adult yet.

420
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:43,263
That's why she's so valuable.
I have to protect her.

421

will fall with her. Do you want that?
