- There's something...
- Hey, Sum.

8
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,645
When I took a proper look at that photo

9
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,607
of you and your boyfriend, I could tell.

10
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:09,486
He's not your boyfriend.

11
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,032
Your type's the opposite.

12

You prefer taller.

I didn't think
you were going to meet up with limp David.

16
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,767
I can't believe
that you tracked him down by yourself.

17
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:48,899
I did it...

18
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,238
because I was so lonely.

19
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,281

want your fortune read?

you, Sum, and Wheelchair...

...are all friends.

72
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,764
So why are you
so interested in me?

73
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:00,766
Hm?

74
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,728
Why are you so interested
in Sum and Gi-eun at the moment?

75
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,312
Huh?

76
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,272
Why?

77
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,234
Are they yours?

78
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,285
Gi-eun smelled a bit like incense...

79
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,748
after she swam around with you.

80
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,750
And at Euljiro too.

81
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,336
Like she was dead.

82
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:31,756
She didn't die though.

83
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:37,803
Complaining?

84
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,225
I should have killed her?

85
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,694
And why do I have to go out of my way

86
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,572
to put something like that,

87
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:01,369
I don't even want to recycle it,
in a trash bag?

88
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,412
Wheelchair girl is...

89
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,418
Is so pathetic.

90
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:13,464
Why would I love someone
who's already broke?

91
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:14,715
I don't care.

92
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:15,799
Why?

93
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,968
Why is it I should care?

94
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,013
Sick fuck, you are.

95
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,894
I didn't know
you were curious about that.

96
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,355
Is that why

97
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,149
you followed me around?

98
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,318
Because I'm unfair?

99
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,487
If that's the case,

100
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,323
Sum is a waste of your energy too.

101
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,622
You're wrong.

102
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:50,418
She's the complete opposite
of that Wheelchair.

103
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:57,049
Sum is like a world that is perfect
even when it doesn't try to be.

104
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:02,805
People just make me sick,

105
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,016
who act, like,

106
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:10,187
refined, perfect, and elegant...

107
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,775
when, in fact, they're worthless.

108
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:19,572
Funny.

109
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:29,998
Hm.

110
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,213
Thanks for sharing.

111
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,842
Listening to you go on about her...

112
00:12:58,527 --> 00:12:59,612
You also...

113
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,866
have a world that you respect,

114
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,661
so I'm assuming you can understand me.

115
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:16,878
I hope...

116
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,221
I hope...

117
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,978
we don't get on each other's bad side.

118
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,153
Okay?

119
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,578
These all belong to that bastard?

120
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,173
Gi-eun!

121
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:10,551
Mok-won.

122
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,690
- Gi-eun.
- Hm?

123
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,817
We don't really have much time.

124
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,530
- Sum...
- Yeah?

125
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,740
Let's go find her.

126
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,631
Huh? Isn't this Someone?

127
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,717
Something's different about it.

128
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,177
What is this?

129
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,014
My computer, Someone.

130
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,349
It's an artificial intelligence
messenger program.

131
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:06,108
You guys screw in here?
I can feel his energy.

132
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,777
It hurts my head.

133
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,328
This is all the evidence?

134
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,204
Mm.

135
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,311
DEVICE INFORMATION

136
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,394
There are so many.

137
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,356
What are we going to do from here?

138
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,777
Send this
to the Violent Crimes Department.

139
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,279
Get a warrant for his arrest.

140
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:56,825
But before that, I thought you might
be able to help me with something.

141
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:00,662
Hm. A warrant, huh? I don't know.

142
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,832
It's just a violation
of the Communications Act.

143
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,628
I'm guessing he'll face a fine?

144
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,463
Hm. That's not enough.

145
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,257
What are you, police?

146
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,261
You need to tell us
everything that you know.

147
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,389
Kim Sum, do you understand, huh?

148
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,810
Just stating the facts
as they are presented to me.

149
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,275
He knows where I live.

150
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,862
He knew that the three of us are friends.

151
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:39,910
He came to my house, and showed up here.
He knows where Gi-eun is.

152
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:44,623
Kim Sum, it's not helping us win
if you don't tell us what you know.

153
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:45,706
We need your help.

154
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:47,667
Come on.

155
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,213
Kim Sum!

156
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:54,550
If I had known something,

157
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,511
I wouldn't have taken
all the knives I have here.

158
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,555
Jeez, what do you mean, huh?

159
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,600
What did you do with the knives?

160
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,439
You gave that psycho a knife?

161
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:14,986
Huh?

162
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:18,614
Let's go.

163
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,053
It's just that...

164
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,434
I have no idea what you're thinking.

165
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,396
Disappointing.

166
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:57,905
Damn it.

167
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,616

00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:41,297
That's why

328
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:43,884
I will do this.

329
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:48,055
Come on.

330
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,697
FEAR

331

MOM FEELS FEAR
WHEN SUM IS OUT OF HER SIGHT

332

Eun-pyeong!

334
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:30,597
What? What?

335
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:31,681
Help me out.

336
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:34,559
Huh?

337
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:37,896
Here.
She's going to meet Seong Yun-o.

338
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:41,483
Can you apply for a communications
warrant? We need to track her location.

339
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,985
- Okay.
- It's urgent.

341
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:58,333
FINGER

342
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:02,462
What's the location of that ID? I-S-L-E.
The one from before. I need it.

343
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:29,252
So your friend is going to meet
Seong Yun-o at a specific location?

344
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:30,823
Yes.

345
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:33,469
What happened
with the location tracking?

346
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:36,079
What? No, no.
The warrant hasn't been approved.

347
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:37,831
Ah, damn. Seriously?

348
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:40,250
Huh?

349
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:43,921
"Departed in a car from 463 Seonhakseo-ro
30 minutes ago."

350
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,339
What? Who is that?

351
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,300
It's a good friend.

352
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:51,011
Hurry up!

353
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:02,022
- Go.
- I really need it back.

354
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:05,275
No matter the reason, you can't have it.

355
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,861
It's not something you need at all.

356
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:10,238
I just need you to give it to me.

357
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:13,408
Just holding it in my hands
makes me feel stable.

358
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:15,493
So please.

359
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,580
You know I'm not capable
of doing anything.

360
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:04,227
Just keep it wrapped
so you're not tempted to use it.

361
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:05,854
Mm.

362
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:13,403
Can you also check his fortune?

363
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:29,753
Roger that. She passed Naebu
and is headed towards Bukbu Expressway.

364
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:30,962
Huh?

365
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:38,220
Did she get kidnapped or something?
She's not the type to go around like this.

366
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:39,846
Maybe she caught on, huh?

367
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,040
What are they bouncing around for?

368
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:48,480
Probably exiting
through the Hawolgok Interchange,

369
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:49,981
U-turning around.

No.

426
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:39,756
