14
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,910
We have two more dishes today.

15
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:48,530
Master and Madam,

16
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:49,420
please enjoy.

17
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,170
What's the matter?

18
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,660
Not to your liking?

19
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,910
The dish is a bit oily.

20
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,590
It would be better with some rice.

21
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,520
Here.

22
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,350
Jiu,

23
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,030
have you tried the crab roe rice I made?

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,840
No.

25
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,090
Today…

26
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,960
You…

27
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,440
Never mind,

28
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:47,910
I will talk to her later.

29
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,470
I know I sounded harsh just now.

30
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,250
But I meant it

31
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,540
for your own good, Miantang.

32
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,000
If you don't want to listen,

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,870
I won't say it then.

34
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,170
Cui Jiu.

35
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,030
Did I

36
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,070
ever like you?

37
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:33,810
I remember being very reluctant

38
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,070
to marry you then.

39
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,260
But when I woke up,

40
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,700
I forgot all about the past.

41
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,630
But knowing how much you've done

42
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,220
for my treatment.

43
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,030
I felt grateful and fortunate,

44
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,030
believing I had married the right person.

45
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,780
I want to be good to you,

46
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,190
but I have forgotten

47
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,430
how to get along with you.

48
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,870
I try to learn from

49
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,910
the ordinary couples,

50
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,780
but somehow,

51
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,470
the more I try to get close to you,

52
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,350
the more distant I feel.

53
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:16,970
Today,

54
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,380
I have a sense of certainty.

55
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:21,790
What certainty?

56
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,940
Jiu is not my kind of man.

57
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:31,820
In my heart,

58
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,140
I want to return the favor.

59
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,700
But even so,

60
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,400
I will

61
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,430
do my duty as your wife.

62
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,990
If you mind,

63
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,550
we can get a divorce.

64
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,480
I will repay you for all the money

65
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,580
spent on my treatment.

66
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,200
Where are you going?

67
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,670
Go sleep in the study.

68
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,760
Not necessary.

69
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:53,410
I will go.

70
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,110
Waking me up in the middle of the night,

71
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,630
you'd better give me a good explanation.

72
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,020
Liu Miantang

73
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,500
is not stupid.

74
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:24,940
She has sensed

75
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,310
that she has no feelings for me.

76
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,700
She also told me that from now on,

77
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,120
I would

78
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:33,820
be seen as her benefactor.

79
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,340
She wants to have separate rooms with you.

80
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,750
Then you are angry.

81
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:47,340
I am happy.

82
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:50,480
She always brings up these matters to me.

83
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,210
I have to play house with her.

84
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,500
I'm really tired of it.

85
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,140
It's best this way for now.

86
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,840
When I get news from Fan Hu,

87
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,340
if she is still useful,

88
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,460
I can have her do everything for me

89
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:03,580
since I helped her.

90
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,310
What are you going to do next?

91
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,190
She is just a pawn.

92
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,450
Once I catch Lu Wen,

93
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:16,340
I'll take this burden off completely.

94
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,550
Just a pawn?

95
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,870
I can see

96
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,310
that you're treating her like a rival.

97
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,120
Sir, may I...

98
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,320
Jiu?

99
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:41,550
What are you doing here?

100
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,560
Just passing through.

101
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:48,110
Is there anything I can do for you?

102
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,690
Not at all.

103
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:50,870
I'll find you some books.

104
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,940
(Porcelain Pattern;
The Story of Cui Yingying and Student Zhang)

105
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:42,020
Are you putting me on a pedestal?

106
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,310
You are my husband.

107
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:44,460
I should do this for you.

108
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,020
Why are you standing there, Jiu?

109
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,050
Just take a look.

110
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,880
Madam.

111
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,730
Madam, the goods are all here.

112
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:28,990
These are all newly fired.

113
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,900
I have a sense of certainty.

114
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,390
Jiu is not my kind of man.

115
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:36,250
Madam.

116
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,760
This batch of blue-green porcelain

117
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,600
has a touch of purple.

118
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,480
They are top quality

119
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,990
and were sent to you once they were finished.

120
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,170
Very good.

121
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,960
Go ahead and keep going.

122
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,580
Be careful and slow down.

123
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:14,890
Be careful.

124
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:20,930
Madam.

125
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,860
Just put the rest outside.

126
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:24,290
Yes.

127
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,790
I know why you're here today.

128
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,080
Why?

129
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:37,910
Don't worry,

130
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:39,910
I haven't secretly contacted the trade guild.

131
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,860
I promise not

132
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,580
to reach out to them again.

133
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:49,070
I hope you'll keep your promise.

134
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,760
The study is too cold.

135
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,670
I'll stay at the Go Club for a few nights.

136
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:10,220
(Yushao Porcelain Shop)

137
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:16,520
These auspicious symbols

138
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,340
are truly different from other koi fish.

139
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,790
With them by your side,

140
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,970
Aunt is sure to live a long,

141
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:22,980
healthy life.

142
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,820
That's so sweet.

143
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,200
Xingzhou,

144
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,680
come here.

145
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,810
Share in

146
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,270
the good fortune of these mascots.

147
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,480
If mother likes it,

148
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,430
just take it.

149
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,310
This porcelain tank

150
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,670
looks well made.

151
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,190
I heard it's from a small out-of-town shop.

152
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,480
Maybe next time,

153
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,150
we can order a set of porcelain.

154
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,810
That's just an ordinary porcelain shop.

155
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:54,930
Every shop in Lingquan Town

156
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:55,910
can do that.

157
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,550
Yes.

158
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,880
Aunt,

159
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,480
this coloring

160
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,700
is a bit rough.

161
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,410
If it weren't for luck,

162
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,550
how could it match the auspicious symbols?

163
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,410
I remember,

164
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,320
in my mansion,

165
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,090
there happens to be an ancient porcelain tank.

166
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,070
The color is pretty.

167
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,310
I can

168
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,860
bring it over and replace this one.

169
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,860
Since it's an antique,

170
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,100
cousin, just keep it for yourself.

171
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:22,050
The coloring is a bit rough,

172
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:24,100
but it wins in its naturalness.

173
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,220
Mother is right.

174
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,220
I really should

175
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,620
share the good fortune.

176
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,390
You don't know how good I've been.

177
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,290
Mr. Xue,

178
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,050
maybe you go in and have a look?

179
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:20,890
Why don't you go?

180
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,080
Alright, alright.

181
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,960
Niece Zhen.

182
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,360
There's no need of that here.

183
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,090
Go see Mr. He.

184
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:31,050
Hurry up, hurry up.

185
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,000
Go in and see him.

186
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,840
Go ahead.

187
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,740
What do you think we should do?

188
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,480
Please.

189
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,030
His Lordship accompanied
the Consort Dowager to the morning incense.

190
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,580
Please wait here for a moment.

191
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,170
Father,

192
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:58,290
are you okay?

193
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,790
Do you feel unwell?

194
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:07,390
Father, do not worry too much.

195
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:08,840
I think His Lordship

196
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,310
won't push us too hard.

197
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,960
I have been

198
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,700
detained for so long.

199
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:19,820
His Lordship still refuses to see me.

200
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:24,170
The reason why His Lordship is holding us

201
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,340
and showing us his iron fist

202
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,580
is to set an example for the other members.

203
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,030
Otherwise,

204
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:30,820
as the head of the trade guild,

205
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,070
how can you be convinced in the future?

206
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:34,770
Furthermore,

207
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:37,150
if His Lordship really
wants to push us too hard,

208
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,390
how could he have allowed me to see you?

209
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,220
Good for you knowing everything.

210
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,200
My Lord.

211
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:51,410
Mr. He.

212
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:52,520
Thought all night,

213
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,510
have you figured it out?

214
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,840
My Lord.

215
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,100
It's not that the trade guild
refuses to lend the ships,

216
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,720
but

217
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,150
we really can't afford the loss.

218
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,840
The majestic He Family in Lingquan Town

219
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,430
is still bargaining with our mountain fastness

220
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,910
over a ransom of just a thousand taels.

221
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,510
My boss said

222
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,240
that if no one

223
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,740
redeems you by tonight,

224
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,700
you will be mine!

225
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,310
No water transport,

226
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,190
you still have land transport.

227
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,030
Zhenzhou is mountainous.

228
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,220
One mountain walk

229
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,070
will destroy

230
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,390
half of the porcelains.

231
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:09,430
Where there is water, there is flooding.

232
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,550
If you don't lend out the ships,

233
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,290
it will be the common people

234
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,550
who suffer.

235
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,690
Out of love and righteousness,

236
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:20,860
we should lend the ships.

237
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:23,270
But considering the future livelihood
of the trade guild,

238
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,390
I hope Your Lordship
will understand our position.

239
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,200
Lending the ships

240
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,860
is an act of righteousness.

241
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,120
As you are also the people of Zhenzhou,

242
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,670
I cannot act unjustly.

243
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:36,720
I will have the river to be cleaned

244
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,600
to minimize your losses.

245
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,440
Furthermore,

246
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,550
this year's taxation

247
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,600
will be reduced by 20%

248
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,310
to offset the costs of
ship chartering and diversion.

249
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:49,690
Father,
His Lordship is sensible and considerate.

250
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:50,530
In this way,

251
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:52,860
we have no worries.

252
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:54,980
Thank you, My Lord.

253
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:57,510
You have a good daughter.

254
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,310
How are you taking care of our father?

255
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,650
Today,

256
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,270
if it weren't for Zhen,

257
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,510
I, an old man,

258
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:26,390
might

259
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,910
have met my end in the Mansion of Lord Huaiyang.

260
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,860
About the business matters,

261
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,390
I am

262
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,510
powerless now.

263
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:42,740
It's time

264
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,550
to hand it over

265
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,070
to you,

266
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,820
the younger generation.

267
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:52,810
Father,

268
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,150
are you handing over the management

269
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:57,580
of our porcelain shop?

270
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,600
My son.

271
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:14,950
Starting today,

272
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:17,820
He's Porcelain Shop

273
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:20,180
will be managed by you.

274
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:22,920
Zhen,

275
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:24,690
you

276
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:26,580
should give him some help.

277
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,600
Father,

278
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,140
you can trust me with this.

279
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,450
However,

280
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:36,420
I've never dealt with the nobility,

281
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:37,930
dignitaries, squires,

282
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,990
or the seniors of Zhenzhou before.

283
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,580
Please assist me

284
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,990
with this.

285
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,120
Madam,

286
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,420
is this land

287
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:12,380
really worth it?

288
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:15,620
(Final Deed)
The scenery here is picturesque.

289
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:17,100
I liked it as soon as I saw it.

290
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,580
I asked Fangxie to inquire about it earlier.

291
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,560
Lord Huaiyang wants
to clean up the river,

292
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,550
and has asked the porcelain shops
in Lingquan to lend ships.

293
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:27,580
If that happens,

294
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,370
cleaning the river will be difficult.

295
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:30,610
And porcelain shops have no ships.

296
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,370
Even if they borrow them from other towns,

297
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:33,720
it will be time-consuming and costly.

298
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,660
It will also be difficult to
find the suitable ships.

299
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,520
So, the water transport

300
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,580
won't work.

301
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:40,290
Tell me,

302
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,990
what else can the porcelain shops do?

303
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,550
The river is under restoration,

304
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:51,970
and all the cargo ships from 12 members

305
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:52,810
have been requisitioned.

306
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,520
Ships in Qingzhou

307
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,900
cannot be borrowed in the short term.

308
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,320
With the water transport not being an option,

309
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,950
we can only choose the land transport.

310
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:03,080
We have explored various options,

311
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:03,920
and found

312
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:05,550
that the land in Shuangling Village,

313
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:07,420
located in the southern suburbs,

314
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:09,420
is the flattest and smoothest,

315
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:10,820
with the shortest distance.

316
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,600
So, it's

317
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,930
the best choice for land transport.

318
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:15,450
That piece of land is indeed very good.

319
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:16,290
Yes.

320
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,420
In that case,

321
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,470
just buy that piece of land.

322
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,420
Young Mr. He, Shuangling Village

323
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:29,560
has been bought by someone else.

324
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,510
-What?
-What?

325
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,240
-What?
-How could this happen?

326
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,100
Who bought it?

327
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,650
Liu Miantang

328
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,180
- from Yushao Porcelain Shop.
- Liu Miantang?

329
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:37,770
It's her again.

330
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:41,780
(Cui Mansion)

331
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,170
I'm here to see Mrs. Cui.

332
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,710
Madam is sick today,

333
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,130
and won't be going out,

334
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:47,070
or seeing anyone.

335
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,480
Your Madam

336
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,710
occupied the land of the trade guild.

337
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:50,790
Occupied?

338
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:51,690
Madam had bought the land

339
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,410
before the ships were requisitioned,

340
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:55,000
and had no idea
that the trade guild would use it.

341
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,240
However, Madam told me

342
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,750
that if there is
something important to discuss,

343
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,310
just go tell the trade guild.

344
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,760
She said...

345
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,660
Mr. He had told her

346
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,720
that women should not be out in the public.

347
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,610
Business matters are not suitable for her,

348
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,210
so she adheres to
the proper conduct of a woman,

349
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,140
and will not see any of you.

350
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,030
She was so quick to act.

351
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,750
Have a look.

352
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,890
She is quick to respond.

353
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:20,790
It's disgraceful.

354
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:23,030
The deed is in her hands.

355
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,690
If she refuses to let us go,

356
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:25,760
what should we do?

357
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,690
- Yes.
- Yes.

358
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:27,530
Just drag it out.

359
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:29,140
Let's see

360
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:30,990
who gives in first!

361
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,900
But the goods can't wait.

362
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,560
We've got orders piling up in the shops.

363
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,450
How can we drag it out?

364
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,310
Yes.

365
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,120
She is

366
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:40,710
opposing us on everything.

367
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,450
All right.

368
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:48,690
Well,

369
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,320
Zhen.

370
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,620
You are a woman,

371
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:53,770
so I'm leaving

372
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,070
this matter for you to handle.

373
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,400
Yes.

374
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,320
Madam said originally

375
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,160
that she won't meet guests.

376
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:09,210
But Miss He sent ginseng

377
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,100
as well as cubilose.

378
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:11,380
Our Madam said

379
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,000
that she can't bear to refuse you

380
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,790
even if she is not feeling well.

381
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,120
Please.

382
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:21,470
Miss He.

383
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,340
Mrs. Cui.

384
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:28,950
I haven't seen you for just a few days.

385
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,710
How did you get so sick?

386
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:32,920
Please have a seat.

387
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,100
I have an old disease,

388
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:39,510
and it flares up from time to time.

389
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,820
When it does,

390
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,310
I get a headache and can't even get up.

391
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,750
Thank you, Miss He,
for coming to see me personally.

392
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:50,180
Please forgive me for any slight.

393
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:52,270
You are not feeling well.

394
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:53,990
Just lie down and rest.

395
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,320
Miss He, there's something you might not know.

396
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,340
I've spent

397
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:02,240
a lot of money on this illness

398
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,580
in the capital.

399
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:05,990
I've nearly spent

400
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,420
all my husband's money.

401
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,950
Fortunately, I met a good doctor.

402
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:11,750
He gave me a prescription.

403
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:14,070
But those herbs

404
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,340
need to be planted in a place
with lush aquatic plants,

405
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,710
away from the hustle
and bustle of carriages and horses.

406
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,340
The herbs must be carefully tended to

407
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:24,950
in order to preserve the efficacy.

408
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,180
And I must be fated to live.

409
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:28,710
Some time ago,

410
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,420
I bought a good piece of land.

411
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:32,990
It can grow herbs

412
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:34,470
to help me keep on living.

413
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,860
So Mrs. Cui, you're saying

414
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,030
that the piece of land in Shuangling Village

415
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,710
is used to plant life-saving herbs.

416
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:43,660
Yes.

417
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:46,080
Anyone who insists on passing there

418
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,550
would really harm the Madam's life.

419
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,820
Miss He, you came to see me this time,

420
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,030
it is also about the land, isn't it?

421
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,180
Mrs. Cui.

422
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,320
A straightforward person
does not resort to insinuations.

423
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,650
The river is now being excavated.

424
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,030
All the ships have been requisitioned.

425
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,380
The porcelain in our town cannot be sent.

426
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,760
As time goes by,

427
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,930
the tribute will be delayed,

428
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:11,320
which could
lead to a great sin of decapitation.

429
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,710
The land in Shuangling Village

430
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,180
is also

431
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:16,180
vital for us.

432
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,900
Miss He, you are open and bright.

433
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,070
Since it is vital to both of us,

434
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:23,180
why should we restrict each other?

435
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,990
I just want to run my business well.

436
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,560
If we can get royal orders

437
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,970
like the 12 members of the trade guild,

438
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,550
and do business uprightly and honestly,

439
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:36,100
then my old illness

440
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:38,900
will get better,

441
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:40,510
even with just some common herbs.

442
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:42,550
Mrs. Cui,

443
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,790
are you threatening me?

444
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:47,820
I had no other choice.

445
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:50,310
For women in this world,

446
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,420
there are already many difficulties,

447
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,470
especially in business.

448
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:55,970
Miss He,

449
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:57,420
you should understand that.

450
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:03,710
I understand.

451
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,310
Let me go back

452
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,620
and discuss it with my father.

453
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:11,030
Keep up, the ones behind.

454
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:15,250
Hurry up!

455
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,320
My Lord.

456
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,660
Ms. Liu seems to be seriously ill.

457
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,340
What's the matter?

458
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,400
I'm not sure.

459
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,450
The shadow guard only said she had a headache.

460
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:26,820
She seems to have a cough again.

461
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,750
I have been staying out all night these days.

462
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,410
She must be happy and carefree

463
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:32,680
- and do whatever she wants.
- Hurry up!

464
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,270
She accidentally

465
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:35,620
caught a cold.

466
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:37,050
Yes.

467
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,380
Yes. It must be the case.

468
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,560
My Lord.

469
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,840
My Lord.

470
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:57,380
(Cui Mansion)

471
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,070
Come on, Master.

472
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,660
Here, you forgot this.

473
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,100
- Master.
- Please slow down, Master.

474
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,760
Madam.

475
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,370
You are really smart.

476
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:16,230
Why do you have so many ideas?

477
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,760
You've outwitted them all.

478
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,080
I didn't expect

479
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,610
that the members of the trade guild

480
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:24,660
would be fooled by you

481
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:26,950
and stop bothering you.

482
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:28,080
I didn't expect

483
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,660
Nanny Li to be such a good actress.

484
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:32,990
Madam gives me good guidance.

485
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:34,730
Madam.

486
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:38,170
The trade guild has sent an invitation

487
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,990
for you to attend
the business meeting tomorrow.

488
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:46,140
Where does
the fragrance of lotus leaves come from?

489
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:02,450
Wait.

490
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:08,050
Why

491
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:09,130
did you

492
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:10,750
come back and leave without telling me?

493
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:12,450
I

494
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,580
came back to get the clothes.

495
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:17,310
I didn't see any clothes,

496
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:20,420
but I did see you carrying herb packs.

497
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
This is for me.

498
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,900
I got inflamed recently.

499
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:27,820
What are you doing here?

500
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:30,340
I am buying things.

501
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:35,230
Go shopping with your hair all messy?

502
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:37,210
I forgot.

503
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:38,690
I'll go back and comb it.

504
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,560
OK. Then I am

505
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,160
leaving.

506
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,010
See you then.

507
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:57,340
You got inflamed again?

508
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:58,770
Nonsense.

509
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:01,290
You're always the smart one, huh?

510
00:27:05,564 --> 00:27:11,484
(Lingquan Town Porcelain Trade Guild)

511
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,040
You look really good

512
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,410
in that outfit today.

513
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:15,850
- White and delicate.
- Right.

514
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:17,410
You are the true natural beauties.

515
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:18,790
- That's too much..
- Please.

516
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:20,130
Mrs. Cui is here.

517
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,040
- Come on.
- Please have a seat.

518
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:21,990
Have some tea and pastries.

519
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:23,690
Why are you ladies here?

520
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:25,270
I am here to see
the members of the trade guild.

521
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,800
Mrs. Cui, now that you are here

522
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,400
and see all of us,

523
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,000
are you still worried about
not being able to join the trade guild?

524
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,020
Yes.

525
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,280
Mrs. Cui, don't be rush.

526
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,800
I actually have an important matter to discuss.

527
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,750
Isn't that something about business?

528
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:39,080
What kind of work

529
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,240
dose Yushao Porcelain Shop do,

530
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,450
the members of the trade guild

531
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:42,380
still need to discuss.

532
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:44,180
They will reply to you in a few days.

533
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:45,490
How many days?

534
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:46,690
Three days.

535
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,040
Today I brought

536
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,080
green tea from Qingzhou freshly
picked in early spring.

537
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:51,930
Come and have a taste.

538
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,450
Come, have a seat.

539
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:54,290
Come, sit down.

540
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:56,450
Try it.

541
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:57,880
Thank you.

542
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,720
This is watered gauze

543
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,580
that I had asked someone buy from Xizhou.

544
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:06,090
As for the style,

545
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,900
it is The Male Phoenix Pursuit,
popular in this year.

546
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:09,650
Mrs. Cui, in daily life,

547
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,480
- you haven't seen much good fabric.
- Good looking.

548
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,320
If you like it,

549
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:14,000
just take it and make clothes.

550
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,990
It is so luxurious.

551
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,040
Thank you for your kindness.

552
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,070
I appreciate it.

553
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,790
But I have several pieces of this fabric
at home.

554
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,550
This top-quality silk is so rare that

555
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,450
even high officials and noble lords
cannot buy it.

556
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:27,800
Mrs. Cui said

557
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,790
you had several pieces at home.

558
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:30,660
You must be mistaken.

559
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:34,170
Don't talk out of your hat.

560
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,180
You should know your limits.

561
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,520
She is really good at bluffing,

562
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,030
even with us.

563
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,950
I can't believe
you made a handkerchief out of watered gauze.

564
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:46,210
Let me take a look.

565
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,640
Is it genuine?

566
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,160
Yes, it is.

567
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,720
Where did you get this?

568
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,720
Mrs. Cui.

569
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,690
Do you know how much this fabric costs?

570
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:55,890
And you use it to make a handkerchief.

571
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:56,730
Well,

572
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,580
my husband gave me this a few days ago.

573
00:28:58,930 --> 00:28:59,860
I didn't ask about the cost.

574
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,480
Here. Have some tea.

575
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,720
- Have some fruits.
- Have some tea.

576
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,280
These fruits were just picked.

577
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,280
They're so fresh.

578
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,000
- Try this one.
- And these pastries

579
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,710
were just bought from the street.

580
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:14,230
This tea is really good.

581
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:34,060
(The two bandits disembarked, traveled around,
and are now heading to Qingzhou.)

582
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:39,180
Did Fan Hu see Lu Wen?

583
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,240
After the two thieves from Mount Yang
got off the boat,

584
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,230
they traveled around

585
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:49,200
and now are heading to the Qingzhou official road.

586
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,820
So cautious.

587
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:52,660
What are they up to?

588
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,030
Lu Wen is biding his time,

589
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:59,820
and it's definitely not
just about healing injuries.

590
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:11,860
(Our family was devastated.)

591
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:13,410
(How can Jiu still give me)

592
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:14,620
(such an luxury item?)

593
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:16,900
(Could it be…)

594
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,470
Madam, you...

595
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:30,710
What are you looking for?

596
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:34,000
The weather is getting cooler,

597
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,510
I am looking for the hand warmer.

598
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:37,450
You can ask me

599
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:39,520
to do it for you.

600
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,480
It's okay.

601
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,660
Nanny Li, just go do your thing.

602
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:43,450
Yes.

603
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,790
These are all top-quality fabrics.

604
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:04,710
After returning from the trade guild,

605
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,850
Madam became suspicious

606
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:09,000
and turned the room upside down.

607
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,130
I wonder if Ms. Liu has found any clues

608
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,660
to doubt your identity.

609
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:52,940
(Cang)
[*Cang: a character meaning "to hide"]

610
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,270
Jiu, why are you back?

611
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:02,470
We don't have much homework today,

612
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,820
so the teacher let us go back earlier.

613
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,560
Jiu, come and take a look.

614
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,550
How do you think of my writing?

615
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,660
Today I am practising the word "Cang".

616
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,210
Much better.

617
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,660
But the word "Chen" in it,
[*Chen: a character meaning "a courtier"]

618
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:25,420
should be written more concisely,

619
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:27,180
not so explicitly.

620
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,950
Jiu is right.

621
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:51,230
How sharp is the blade of a courtier
or a minister.

622
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,620
If one can conceal without revealing,

623
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:55,140
that's true hiding.

624
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,320
Jiu, write one yourself.

625
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,560
I'll inmitate your writing

626
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,550
to ensure it's accurate.

627
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,560
Okay.

628
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:16,410
People say

629
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:17,900
that the handwriting reflects the person.

630
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:20,030
Jiu,

631
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,930
your writing is strong and powerful,

632
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:22,990
with deep, penetrating strokes.

633
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,560
It is fair to say

634
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,660
you're from a high-ranking family.

635
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,780
Miantang, you're overpraising me.

636
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,320
It's just that my childhood teacher

637
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,950
was very strict.

638
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:35,660
Was the teacher from the capital?

639
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,180
Of course.

640
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:42,030
The capital is so nice.

641
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:44,070
Unfortunately,

642
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,860
I can't remember anything.

643
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:49,420
Sometimes I wonder,

644
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,080
in the past,

645
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,860
how rich and prosperous our life was.

646
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:56,820
Even if we've spent all our family fortune now,

647
00:33:57,130 --> 00:33:59,100
we still have money to buy such a good house

648
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,790
and enjoy so many fine things.

649
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:04,660
As long as you're happy.

650
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:07,230
It's getting late.

651
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:08,870
You should take a rest.

652
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,670
I'll go to the study
to record the game records.

653
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:35,350
The seal

654
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,950
means it's from an official kiln,

655
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,780
and is not available to ordinary people.

656
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:51,870
It is actually from the official kiln.

657
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:55,350
Could it be a counterfeit?

658
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:57,810
I have been firing porcelain
for the He family for ten years.

659
00:34:57,810 --> 00:34:59,430
I can tell if it's real or fake at a glance.

660
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,620
This is definitely

661
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,430
from the official kiln for tribute.

662
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,480
Madam, where did you

663
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,660
get such a treasure?

664
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:15,610
I'll take my leave.

665
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,520
Please take care.

666
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:26,660
(Lingquan Go Club)

667
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:29,170
Take care.

668
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,390
- Follow him.
- Yes.

669
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:36,990
- Please come in.
- OK.

670
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,700
- Ma'am, please come in.
- OK.

671
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,030
A private room on the second floor!

672
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:42,610
Sir.

673
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,180
Still hesitating?

674
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,580
You're the best player in the Go Club.

675
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:11,220
You can't even

676
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,990
solve this ko.

677
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,140
It has to be you,

678
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,990
skilled in the Go.

679
00:36:26,330 --> 00:36:27,990
Cui Jiu,

680
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:29,890
I often see you

681
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:31,290
playing Go

682
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:32,870
with Lord Huaiyang.

683
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:35,100
I thought you

684
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:37,180
received this appreciation

685
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:38,950
for your skill in the game.

686
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,470
I am not as skilled as you.

687
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,910
Now it seems,

688
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:45,070
you're not that impressive.

689
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:49,660
Official Wang, you are highly skilled in Go.

690
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:50,920
It doesn't matter.

691
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:52,730
Today,

692
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:55,510
as long as you can make me happy...

693
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:56,680
No, I really mean it.

694
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,680
You are indeed highly skilled.

695
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,580
I am not as skilled as you.

696
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,070
Look at this man.

697
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:04,690
Come on.

698
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:06,220
Reward him generously.

699
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:09,690
Take it.

700
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:11,730
Thank you.

701
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,070
- Thank you.
- Take it.

702
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,890
- Satisfied now?
- Ma'am, are you leaving now?

703
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:26,240
This fabric looks good.

704
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:27,880
Please take care.

705
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:40,100
My Lord. Ms. Liu is left.

706
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:41,770
OK.

707
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:45,990
My Lord, please calm down.

708
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,470
I offended you just now.

709
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:51,030
It's okay, you are right.

710
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,070
Just keep the money.

711
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:56,180
- Thank you, My Lord.
- Well done.

712
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,880
Thank you, My Lord.

713
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:02,040
Please keep

714
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,950
what happened today to yourselves.

715
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,870
If even a word leaks,

716
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,950
you'll be in for it.

717
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,510
Please rest assured.

718
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:11,430
I absolutely keep it a secret.

719
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:18,820
(Cui Mansion)

720
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:28,730
Master.

721
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:33,130
Master.

722
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,780
What if Ms. Liu is serious

723
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,660
and scolds you?

724
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,870
It's fine if she does.

725
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,830
It doesn't matter if she scolds me.

726
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:47,350
She won't turn down the money anyway.

727
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:50,290
Yes.

728
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,040
What's going on?

729
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:02,160
Nanny Li,

730
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,000
Moru,

731
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:04,350
you both leave first.

732
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,120
Unless I say so,

733
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:06,960
stay out.

734
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,620
What's the matter, Miantang?

735
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,040
Jiu,

736
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,950
is there something you want to tell me?

737
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:29,510
Who upset you, Miantang?

738
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:32,300
How long do you plan to hide it from me?

739
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,220
What did I hide?

740
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,700
I watched a Go match today

741
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:39,180
at a restaurant in the west of the town.

742
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,260
So... you know that?

743
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:47,770
Yes.

744
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:50,580
I know you have been lying to me.

745
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:53,080
I know the money you bring home every day

746
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,660
is not from winning the Go.

747
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:56,260
I also know

748
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,830
that you consort the influential officials,

749
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:01,700
indulge in their idle pleasures,

750
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:04,580
and flatter them all the time!

751
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,220
What's wrong with that?

752
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:09,390
I do it to earn money for our family.

753
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,430
When did I ever need you to earn money?

754
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,740
I take care of this family

755
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,770
so you can do

756
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:18,300
what you love.

757
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:19,770
However,

758
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:22,770
to gain some benefits,

759
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:23,990
you sullied the Go

760
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:26,580
by deliberately losing to that dandy.

761
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:29,170
Cui Jiu.

762
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,910
Where is your dignity as a Go player?

763
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,910
W-What dignity?

764
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:35,360
I was taking what...

765
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,550
Mi-Miantang.

766
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:43,950
From now on, I will…

767
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:46,930
You still don't know

768
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:48,350
what I'm really mad about.

769
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:50,580
I want to join the trade guild,

770
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:52,640
but you strongly oppose

771
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,430
and say it's a disgrace.

772
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,430
Yet, you are willing to give up your dignity
just to earn a living.

773
00:40:58,930 --> 00:40:59,930
As a couple,

774
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:01,430
we're supposed to weather the storm together.

775
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,250
But it feels like I'm the only one

776
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:05,580
living under your protection.

777
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:08,290
You have never

778
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:11,300
shared your concerns and grievances with me,

779
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,680
and I have never

780
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,950
received your trust.

781
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,430
Wasn't that what you said before?

782
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,040
That there is only gratitude between us

783
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,450
and no need to weather the storm?

784
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:24,660
But I want to.

785
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:28,170
In the past,

786
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:30,580
I misunderstood you.

787
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,470
I didn't know that you'd rather suffer yourself

788
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:37,550
than let me be harassed by
the members of the trade guild.

789
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:41,510
I thought you were only focused on playing Go,

790
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:43,430
not on handling household chores,

791
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,780
and criticizing me.

792
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,440
I...

793
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,550
I relied on my memory loss

794
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:53,410
to ignore all the good you did for me

795
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:54,830
in the past.

796
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,990
I only cared about my own feelings,

797
00:41:58,850 --> 00:41:59,930
but I never thought about

798
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:01,390
how you felt,

799
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,100
and said such harsh words to you.

800
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:09,170
That is

801
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,220
not the case.

802
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:16,660
I didn't mean to blame you.

803
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:21,170
Jiu.

804
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,870
Let's forget

805
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,770
all the misunderstandings

806
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:29,910
and deceptions

807
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,550
from the past.

808
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,350
- Is it okay?
- Okay.

809
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:39,130
I...

810
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:41,990
I want to get to know you again.

811
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:44,260
I also want

812
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,470
to be Cui Jiu's true wife.

813
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:49,130
Is it okay?

814
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:53,810
Okay.

815
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:56,290
Miantang.

816
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,780
From now on,

817
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:01,470
I will never consort with
the rich and powerful.

818
00:43:59,000 --> 00:43:59,990
- Go to your room...
- Go to your room...

819
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,100
You'd better sleep on the bed.

820
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:06,250
