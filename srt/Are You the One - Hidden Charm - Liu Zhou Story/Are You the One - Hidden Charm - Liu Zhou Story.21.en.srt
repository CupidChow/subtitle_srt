14
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:45,670
Zhen.

15
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,390
Lord Zhao.

16
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:49,100
He is someone worthy of lifelong commitment.

17
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,890
You should cherish this opportunity.

18
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,750
Don't act pretentiously in the future.

19
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,940
Don't defy your husband.

20
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,330
Is marrying him

21
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,780
the only way I can repay my family?

22
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,530
Everything I did and tried

23
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:08,950
before

24
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,290
was never appreciated.

25
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,690
In your eyes,

26
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,320
the only way out

27
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,150
for me

28
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,460
is to marry Lord Zhao, right?

29
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,760
Yes.

30
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,060
Only this way.

31
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:27,710
Zhen.

32
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,250
Where are you going?

33
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:31,730
Coming.

34
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,290
Coming, coming.

35
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,850
Miss He.

36
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,290
After these months,

37
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,100
you've lost lots of weight.

38
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,810
I left abruptly that day

39
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,010
and didn't leave a note.

40
00:02:58,990 --> 00:02:59,850
Will you blame me?

41
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,530
I was wrong at first.

42
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,250
It's my fault for saying that

43
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,850
out of the bad mood.

44
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,710
Alright.

45
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,920
Let's call it even.

46
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,270
Never bring it up again.

47
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,110
Alright?

48
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,810
What kind of pattern is it?

49
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,530
It's so unique.

50
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,460
A golden lantern flower,

51
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,810
also called heartless grass.

52
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,800
Heartless?

53
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,710
While the leaves are still there,

54
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,780
the flower hasn't bloomed.

55
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,410
When the flower blooms,

56
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,180
the leaves have withered.

57
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,130
The flower and leaves never meet.

58
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,340
They are both indifferent

59
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,600
and heartless.

60
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,500
Madam,

61
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,130
why are you suddenly stitching this?

62
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,680
I find it interesting

63
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,810
in "Youyang Novels".

64
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,150
It says this flower

65
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,660
often blooms in the homes of villains.

66
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,620
Nanny Li, have you seen it?

67
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,940
I'm not a villain.

68
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,180
How could I have seen it?

69
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,800
What a sin.

70
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:03,730
What a sin.

71
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:16,990
Miss He?

72
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,310
Ms. Liu.

73
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,340
What's wrong with you today?

74
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,960
I...

75
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,820
I have a friend

76
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,520
whose brain was damaged

77
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,440
by a fever as a child.

78
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,280
She lost her memory.

79
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,050
She denied her real mom

80
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,900
but mistook the maid for her mother.

81
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,000
The maid took advantage of her ignorance

82
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,370
to gain benefits from the family.

83
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,490
I wanted to tell my friend the truth,

84
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,730
but everyone stopped me,

85
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,700
telling me not to meddle.

86
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,490
I feel distressed.

87
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:52,670
Miantang.

88
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,340
Do you understand how I feel?

89
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,140
How could it be?

90
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,780
Her real mother

91
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,340
is right there.

92
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,900
She won't let the maid harm her.

93
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,590
It's probably just to amuse your friend.

94
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,290
You're worrying too much.

95
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,370
The stitching is indeed too rough.

96
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,340
I'll just take it apart and redo it.

97
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,100
It has come to this.

98
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,930
Why are you still...

99
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,070
I'll take it apart

100
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,600
to escape

101
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,660
from the current situation

102
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,370
and start over.

103
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,490
I originally did it for fun.

104
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,900
But gradually,

105
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,340
it felt wrong.

106
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,470
Now,

107
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,820
I'll take it all apart

108
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,040
and sew a pattern that I like

109
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,220
and that is auspicious.

110
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,110
Miss He,

111
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,720
what do you think?

112
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:01,990
Good.

113
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,020
Don't stitch the grass.

114
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,410
Stitch what you like.

115
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,670
Aunt.

116
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,700
Drink this calming soup

117
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,140
and rest early.

118
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,900
Getting angry harms the spleen.

119
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,730
You still have to oversee the rites tomorrow.

120
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,460
I'm sorry.

121
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,730
It's also me who lacks the ability

122
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,970
to hold Xingzhou's heart.

123
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,460
This child

124
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:40,850
has always been determined.

125
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,530
Once he makes a decision,

126
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,170
even I, his mother,

127
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,780
cannot stop him.

128
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,080
Among all virtues,

129
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,340
filial piety comes first.

130
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,530
Common people lose their reputations

131
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,140
for not being filial.

132
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,030
And officials

133
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,410
lose their positions.

134
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,660
Let alone a lord.

135
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,640
So many eyes in the court

136
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,970
are watching Xingzhou.

137
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,050
You cannot ignore this

138
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,700
and give others excuses.

139
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,340
Do you mean...?

140
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,260
I have a plan to make amends.

141
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,490
But...

142
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,230
Tell me.

143
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,400
Aunt.

144
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,190
Tomorrow, when you go to Liuming Temple

145
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,140
to oversee the rites,

146
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:39,850
I'll accompany you.

147
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:41,310
At that time,

148
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,370
with the people and officials
of Zhenzhou present,

149
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,080
you can publicly recognize me

150
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,410
as your daughter-in-law.

151
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,030
Thus,

152
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,320
this marriage will be known to everyone.

153
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,460
Everything's set.

154
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,370
Xingzhou won't be able to back out.

155
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:01,020
(Zhenzhou)

156
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:03,990
The certificate.

157
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,920
Go.

158
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,520
Go.

159
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,480
Go.

160
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:18,550
Go.

161
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,160
- Go.
- Let's go.

162
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,930
The Consort Dowager's procession has set off.

163
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,650
It's in vain.

164
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,420
The madam has arranged for a carriage.

165
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:41,420
It should also be heading
towards Liuming Temple.

166
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,730
She does like lively scenes.

167
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,300
What if they run into each other?

168
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,920
Huang Gui.

169
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,310
My Lord.

170
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,100
Tighten the city's defenses to prevent bandits

171
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,940
from mixing in.

172
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,120
Rest assured.

173
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,680
Aside from the Taoist priests,

174
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,610
no one else came in.

175
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,540
Where's the roster?

176
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,460
It's quite tricky.

177
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:18,540
What's tricky?

178
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,680
The level of realism in the fake certificates

179
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,770
is quite sophisticated.

180
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,850
But they don't know

181
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,630
that Liuming Temple,
as a major Taoist institution,

182
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,340
altered the characters on the prayer scroll

183
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,850
to advise Emperor Wen of the previous dynasty.

184
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,850
(Liuming Temple)
"Liu" is shortened,

185
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,610
and "Ming" is slightly elongated.

186
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,230
It symbolizes less transience

187
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,340
and more clarity.

188
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,370
Emperor Wen was enlightened

189
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,820
and rewarded Liuming Temple.

190
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,820
This practice has been passed down since then.

191
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,180
I've been negligent.

192
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,640
Moru.

193
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,700
Prepare the regular clothes. Let's go.

194
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:57,710
Yes.

195
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,970
Has the madam arrived?

196
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,280
Not yet.

197
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,890
When did she set off?

198
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,420
She left early this morning.

199
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,350
Order the guards to protect

200
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,190
the Consort Dowager.

201
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:10,670
Yes.

202
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,430
Nanny Li.

203
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,730
Stop the carriage at the street entrance.

204
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,490
Aren't we going to Liuming Temple?

205
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,590
Didn't you say

206
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,630
Liuming Temple would be crowded today,

207
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,940
smoky,

208
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,970
with ruffians and thieves?

209
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,300
Yes.

210
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,770
Let's follow your suggestion

211
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,970
and not go today.

212
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:32,940
That's great.

213
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,420
When we reach the street market ahead,

214
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,540
Nanny, buy a bass for me.

215
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,180
I'll go to get some tonic medicine
for my husband.

216
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,310
Madam,

217
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,820
isn't it better if we stay together?

218
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,340
There are so many people today.

219
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,420
If anything happens,

220
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,850
it will be hard to explain to the master.

221
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,800
If we get to the fresh fish market late,

222
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,610
the remaining fish won't be fresh.

223
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,060
I'll wait for you at the pharmacy.

224
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,220
What could happen?

225
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,540
Just come find me as soon as you're done.

226
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,610
Alright, alright.

227
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,070
Sir,

228
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,250
check if you have these.

229
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,280
Sure.

230
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,610
Do you have fine antlers?

231
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,280
Yes.

232
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,890
It looks like business is booming today.

233
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,400
Please get all these

234
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,490
tonic prescriptions ready.

235
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:28,250
I won't delay your big sale.

236
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,590
You're right.

237
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,350
Please wait a moment.

238
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,820
We have everything you need.

239
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,180
Madam, I'll prepare
the medicine for you right away.

240
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:40,610
Please wait a moment.

241
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,890
- Sister.
- Sister.

242
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,820
Lu Zhong, Lu Yi.

243
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,200
Sister, Uncle Qiao has told us

244
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,060
everything.

245
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,040
How do you want

246
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,460
Lord Huaiyang to die?

247
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:59,130
If we hadn't changed the location today,

248
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,630
I would've killed him

249
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,650
in Liuming Temple.

250
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,800
The time isn't right.

251
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,770
We must be cautious.

252
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,460
Avoid the dangerous wall.

253
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,230
On the Shangsi Festival,

254
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,580
where were you that night

255
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,610
when I went missing?

256
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:13,430
That night,

257
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,340
Lu Yi and I discovered a group of ambushers.

258
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,940
We managed to drive them off.

259
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,490
We returned and found out

260
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,470
you were missing.

261
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,180
I tried to ask Mr. Ziyu,

262
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,820
but Sun Yun'er stopped me.

263
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,180
She told me you

264
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,560
had decided to leave and wouldn't return.

265
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,970
Ghosts are more reliable than her.

266
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:31,300
Later, Mount Yang became hers.

267
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,180
There was no place for us.

268
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,130
We had to go to Beizhou to find Uncle Qiao

269
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,300
and search for you.

270
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,580
If you want to avenge,

271
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,340
listen carefully to what I say.

272
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,100
Master.

273
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:49,310
Where is Madam?

274
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,540
Madam and Nanny Li left early this morning.

275
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,890
If I couldn't stand it,

276
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,100
I would speak out.

277
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,320
The medicine he sold

278
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,180
to Butcher Li's wife

279
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,540
was mostly common herbs,

280
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,460
except for one or two,

281
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,250
but he charged her double.

282
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,320
If he dares to cheat me,

283
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,300
I'll make sure Butcher Li knows about it.

284
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,110
Butcher Li

285
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,800
is a tough character,

286
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,060
a bully in the market.

287
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,510
If Madam truly wants

288
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,420
to tell him,

289
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,750
it's enough to make

290
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,650
the shopkeeper suffer.

291
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,540
What a sin.

292
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,490
Honey, why are you back?

293
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,340
Honey.

294
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,650
What happened?

295
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:45,300
The Lord asked me to take half a day off,

296
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,490
so I came back to check.

297
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,370
Yesterday, you mentioned Liuming Temple.

298
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,940
I thought you had gone there.

299
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,460
I was going to,

300
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,320
but Nanny Li kept saying

301
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,750
it was too crowded

302
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:56,820
and might lead to trouble.

303
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,580
I thought it made sense,

304
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,340
so I changed direction to the market.

305
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,320
On the battlefield,

306
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,770
you risked your life.

307
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,080
You must be exhausted.

308
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,220
You need to recuperate.

309
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,540
I bought a bass

310
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,960
that was just caught today.

311
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,800
It's very fresh.

312
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,610
How considerate of you.

313
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,470
Praying for the deceased soldiers

314
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,540
shows compassion.

315
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,080
Taking care of the living

316
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,060
is also important.

317
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,180
Dear, I'll speak frankly.

318
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,850
A villain has entered Zhenzhou.

319
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,230
Have you seen any

320
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,180
suspicious men?

321
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,010
Suspicious men?

322
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,700
Why would they come to me?

323
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,850
Did you see anyone

324
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,130
dressed as a Taoist priest?

325
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,630
Why would a Taoist priest not be
in the temple chanting

326
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,730
and wander around instead?

327
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:53,830
Dear.

328
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,920
This matter is very important.

329
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,180
Think carefully.

330
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,770
Honey.

331
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,420
Sounds like you're interrogating me.

332
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,010
I'm not interrogating you.

333
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,700
You returned in such a panic

334
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,490
only to check if I was being unruly.

335
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,120
Nonsense.

336
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,340
Just chatting.

337
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,650
When you lie,

338
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,700
you always avoid my eyes.

339
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,880
Dear.

340
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:37,220
It's really just chatting.

341
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,370
I was afraid of the villain,

342
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,100
so I came back to check on you.

343
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,040
What?

344
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,350
Honey,

345
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:45,940
are you afraid I'll be taken by them?

346
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:47,970
Don't worry.

347
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,400
Our family is now

348
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,850
under Lord Huaiyang's protection.

349
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,490
What villain would dare act?

350
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,990
That would be ignoring

351
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,850
Lord Huaiyang.

352
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:56,730
You're right, dear.

353
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,430
Master.

354
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,920
Lord Huaiyang sent word

355
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,730
that the rites had ended

356
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,200
and he had already left.

357
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,010
He wants you to visit him.

358
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,180
Then you should go quickly.

359
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,180
Don't keep the Lord waiting.

360
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:14,730
If we lose

361
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,730
the Lord's protection,

362
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,420
and villains come again,

363
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,180
you might really lose me.

364
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,830
Alright, dear.

365
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:26,890
I'll go now.

366
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,430
Mother.

367
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,630
Two villains disguised as Taoists

368
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,460
and broke into Zhenzhou today.

369
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,700
I went to investigate,

370
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,580
which delayed the blessing time.

371
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,780
I hope you'll forgive me.

372
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,000
Sit down.

373
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:10,550
Yes.

374
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,020
This is peony stamens.

375
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,840
Binglan

376
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,130
saw I looked unwell

377
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,690
and brought it to me.

378
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:41,710
Today,

379
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,060
I was alone in charge

380
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,260
at Liuming Temple.

381
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,370
With the sudden villain trouble,

382
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,170
my frail body

383
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,500
could hardly endure it.

384
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,130
Fortunately, Binglan helped me,

385
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,540
so I didn't

386
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,230
lose the family's face

387
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,060
in front of the people.

388
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,350
She helped me

389
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,740
and also helped you.

390
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,020
You must remember this favor.

391
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,240
Today,

392
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,880
I planned to recognize Binglan as your fiancee

393
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,740
and have you reconcile with her.

394
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,410
What do you think?

395
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,170
It seems you're still thinking

396
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,610
about that mistress.

397
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,370
Mother, I've said it before.

398
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,920
She is not a mistress.

399
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,610
I don't need to know who she is.

400
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,060
Binglan has already stepped back.

401
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,590
She said

402
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,030
if you truly favor

403
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,410
that Liu woman,

404
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,750
she will give her face

405
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:53,030
and support you properly.

406
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,850
What more do you want her to do?

407
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,360
You're a lord.

408
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,820
You knew villains in the temple,

409
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,260
yet you were absent from your mother
and the people.

410
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,930
You ran off to a place
of leisure on North Street.

411
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,340
Isn't that absurd?

412
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,070
I can

413
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,130
overlook all this.

414
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,980
But you must promise me today

415
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:16,780
to marry Binglan.

416
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:34,830
Mother.

417
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,410
For today's matter,

418
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:40,060
it is true that I was at fault.

419
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,370
There are other reasons behind this.

420
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,930
I will explain it to you later.

421
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,060
As for the engagement,

422
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,060
please forgive me.

423
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,370
I will only marry Liu Miantang.

424
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,130
What are you saying?

425
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:56,930
I, Cui Xingzhou,

426
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:59,580
will only marry Liu Miantang in this life.

427
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,540
You scoundrel!

428
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,000
Scoundrel!

429
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,340
Scoundrel!

430
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,850
Scoundrel!

431
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:29,550
Madam.

432
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,720
Honey.

433
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,650
I came to fetch your changed clothes.

434
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:43,740
Why are you injured?

435
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,680
It's nothing.

436
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,780
Let me apply medicine.

437
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,390
Does it hurt a lot?

438
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,480
Yes.

439
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,690
This person is rough.

440
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,540
But don't worry.

441
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,130
It wasn't the villain who hurt me.

442
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,110
The Lord

443
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,690
punished me.

444
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:33,650
How can the Lord treat his soldiers so harshly?

445
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,370
Perhaps he is in a bad mood.

446
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,960
I heard he fell out

447
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,130
with the Consort Dowager.

448
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,350
The Consort Dowager

449
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,500
matched him with a well-suited marriage,

450
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,650
but the Lord's heart

451
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,410
belongs to another woman.

452
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:23,820
It's chilly today.

453
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,260
A warm soak is good for your health.

454
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,480
Honey,

455
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:47,130
the villain you mentioned earlier.

456
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,450
Was he a remnant of Mount Yang?

457
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,450
Why do you suddenly ask about this?

458
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,580
I'm just curious.

459
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,360
After all,

460
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,820
I once fell into their hands.

461
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,450
I heard from the neighbors

462
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,410
that the leader of Mount Yang
had surrendered to the court.

463
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,820
So, they are

464
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:11,100
no longer Zhenzhou's enemies.

465
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,610
Mount Yang no longer causes chaos.

466
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:17,100
Those unwilling to surrender

467
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,640
have scattered.

468
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,580
Why do you keep mentioning Mount Yang?

469
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,300
Zhenzhou is not lacking.

470
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,210
It takes vigilance to stave off evil.

471
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:28,890
The Lord has won against them many times.

472
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:31,980
Many times?

473
00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:34,100
How many times?

474
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:40,980
Honey,

475
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,930
who do you think

476
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,610
is stronger, Lord Huaiyang

477
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,890
or the Mount Yang leader?

478
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,100
It's hard to say

479
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:53,170
who is stronger between them.

480
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,410
On the Shangsi Festival,

481
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,920
at the ritual, the lighting

482
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,020
should've brought a truce.

483
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:00,780
But the Mount Yang leader

484
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,060
attacked Lord Huaiyang.

485
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,210
The leader attacked?

486
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,370
Yes.

487
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,300
The Lord didn't expect

488
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,640
that the leader, who always kept his promises,

489
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,820
would break his word

490
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,880
and attack him while the soldiers

491
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,850
were resting.

492
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,500
The Lord was furious

493
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,300
and tried every means to defeat him

494
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,060
and heavily harm Mount Yang,

495
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,340
but the leader then vanished.

496
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,170
The Lord tried to capture him,

497
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,100
wanting not only to defeat him

498
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,540
but also to ask him in person

499
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,650
why he broke the agreement.

500
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,470
Later,

501
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:45,100
Mount Yang surrendered,

502
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:46,960
and the Lord

503
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,880
completely lost the chance

504
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,780
to settle things with him.

505
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,760
Honey.

506
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,500
I want to go to Mount Yang.

507
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,070
Why?

508
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,740
I want to clear the demons in my heart.

509
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,740
Do you remember anything?

510
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,500
At the Shangsi night years ago,

511
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,610
I had not yet

512
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,610
married you.

513
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,450
My family was

514
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,440
on Ling Mountain outside Xizhou City,

515
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,540
viewing the scenery

516
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,300
and making wishes through sky lanterns.

517
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,170
The open terrain here

518
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,850
would make the sky lanterns

519
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:31,890
look very beautiful.

520
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,720
Indeed.

521
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,210
On Shangsi night,

522
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,500
sky lanterns

523
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,850
accompanied by the blooming mountain flowers

524
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:43,980
are quite magnificent.

525
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,060
Did Lord Huaiyang tell you this as well?

526
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:57,410
With the sky lanterns in the air,

527
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,610
if the villain attacked,

528
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,020
he would be easily spotted.

529
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,690
How could there be an ambush?

530
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,610
Lord Huaiyang is so smart.

531
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,060
Could he be lying to you?

532
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:18,980
Along the way,

533
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,740
we walked through a section
of collapsed mountain road.

534
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,820
Do you remember?

535
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,280
It used to be

536
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,540
the only way up the mountain.

537
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,260
On Shangsi night,

538
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,780
Lord Huaiyang

539
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,210
camped right there.

540
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,340
The soldiers were making wine,

541
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,930
temporarily letting down their guard.

542
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:41,930
That day,

543
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:46,340
they had agreed to a ceasefire.

544
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,410
But with the sky lanterns,

545
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:52,020
the soldiers waited

546
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:54,100
for a horde of fierce Mount Yang bandits

547
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:57,500
to break into their camp.

548
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:10,870
It seems

549
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,450
Lord Huaiyang wasn't lying.

550
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:20,100
In fact, he's not good at lying.

551
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,040
Miantang.

552
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,580
Since returning to Zhenzhou,

553
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,780
I've been uneasy.

554
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,740
I always feel like I'm going to lose you.

555
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,310
Haven't I always been by your side?

556
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,150
I know.

557
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,740
That's why I plan

558
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,300
to tell you everything.

559
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,040
Everything?

560
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,820
What do you mean?

561
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:57,870
Master!

562
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,200
Master!

563
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,720
What's wrong?

564
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,690
Master, Madam.

565
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,150
The army

566
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,210
says you need to return.

567
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,270
Tomorrow is the Little New Year.

568
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,300
Remember to go home.

569
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,300
I thought I could rest.

570
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:13,980
Work is important.

571
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,210
You have two letters.

572
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,590
One is from the capital.

573
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:31,020
The other is from Beizhou.

574
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:32,870
Anything else?

575
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:35,070
Your mother is ill.

576
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,370
They want you to return quickly.

577
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:50,370
Miss.

578
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,410
The hidden agents at Mount Yang

579
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,540
found Liu Miantang and Lord Huaiyang.

580
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,820
What was she doing at Mount Yang?

581
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,930
It seems she was just climbing the mountain.

582
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,450
But the agent found

583
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,300
that Liu Miantang left this behind.

584
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,150
Miss.

585
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,820
Is this a Mount Yang mark?

586
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,300
I don't quite understand it.

587
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,790
This mark isn't for you and me.

588
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,130
You wouldn't understand.

589
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:30,060
In five days,

590
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,710
at noon,

591
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:32,650
at Youyu Cave?

592
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,260
I'm going to Mount Yang.

593
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,300
The firewood is damp

594
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,100
and won't catch fire.

595
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,580
It's just a spring rain.

596
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,410
It went afar to avoid it

597
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,740
but still got soaked.

598
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,340
How useless.

599
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,210
Do you remember when you were young,

600
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,820
you and your cousin, Qingying,

601
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,410
used to argue?

602
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,880
Even at a young age,

603
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,130
you learned from the opera

604
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:19,690
to sever the ties,

605
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:20,920
but when she was

606
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,060
bullied on the road,

607
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,060
you were the first to step in.

608
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,540
Your grandfather used to say

609
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,170
you appear

610
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,060
tough on the outside,

611
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,370
but you're softer

612
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,170
than anyone inside.

613
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,240
I said

614
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,890
I came here to rid myself of the mental demons.

615
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,450
Your demons

616
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,370
are also mine.

617
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:49,870
Yes.

618
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,440
I once

619
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,690
wanted to reclaim everything from before

620
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,170
because it concerned us.

621
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,680
Honey,

622
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:13,500
we've weathered so many storms together.

623
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,650
Perhaps what we have now

624
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,130
is even better than the years we lost.

625
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,110
What I want to say

626
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:21,960
might surprise you.

627
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,930
If you intend to say

628
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,580
anything that breaks this happiness,

629
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:27,930
then I don't want to hear it.

630
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,020
A couple

631
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,370
always has secrets, doesn't it?

632
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,690
If you truly feel regret,

633
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,890
then keep deceiving me for a lifetime.

634
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,610
Don't hide half of it

635
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,300
and then falter, revealing it.

636
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:49,500
You would feel better,

637
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,740
but I, as a woman,

638
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,350
would have to bear

639
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,370
this burden.

640
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:00,890
Is that truly how you feel?

641
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,110
Yes.

642
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,690
So don't tell me.

643
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,720
I beg you.

644
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,410
Honey.

645
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:28,610
I haven't said thank you to you yet.

646
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:30,850
No matter what,

647
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,450
without you,

648
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,100
I might have been gone
from this world long ago.

649
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,540
From now on,

650
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,130
if Mount Yang is mentioned,

651
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:51,060
this is the only thing I will remember.

652
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:54,110
If you recall

653
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,300
everything later,

654
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:57,870
you can always

655
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,740
do what you think

656
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,450
is right.

657
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,730
Soft-hearted?

658
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,540
I admit.

659
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,510
I did

660
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,940
have a slimmer of hope.

661
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,160
I thought

662
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,550
perhaps he was also used

663
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:25,390
by Lord Huaiyang.

664
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,940
Maybe he had no choice.

665
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,770
Only in this way

666
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,280
could I justify

667
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,120
my soft-heartedness.

668
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:34,650
If you...

669
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,420
Anyway, he's going to marry you.

670
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:38,430
Marry me?

671
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,330
What he wants to marry is not me,

672
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:45,940
but the canary he has raised.

673
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,540
The woman who only

674
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,170
has eyes for him.

675
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,650
It's just his delusion.

676
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:58,330
The deeper his feelings,

677
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,650
the more ironic and ridiculous it seems.

678
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,400
I've played this self-deceiving role

679
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,240
enough.

680
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:08,500
So I won't be soft-hearted anymore.

681
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,170
Mother, you're awake.

682
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,100
Wake up for what?

683
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,580
I might as well sleep it off,

684
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,170
so everyone could get peace.

685
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,770
My Lord, Consort Dowager.

686
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:51,020
Time for the medicine.

687
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:54,830
My Lord.

688
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,730
You haven't slept all night.

689
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,540
You should rest early.

690
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,130
It's fine. Leave.

691
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:11,460
If you really can't let her go,

692
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:14,020
I can step back

693
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,650
and let her become a concubine.

694
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,130
Is she so good

695
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,510
that you'd throw away the reputation

696
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:29,940
of the entire family?

697
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:39,380
How many concubines did Father have?

698
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,430
Ten?

699
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,030
Twenty?

700
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,670
How many mistresses

701
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,020
are unknown to us?

702
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,280
What?

703
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,000
Are you using

704
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,420
your father as a shield?

705
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,420
He made a fuss.

706
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,100
Do you want to follow his example?

707
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,160
Mother,

708
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,690
the life here is rich and luxurious,

709
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,760
but it's full of scheming

710
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,020
and indifference.

711
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,720
I know you haven't had

712
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,940
an easy time these years.

713
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,610
I haven't, either.

714
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,580
I always thought

715
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,770
that if I restrained myself

716
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,460
and didn't indulge in love,

717
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,330
even if it's just to respect each other,

718
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,150
I wouldn't let

719
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:19,690
my wife and child suffer.

720
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,390
Mother.

721
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,250
For her,

722
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,810
I pretended to be an ordinary commoner

723
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,210
in a small household

724
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,280
struggling for a living,

725
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,170
burdened with countless trivial worries.

726
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,810
But she didn't seem to feel troubled.

727
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,250
She lived freely and unrestrained.

728
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,380
All she wished for us

729
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:44,980
was to be united as a couple

730
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,540
for a lifetime.

731
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,130
Only then did I realize

732
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,170
how terribly wrong I was.

733
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,080
Happiness and joy

734
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,130
must be earned with a true heart.

735
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:03,500
But I let her down

736
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,810
and overestimated myself.

737
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,640
Mother,

738
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:28,170
please forgive my unfiliality.

739
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:30,280
I don't want any more

740
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,380
mutual respect

741
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:32,770
or noble concubines.

742
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:34,770
With all the marital rites,

743
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:35,910
in this life,

744
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,060
she's the only one I want.

745
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:27,140
(Lu Wen left the capital, went west,
and didn't step into Zhenzhou.)

746
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,690
Not Lu Wen.

747
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:39,180
(Bai's Pharmacy)

748
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,500
Madam, why are you buying these medicines?

749
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,470
Wasn't my husband injured a few days ago?

750
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:48,610
It's all bruised.

751
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,420
It's nothing.

752
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,920
We still have plenty of fine

753
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,770
medicines from Physician Zhao.

754
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:55,920
These are remedies from Mrs. Yin.

755
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,760
You wouldn't know.

756
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,560
Madam.

757
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,810
What's wrong?

758
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,580
There's one more thing I need.

759
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:37,830
Master.

760
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:40,310
Where is Madam?

761
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,810
She went to the market with Nanny Li.

762
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,540
Should I go find her?

763
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:46,190
Knowing your return,

764
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:47,380
Madam will be pleased.

765
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:53,950
Hurry and go.

766
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:55,470
Yes.

767
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:02,380
Forgive me.

768
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,860
Please clarify this.

769
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,420
Madam, you're back.

770
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:16,610
Why are you standing here?

771
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,560
Where's my husband?

772
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:22,250
He didn't sleep all night,

773
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:23,900
so he took leave from the deputy.

774
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,650
He's resting now.

775
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,290
Then I'll go see him.

776
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:45,390
Honey.

777
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,200
Dear.

778
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,150
I thought

779
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:50,210
you were already asleep.

780
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,730
I did lie down,

781
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,670
but I couldn't fall asleep.

782
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:57,860
I might as well read a book.

783
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,130
What book are you reading?

784
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,810
A good strategist

785
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:06,810
would take the initiative.

786
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,250
Void and Actuality.

787
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:11,460
The Art of War?

788
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,030
Since you joined the army,

789
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,400
you've changed a lot.

790
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,440
You read military strategy

791
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,730
as if it were light reading.

792
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,540
I found it casually

793
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,380
and just skimmed through.

794
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:33,590
It's the Little New Year,
yet you had to take leave.

795
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:35,610
The army is really unreasonable.

796
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:37,960
Others

797
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,170
don't have the privilege I have

798
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:41,770
to return home at night

799
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:43,610
and have dinner with their wife.

800
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,640
Alright.

801
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,320
Are you going to keep lying down

802
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,940
or come with me to the kitchen?

803
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,020
I'm going to cook today.

804
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,460
I'm indeed a bit tired.

805
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:57,470
Sure.

806
00:42:57,990 --> 00:42:59,060
I'll wake you up later.

807
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,640
Okay.

808
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,760
Dear,

809
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:03,690
is there crab roe rice?

810
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,510
What are you thinking?

811
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:07,550
At this time of year,

812
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:08,460
there's no crab roe.

813
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,560
