=Episode 26=

14
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:48,410
It's been so long.
Why hasn't the girl come out yet?

15
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,100
Do you even need to ask?

16
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,890
His Lordship is a vigorous man.

17
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:12,140
(Where are the great men of the past)

18
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,850
Why are you looking at me?
Look at your writing.

19
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,970
That stroke, the pen, pause,
pause for a moment.

20
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,500
My lord, I barely recognize a few characters,
let alone practicing calligraphy.

21
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,180
(Where are the great men of the past?
And where are those of future years?)

22
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,260
(The sky and earth forever last;
Here and now I alone shed tears.)

23
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,790
Not only did he not touch me,
but he also forced me

24
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,060
to practice writing all night.

25
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,220
Even now, my wrist is sore.

26
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,940
Do you still remember what he made you write?

27
00:02:54,550 --> 00:03:00,850
I only recognize something
like "men of the past, sky, and earth".

28
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,530
Where are the great men of the past?
And where are those of future years?

29
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:08,500
he sky and earth forever last;
Here and now I alone shed tears.

30
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,730
That's all the characters.

31
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:11,940
You may leave now.

32
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,620
It seems Cui Xingzhou
is feeling quite troubled.

33
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,250
It must be because he hasn't achieved his goal
on this trip.

34
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,500
I think he will soon return disappointed.

35
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,570
Lord Huaiyang is not an ordinary person.

36
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:36,570
He wouldn't come all the way here to give up.

37
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,970
This poem was clearly a message for you,
my lord.

38
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,380
I'm afraid there are hidden meanings within it.

39
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,570
Deliver this secret letter
to the capital immediately.

40
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,730
About Lord You...

41
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:02,340
He has made up his mind.
There's no point in persuading him.

42
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:06,280
His Majesty has promised to make the first lord
to come to the capital

43
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,690
the Monetary Commissioner
of the four counties in Beizhou.

44
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:16,260
I believe many of the northern lords
are farsighted and pragmatic.

45
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,730
He never mentioned to me
that His Majesty had made such a promise.

46
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:40,610
Well played, Lord Huaiyang. He deceived me.

47
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,730
Even if these lords in the Northern Region
are favored by the imperial court,

48
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,170
who can shake your position?

49
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:54,170
I don't care about others,
but if it's that person...

50
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,030
Keep watching.

51
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,350
I want to know all of Cui Xingzhou's movements.

52
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,190
Yes.

53
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:06,140
My lord, do you not need
to take more troops to Beizhou?

54
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,400
No need.

55
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,970
There are some important matters
that I must handle alone.

56
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,210
- These are two bolts of silk.
- Take a look.

57
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,720
- What about that one?
- Top-quality animal hides.

58
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,680
- Four bolts of silk, eight bolts of silk.
- Take a look, take a look.

59
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:23,950
Look.

60
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,080
- I'll take this one.
- Okay.

61
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,900
Take a look.

62
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,650
- Pack it up.
- Pack it up.

63
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,090
- You have a good eye.
- Top-quality animal hides.

64
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:28,960
Sister, I'll leave it to you.

65
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,270
- Please come inside.
- Listen, Miantang.

66
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,220
Do come again.

67
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,970
The goods are not enough to sell.

68
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,260
When the waterway
to Beizhou and Xizhou opens up,

69
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,390
we'll buy a warehouse in Xizhou.
The trade route there is broader.

70
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:45,260
With the north-south thoroughfare,
the fur business will only get bigger.

71
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:51,120
Sir, these are all top-quality animal hides.
Take a look.

72
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,410
- This one?
- How about it?

73
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:56,370
Uncle, is it far from here to Beizhou?

74
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,780
It's very close.
The official road was just built.

75
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,340
If we change horses,
it will only take a dozen days.

76
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:10,290
You little girl, are you homesick?

77
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:16,930
My grandfather should still be waiting for us
at home, right?

78
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,470
- Then this one.
- Of course.

79
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,730
- Take care.
- Let me tell you.

80
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,930
If we ever go back in the future,

81
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:28,490
we must have Mrs. Lin
make your favorite butter pastry,

82
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,580
and my favorite roast goose.

83
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,520
Our whole family will be happily together
in the courtyard.

84
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,580
No matter how big our business gets,
Beizhou will always be our home.

85
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,280
What is it?

86
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:50,850
It saves your life.

87
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:55,930
Clever girl.

88
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,050
Please enjoy, Your Highness.

89
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,020
Your Highness,

90
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,880
these pen shells were delivered
to the palace yesterday.

91
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,930
The imperial chefs selected the freshest ones.

92
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,580
Chonghua Palace is the first to receive them.

93
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,970
It smells so good.

94
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,220
Let's have a taste.

95
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,490
Yours.

96
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,260
- Yours.
- Thank you, Your Highness.

97
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,290
The chefs at Shi Mansion used
to make puffer fish soup too.

98
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,790
It looked similar to the one in the palace.

99
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:00,260
But the taste was worlds apart.

100
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,170
Firstly, the ingredients are fresh.

101
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,730
Secondly,

102
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,300
the imperial chefs
must have used more artemisia,

103
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,350
reed shoots, and Chinese cabbage.

104
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,260
That's why it tasted sweeter.

105
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,580
- Drink more.
- Drink it while it's hot.

106
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,870
- It's really delicious.
- It's delicious.

107
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,110
- Please have a taste.
- Have a taste.

108
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:22,930
It's really good.

109
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,830
Yes, it's indeed very good.

110
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,390
- Let me pour you some, Your Highness.
- Drink more.

111
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,260
Fu Yushen seeks your audience, Your Highness.

112
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,250
Mr. Fu, what brings you here?

113
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,770
His Majesty instructed me
to invite Her Highness for a chat.

114
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:51,370
Please continue your meal, Your Highness.
I will wait here.

115
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,970
Go get the tea.

116
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:56,670
Your Highness.

117
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:07,050
The Ministry of Rites has drafted the list
of noble ladies to be conferred a rank.

118
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,180
You should take a look.

119
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,650
Yes, Your...

120
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,370
Your Majesty.

121
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:22,700
(List of Noble Ladies)

122
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:27,140
(First Rank Lady, Third Rank Lady)

123
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,340
Is there any mistake or omission?

124
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,850
The Ministry of Rites
has considered everything thoroughly.

125
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,510
I believe there is no mistake.

126
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,350
Nonsense.

127
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,770
Sorry, I hope Your Majesty can enlighten me.

128
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,820
Is it better now?

129
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,300
You may rise.

130
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,700
You must feel lonely in the palace.

131
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,420
I have already permitted Lady Shi
to visit the palace.

132
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,650
Thank you, Your Majesty.

133
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,340
Have you memorized my instructions?

134
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:35,890
Yes, I have.

135
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,290
It's all different now.
In the palace, you must act with caution

136
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,540
and not give others a chance to criticize you.

137
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:46,710
Understood.

138
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,650
Your Highness, Lady Shi.

139
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,760
Your Highness,

140
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,730
the Landscaping Office has sent over
the newly cultivated Rhododendrons.

141
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,890
According to the rules,
they are first brought to

142
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,890
Chonghua Palace for Your Highness
to choose from.

143
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,250
Those pink Rhododendrons are elegant and rare.

144
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,970
Her Highness is the mistress of the palace.

145
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,890
She deserves the most magnificent red color
to display her dignity.

146
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,850
But I prefer...

147
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,390
Your Highness,
do you intend to let Jingyang Palace

148
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:41,610
have the red ones
and choose those secondary colors?

149
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,180
Leave these few pots here.

150
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:48,950
Yes.

151
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:57,700
No matter how rare the color,
it is for consorts.

152
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,060
It cannot be here.

153
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,090
I had hoped you could assist your father
in the palace

154
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,010
and secure protection for our family.

155
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,200
But you are so timid.

156
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,820
This encourages the arrogance
of the woman in Jingyang Palace.

157
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,920
Mother, the situation has just stabilized.

158
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:33,650
I am also cautious in the palace
and it is not appropriate to stir up conflicts.

159
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,770
Your inaction stands for our family's inaction.

160
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,010
It's just a small matter, why be so petty?

161
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,140
Xueji, do you know

162
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,580
how you got your position as Empress?

163
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:02,890
I can see that you are a smart child.

164
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,770
Naturally,
you know what His Majesty values

165
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,100
is your father and our family's support.

166
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,500
Therefore, the Empress has to

167
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:15,650
be a daughter of the Shi Family.

168
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:20,180
You're the Empress,
and also the Empress of the Shi Family.

169
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:27,250
In the past,
you might have relied on some wild luck.

170
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:32,700
But if you cannot perform your duties
to the family,

171
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,610
your father will have to choose another
from his many sensible daughters.

172
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,060
I see.

173
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,770
See Lady Shi off.

174
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,060
Good bye, Madam.

175
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,540
Your Highness, Lady Shi has left.

176
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:21,220
Songhua,
do you find this Rhododendron beautiful?

177
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,340
This is not something left over by others.

178
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:34,130
This is the best Rhododendron in the world.

179
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:45,010
I originally thought
that escaping the cage would make a difference.

180
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:58,340
But in fact, nothing has changed.

181
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:12,300
(Qiao Residence)

182
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:25,780
(Strive for Perfection)

183
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,180
Father, please spare me, Father.

184
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,920
If it weren't for the New Emperor's ascension
and the Government Office

185
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,160
sending two Pardon Decrees,

186
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,310
would you two rebellious sons have planned

187
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:45,490
to keep the matter
of Mount Yang hidden forever?

188
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,610
Hiding it from me
until the entire family is executed?

189
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,710
Father, I don't have such courage.

190
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:53,830
I was just helping to cover it up.
It was all my elder brother's idea.

191
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:58,220
I left the family affairs to you,
not for you to protect and help them.

192
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,200
Father, you can't keep hitting him, Father.

193
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,010
If you keep hitting, my elder brother will die.

194
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,970
It's almost enough. I'm bleeding.

195
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:10,420
Since you have the face to come back,
you should know

196
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:13,320
- that I must beat you to death.
- Yes, yes.

197
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:16,560
Miantang is so young,
it's one thing to take her along for mischief,

198
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,700
but involving her in such disputes is another.

199
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,830
It was her idea.

200
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:22,770
What did you say?

201
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,030
I mean,
I shouldn't have caused trouble

202
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,970
with Miantang
and brought this disaster upon us.

203
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,120
Father, I was wrong.

204
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,040
But Miantang and I helped the Emperor.

205
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,220
Now that the New Emperor
has ascended the throne,

206
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,440
we can stay home with fame.

207
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,020
From now on,
we'll live a peaceful life

208
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,840
and no longer meddle in political affairs.

209
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,680
Nonsense.

210
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,160
The Emperor's followers all get promoted
and ennobled in the capital.

211
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,080
You were just cannon fodder.

212
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,860
An inconsequential Pardon Decree

213
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,830
that exempts you from corvée
and forgives past offenses

214
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,320
is all you have.

215
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,160
Yes.

216
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:58,340
The political situation
will still be chaotic for a while.

217
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,830
You two listen to me,
you must not get involved in

218
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:03,250
these disputes again.

219
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:08,210
From now on,
you must never speak of this matter to anyone.

220
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,650
- Yes.
- Keep a low profile and live quietly.

221
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,760
Yes.

222
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,980
Is there anything else you're hiding from me?

223
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,980
No, just this one thing.

224
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:25,020
Master, Miss Liu has returned.

225
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,280
Dad.

226
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:07,710
Grandfather.

227
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,030
Dad.

228
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,100
Why are you hitting yourself?

229
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:14,580
Take it out on me if you must,
why hit yourself?

230
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,890
I'm back.

231
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:42,930
All these years,
I always thought you could stay

232
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:46,340
in the capital as Mrs. Cui.

233
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:49,770
I even hoped you would have a child soon
and live a happy life,

234
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:53,100
supporting your husband
and educating your child.

235
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,170
But what did you do?

236
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:57,750
It's my unfilial behavior
that has disappointed your expectations.

237
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,850
You are indeed unfilial.

238
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,770
Tell me honestly,

239
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,780
what exactly is going on
between you and His Majesty?

240
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,210
Please don't get too upset. I'll tell you.

241
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:14,260
Ziyu is an old friend that my uncle made
during his early years as a bodyguard.

242
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:20,690
I met him at that time,
but I didn't know who he was.

243
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,630
Later,
I didn't want a blind marriage

244
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,450
and become the wife of Cui Jiu
whom I had never met.

245
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:30,450
So I begged my uncle
to seek refuge at Mount Yang.

246
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:37,300
But I knew well that you would not want me
to associate with people of unknown origin.

247
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,100
That's why I resorted
to this desperate measure.

248
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,130
Pretending to get married
and using the name of mountain bandits,

249
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,930
I orchestrated this absurd elopement drama.

250
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:55,060
After I went to Mount Yang,
I spent every day with Ziyu.

251
00:19:55,470 --> 00:20:00,500
Gradually, I came to know
who he was and understood his plans.

252
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,440
You and your uncle kept me
in the dark all along.

253
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,300
You two really put on a good show.

254
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,980
All these years, you have been
with His Majesty?

255
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,370
I deserve punishment for deceiving you
all this time.

256
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,300
But now, I don't want more people
to know about it.

257
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,690
I hope you will keep this secret for me.

258
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,370
No matter what happened in the past,

259
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:41,980
now he is the ruler
and has nothing to do with me.

260
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:45,540
At least in these years,
I have become self-reliant

261
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,580
and learned a lot about doing business.

262
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,300
I will stay in Beizhou and earn some money
to supplement the household expenses.

263
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,890
Once my life is stable,
I will help my uncles

264
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,100
to reorganize the escort agency.

265
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:58,890
What good is it to have seen some of the world?

266
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,370
From today on, stay at home obediently.

267
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,500
My escort agency can still hold on.

268
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,300
You don't need to worry about business matters.

269
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,500
Did he really go to Beizhou?

270
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,610
Absolutely.

271
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,450
Lord Huaiyang should have entered the city
by now.

272
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:24,880
If Lord Beizhou receives the reward,
won't he be like a tiger with wings?

273
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,690
Wouldn't he soon outrank me?

274
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:38,060
My lord, you're full of concerns
and unwilling to go to the capital.

275
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:42,020
Lord Beizhou is not someone easy
to deal with either.

276
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,580
What you say makes a lot of sense.

277
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:53,580
Given Lord Beizhou's fiery temper,

278
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:58,610
Lord Huaiyang will definitely not
have a good time there.

279
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,550
I will not go to the capital no matter what.

280
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:08,500
I will not covet the reward from His Majesty.

281
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,890
His Majesty knows
that you're apprehensive

282
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:13,410
about going to the capital,
so he specifically asked me to bring a message.

283
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:16,500
Over the years,
the correspondence

284
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,780
between the lords of Beizhou and the Wu clan

285
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:21,450
has all been in the hands of His Majesty.

286
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:25,580
However, he did not read a single letter
before burning them all.

287
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,980
So, what's your point?

288
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:31,050
I know you're afraid
of the new emperor's reckoning,

289
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:34,130
fearing to lose your lordship and family.

290
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,300
On my way to Beizhou,
I saw the great landscape.

291
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,010
Beautiful mountains and rivers,
thousands of grand mansions,

292
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,100
and vast fertile lands.

293
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,540
But that's all you have.

294
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:51,300
To confront the imperial court,
you still lack the leverage.

295
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:58,650
Do you think that I will be intimidated
by what you said?

296
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:02,230
Lord Huaiyang, you came from Youzhou, right?

297
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,740
Did they give you cold shoulders?

298
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,900
Even Lord You is unwilling
to go to the capital.

299
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,850
Why should I be the one to take the lead?

300
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:15,410
Lord You is a wise man.

301
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:20,300
I just need to give him some time to think,
and he will naturally go to the capital.

302
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:26,060
Lord Huaiyang, why are you still holding on?

303
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:31,580
Even though Lord You is foolish,
he is not willing to be a scapegoat.

304
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:02,410
If you still don't believe me,
then I can only willingly become a hostage.

305
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,210
Just detain me in Beizhou.

306
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:07,650
As for whether Lord You
is a touchstone or a scapegoat,

307
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,750
you will just have to wait and see the result.

308
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,410
It won't harm you in the slightest.

309
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:16,230
If Lord You goes to the capital
to pay homage and returns safely as I said,

310
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:21,340
you will know how benevolent
and honest His Majesty is.

311
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,160
What if he doesn't return?

312
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,650
Then you can kill me for breaking my promise.

313
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:31,840
Cui, are you trying to lure me into a trap?

314
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,130
So you can have a good reason
to wage war against Beizhou.

315
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:37,930
I came with only this many attendants.

316
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:42,120
My troops are stationed far north
of the great river.

317
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,340
They are far from Youzhou and your Beizhou.

318
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:49,650
If I wanted to lure you into a trap,
I wouldn't have the capability.

319
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:55,350
Alright.

320
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,760
Alright.

321
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,170
Since you want to stay as a hostage,

322
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:03,500
then let's follow your words
and take this step first.

323
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,950
But during this period,
if you leave Beizhou even half a step,

324
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:08,540
don't blame me for being rude.

325
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,820
I won't.

326
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:12,460
Magistrate Li Guangcai is an old friend of mine
from the imperial examination.

327
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:14,890
We haven't seen each other for many years.

328
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:21,170
It'll be convenient for me to live with him.
I hope you will permit it.

329
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,650
Since you're willing to risk your life
as a hostage,

330
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:27,890
I will grant you this convenience.

331
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,000
Stop the carriage.

332
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,210
- My lord.
- Don't follow me.

333
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:14,780
Since we parted in the capital,
I didn't expect to meet you here.

334
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,690
Sorry, I mistook you for someone else.

335
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,850
Sir, how much is this?

336
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,410
Wumei Courtyard.

337
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,780
Just a random name.

338
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,100
This small courtyard of mine is not even
as good as the woodshed in your residence.

339
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,820
Had I known you were coming,
I would have repaired it properly.

340
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:05,100
Such a scene brings back memories.

341
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:10,890
I really didn't expect that you would come
to Beizhou as a hostage

342
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:14,260
regardless of your own safety.

343
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:17,930
You have a backup plan, right?

344
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,850
It's not much of a plan.

345
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:27,820
As long as I stay in Beizhou, behave myself,
and treat the Lord Beizhou kindly,

346
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:31,650
some people will naturally become anxious.

347
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:35,690
I knew you were not someone
who acted on impulse.

348
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:41,540
If this succeeds,
it will be a great achievement.

349
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,710
Lord Huaiyang,
with your illustrious military achievements,

350
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:51,020
have you thought about what kind of reward
you want to ask from His Majesty?

351
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,890
It's still too early to say.

352
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:59,450
However, I do have a request.

353
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:05,540
By the way, there's something.
I'm not sure if I should mention it.

354
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,200
Go ahead.

355
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:10,210
It's actually not a big deal.

356
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:13,930
The Qiao Family is looking for a son-in-law.

357
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,690
Looking for a son-in-law?

358
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,370
Is she in such a hurry to get married?

359
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,130
Yes.

360
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,880
Back when this happened in your family,

361
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,000
Princess Dowager Chu married your sister
to a man in the capital.

362
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:29,100
How long has it been?

363
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,280
Alright, looking for a son-in-law.

364
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:35,100
What did you just say?

365
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,690
Nothing.

366
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,340
Do they have any other movements?

367
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,890
That, I wouldn't know.

368
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,040
Alright.

369
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:54,690
Aunt.

370
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,020
Miantang.

371
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,200
I was afraid you might not be used to the cold

372
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,070
in Beizhou after staying
in the capital for so long.

373
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:04,370
I asked Qingying to bring her quilt for you.

374
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,550
Aunt, thank you for your concern.
Please have a seat.

375
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,410
Cousin.

376
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,930
Qingying, long time no see.

377
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,060
Why did you tell me you were coming,
so I could have welcomed you?

378
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,690
I just want to take a good look
around this courtyard.

379
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:23,600
Haitang Courtyard is still the same as before.
Nothing has changed.

380
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,610
It's Yuying.

381
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,780
After I moved in,
this place was renamed Yuying Courtyard.

382
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,100
Silly girl, your cousin just returned,
why are you telling her all this?

383
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,850
You are the eldest legitimate daughter
of the Qiao Family.

384
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,300
Are you afraid your cousin
will take your inheritance?

385
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:44,390
Miantang,
I see you have become

386
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:47,370
much thinner since you got married.

387
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:50,060
You must have suffered a lot
at your husband's family.

388
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:57,100
I fell seriously ill the year before last,
so I didn't remember many things clearly.

389
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:00,360
Therefore,
I have been living in seclusion

390
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:03,060
in a separate residence of my husband's family,
but I haven't suffered much.

391
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:07,580
However, because of my illness,
I cannot bear offspring.

392
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:15,260
So, no matter how kind my husband's family is,
they only have one child.

393
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,670
After my health improved, we discussed

394
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,020
and decided on an amicable separation.

395
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,450
Poor child.

396
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:29,170
Here, take this money.

397
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:32,980
If you lack anything in the future,
just tell me.

398
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,850
It's not easy for you, Aunt,
to manage the household.

399
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:39,740
Even though the nights are cold,
you wear such thin brocade.

400
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:42,930
It breaks my heart.

401
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,780
These are all made of hemp cloth.

402
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,930
I only have a few clothes,
so I wear them in rotation.

403
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,300
You're so frugal.

404
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,410
This is a small token from me.
I hope you can accept it.

405
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,820
What is this?

406
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:04,090
I am currently staying
at my maternal grandparents' home,

407
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:06,980
and all my living expenses need to be covered.

408
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:12,610
Although this is not much,
it is enough for the current expenses.

409
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,920
Miantang, you don't have to do this.

410
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,960
This is not appropriate.

411
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,890
I'm one more mouth to feed,
so I have to cover the expenses.

412
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,740
Aunt, please don't decline it.

413
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:32,930
Since you put it that way, I won't refuse.

414
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,980
Quick, give the quilt to your cousin.

415
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:46,500
Oh my, so much money!

416
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,930
This little girl really knows
how to read the situation.

417
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:52,850
She knows who to bow to in this family.

418
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,830
Although Grandfather
seemed very angry when she returned,

419
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,500
he favors her in his heart.

420
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,300
Not only did he give her this courtyard,

421
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:03,300
he also gave her a new Su Silk quilt cover,
which even I hadn't seen before.

422
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:05,690
It must be a treasured item
from Grandfather's private collection.

423
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:08,340
Don't you know this girl's tactics?

424
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,310
Even before she moved into the Qiao Family,

425
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,780
she was always trying
to win your grandfather's favor.

426
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,780
Indeed, in a few days,
I'll ask for a quilt like that for you too.

427
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,370
I'll say it's for your dowry.

428
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,860
Mother,
that Su Silk quilt cover

429
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,100
isn't anything special.

430
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:30,610
You know she's been scheming
since she was young.

431
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,210
Don't let her money cloud your judgment.

432
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:37,450
She said it was an
amicable separation or whatever.

433
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,210
Do you really believe her?

434
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:43,820
She was probably divorced and rushed back
to claim her share of the family property.

435
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,940
Early this morning,
I asked Li the Blind to do a divination,

436
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:03,200
and today is very auspicious.

437
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,980
It's the perfect day to look
at marriage prospects.

438
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:18,260
The lady who just passed by must be
from the Qiao Family.

439
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:24,370
Considering her age, she must be Miss Qiao.

440
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:29,210
I can't believe she's so elegant.

441
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,740
She is Master Qiao's granddaughter.

442
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:39,410
Her father's family is in decline,
so she is temporarily staying with us.

443
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,100
I wonder if you are in charge
of this young lady's age card.

444
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,740
She is not a Qiao.

445
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:54,280
Well, you should ask
my father-in-law about this.

446
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,370
I am not sure.

447
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,920
Miantang,

448
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:22,610
why did you send Lu Zhong back to Beizhou
in advance without discussing it with me?

449
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:25,180
Previously,
you mentioned that the situation

450
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:27,330
at home was not good,
but you were vague about it.

451
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,950
I thought,
if the family was not in dire straits,

452
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:34,020
you would not have brought it up.

453
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,810
You girls should not be troubled
by family matters.

454
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:42,210
As you said, it's a family matter.
Am I not a part of this family?

455
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,020
Lu Zhong went to Beizhou as a merchant.

456
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,900
He found out that my grandfather was looking
for a buyer for the Escort Agency.

457
00:34:55,880 --> 00:35:01,460
I didn't know the family is so destitute now.

458
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:05,730
Someone wants my grandfather's property
for a dowry.

459
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,580
Even the matchmaker personally
went to greet them.

460
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,020
How could my grandfather not be anxious?

461
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,610
It seems you've had a plan all along.

462
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,540
I am preparing to give a reply to Lu Zhong
and hope you can assist me.

463
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:44,020
I remember that you love meat, Grandfather.

464
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:48,210
As I get older, my appetite is declining.

465
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:50,250
You are too thin.

466
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:57,130
Later, take an extra five hundred coins
from the accounts to nourish her properly.

467
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,120
Yes.

468
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:04,060
Has Qingying's matter been settled?

469
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,420
Not yet.

470
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:11,580
The Su Family showed no concern for Qingying
but kept asking the matchmaker about Miantang.

471
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:15,290
As her aunt, I can't say much.

472
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,860
I can only say that you're a generous
and kind man.

473
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,510
You favor the divorced granddaughter
more than your legitimate granddaughter

474
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:25,170
who has not yet married.

475
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:29,310
It's alright to tell the
Su Family about Miantang.

476
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:31,250
It has to be
discussed eventually.

477
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,980
By the way,
let the matchmaker find a good family.

478
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,640
It would be best
if my granddaughters could get married

479
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:41,960
on the same day with a grand ceremony.

480
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,540
Good things come in pairs, after all.

481
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:47,380
I never thought about getting married,
nor do I plan to remarry.

482
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:52,940
I will find you a husband
according to Qingying's standards.

483
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:55,130
Don't worry.

484
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,860
Father, having both ladies
marry at the same time

485
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:01,770
would indeed be a double blessing.

486
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:07,800
But if we follow Qingying's marriage standards
and prepare two dowries,

487
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,730
then we will barely be able
to manage a decent meal in the future.

488
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,580
I will not get married.

489
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,460
Nonsense, how can a woman not get married?

490
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,610
A woman doesn't necessarily have
to get married to have a meal.

491
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:28,770
I want to revive the family business
and live my own way.

492
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:32,420
I'll sustain myself. Don't worry, Grandfather.

493
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,980
As for those who love to gossip,

494
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,940
they must be jealous that my life
is better than theirs.

495
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,060
I should be happy about that.

496
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:45,690
Aunt, when eating rice tofu,

497
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,900
you need to dip it in vinegar
to get the crab flavor.

498
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:58,330
Miantang, when have I ever
let you go hungry at home?

499
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:04,060
I have already chosen a buyer
for the Shenwei Escort Agency.

500
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:07,170
You don't need to worry
about the family business or money.

501
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,900
I have worked hard
in Beizhou for most of my life.

502
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:14,610
Do you think I can't even afford
my granddaughter's dowry?

503
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,130
What a joke.

504
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,060
The flowers are blooming
exceptionally well this spring.

505
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,170
Have you two ever seen such a beautiful scene
in previous years?

506
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,810
None can compare to this spring.

507
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,690
Your Highness,

508
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,500
actually, I might have seen you
when I was young.

509
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:53,660
When I was young,
I often accompanied my mother

510
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:55,690
to visit Lady Shi
at the Shi Mansion in Qingzhou.

511
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,850
At that time, your elder sister Xueshuang

512
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,590
was still unmarried.

513
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,500
She and I were quite close.

514
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,060
Xueshuang was an expert in perfumery.

515
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,650
I learned the art of fragrance from her.

516
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,900
It's been so long that I don't remember much.

517
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:18,810
But your fragrance is familiar.
It's from my sister's prescription.

518
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,690
You must be mistaken.

519
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,710
You are the younger sister
of the Minister of Rites

520
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,540
and the legitimate daughter of Duke Li.

521
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,050
Naturally, you would associate

522
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,030
with the legitimate daughters
of the Shi Family.

523
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:31,350
At that time,
Her Highness was secluded

524
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:33,290
in the inner chambers,
and there was a distinction between

525
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:34,650
legitimate and concubine-born daughters.

526
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:35,650
How could you have seen her?

527
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,250
Thinking about it,
it seems I was indeed careless.

528
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:54,630
She actually said there is a distinction

529
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,460
between legitimate
and concubine-born daughters.

530
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,770
That's all the passing eunuch
in the Imperial Garden heard.

531
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:05,420
Her Highness did not respond
and endured it herself at that time.

532
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:16,590
These Hele Meatballs are truly crispy
on the outside and tender on the inside.

533
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:18,980
One bite fills your mouth with savory flavor.

534
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:24,060
Your Highness should publish a book called,
Food Commentary from the Imperial Kitchen.

535
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:33,210
Your Majesty.

536
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:40,350
Rise.

537
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,420
You're enjoying it quite well.

538
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,980
Your Majesty, how do you like fragrance?

539
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,810
It's soothing.

540
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:18,020
But the scent is somewhat unusual.
I've never smelled it before.

541
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:22,130
What kind of fragrance is it?

542
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:26,100
It's the one I used when I was young.
It's nothing special.

543
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:30,810
But if Your Majesty likes it,
you can ask Consort Rong about it.

544
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,250
She is an expert in fragrance.

545
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:36,500
Consort Rong.

546
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,170
The fragrances she uses
are even more exquisite.

547
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,130
How has His Majesty been treating you lately?

548
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,540
With great favor.

549
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,240
In the past,
he would come to my palace

550
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:56,810
once every six or seven days.

551
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:59,460
But this month,
he comes every two or three days.

552
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:03,810
He even allowed me to take leave
on the first and fifteenth of each month

553
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:05,860
to visit you and my foster mother.

554
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,380
Very good.

555
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,610
Arranging for Consort Rong to enter the palace

556
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:19,940
was to assist you, not to divide your favor.

557
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:22,690
This is my intention.

558
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:25,580
I understand, Father.

559
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,660
What unusual actions has
that concubine-born girl

560
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:29,170
of the Shi Family taken?

561
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,940
Shi Xueji has shown no reaction
to another consort in the harem.

562
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,730
On the contrary, she gets along well
with Consort Rong.

563
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,420
She often seeks her advice on qin, chess,
calligraphy, and painting.

564
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:46,210
Well, she knows her place well.

565
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:50,860
She learns these skills
because she's aware of her inelegance.

566
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:54,610
Go greet your foster mother.

567
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,730
