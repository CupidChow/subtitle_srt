Fly.

00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,020
Fly.

19
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:56,510
Your Majesty.

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,410
I'm Shi Yikuan.

21
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,160
Greetings, Your Majesty,

22
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,140
Empress Dowager.

23
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,530
Wishing Your Majesty boundless fortune,

24
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,340
and the Empress Dowager longevity.

25
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,180
You used to be the Chief Commander,

26
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,380
in charge of Qingzhou.

27
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,530
Now, you're in the capital.

28
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,810
Are you used to it?

29
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,250
Whether it's Qingzhou

30
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,620
or the capital,

31
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,970
it's all under the Emperor's rule.

32
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,130
Whether as a commander

33
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,970
or as a minister,

34
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,460
I serve

35
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,660
to manage troops for His Majesty

36
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,180
and relive his worries.

37
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,430
Take a seat.

38
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,290
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

39
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,510
Your Majesty.

40
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,670
I want some sugary cakes.

41
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,690
You. Get some for me.

42
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,730
Are you the leader of Mount Yang,

43
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,690
now under imperial pardon?

44
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,530
Thanks to your grace

45
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,810
for accepting us,

46
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,940
so we can have a chance to return

47
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,250
to the right path.

48
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,920
Take a seat.

49
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,230
Thank you.

50
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,620
How handsome.

51
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,100
Seems the minister

52
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,970
got a fine son-in-law.

53
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,660
It's all thanks to your favor.

54
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,830
Ziyu,

55
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,800
didn't you prepare a grand gift

56
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,530
for the Empress Dowager?

57
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,810
Seeing

58
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,180
the imperial wealth,

59
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,530
I now

60
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,340
feel it's inadequate.

61
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,010
Bring it up.

62
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:30,410
The vital of the North Sea

63
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,820
lies in Mount Ling.

64
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,050
A mountain can only hold one stone.

65
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,290
I think

66
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,050
the Queen Mother nurtures all,

67
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,370
just like you

68
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,780
granted rebirth to Mount Yang.

69
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,370
So, I present this statue

70
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,460
to express my determination
to submit to the court.

71
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,730
How could I

72
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,460
ignore your sincerity?

73
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,160
From now on...

74
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,530
The Grand Empress Dowager arrives.

75
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,370
Grand Empress Dowager.

76
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,580
Grandmother.

77
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,320
Grand Empress Dowager

78
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,260
usually stays secluded.

79
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,100
Why today, do you
take an interest in coming here?

80
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,780
How thoughtful of you

81
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,120
to remember today

82
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,050
is the late Crown Prince's death anniversary.

83
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,850
You even prepared a banquet.

84
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,820
This...

85
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,050
But the dishes

86
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,170
are too heavy.

87
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,900
The colors of the clothes are too bright.

88
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,140
Change them.

89
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,660
Today, the Minister of War assumes office.

90
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,490
I specifically summoned him.

91
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:57,730
The late Crown Prince
died suddenly at a prime age,

92
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,850
leading to today's situation where you rule

93
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,410
on behalf of the young Emperor.

94
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,370
Today,

95
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,530
instead of mourning him,

96
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,970
you are here holding a banquet

97
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:13,460
with a minister.

98
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,820
People will talk.

99
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,290
Empress Dowager,

100
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,780
aren't you afraid?

101
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,970
The late Crown Prince was kind

102
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,530
and an example for all.

103
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,820
No one dares forget his death anniversary.

104
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,220
The Empress Dowager summoned Minister Shi

105
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,830
to remind him

106
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,820
to be a kind official,

107
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,490
like the late Crown Prince.

108
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,930
As for the dishes and clothes,

109
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,440
while extravagance is
inappropriate on such a day,

110
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,280
neither

111
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,820
should we be too frugal.

112
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,920
If the common people think

113
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,000
the treasury is empty,

114
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,930
it might

115
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,660
cause instability and threaten

116
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,340
the foundation of the state.

117
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,260
How dare you!

118
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,050
The Grand Empress Dowager hasn't spoken yet.

119
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,970
Who allows you to speak?

120
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,730
I didn't expect such talent

121
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,900
from the underworld.

122
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,480
Your Majesty,

123
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,660
you value talents.

124
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,780
How about appointing him as a secretary

125
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,120
in the Ministry of War,

126
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,580
working alongside the Minister?

127
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,890
As Mother said.

128
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,420
Thank you, Your Majesty.

129
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,420
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

130
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,940
(Won.)
Such changes

131
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,890
(Governor committed suicide.)
happened in Xizhou.

132
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,820
According to the letter,

133
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,200
Governor Sheng

134
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,130
likely took his own life out of guilt.

135
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,420
I don't care whether he felt guilty.

136
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,820
Either way, A Gushan was defeated,

137
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,890
bringing glory to the Qi Kingdom.

138
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,180
But it's a pity

139
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,970
that Cui didn't die

140
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,420
on the battlefield.

141
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,240
His victory

142
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,060
was merely luck.

143
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,650
So what if it was luck?

144
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,300
He'll still enter the capital
triumphantly to present prisoners.

145
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:43,300
Just the thought of having to reward him

146
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,850
makes me sick.

147
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,770
If he is rewarded again,

148
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,650
I fear the people will only

149
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,610
know Lord Huaiyang

150
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,700
and forget the Emperor.

151
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,130
How dare he!

152
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,010
A lord of a different surname.

153
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,800
I will never let him enter the capital

154
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,060
and threaten the Emperor.

155
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,340
Shi Yikuan.

156
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,460
I value you so much.

157
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,650
What do you think?

158
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,490
I do have a plan,

159
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:21,850
which I wish to discuss with you.

160
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:28,460
Greetings, Grand Empress Dowager.

161
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,730
Weren't you appointed
as a secretary in the Ministry of War?

162
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,130
Why such humility?

163
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:42,850
Without the decree,

164
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,580
I dare not overstep.

165
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,250
In "The Great Perfection of Wisdom Treatise",

166
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,200
it says, "Worst thing happened."

167
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,490
"Best thing didn't."

168
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,540
"Burned by the fire of regret,"

169
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,540
"one falls into the evil path."

170
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,300
Have you read the scriptures?

171
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:03,730
Only scratched the surface.

172
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,400
Come closer.

173
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,340
Lift your head.

174
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,010
Why did you become a bandit?

175
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,850
Parents died early.

176
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,540
Nothing left to rely on.

177
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,060
I just wanted to survive.

178
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,850
I see a kind face,

179
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,700
a bit familiar,

180
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:53,180
but sadly,

181
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,650
you're just a person who follows power,

182
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:01,130
like your father-in-law Shi Yikuan,

183
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,040
flattering

184
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,770
and showing off

185
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,730
in front of the Emperor.

186
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,850
I have seen too many of your kind.

187
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,700
Your reprimand is justified.

188
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:23,610
Today, I remind you.

189
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,890
Aiding the tiger will eventually

190
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,250
lead to being harmed by it.

191
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,340
(Old friends can't be seen.)

192
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,370
(The Hanjiang River flows east.)

193
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,940
(For the innocent diseased,)

194
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,100
(I will find the culprit)

195
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,490
(and let them pay with blood.)

196
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,650
(I will avenge you.)

197
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,540
(I hope you can rest in peace soon.)

198
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,250
What is happening over there?

199
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,200
This morning,

200
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,890
the Governor's wife invited a ritual.

201
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,700
Now they are distributing porridge.

202
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,880
A ritual?

203
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,060
Don't you know?

204
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,320
The Governor died

205
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,580
in his mansion last night.

206
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,100
Governor Sheng died?

207
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,240
How did he die?

208
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:45,420
- No one knows how he died.
- Coming.

209
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,200
Maybe he died from overwork.

210
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,470
He suddenly passed away.

211
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,300
I'll head over there first.

212
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,060
What a sin.

213
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,200
Tomorrow, the team

214
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,540
will enter Xizhou City.

215
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,770
I hope you will help us

216
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,820
and not make things difficult for my brothers.

217
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,440
Mr. Lu, rest assured.

218
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,700
I know what to do.

219
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,100
I'm a night watchman in the city.

220
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,850
After midnight that day,

221
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,220
I was patrolling.

222
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,300
The escort team hit me.

223
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,010
It's strange enough to escort goods at night,

224
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,820
but they were ferocious

225
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,820
and hit me without saying a word.

226
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,650
Are you sure it was an escort cart?

227
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,680
I'm sure.

228
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,800
Their escort carts and the chests they carried

229
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,920
had special markings.

230
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,130
I couldn't have mistaken it.

231
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,540
Is there

232
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,340
anything else unusual?

233
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,100
Well...

234
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,400
The cart was particularly heavy.

235
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,420
The wheels struggled to turn.

236
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,650
No idea what they were transporting.

237
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,920
On the side of the cart,

238
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,610
something was dripping.

239
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,350
I couldn't see what it was,

240
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,010
but it smelled fishy.

241
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:02,430
Huang Gui.

242
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,760
Take him down.

243
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,680
Get an artist to draw

244
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,420
everything he described.

245
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,820
Deploy to search the city, inside and out.

246
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:09,950
Yes.

247
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,490
The dripping was human blood.

248
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,700
As you said,

249
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,010
the Pingyuan Escort Agency was slaughtered.

250
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,750
It rained that night.

251
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:26,730
Water pooled on the road.

252
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,580
Even if there was blood,

253
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,060
it wouldn't show.

254
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,650
There's something else

255
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,490
I need your help investigating.

256
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,490
(Qinchang Gate)
With one character,

257
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,420
I can tell your fortune.

258
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,610
Yin and yang, five elements.

259
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,340
Nine out of ten readings are accurate.

260
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,850
Young lady,

261
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,370
would you like to try it?

262
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,340
There are many swindlers.

263
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,460
Madam, don't be deceived.

264
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,820
As you said,

265
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,130
you're nine out of ten accurate.

266
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,580
It means one of them is inaccurate.

267
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,490
What if I get that one?

268
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:21,890
Then I won't

269
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,490
take your money.

270
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,220
Please write a character.

271
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,580
(Liu)

272
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,310
Done.

273
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:49,830
Liu means willow.

274
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,580
The willow casts shade.

275
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,340
Shade also means darkness,

276
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,820
mostly signifying adversity.

277
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,180
I presume you've been

278
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,840
worried and tired recently,

279
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,300
even facing life-threatening danger,

280
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,130
causing concern

281
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,540
among your family.

282
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,840
Sir, you've grasped the cause

283
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,930
but not the outcome.

284
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,520
As the saying goes,

285
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,500
"The bond of willow is in the tune."

286
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,960
It reflects the bond and longing

287
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,260
between me and my family.

288
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,020
Even in peril,

289
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,130
I'll find a way out

290
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,260
and survive against the odds.

291
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:28,820
The dark willows will bloom.

292
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,500
Sir, do you read palms?

293
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,130
Of course, my real talent.

294
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,450
What do you seek?

295
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,410
Family fortune.

296
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,450
Your palm lines

297
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,340
are strong.

298
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,020
From what I see,

299
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,710
your family is healthy,

300
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:09,890
no illness or pain.

301
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,600
Though life is hard,

302
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,980
with you here,

303
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,780
they can endure

304
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,450
until the clouds part and the moon shines.

305
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,100
I only wish

306
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,650
for my family's safety,

307
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,020
a roof over their heads,

308
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,410
and enough to eat.

309
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,890
I also await

310
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,980
a moment of reunion.

311
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,690
That is certain.

312
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,040
Sir, your reputation

313
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,650
is well deserved.

314
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,740
Thank you, Madam.

315
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,200
Master,

316
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,850
could you do a reading for me?

317
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,610
Your face

318
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,300
shows good fortune,

319
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,020
but

320
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,230
in your life,

321
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,500
there are three misfortunes.

322
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,340
You are now facing

323
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,410
the greatest misfortune.

324
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,650
Amazing.

325
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,500
Truly amazing.

326
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,200
Well, Master.

327
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,100
You can even see the misfortune

328
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,260
I'm facing right now.

329
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,210
What should I do?

330
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,000
Well.

331
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,650
Don't worry.

332
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:29,990
Just write it down.

333
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,740
I'll burn it before the deity.

334
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,500
It will surely turn bad luck into good.

335
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,680
Alright, alright.

336
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,740
Well.

337
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,260
Good, good.

338
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,440
Xiaolu, the beggar in the north

339
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,500
is my informant.

340
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,020
Have him leave a mark near the escort agency.

341
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,890
Qingcheng Tavern in the east of the city.

342
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,890
Your first time in the capital.

343
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,780
Where do you want to go?

344
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,890
My father warned me

345
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:22,100
to be extremely cautious in the capital.

346
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,890
I'll just stay at home.

347
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,580
That's a pity.

348
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:28,260
There are so many good foods in the capital.

349
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,650
Sugar cakes from Taoran Alley.

350
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,680
Yellow bean rolls from Linyu Pavilion.

351
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,030
Braised fish from Xisi.

352
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,540
Roast lamb in bread.

353
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,780
I'll tell Minister Shi to take you

354
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,310
to Zhuxuan Tavern

355
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:47,300
in Shili Village.

356
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,580
They have a famous green wine,

357
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,060
clear and fragrant.

358
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,170
Thank you, Young Master.

359
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:07,460
(Mansion of Crown Prince)

360
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,200
You seem very familiar

361
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,740
with the capital.

362
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,850
I used to roam the martial world

363
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,580
and stay in the capital.

364
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,890
Now, it's like revisiting

365
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,610
an old place.

366
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:35,630
How is it?

367
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,600
(Escort)

368
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,440
My Lord.

369
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,030
We found the escort carts

370
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,680
in the wasteland of the western suburbs.

371
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,930
But the boxes are all empty.

372
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,410
The bloodstains were cleaned.

373
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,100
Clearly, they dumped the bodies.

374
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,200
My Lord, these are yamen's sketches

375
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,580
of the 21 members of the agency.

376
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,220
(Qiulin Xian)

377
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,200
So many people.

378
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,170
They couldn't have gone far.

379
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,680
Order a continued search.

380
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,930
Search everywhere.

381
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,580
Find these people for me.

382
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:09,910
Yes.

383
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,660
(Noodles)

384
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,660
(Qingcheng Tavern)

385
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,520
Madam.

386
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:29,260
What's special about this noodle shop?

387
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,690
Why don't we go to the busier one

388
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,170
across the street?

389
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,680
The one is just an ordinary eatery,

390
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,750
but this one serves authentic Xizhou cuisine.

391
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,260
Their chicken blood noodles are famous.

392
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,960
Anyone passing by Xizhou

393
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,060
must try it,

394
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,850
lest the trip is not wasted.

395
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,440
Plus, this place

396
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,550
has limited daily servings.

397
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,600
We might not even

398
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,580
get any.

399
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:59,940
(Qingcheng Tavern)

400
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,150
Search.

401
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,240
Yes.

402
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,400
Check under the floorboards.

403
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,240
Yes.

404
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,800
My Lord.

405
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,930
Nothing inside.

406
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,210
This was the last house.

407
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,440
Search the back hill.

408
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,280
Yes.

409
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,070
My Lord!

410
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:07,410
- Open it.
- Yes.

411
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,520
Come!

412
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:22,500
This mark appeared in front
of the escort agency.

413
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,210
Could it be left by Qiao Xian?

414
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:26,350
No.

415
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,680
Qiao Xian

416
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,790
wouldn't expose himself by leaving

417
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:31,540
a mark to reveal his whereabouts.

418
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,020
Besides,

419
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,360
this meeting signal

420
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,820
belongs to Mount Yang.

421
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,450
The crabapple flower.

422
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,650
This reminds me of someone.

423
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:45,870
Who?

424
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,650
Perhaps this person

425
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,260
is also looking for Qiao Xian.

426
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,680
There are twenty bodies here.

427
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,520
One is missing.

428
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,580
It's the leader of the agency, Qiulin Xian.

429
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,210
Post his image across the city.

430
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:12,170
Qiulin Xian is wanted.

431
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:13,960
Yes.

432
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,260
(Wanted)

433
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:27,220
(Qiulin Xian as shown)

434
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,520
Alright.

435
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,480
Go rest now.

436
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,340
Honey, why are you back so late?

437
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,690
I was busy with official duties,

438
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,020
so I got delayed.

439
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,610
Again with the official duties.

440
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,650
Even the Lord isn't as busy as you.

441
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,790
I heard you went out

442
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:35,850
drinking and shopping.

443
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,930
Did you have fun?

444
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:41,100
Don't mention it.

445
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,550
Today, I was eager to eat

446
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,740
chicken blood noodles,

447
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:45,960
but when I got there,

448
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,020
they were all sold out.

449
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,300
I'm so disappointed.

450
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,800
What will you do?

451
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,300
I'll go early tomorrow

452
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:52,550
and wait.

453
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,820
You're really relentless

454
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,650
when it comes to food.

455
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:01,740
Not just food.

456
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,210
In other things, too.

457
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,980
If I want something,

458
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,300
I'll find a way to get it.

459
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:09,650
As long as you want it,

460
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,170
I'll find a way

461
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,450
to get it for you.

462
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,590
By the way.

463
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:22,390
Honey.

464
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,210
On my way back today,

465
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,720
I saw wanted posters

466
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,820
all over the city for that fugitive.

467
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,400
Qiulin Xian.

468
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,740
Who is he?

469
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,980
He's an escort.

470
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,980
What crime did he commit?

471
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,600
He's involved in the agency's

472
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,440
murder case.

473
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:46,610
The Lord is determined to investigate.

474
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,780
I have to help with the investigation tomorrow.

475
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,300
How will you investigate?

476
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,930
It's official business. I can't tell you.

477
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,400
You only need to know

478
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,500
to stay indoors.

479
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:02,880
Don't go out.

480
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,060
Just be safe.

481
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,540
You're amazing, honey.

482
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,100
For a month,

483
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,610
you've already been a centurion.

484
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,150
And now,

485
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,850
Lord Huaiyang has

486
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,020
entrusted you

487
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,780
with this big case.

488
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,020
I'm so fortunate.

489
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,820
Why would I ever leave the house?

490
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,840
I'll just stay home

491
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,610
and wait for your salary.

492
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,300
I just played Go

493
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,020
with the Lord

494
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:40,680
and got to know him a bit.

495
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,100
He's just helping me out.

496
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,040
Dear.

497
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,020
I sense you're hiding something

498
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,850
in your eyes.

499
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:06,610
Is there something you want to tell me?

500
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,300
It's useless to say.

501
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,980
It's about official duties.

502
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,130
I can't say.

503
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,300
Consider it idle chatter at home.

504
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,740
It's harmless.

505
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:32,410
Suddenly, I remember everything.

506
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,540
Really?

507
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:37,690
Do you want to hear?

508
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,130
What did you remember?

509
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,850
I recall the old days

510
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,370
when the family

511
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,850
worked in escort services.

512
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,370
Really?

513
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,310
Tell me more.

514
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,990
The escort teams

515
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:01,030
always had

516
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,890
to be on guard against thieves,

517
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:05,070
So they wouldn't

518
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,930
show themselves in busy places.

519
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,210
If they sensed danger,

520
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:10,920
they'd disguise themselves,

521
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,640
merging with the crowds in inns,

522
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,370
eating and living with the locals.

523
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,710
These martial world folks

524
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:18,980
can endure hardship,

525
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,580
using the poor as cover.

526
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,980
Thieves wouldn't easily notice.

527
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,280
Let's sleep.

528
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,690
This place was a village for border prisoners.

529
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,650
Last year, there was a plague.

530
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,550
The Governor's decision was

531
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,690
to leave them to their fate,

532
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,770
so they ended up in this state.

533
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:55,960
My Lord.

534
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,780
Thick smoke is rising from the house.

535
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,150
Let's go.

536
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,580
Burn more paper.

537
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,820
Attract fewer ghosts.

538
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,100
Burn more paper.

539
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,370
Attract fewer ghosts.

540
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,960
Burn more paper.

541
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,060
Attract fewer ghosts.

542
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,710
Burn more paper.

543
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:28,780
Attract fewer ghosts.

544
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:31,920
Burn more paper.

545
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,020
Attract fewer ghosts.

546
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,150
Burn more paper.

547
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,130
Attract fewer ghosts.

548
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,780
Burn more paper.

549
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,130
- Fewer ghosts.
- Kneel.

550
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,230
Burn more paper.

551
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,130
Attract fewer ghosts.

552
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,600
Burn more paper.

553
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,580
Attract fewer ghosts.

554
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,070
Burn more paper.

555
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:44,920
- Don't.
- Ghosts.

556
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,680
My Lord, he's not Qiulin Xian.

557
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,370
- Go. Hurry.
- Burn more paper.

558
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,690
Attract fewer ghosts.

559
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,640
Burn more paper. Attract fewer ghosts.

560
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,480
Tell them

561
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:56,410
not to waste time on this.

562
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58,410
Even if he was sent by Qiulin Xian,

563
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,210
he's just here to mislead us.

564
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:01,850
No need to interrogate him.

565
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,000
Yes.

566
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,100
(Qingcheng Tavern)

567
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,040
Madam,

568
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,400
the shopkeeper said

569
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,060
there's no chicken blood noodles today.

570
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,690
Let's eat something else

571
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:17,830
and come tomorrow.

572
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,170
Do you

573
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,850
really have to eat it?

574
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,930
Chicken blood has been known
to ward off evil and disasters.

575
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,410
Consuming chicken blood

576
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,930
can erase enmity and disaster.

577
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,520
That day,

578
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:31,500
I made a vow in front of the Ruyi Tree.

579
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,100
I must eat these

580
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,820
chicken blood noodles.

581
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,260
Should I go order something else?

582
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,680
Sir,

583
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,160
bring us a few signature dishes

584
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,340
from Xizhou.

585
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:49,680
Please make it quick.

586
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,550
- Also.
- Alright.

587
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:53,120
If there are other noodle dishes,
bring them too.

588
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:53,960
No problem.

589
00:32:59,070 --> 00:32:59,910
Nanny Li.

590
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,100
Please go call the coachman.

591
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,780
I'll take a walk to digest a bit.

592
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,450
Alright.

593
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:10,110
Miss, take a look
at these flower-patterned fabrics.

594
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,120
Look at this. All new designs.

595
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,030
This one suits your complexion.

596
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:21,410
Spare some money, please.

597
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,370
Miss, someone is watching you.

598
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:27,890
I know.

599
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,850
How did it go?

600
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:32,120
Your suspicion was correct.

601
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,130
No one touched the crabapple at the tavern.

602
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:36,340
But at the teahouse next door,

603
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,550
a man goes there

604
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,020
to have tea every day,

605
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,580
staring at the second-floor window
of the tavern.

606
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,890
It's this man with the straw hat.

607
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,680
Follow him.

608
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,170
See where he stays.

609
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,610
Be careful.

610
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,680
Mr. Cao.

611
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,990
Lord Huaiyang has found the twenty bodies

612
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:25,130
from the escort agency.

613
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,060
Now, they're searching the city for Qiao Xian.

614
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:30,940
Increase our manpower.

615
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,460
We must capture Qiao Xian

616
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:33,470
before Lord Huaiyang.

617
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:34,310
Yes.

618
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:43,140
(Hong House)

619
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,240
Sir.

620
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,620
Come on.

621
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,000
This way, sir.

622
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,200
Come in, sir.

623
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,180
Come on.

624
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,620
Sir.

625
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,240
Take care, sir.

626
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,560
Take care.

627
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,290
Are you going out again?

628
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:12,360
Do you know

629
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,240
your wanted posters are all over the city?

630
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,650
There's a bounty for you.

631
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,810
That's why I can't stay

632
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,860
in one place for long.

633
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,420
If you need money,

634
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,100
you can turn me in.

635
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:28,130
What nonsense are you talking about?

636
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,250
They won't find me.

637
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:36,310
Bye.

638
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,720
My Lord,

639
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,510
your plan worked.

640
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,470
The merchants

641
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,900
aren't interested in the bounty.

642
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,650
When they heard they'd have
to pay the suppression funds,

643
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,330
they started providing leads.

644
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,160
Go.

645
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:04,310
Bring them in.

646
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:05,910
Yes.

647
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:16,220
(Face-Reading Hall)

648
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:17,390
Master.

649
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,460
I just want to know

650
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,060
if my accumulated merits

651
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:22,940
are enough to offset my sins.

652
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,770
Too many lies.

653
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,200
It's difficult.

654
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,060
I've been looking for you

655
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,940
for a long time.

656
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,940
Heaven has eyes.

657
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,460
You finally sit before me.

658
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,460
Uncle.

659
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,580
I've forgotten the past.

660
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,170
What have you been through?

661
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,290
It's a long story.

662
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,280
Everything started

663
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:59,540
on Shangsi Festival night.

664
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,060
(Qiulin Xian)

665
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:03,020
Do you recognize him?

666
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,560
No, I don't.

667
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,720
Nonsense!

668
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,800
I clearly saw Qiulin Xian

669
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,020
leaving your room.

670
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,460
The cinnabar.

671
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:18,420
I bought it to copy scriptures.

672
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,730
I spilled it by accident.

673
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,250
What was originally kept here?

674
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,060
Nothing.

675
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:27,630
Then how do you explain

676
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:28,470
this long mark?

677
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,980
Maybe something fell on the floor.

678
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:33,610
I don't know.

679
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:37,950
Huang Gui.

680
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:41,020
What does this sheet

681
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,130
look like to you?

682
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,020
It looks like...

683
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,380
After I woke up,

684
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,130
I only remembered that I was to marry Cui Jiu.

685
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,880
That's the man

686
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,760
I now call my husband every day.

687
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,210
But he's not Cui Jiu.

688
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,810
I didn't know that at the time.

689
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:09,540
I even mistook him.

690
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,480
He used my amnesia,

691
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,540
deceiving me

692
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,650
into thinking we had a marital relationship.

693
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,070
He trapped me in a house

694
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,100
in Lingquan Town,

695
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:20,290
but he also believed

696
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,380
that I was Lu Wen's concubine,

697
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,690
so he used me as bait

698
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,500
to capture Lu Wen.

699
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,860
(Face-Reading Hall)

700
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:40,220
(Face-Reading Hall)

701
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,560
Let's go in.

702
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:42,430
Yes.

703
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:43,870
Mantang,

704
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,690
you are naturally sharp.

705
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,940
Do you know who this Cui Jiu really is?

706
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:51,770
I'll find out

707
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,170
who he is.

708
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,590
I'll settle the score

709
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:56,690
with him.

710
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:59,540
As for how he used me in the past,

711
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,060
I'll repay him in full.

712
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:14,950
But right now,

713
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,580
I have more important things.

714
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,980
The person who killed our escort brothers

715
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,810
is the one

716
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:23,210
who severed my tendons

717
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,130
and caused my fall and amnesia.

718
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,290
He's now searching for you, Uncle.

719
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,290
Until he's dead,

720
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,170
I won't find peace.

721
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,640
Master,

722
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:34,650
is there really no way to remedy this?

723
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:37,650
Well...

724
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,770
Master.

725
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,200
Honey.

726
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,380
Why are you here, dear?

727
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:55,510
Master,

728
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,770
today I accompanied the madam

729
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,290
to have face-reading.

730
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,460
Are you here on official business?

731
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,560
Yes.

732
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,900
How accurate is the fortune-telling?

733
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:17,470
Very accurate.

734
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:20,210
He said you are kind-hearted,

735
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,500
honest, and straightforward,

736
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,900
and that your official career will be smooth.

737
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:25,030
He even predicted

738
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:25,900
your promotion.

739
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,580
Come on, honey.

740
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,390
Master.

741
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,650
While your official career is promising,

742
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,900
I'm afraid your noble star conflicts

743
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:57,280
with the solitary star,

744
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,060
making it difficult to rise to great heights.

745
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,760
Honey, since we're here,

746
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,170
why don't you ask the master

747
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,860
to check our marriage compatibility?

748
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,030
It won't take long.

749
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:09,170
You won't delay your work.

750
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,210
A face reading?

751
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,060
You two

752
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,380
are a match made in heaven.

753
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,420
That seems accurate.

754
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:28,990
Now, I want to know

755
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:30,540
about the future of our marriage.

756
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,650
Then please draw a lot.

757
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,660
(Lot 1: Most Auspicious)

758
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,180
(Lot 18: Most Inauspicious)

759
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,810
Most inauspicious.

760
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,130
What does it mean?

761
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:08,130
A clear path ahead, but suddenly it turns dark.

762
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,730
Don't pursue what's unclear.

763
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:16,100
A crumbling wall returns to dust.

764
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,900
Even with divine help, it won't stand.

765
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:23,580
If this lot is interpreted for marriage,

766
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,130
it foretells difficulties.

767
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,770
Do you

768
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,060
have any secrets between you?

769
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:34,170
- I don't.
- No.

770
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,420
Then it must be

771
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,130
the lot falling to the ground,

772
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,380
affected by the earth's energy.

773
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:44,650
If we interpret it by the lot's words,

774
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,580
you may love each other,

775
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:50,100
but without honesty,

776
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,170
you will drift apart.

777
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,940
Is there any chance to turn things around?

778
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,380
This

779
00:42:58,030 --> 00:42:59,540
is fate.

780
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:01,540
However,

781
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,770
fate can be changed by people.

782
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:08,100
As long as you are sincere with each other,

783
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:11,900
there will be a chance to win each other back.

784
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:15,510
Dear,

785
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,020
I will be honest with you.

786
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,130
I will too.
