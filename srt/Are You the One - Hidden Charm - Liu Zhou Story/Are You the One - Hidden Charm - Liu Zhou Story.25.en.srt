=Episode 25=

14
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:58,260
Sir, it's been an hour,
and Ms. Liu is still in there.

15
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,460
Go take a look.

16
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,820
Sir, this leads to the back street.

17
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,020
My lord, look, we found a tuft of animal fur.

18
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,980
My lord, this could be the rumored White Deer.

19
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,420
It's an auspicious sign
and the mandate of heaven, my lord.

20
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,980
My Lord, there's an assassin!

21
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,300
- My lord!
- Protect the prince!

22
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,900
My lord, my lord!

23
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,780
You missed. The second one will fail.

24
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,620
Move aside.

25
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,620
- He has many guards with him.
- Chase them.

26
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,100
If they catch up,
I won't be able to protect you.

27
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:21,940
Come with me now.

28
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,820
Stop looking. It's just me.

29
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,010
Your Majesty, Prince Sui has men block

30
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,740
all the exits down the mountain.

31
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,220
It'd be hard for Ms. Liu to escape the search.

32
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,300
There's one place that can keep you safe.

33
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,220
It's just a bit off from the heart.

34
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,020
Cui Xingzhou, was it you?

35
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,140
Yes, it was me.

36
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:49,500
My Lord, you're so narrow-minded.

37
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,980
My arrow missed by accident.

38
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:57,900
How was I to know you'd run into it
from so far away?

39
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:06,300
I still wanted to reconcile with you.

40
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,500
You madman.

41
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,260
Reconcile?

42
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,340
Do you really think
I don't know about the matter in Zhenzhou?

43
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,380
Fine, I'd like to know

44
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,180
how you plan to reconcile this matter with me.

45
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,140
What are you standing there for?

46
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,860
Lord Huaiyang encountered a wild beast
during the Spring Hunt and died unexpectedly.

47
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,100
Take him down.

48
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,460
My lord, have you thought it through?

49
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,940
Do I need to hesitate to take down you?

50
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:46,110
What if the Grand Empress Dowager knew that

51
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:49,820
the Xizhou conflict was caused by her own son?

52
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:55,300
My lord,
do you not care about this matter either?

53
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,820
Thousands of souls perished in Xizhou.

54
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,850
My lord,
have you truly calculated everything so well

55
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:05,140
that there are no flaws?

56
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:10,260
Let me tell you the truth,
I have already prepared the secret letter.

57
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,780
Today,

58
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,020
if I cannot walk out
of this hunting ground safely,

59
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:20,300
what you did in Xizhou will be presented
to the Grand Empress Dowager.

60
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:23,500
By then,
what will the imperial relatives think?

61
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,380
Will they still let you have your way?

62
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,740
My lord.

63
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:32,860
My lord.

64
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,140
How dare you threaten me?

65
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,460
If you do not believe it, you can try.

66
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,780
Let's see if you can risk it all,

67
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,100
or if I, the madman, can risk it all.

68
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:00,940
My lord, your injury is too severe.
Please return to the camp for treatment first.

69
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,580
Then we'll search for any other accomplices.

70
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:06,940
Let's go.

71
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:09,980
My lord.

72
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,540
My lord, you need to recuperate for a few days.

73
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,820
I will now prescribe some medicine for you.

74
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,620
Leave.

75
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,580
Make them all leave.

76
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,260
Yes.

77
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,420
You all leave as well.

78
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,180
Thank you, my lord.

79
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,940
Pei.

80
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,500
Pei.

81
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,660
You were fine when you went out just now.

82
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,420
What happened?

83
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,340
Uncle, you're injured. Do not move too much.

84
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,500
Great grandmother,
do not worry, take care of yourself.

85
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,020
What exactly happened?

86
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,340
I was careless

87
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,100
and injured by a beast.

88
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,660
Yes.

89
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,540
His Lordship has ordered a search in the camp

90
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,860
to prevent that beast
from harming the imperial family members.

91
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,460
Therefore, I failed to protect His Lordship.
Please forgive us, Your Majesty.

92
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,940
Great grandmother,
do not worry, take care of yourself.

93
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,900
Your health is the most important.

94
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,220
Yes, yes.

95
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,060
No wonder it was so noisy outside.
What a horrifying thing.

96
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,780
How is the Grand Empress Dowager?

97
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,920
His Majesty is worried that

98
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,780
the Grand Empress Dowager is overly distressed.

99
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,740
He has ordered the Imperial Guards
to escort all the ladies back to the palace.

100
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,820
I see.

101
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:23,220
But my clothes got wet earlier.

102
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,300
I'm afraid it will take some time to dry.

103
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,860
No problem, I will wait outside.

104
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:59,220
Actually, Ms. Liu,
you're not quite as I imagined.

105
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,580
The plums and willows dance in the breeze.

106
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:08,460
I originally thought
you would be a quiet and charming begonia.

107
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,190
Although my name is Miantang,

108
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,580
I have nothing to do
with this luxurious flower.

109
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,380
But Lady Shi, you surprised me.

110
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,130
Really?

111
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,220
His Majesty sent me here

112
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,900
without leaving a single word.

113
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:31,300
But you remained calm and composed.

114
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,060
I'm impressed by the daughter
of a military general.

115
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,140
That's because I trust His Majesty.

116
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,340
Naturally, I also trust the women
favored by His Majesty.

117
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,290
Trust is a precious thing.

118
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,420
I also hope to be like you, Lady Shi,

119
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,780
to meet someone who can be trusted.

120
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,510
Your Majesty, the scout reports
that Lord Huaiyang confessed

121
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:18,140
to shooting the arrow to Prince Sui.

122
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,500
No one else can know this.

123
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,820
Understood.

124
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,820
(When did you make the decision?)

125
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,440
(You were just afraid of missing the opportunity
for the Spring Hunt.)

126
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,540
(You didn't intend to hide it
from me on purpose, right?)

127
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:46,940
So, you never fully trusted me
from the beginning.

128
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,460
Your Majesty kept finding excuses to delay.
You're not truly seeking revenge.

129
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,060
Aren't you also deceiving me?

130
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,340
I just wanted to keep you here first,
so you wouldn't act impulsively.

131
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,860
Miantang, even for a moment,

132
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,580
did you ever think of staying for me?

133
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:18,340
I came to the capital only for revenge.

134
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:24,140
Besides that, there is no reason
for me to stay by your side.

135
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,580
I did admire you once.

136
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,260
I do not doubt

137
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,620
nor deny our past.

138
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:44,540
Then why did everything suddenly change?

139
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,500
It didn't change suddenly.

140
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,420
When you intended to cooperate with Prince Sui,

141
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:01,220
I knew that what you
and I wanted was fundamentally different.

142
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:06,420
Our lives only briefly overlapped.

143
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,820
In the end,
neither of us will change for the other.

144
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:14,060
Today's events are the best proof of that.

145
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:20,780
A missed strike means
there will be no second chance.

146
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,540
From now on,
Prince Sui will only be more guarded.

147
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:30,060
And today,
I missed out on the best opportunity.

148
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:35,180
If I want to act again in the future,
it will come at a greater cost.

149
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,900
Then I will risk my life to protect you.

150
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:43,660
As long as you are willing to stay with me,
I...

151
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:47,460
But every time I see you in the future,
I will remember today and this moment,

152
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,300
just like I will always remember the Night
of the Shangsi Festival.

153
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:00,200
You knew Prince Sui was trying to win you over.

154
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,740
Yet you let those men who shared hardships
with you die overnight.

155
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,740
- I..
- You wouldn't do anything wrong.

156
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,140
Because you weigh the pros and cons.

157
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:22,860
But Lu Wen is a person
who acts on his emotions.

158
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,870
Different paths lead to different destinations.

159
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:32,300
(Ziyu, let go.)

160
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,900
The Council of Examination,
on this day I take the throne,

161
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:55,500
I hereby make my father,
Late Crown Prince Xiao, Emperor Xiaozong

162
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,860
and my legitimate mother,
Madam Cao, Empress Dowager.

163
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:04,740
The Empress is to be respectfully conferred
by the Grand Empress Dowager's decree.

164
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,720
The inner court is to be treated
with great respect,

165
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,420
as the state has its established rituals.

166
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:13,140
With virtue already complete in the palace,
the rank should match its dignity and power.

167
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,420
Madam Sun, you embody the virtues
of humility and obedience,

168
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:19,060
following the teachings of your mentors.

169
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:22,580
You are cautious and dignified.

170
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,820
From a noble lineage,
yet you do not abuse your power.

171
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,940
You are humble and radiate brilliance.

172
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:31,500
You have the law in your mind and abide by it.

173
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:37,140
You lead by example and set a precedent.
I hereby make you...

174
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,620
Empress, Empress.

175
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,060
Consort Xian.

176
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,580
You shall execute my decree.

177
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,220
Consort Xian, please accept the decree quickly.

178
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:57,340
Also, you should change out of this red dress.

179
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,930
A rose-red color would be
more suitable for you,

180
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,140
Your Ladyship.

181
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,900
Lady Shi, you're endowed with grace and virtue.

182
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,940
You serve both palaces and manage all affairs,

183
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:13,900
upholding ancient traditions,
and leading by example.

184
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,100
You're not boastful in appearance,
and humble in speech.

185
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:20,540
Hence you can be made the Empress.

186
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:27,220
The ministries shall select an auspicious day
for the ceremony and execute my decree.

187
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,120
Thanks to Your Majesty's favor.

188
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:34,340
It is the fortune of my daughter
and my entire family.

189
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,740
I bow to Your Majesty's great kindness.

190
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,460
My dear father-in-law.

191
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,620
No need for such formalities.

192
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:09,820
Yes.

193
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,820
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

194
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,300
Congratulations, Minister Shi.

195
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,580
Is it that carriage?

196
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,660
My lord, we can still catch up
if we leave immediately.

197
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:44,580
(Anhe Gate)

198
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,740
I didn't expect
that His Majesty would really let you go.

199
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,380
If it weren't for his interference,

200
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,340
that old thief Prince Sui
wouldn't still be alive and kicking.

201
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,580
Uncle, if you keep talking like this,
we won't be able to return to Beizhou.

202
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,060
We might as well spend the rest of our lives
in the Heavenly Prison.

203
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,780
Sister, have you really made up your mind?

204
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,740
Once you leave,
you will cut ties with the past.

205
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,660
You foolish boy.

206
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:19,500
Do I look like someone who gives up easily?

207
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,140
Since we can't do anything now,

208
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,740
we might as well leave this place
and bide our time.

209
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:31,060
One day,
I will definitely avenge my fallen brothers.

210
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:32,740
Alright.

211
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,420
Your Majesty.

212
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,100
Sit down.

213
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:27,580
I thought you would leave with her.

214
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,340
Why make things difficult for myself
when I can fulfill her wish?

215
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,860
Before the Spring Hunt,
did you know about her plans?

216
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:43,020
How can an ordinary person like me stop her
from what she plans to do?

217
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,420
But you risked offending Prince Sui
to save her.

218
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,580
Offending him is no big deal.

219
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,580
For her,
I would even offend

220
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,060
Your Majesty without hesitation.

221
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:10,500
Today,
there is a new chess puzzle for you to solve.

222
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,940
When I took the throne,
only three or four lords came to pay homage.

223
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,380
None of the powerful lords,
except for Prince Sui, came.

224
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,820
They are all watching and waiting.

225
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,580
Some of them surely want to usurp me.

226
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:36,060
This world is not yet at peace.

227
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,140
Which route should we solve first?

228
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:41,980
The northern route.

229
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:47,100
Lord You and Lord Bei are my great uncles.
They acted arrogantly and refused to come.

230
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:54,860
Unlike you,
who rushed to the capital for other matters.

231
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,500
I won't make things difficult for you.
You should go to Youzhou first.

232
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,620
If Lord You comes
to pay homage and pledges loyalty,

233
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,780
he'll be made the Monetary Commissioner
for the four regions of the Beijun County.

234
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,780
This is a generous gift.

235
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,100
Monetary Commissioner.

236
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:18,980
He's Prince Sui's follower.

237
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,940
If Lord You submits,

238
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,220
I can temporarily hold him down
and plan further.

239
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,300
Does Your Majesty want to eliminate Prince Sui?

240
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,180
Don't you want to?

241
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:42,620
Your Majesty's own affairs are being left
to an outsider like me to resolve.

242
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,020
You really know how to use people.

243
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,340
The situation is as it is.

244
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,220
Are you going to defy the imperial decree?

245
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,060
I dare not.

246
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,940
I am alone and have no other matters.

247
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:00,060
I might as well play more chess
with Your Majesty.

248
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:19,760
On the eighth day of the second month
in the First Year of Xiyou,

249
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:22,780
the Emperor issued this edict,

250
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:29,020
appointing the seventh daughter
of the Minister of War, Shi Yikuan, the Empress.

251
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:33,380
You are to harmonize heaven and earth,
as the poem "Guan Ju" begins.

252
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:36,460
The foundation of the Emperor's benevolence
lies in internal support.

253
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,680
Thus,
the Emperor's consorts

254
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,540
illuminate the imperial path.

255
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,740
Emulating the virtuous wives,

256
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,620
the Empress should diligently
cultivate her virtue

257
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:50,060
to solemnly serve the Ancestral Temple,
reverently manage the royal harem

258
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:53,900
fully respect the way
of women and guide the Six Palaces,

259
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,980
setting an example for the subjects.

260
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,760
(Persevere and achieve greatness)
Heaven is impartial.

261
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,820
Only virtue stands. Be cautious.

262
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,100
Bow twice.

263
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,100
Take the seat.

264
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,820
Why do you always avoid looking at me,
my empress?

265
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,340
I...

266
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:09,540
I still have some appeals to review.

267
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,580
You should rest early.

268
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,060
Why me?

269
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:35,120
I'm foolish.
I do not understand

270
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:38,740
why Your Majesty chose me as the Empress.

271
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,720
Minister Shi is loyal
to the monarch and loves the country,

272
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,180
with a family tradition of integrity.

273
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:50,540
I believe his daughter
has inherited this virtue

274
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,580
and is worthy to be my empress.

275
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,420
I understand now.

276
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:24,860
You have a long day. Are you hungry?

277
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,980
Your Majesty, please speak freely.

278
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,980
I do not wish to hide anything from you.

279
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:01,020
Choosing your family was indeed part
of my current strategy.

280
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:10,100
I did not dare to have expectations of you,
nor will I ever have any.

281
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,160
Along the way,
you have shown courage and wisdom,

282
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,820
helping me greatly.

283
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,900
I am very grateful.

284
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:26,420
Choosing you as the Empress now is indeed
for the sake of balancing power.

285
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:35,260
But I am also truly fortunate
that I chose you back then.

286
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,740
I can give you all the honors of the harem.

287
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,740
However...

288
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:54,020
Your Majesty needs not to say more.
I understand.

289
00:28:55,540 --> 00:29:00,980
Your Majesty has always treated me
and Yun'er with propriety and respect.

290
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,500
I originally thought it was
because Your Majesty was naturally indifferent.

291
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:10,180
But upon arriving in the capital,
Your Majesty often showed genuine joy.

292
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:17,380
It was not until I met Ms. Liu that I realized

293
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:21,700
that she is
where Your Majesty's heart truly lies.

294
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,620
Your Majesty knows

295
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,080
I have lived under others' mercy
since childhood,

296
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,980
with no choice of my own.

297
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:40,500
I'm grateful to Your Majesty
for rescuing me from my predicament.

298
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:44,580
I'm even more grateful
to Your Majesty for being honest today.

299
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,900
I have already made up my mind.

300
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,100
I know my place in the palace.

301
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:02,060
The wedding ceremony is complete.
Please rest assured, Your Majesty.

302
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:05,360
From now on,
I will fully support Your Majesty

303
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:08,460
and fulfill my duties as Empress.

304
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:13,900
My empress is obedient,
sensible, gentle, and virtuous.

305
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,980
I'm very much at ease.

306
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:25,340
State affairs are important.
Your Majesty should not waste your time here.

307
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,300
Please return to Qinying Hall early.

308
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,140
You're right.

309
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,740
What kind of medicinal herbs do you need?

310
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,180
You have quite a lot here.

311
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:39,860
I'll take them all.

312
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,660
- Alright.
- They're mine.

313
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:43,460
Alright, alright, take care, sir.

314
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,180
Take a look.

315
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,300
Dried goods.

316
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:49,940
Take a look.

317
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,780
- Sir, have a look.
- These are all top-quality dried goods.

318
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,380
- They're fresh.
- Yes.

319
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,380
How many are there in total?

320
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,000
- Three bags.
- I'll take them all.

321
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,340
- Alright.
- Keep them for me.

322
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,380
Alright.

323
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,580
Take a look.

324
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,080
Buns.

325
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,500
Take a look.

326
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,340
Uncle.

327
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,600
Miantang,
we've been detouring west

328
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:16,020
from the capital for so long.

329
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,500
Are you really not in a hurry
to return to Beizhou?

330
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,520
I'm in a hurry.

331
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:22,180
I'm in a hurry to make a big profit
and return with dignity.

332
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:27,140
We're innocent now.

333
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:31,220
I agree to make more money
and return with dignity and glory.

334
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,060
But right now,

335
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:35,140
the lords have not yet pledged allegiance
to the new emperor.

336
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:39,220
Look at this situation.
All these merchants are detained here.

337
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:42,260
They've been in this rundown town for days.

338
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:46,060
Even if we buy their goods at a low price,
we can't transport them back to Xizhou.

339
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:49,460
Are we really going to wait
until the river route opens?

340
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,180
So we won't cross the river.

341
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,610
We buy goods at low prices
and sell them to the western tribes.

342
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:54,580
Rare goods are sought-after.

343
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,060
Again with the western tribes.

344
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:59,140
Xizhou is currently suppressing the remnants
of A Gushan.

345
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:01,180
There are soldiers guarding all the passes
along the way.

346
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,420
There is a shortcut.

347
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,460
Look, uncle.

348
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:10,220
Feitang Valley is easy to enter
but strict to exit.

349
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:13,380
Plus, with foggy weather,
we can come and go more freely.

350
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,060
How do you know this?

351
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:21,160
Previously, the decisive battle
between the Zhenzhou Army

352
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,300
and the western tribes took place there.

353
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,620
Now, the first three passes of Xizhou
have been recaptured.

354
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,220
I am certain that the place
is now lightly guarded.

355
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,440
The battle is over for now.

356
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,380
The people of the western tribes
need clothes and medicine,

357
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,220
don't they?

358
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:37,300
Few merchants go there
and I am familiar with the area.

359
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:41,340
When the trade route opens,
we will surely make a fortune.

360
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,050
Therefore,
doing business in the northwest

361
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,300
is the best choice.

362
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:47,100
What if we get caught by patrolling soldiers?

363
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:50,020
You are the most daring in our family.

364
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:53,260
In the past,
you even dared to smuggle iron ore.

365
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,960
Why are you now hesitant
about common goods like oil,

366
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:56,580
rice, clothes, and medicine?

367
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,380
When have I ever been hesitant?

368
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,500
I am just worried that you might lose your way.

369
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,250
That's right.

370
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:07,260
This is the Qiulin Xian I know,
wild and free, roaming the world.

371
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,340
Yes, wild.

372
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:13,380
Uncle, why are you laughing?

373
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:19,060
I'm just feeling emotional.
We've gone through so much,

374
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:23,700
but my niece is still the girl
with light in her eyes.

375
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:35,820
Uncle, I have come out of it.

376
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,820
My lord,
the scouts from the northwest

377
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,740
have brought news about the Madam.

378
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:02,060
They said Ms. Liu went to the western tribes
a few days ago for business.

379
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,820
No need to tell me these things.

380
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,820
My lord, the clothes have been
washed and ironed.

381
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,780
Where should I put them?

382
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:33,980
Why are all these new?

383
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,620
Where is my old cloak?

384
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,420
That one got ruined in the wash.
I threw it away.

385
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:42,820
Merchants don't seek official duties,
or wear clothes with a crane.

386
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:44,620
It's an eagle.

387
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,020
Who told you to throw it away?

388
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,260
I'm asking you, who told you to throw it away?

389
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,860
The stitching on that one was rough.

390
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,500
Then I ruined it while washing it.

391
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,580
I thought you wouldn't wear it anymore,
so I threw it away.

392
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,220
Go find it for me right now.

393
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,340
If you can't find it, you're fired.

394
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,140
Yes.

395
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,620
(Medicine)

396
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,540
What would you like?

397
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,140
Look at this quality.

398
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,380
- This one, it's great.
- I'll take this one.

399
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,380
- This is good.
- Take a look.

400
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,240
These are all fresh.

401
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,300
Come, wrap this up.

402
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,820
- Would you like some?
- Then give me a piece.

403
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,250
Wrap this up.

404
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,700
- Here.
- Uncle, this is selling well.

405
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,220
- Add a bit more.
- This one.

406
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,260
Lu Yi.

407
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,420
- A bit more of this.
- Alright.

408
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,260
Good.

409
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,220
Take a look.

410
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,620
Come on, take a look.

411
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:47,260
Young man, I see you've been busy all day.
You should take a break.

412
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,300
Why not join me for a drink?

413
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,340
(Tea)

414
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,380
So robust.

415
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,460
Adorable.

416
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,060
Here, have a drink.

417
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:03,780
Okay.

418
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,700
I've often heard the Qi people say

419
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:18,140
that time is like fleeting clouds,
and it makes sense.

420
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,060
We haven't seen each other for months.

421
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,780
The mastiffs of the western tribes
have grown quite a bit.

422
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,900
You could say that.

423
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,950
Actually, I came yesterday

424
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:32,000
and already inquired about you,
Princess Chunyue from the clan.

425
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,260
I planned to visit you
after I finish my business.

426
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,900
Where is your husband?
Still in the military camp?

427
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,340
Be careful of your husband.

428
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,900
I took your advice and divorced him.

429
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,740
Well done.

430
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,120
Back then,
I chose to become a merchant

431
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,740
within the pass to avoid the tribal disaster.

432
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:59,820
Even if he doesn't drive me away,
my child and I won't stay for long.

433
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:03,940
Drink.

434
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:11,740
Speaking of your previous husband,

435
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:15,540
he was quite good-looking,
so you didn't lose out.

436
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,540
You will find someone even better.

437
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,300
What are your plans for the future?

438
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:29,140
I want to open a trade route with you,
so we can prosper together.

439
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:30,620
Sure.

440
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:34,660
The iron ore in these mountains is endless.
Let's continue this business.

441
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:41,740
That cold, hard stuff is better left buried
in the ground.

442
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,980
How about we start a new business?

443
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:50,660
(Beizhou)

444
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,900
My lord, I found your cloak.

445
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,740
My lord,

446
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,180
the cloak.

447
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:37,740
Since it's torn, throw it away.

448
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:44,660
Yes.

449
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:18,140
Welcome, Lord Huaiyang, to Youzhou.
You've traveled so far.

450
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:22,780
These are some modest gifts.
I hope you like them.

451
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,500
Pour the wine.

452
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:32,980
Everyone, let's toast to the Lord You.

453
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,500
To Lord You!

454
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:45,020
My lord, if we could have reached
the capital in time,

455
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:47,780
we would probably
be sharing an imperial banquet

456
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:50,220
with His Majesty right now.

457
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,020
You wouldn't have...

458
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:52,860
Come, everyone.

459
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:56,220
To host us rough men.

460
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:04,460
I am just a minor lord without ambition.

461
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:07,340
Back when the Wu clan was in power,

462
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:11,900
I stayed in Youzhou and didn't get involved
in imperial court affairs.

463
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:16,540
Now, I should be even more content
and keep to myself.

464
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,620
To be honest with you,

465
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:25,660
I only hope for the residents of Youzhou
to live peacefully.

466
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:30,500
I wish nothing more.

467
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:33,820
Others may not understand me.

468
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:39,020
But you should deeply understand it, right?

469
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:49,180
I quite agree with you.

470
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:57,220
I never expected to find a bosom friend here.

471
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:01,060
Someone, bring wine for everyone.

472
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:02,350
Let's drink together.

473
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,390
Alright.

474
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:04,910
- Come on, let's drink.
- Cheers.

475
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:05,860
My lord.

476
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,340
Let me toast to you again.

477
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,900
- I really...
- My lord.

478
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:15,340
The wine in the army is strong.
A small sip is enough. Don't harm your health.

479
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,220
No, no, no.

480
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,540
My lord, your choice to drink or not.

481
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,620
- Cheers.
- Cheers, cheers.

482
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:35,540
The army is really not a good place
for conversation.

483
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,020
We are friends.

484
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:43,580
If we can find a place with beautiful scenery
in the future,

485
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:48,860
it would be a blessing to chat
about our ambitions.

486
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:54,480
Unfortunately,

487
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:58,340
I have important duties
and must depart tomorrow.

488
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,300
What a pity.

489
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:01,620
No, no.

490
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:23,700
My lord, Lord You has sent a great gift.

491
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:41,620
My lord.

492
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:51,140
By the order of Lord You,
I've come to serve you, my lord.

493
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,620
Please do not disdain me.

494
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:03,940
Lord You does have a unique way
of showing hospitality.

495
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:08,660
If I do anything inadequately,

496
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:09,820
- please, My Lord...
- Don't move.

497
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:16,740
You're not undressing, right?

498
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:28,700
Lord You is so...

499
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:36,450
