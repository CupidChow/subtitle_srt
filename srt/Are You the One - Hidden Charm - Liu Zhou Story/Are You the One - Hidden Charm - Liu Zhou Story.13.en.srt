even more

17
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,970
uneasy,

18
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,660
fearing that we might part forever

19
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,020
and never meet again.

20
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,810
It must be laughable.

21
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,280
But fortunately,

22
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,190
you understand

my twists and turns of emotions.

24
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,730
That's why we can sit here,

25
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,460
on this peaceful night.

26
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,530
Among these thousands of lights,

27
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,410
we have our own.

28
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,010
My heart

29
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,290
feels settled now.

30
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,500
The world only knows

31
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,850
of the nobles and generals

32
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,530
who give their lives

33
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,730
and blood.

34
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,460
But in times of war,

35
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,690
this is what ordinary families are like.

36
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,830
What?

37
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,460
Aren't you an ordinary person?

38
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,200
Dear.

39
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,040
Can you see

40
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,010
the three stars aligned?

41
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,180
One day,

42
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,340
when Lord Huaiyang leads his army back,

43
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,780
he'll return from that direction.

44
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,620
But what if he doesn't win?

45
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,410
If he doesn't win,

46
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,180
he'll still return from there,

47
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,940
But he'll be

48
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,250
wrapped in horsehide,

49
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,010
returning in honor.

50
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,940
Come on.

51
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,410
Why do I need to know
where Lord Huaiyang will return from?

52
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,410
You're right.

53
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,690
All I know is

54
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,640
we're a common family.

55
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,250
We may not reach great wealth,

56
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,110
but at least we can stay with our loved ones.

57
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:46,970
That's enough.

58
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,230
Dear.

59
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,340
Tonight is beautiful.

60
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,830

Your writing is nice.

64
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,970
You should write it.

65
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:36,430
What's wrong?

66
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,700
I haven't decided what to write.

67
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,000
I've already had someone draft it.

I'm Cui Jiu of the capital.

117

00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,620
(Letter of Divorce)
are united in marriage,

00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,220
with deep affection

120
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,660

121
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,500
But now, with war raging,

122
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,940
the country is in turmoil.

123
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,660
As an able-bodied man,

124
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,500
I must grieve for the hardships of the people

125
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,740
and bear the suffering of the nation.

126
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,980
Though born a merchant,
I will not shy away from duty,

127
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,900
nor evade responsibility due to low status.

128
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,700
I have no grand ambitions,

129
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,020
but I should follow the example
of the countless men of Zhenzhou

130
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,620
and serve my country with my life,

131

I will have gone north with the Zhenzhou army.

Life or death is uncertain.

135
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,380
I fear for your sorrow,

136
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,380
and that your youth will be wasted.

137
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,700

I leave to you.

00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,060
I hope Miantang will return

142
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,580

143
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,220
and live a peaceful life.

144
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,620

145
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,460

- They're here.
- How is it?

Pretty good.

159
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,310
You go ahead.

160

- OK.

Yes. Go back.

00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,700
I'll take everything I can.

190
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,220
Ms. Liu tricked you.

191
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,540
Why go find her again?

192
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,540
She claims to be my friend.

193
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,060
I can't let this go like that.

194
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,260
I must hear from her

195
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,980
why she toyed with me.

196
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:34,140
(Cui Mansion)

197
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,500
Miss He.

198
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,180
Where is your madam?

199
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,260
Madam!

200
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,420
Madam!

201
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:03,900
Madam!

202
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,300
Nanny Li!

203
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,660
Madam!

204
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,260
Madam!

205
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,540
Nanny Li!

206
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,540
Where are they?

207
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:30,740
My Lord,

208
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,660
the troops have been marching for days.

209
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,460
The soldiers seem weary.

210
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,140
Should we camp here?

211
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:37,980
No.

212
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,260
The court has ordered us to reach

213
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,020
Jinjia Pass within the month.

214
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,100
This means

215
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,940
we must cover fifty miles a day.

216
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,380
If I'm lenient,

217
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,220
I'd only be harming you all.

218
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,180
My Lord.

219
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,260
Pass the order

220
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,580
to keep marching.

221
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,820
Any delay will be punished by military law.

222
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,460
Yes.

223
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,380
My Lord.

224
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,020
My Lord, the madam...

225
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,940
- What's wrong?
- The madam is fine.

226
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,300
After receiving the letter,

227
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,260
she dismissed Fangxie and Bicao.

228
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,100
Then she asked me to buy some supplies.

229
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,140
When I returned,

230
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,580
she and Nanny Li were gone.

231
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,340
Nanny Li left a message for the guards.

232
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,980
She said the madam couldn't wait

233
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,140
and left with her and the money.

234
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,460
Rest assured.

235
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,620
Per your orders,

236
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,380
Fan Hu and the guys are following her.

237
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,180
Nothing else?

238
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:32,980
Else?

239
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,260
- You mean...?
- Crying?

240
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,660
Ranting?

241
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,220
Panic and cursing?

242
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,100
Like that. What are you thinking?

243
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:42,780
Nothing.

244
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,100
After receiving it,

245
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,340
the madam handled it calmly,

246
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,380
without any fuss.

247
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,620
She focused on taking the money,

248
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,380
just as I expected.

249
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,460
She didn't even pretend

250
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,300
to cry?

251
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,220
No.

252
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,340
My Lord, I speculate

253
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,980
she's following

254
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,380
your letter's advice,

255
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,980
returning to her family to live well.

256
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,820
You should be glad

257
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,940
the burden is gone.

258
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:14,780
Yes.

259
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,540
I am glad.

260
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,700
She's just like other women,

261
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,540
knowing how to adapt

262
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,740
and live peacefully.

263
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,300
Very good.

264
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:29,980
Everyone, move on.

265
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,340
Yes.

266
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,380
That shopkeeper

267
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,100
is capable and kind.

268
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,660
He just advised me

269
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,740
where to change horses

270
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,780
and dine.

271
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,780
After crossing the state border,

272
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,220
it'll be barren mountains.

273
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:58,980
The northwest is cold.

274
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,020
Nanny Li, take care.

275
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,100
Madam.

276
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,580
Well.

277
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,060
Where are we going?

278
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,340
To Xizhou.

279
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,460
To follow Lord Huaiyang's army.

280
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:36,700
(Liu has left Lingquan
with her servants for Xizhou.)

281
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,740
She's gone to Xizhou?

282
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,060
Cui Xingzhou must have some skills

283
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,860
to make her so loyal.

284
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,220
Given what I know of Liu Mingtang,

285
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,340
she wouldn't be so sincere.

286
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,180
You mean she knows something

287
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,380
and wants to change her master?

288
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,700
All I know is

289
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,020
Liu Mingtang wants to follow Cui Xingzhou

290
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,340
to the death.

291
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,660
Now is the best time to catch her.

292
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,020
(Xizhou)

293
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:38,260
(Xizhou)

294
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,140
Nanny Li, are you okay?

295
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,460
- I'm fine.
- Madam.

296
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,820
Something's on the road.

297
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,780
I'll move it.

298
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,620
Sure.

299
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,540
Madam!

300
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,700
Bandits!

301
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,580
Come on!

302
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,900
Help!

303
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,780
Madam, thank heavens

304
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,420
for these heroes saving us!

305
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,580
Madam, you can't go!

306
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,100
The two bandits

307
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,380
are already tied up.

308
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,540
Good.

309
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,980
Thank you, heroes, for your assistance.

310
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,380
May I know your names?

311
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,700
No, no.

312
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,340
Madam.

313
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,660
Your bravery saved the day.

314
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,500
No need to thank us.

315
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,540
Madam?

316
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:31,940
Sir.

317
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,660
Have we met before?

318
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:43,980
I am

319
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,940
Fan Hu,

320
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,020
also from Zhenzhou.

321
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,700
We once met before.

322
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,980
Madam,

323
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,220
at Lingquan Town,

324
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,660
by the river,

325
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:01,180
you ran...

326
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,740
- A porcelain shop.
- A porcelain shop.

327
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,580
We three brothers

328
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,100
were following the army,

329
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,780
intending to join and fight.

330
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,180
But unexpectedly,

331
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,780
we found you in distress.

332
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,260
As fellow townsmen,

333
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,540
it was our duty to help.

334
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,260
We didn't expect

335
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,020
to end up in such a sorry state.

336
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,620
These are my brothers,

337
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,380
Hu Ting

338
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,340
and Ying Zai.

339
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,820
I see.

340
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,460
I'm truly sorry

341
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,140
for causing your injuries.

342
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,100
It's okay.

343
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:38,460
Nanny Li.

344
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,180
Get some rice wine and dried meat

345
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,500
to thank and reward these heroes.

346
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,060
Yes.

347
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,220
Thank you, Madam.

348
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:45,980
Madam.

349
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,100
What should we do with the two bandits?

350
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,580
Earlier,

351
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,780
I heard wolves howling nearby.

352
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,220
Cut them and feed them

353
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:02,860
to the wolves.

354
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,740
Yes.

355
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,940
Oh, Nanny Li.

356
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,260
Heat some ointment.

357
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,140
The journey is long.

358
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,300
My wrist

359
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,780
needs to heal quickly.

360
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:17,860
Yes.

361
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,420
My Lord.

362
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,300
What's the matter?

363
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,540
My Lord, there's been

364
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,060
a suspicious carriage following us.

365
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,060
I suspect they're spies,

366
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,260
so I had them captured.

367
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,500
Interrogate them.

368
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,420
If they're a threat,

369
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,380
execute them at once.

370
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,060
I did that,

371
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,340
but those people

372
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,260
were fierce.

373
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,180
Especially a serious old woman

374
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,620
who said she knew you

375
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,020
and was looking for Mr. Cui Jiu.

376
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,220
Who else was with her?

377
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,180
A woman dressed as a man, a coachman,

378
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,180
and three men

379
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,300
claiming they want to join the army.

380
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,300
One is seriously injured.

381
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,780
Madness, absolute madness.

382
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,060
Following the army like this.

383
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,460
What are they thinking?

384
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,460
Understood.

385
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,420
Yes.

386
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,300
- Huang Gui.
- Yes.

387
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,260
Find me a set

388
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,420
of regular soldier's armor.

389
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,420
Keep it quiet.

390
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,420
Yes.

391
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,380
Come on.

392
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,020
Help me up a bit.

393
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:49,820
Madam.

394
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,020
Have some food first.

395
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,220
Are you better?

396
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,060
Yes.

397
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,260
I can manage.

398
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,260
Eat something.

399
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:09,900
Thank you, Madam.

400
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,420
Do you think you're Lord Huaiyang?

401
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,660
He wanted to be dramatic,

402
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,020
writing a letter to cancel the engagement

403
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,100
for some lofty ideal.

404
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,420
It's for his reputation.

405
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,620
But you're a commoner. Why follow his example

406
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,940
and write a divorce letter?

407
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,620
Leaving for the army without a word.

408
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,540
Did you ever think?

409
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,740
Even at the front,

410
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,620
the Lord won't lack women.

411
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,820
When he returns,

412
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,300
he'll have a higher rank,

413
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,300
wealth, and fine clothes.

414
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,740
But you, in a moment of impulse,

415
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,780
divorced your wife

416
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,980
and gave away your assets.

417
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,580
Do you think people will praise you

418
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,540
for making sacrifices?

419
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,020
Have the books driven you mad?

420
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,620
If you truly wish to serve the country

421
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,060
and fulfill your ambitions,

422
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,980
discuss it with me properly.

423
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,220
Will I stop you from that?

424
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,780
If you die in battle,

425
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,660
I'll bring you home, no matter how far.

426
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,740
But you wrote a letter to dismiss me.

427
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,780
Do you see me

428
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,100
as just a selfish,

429
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,540
cowardly woman?

430
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,540
Who told you to write a divorce letter?

431
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,140
Who told you to write that?

432
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,780
I was wrong. I was wrong.

433
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,140
I was wrong. I was wrong.

434
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,260
It's all my fault.

435
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,660
She must have been targeted

436
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,740
as soon as she left Lingquan Town.

437
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,700
They seemed to know

438
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,460
that Madam was chasing after you.

439
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:52,260
They set up an ambush

440
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,340
on the necessary route.

441
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,500
It's my incompetence

442
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,700
that put Madam in danger.

443
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:58,820
Please, My Lord...

444
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,860
Please punish me.

445
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,100
When we were ambushed in the mountains,

446
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,860
Madam saw Mr. Fan was seriously injured.

447
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,740
She lent him her cloak

448
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:20,100
to keep him warm.

449
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,980
Despite the cold,

450
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,500
she refused to wear that cloak.

451
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,260
Why didn't you say so earlier?

452
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,380
Why take it off?

453
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,860
Just wear it.

454
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,660
So, the assassin

455
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,660
was subdued by her.

456
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,380
And your life

457
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,140
was saved by her too.

458
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,140
Yes.

459
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,140
Find a physician

460
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:49,500
to treat his wounds.

461
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,020
Yes.

462
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,460
Go rest.

463
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,020
Get it treated.

464
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:18,900
Thank you, My Lord.

465
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,940
I am Lord Huaiyang.

466
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,100
I was born

467
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,780
to bring peace to the land.

468
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,140
I'm responsible

469
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,180
for my country.

470
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,420
What right do I have

471
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,580
to talk about love?

472
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,460
I can't spend my life with only her.

473
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,020
I won't promise her that.

474
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,100
In the end, this is just a game.

475
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,660
When the game's over,

476
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:05,860
who would take

477
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,420
the pieces away?

478
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,540
Are you planning to stand there all night?

479
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,940
I just wanted to check if you're okay.

480
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,940
If you're fine, I'll leave.

481
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,740
Why aren't you leaving?

482
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,020
I wanted to tell you.

483
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,700
After the long journey,

484
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,460
you must be tired.

485
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:47,940
You forgot.

486
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,740
My family runs an escort agency.

487
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,340
Traveling is common.

488
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,340
I achieved merit days ago.

489
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,940
The general appointed me

490
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,580
to the patrol squad.

491
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,860
He also promoted me to a centurion.

492
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,300
That's good news.

493
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,340
Since you've been promoted,

494
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,460
you should return soon,

495
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,020
so you don't get punished

496
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,340
by the general because of me.

497
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,540
It will be even colder as we head west.

498
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,500
You must also keep warm.

499
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,260
You look worn out.

500
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,780
Marching is tough.

501
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,780
You must rest.

502
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,020
I'm fine.

503
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:51,260
Tomorrow, let the coachman follow the army.

504
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,460
After reaching Jinjia Pass,

505
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,180
I'll find a nearby village

506
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,180
for you to rest.

507
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,220
Okay.

508
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,140
Honey.

509
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,460
I...

510
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,700
My hand hurts.

511
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,820
(He Mansion)

512
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,940
This man

513
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,940
treated He Zhen that day.

514
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,060
Right.

515
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,580
Why is he here again?

516
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:16,980
Is Zhen sick again?

517
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,300
She isn't ill.

518
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,140
She went early with the master to the shop.

519
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:24,820
With a look of debauchery,

520
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,220
he must be involved with that girl.

521
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,020
Take a few servants and...

522
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,660
Please.

523
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,660
Who are you?

524
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:54,980
Are you a physician?

525
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:56,980
I am.

526
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:58,860
Good at treating women?

527
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,540
If you have any private ailments,

528
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,100
- I do...
- Nonsense!

529
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,580
Indeed, you are frivolous and shallow.

530
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,900
- Someone.
- Yes.

531
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,940
What are you doing?

532
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:15,940
I'm here

533
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,860
to discuss something with your master.

534
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,220
I have urgent matters.

535
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,100
Be quiet.

536
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,460
Why are you doing this again?

537
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:31,900
Strip this

538
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,220
esteemed physician clean

539
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,960
and send him to He Zhen's room.

540
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,300
- Yes.
- No!

541
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,460
What are you doing?

542
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,820
Let me go!

543
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:43,100
(He Mansion)

544
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:48,820
Master!

545
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,900
This is serious, Master!

546
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,020
Master! Something's wrong!

547
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,860
What's with the panic?

548
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,580
Something terrible has happened at home.

549
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,060
Father.

550
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,380
Look at this.

551
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,220
Isn't this a misfortune for the family?

552
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,540
He Zhen has done

553
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,900
something so shameful

554
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,740
and disgraceful.

555
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,940
Not long after you left,

556
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:20,300
this oily-faced pervert

557
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,980
sneaked into the house

558
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,460
to meet with He Zhen.

559
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,660
You're talking nonsense.

560
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,300
Are you asking for a beating?

561
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,180
You've finally returned.

562
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,860
I've been waiting.

563
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,580
How unfortunate.

564
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,040
How unfortunate.

565
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,020
Father.

566
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,420
Are you crazy out of worries?

567
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,820
Such a jerk.

568
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:49,900
Don't mind him.

569
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,060
Untie me first.

570
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:02,540
Zhen.

571
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,780
Beg the Lord.

572
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,140
Ask him to spare our family.

573
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:07,850
Hurry!

574
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:17,740
The Lord?

575
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,500
- He...
- Miss He.

576
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,860
Does your family

577
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,180
all like to do this?

578
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:28,380
Do you all like to bind people
and silence them?

579
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,140
This is the second time.

580
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,180
To be a physician in the Cui family,

581
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,620
one must have an unimaginable status.

582
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,580
But the medical skills

583
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,020
are quite inferior.

584
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:48,060
Mrs. Cui entrusted herself

585
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,460
to the wrong person.

586
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,060
Indeed.

587
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,820
I am not skilled in medicine.

588
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,900
The last incident was not your fault.

589
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,380
It's over now.

590
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,540
Don't you all

591
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,420
recognize this is a lord?

592
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:07,820
No.

593
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,500
Father, it's your fault.

594
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,460
If you had introduced us

595
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,420
to the dignitaries of Zhenzhou,

596
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,820
we wouldn't have offended

597
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,020
the Lord today.

598
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,060
Unfilial child.

599
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,380
Apologize quickly.

600
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:22,500
My Lord.

601
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:23,660
My Lord.

602
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,340
I was wrong.

603
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,420
My Lord.

604
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,500
I shouldn't have done it.

605
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,700
My Lord, I admit my mistake.

606
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,420
Please spare our family.

607
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,500
I am kowtowing to you here.

608
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,660
Alright, alright.

609
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,980
I'm not wearing my official robe.

610
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,740
Treat me

611
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,020
as an ordinary physician.

612
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,980
For Miss He's sake,

613
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,500
I will forgive you today.

614
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,140
Thank you, My Lord.

615
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,300
Mr. He,

616
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,380
I'd like to speak privately

617
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,620
with Miss He.

618
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,340
We'll discuss it with you later

619
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,740
about why I came here.

620
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,300
Alright, alright.

621
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,140
Please.

622
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,740
Don't me, Father.

623
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:28,980
You can sigh later.

624
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,140
I actually think

625
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,860
this is a good thing.

626
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,780
What good thing?

627
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,860
You've offended Lord Zhennan.

628
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:43,940
Our family will have to pay for that.

629
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,300
Father.

630
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,140
You...

631
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,420
Father.

632
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,380
You're really confused.

633
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,060
Can't you see?

634
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,260
He is

635
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,260
interested

636
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,660
in our younger sister.

637
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,540
Is he here to see you?

638
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,500
No.

639
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,780
He came to find my good sister.

640
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,100
You mean

641
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,100
he's interested in our Zhen?

642
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,660
How could this be?

643
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:12,900
Our family has been

644
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,180
in business for generations,

645
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,980
and our status is far

646
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,140
from that of the Lord.

647
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,500
Moreover,

648
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:19,740
didn't the Lord

649
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,980
have an engagement with Princess Lin'an?

650
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,140
What happened?

651
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,660
Yes.

652
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:25,740
He was supposed

653
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,660
to marry the Princess,

654
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,220
but before the marriage,

655
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,460
she broke off the engagement.

656
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,620
The Lord's side claimed it was the Lord

657
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,260
who broke off the engagement.

658
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,100
But everyone knows

659
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,780
about this scandal.

660
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,740
After such a huge scandal,

661
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,780
how can he still hold his position

662
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:42,820
as the Lord today?

663
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,500
If you ask me,

664
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,500
after all,

665
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,700
he let me go today.

666
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,140
It means

667
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,860
he has treated me as family.

668
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,980
Really?

669
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:58,900
Of course.

670
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,100
No wonder

671
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,460
Lord Zhennan said

672
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:08,380
he had urgent business
to discuss with me today.

673
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,220
Could it be...?

674
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,180
Yeah.

675
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,060
Maybe today

676
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,460
he was here to propose marriage.

677
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,220
Good.

678
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:20,580
That's great.

679
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,500
Good news.

680
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,940
A happy event indeed.

681
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:25,820
Miss He,

682
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,100
you look radiant.

683
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,420
It seems your health has improved.

684
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:34,180
Only trustworthy physicians

685
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,300
can be relied on.

686
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,220
Despicable quacks

687
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,260
can't be trusted.

688
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,980
Ignoble people like you

689
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,900
are indeed in cahoots

690
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:44,660
with your friend.

691
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,500
Miss,

692
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:48,820
you know that, huh?

693
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,380
I thought Liu Miantang

694
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,020
was pretending to be confused.

695
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,260
Now, I know you are Lord Zhennan.

696
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,980
I have

697
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,860
figured things out thoroughly.

698
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,100
Miantang

699
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,580
was deceived by you all

700
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,540
from the beginning to the end.

701
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,180
It's not as you think.

702
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,100
There are twists

703
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,580
and turns in this matter,

704
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,060
which concerns the peace of Zhenzhou.

705
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,660
I cannot elaborate at this time.

706
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,140
Is hiding his identity to keep a mistress

707
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,740
related to the safety of the county?

708
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:22,660
My Lord,

709
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,140
don't tell me such pretty lies

710
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,820
for a three-year-old child.

711
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:27,740
What you care about

712
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,460
is merely the face and reputation
of the powerful.

713
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,580
I'm not lying to you about this.

714
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,140
Lord Huaiyang has gone to the northwest

715
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,220
and divorced Liu Miantang.

716
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:37,860
They're no longer a couple anymore.

717
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,460
Lord Huaiyang and I

718
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,500
are not the kind of people

719
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,100
who are blinded by lust as you think.

720
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,100
I am here today

721
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:47,500
to ask Mr. He for a convoy

722
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,020
to deliver provisions.

723
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:52,420
When the time comes,

724
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,780
I will tell you everything.

725
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,300
My Lord,

726
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,540
I don't want to hear

727
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,380
about this filthy matter.

728
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,140
You...

729
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,140
You infuriate me.

730
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,260
Mr. He.

731
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,460
Sorry for the wait.

732
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,340
My Lord.

733
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,580
- Please.
- Please.

734
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:19,940
Please.

735
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,460
To be honest,

736
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,060
I am currently

737
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,940
preparing a major event

738
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:32,260
that requires your strong support.

739
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,910
So I came to visit early in the morning.

740
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,260
I know about this.

741
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,450
Our family

742
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:41,420
is the leading merchant in Lingquan.

743
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:42,500
We'll be responsible

744
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:43,820
for this important matter.

745
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:45,900
So,

746
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,140
do you agree?

747
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:49,860
That's great.

748
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,460
Then no one else will have any objections.

749
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,700
I am the head of the family,

750
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:57,340
so naturally everyone will agree.

751
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,460
Moreover, such a significant matter

752
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:01,340
is a great fortune for the family.

753
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,020
That's precisely what we hope for.

754
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,700
We would be delighted.

755
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:05,940
Who would dare to object?

756
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,180
I didn't expect you

757
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,500
to have such insight.

758
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:09,820
I admire you.

759
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:12,980
To be honest,

760
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:16,300
I am usually careless

761
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:17,700
and useless.

762
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:21,340
This time, I'll be counting on you.

763
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,820
Not at all.

764
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,540
With all these compliments,

765
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,940
you flatter me.

766
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,340
It's our duty.

767
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,580
Not at all.

768
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,340
- Please.
- Please.

769
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:37,620
That's great.

770
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:44,740
Are you

771
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:46,180
really willing?

772
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:47,900
Zhen?

773
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:50,020
She's so willing.

774
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:51,700
How could she not be willing?

775
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:53,940
Besides,

776
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,900
this is a big event.

777
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:56,940
A happy event.

778
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:58,460
I usually

779
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:01,580
care most about my daughter.

780
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,420
She can do

781
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:04,820
whatever she wants.

782
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:07,300
But...

783
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:08,860
Feel free to say it.

784
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,140
Good.

785
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:11,860
Then I will speak plainly.

786
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:13,900
You see.

787
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:15,700
Our family

788
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,860
is a merchant family.

789
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:19,940
I understand this.

790
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:22,180
This is business.

791
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,910
We'll be clear about money.

792
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,300
You underestimate our family too much.

793
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:29,300
Such a major event

794
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:30,540
has nothing to do with money.

795
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:32,660
