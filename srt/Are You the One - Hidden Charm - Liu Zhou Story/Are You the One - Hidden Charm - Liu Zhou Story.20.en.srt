14
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,220
Xingzhou is back.

15
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,500
Perfect timing.

16
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,150
Let's take a look.

17
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,120
Aunt.

18
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,690
What did I say?

19
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,560
You've been waiting for him every day.

20
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,760
Finally,

21
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,940
Xingzhou is back.

22
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,200
You're truly blessed.

23
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,040
The days of having a full house

24
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,380
of descendants are still ahead.

25
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,340
Binglan, why are you standing there?

26
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,500
Greet your aunt.

27
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,850
Aunt, Greetings.

28
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,380
What's the matter?

29
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,960
When he wasn't here,

30
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,240
you missed him.

31
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,690
Now he's right in front of you.

32
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,900
Why pretend not to see him?

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,410
I know I'm not likable.

34
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,780
Rather than making Xingzhou uncomfortable,

35
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,100
I'd rather have Aunt criticize me for rudeness.

36
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,100
Come on. Sit down.

37
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,730
You always

38
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,530
make yourself suffer.

39
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,130
Just now,

40
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,500
I explained to your cousin.

41
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,380
What happened before is a misunderstanding.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,660
We are family.

43
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,940
How could we be estranged?

44
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,310
I understand

45
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,570
your kindness.

46
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,500
However, during the time Xingzhou was away,

47
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,410
the Lian family has faced
quite a lot of criticism.

48
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,970
If he returns

49
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,850
and we show up shamelessly,

50
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,080
wouldn't that

51
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,500
make them mock us?

52
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,360
No wonder you refused

53
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,840
to come today,

54
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,730
saying the engagement was canceled.

55
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,960
You were worried

56
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,340
about your aunt's health.

57
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,290
Now Xingzhou is back.

58
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,290
She said she'd keep a distance.

59
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,500
What are you talking about?

60
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,780
I've decided.

61
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,290
A new engagement will be drafted immediately.

62
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:40,960
When you

63
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,970
marry Xingzhou properly,

64
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,730
I believe no one will dare to speak ill of you.

65
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,220
Aunt.

66
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:51,710
Binglan.

67
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,180
Is there anything else?

68
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,690
I just want to see

69
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,520
if you're well.

70
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,570
I'm well.

71
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:04,940
If you've seen enough,

72
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,120
then go back.

73
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,240
Xingzhou.

74
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,780
It was a misunderstanding before.

75
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,100
Don't you care about the old affections at all?

76
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,900
Between my cousin and me,

77
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,080
there's cooperation,

78
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,260
compromise,

79
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,750
and mutual benefit.

80
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,260
But there's absolutely

81
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,530
no affection.

82
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,340
Xingzhou.

83
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,100
Binglan's turned down
many good proposals for you.

84
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,580
Do you really want to be this heartless person?

85
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,610
Aunt.

86
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,780
My cousin

87
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,100
chose me

88
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,390
among many other cousins

89
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,680
because of the position

90
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,170
of Princess Huaiyang.

91
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,880
I agreed.

92
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,510
Her grandma passed away.

93
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,290
She observed mourning for 3 years. I waited.

94
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,140
To pacify the western tribes,

95
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,290
Binglan didn't want to compromise on marriage.

96
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,730
I also accommodated.

97
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,900
How am I heartless?

98
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,580
I was not unwilling to marry.

99
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,410
I was truly ill at that time.

100
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,850
Later, I wanted to explain
and make amends with you.

101
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,290
But it was too late.

102
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,030
Xingzhou.

103
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,020
I've always had only you

104
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,900
in my heart.

105
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,100
The engagement is canceled.

106
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,100
I won't look back.

107
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,960
Mother,

108
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,220
I have someone I admire.

109
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,660
I will marry only her.

110
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:24,790
Well.

111
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,730
Which noble lady is she?

112
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,750
Why have I never heard of this?

113
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,340
She's not a noble lady.

114
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,820
But we genuinely care for each other.

115
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,410
I hope Mother will support us.

116
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,960
Xingzhou.

117
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,780
You are so heartless.

118
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,100
Is it for that mistress?

119
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,930
Sister.

120
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,530
Your son has long had a mistress.

121
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,720
She was captured by mountain bandits.

122
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,580
She was an impure woman.

123
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,510
I've wanted to tell you for a long time.

124
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,360
But I held back,

125
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,900
fearing you'd be angry.

126
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,340
May I ask

127
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,310
which noble family would have mistresses

128
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,410
without a wife?

129
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,760
Xingzhou.

130
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,350
Is what they say

131
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,720
true?

132
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,800
Hearing them,

133
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,580
she does sound like a mistress.

134
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,050
But in fact,

135
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,460
she is treated as a legitimate wife

136
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,700
beside me.

137
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,320
You...

138
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,000
Have you lost your mind

139
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,190
because of her deception?

140
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,850
Mother, she never deceived me.

141
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,580
Rather, it's I who deceived her all along.

142
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,220
I can't let her go.

143
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,460
It was my decision

144
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,020
after much thought.

145
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,730
It will not change.

146
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,600
She is a woman of a poor background.

147
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,930
Her name is Liu Miantang.

148
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,850
She is from a good family.

149
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,270
In the future,

150
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,290
if I hear any insults

151
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,720
toward her again,

152
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,660
no matter who it is,

153
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,030
I will not

154
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,290
forgive them easily.

155
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,400
Mother,

156
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,260
I will take my leave now.

157
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,230
Xingzhou.

158
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,520
Xingzhou.

159
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,970
Are you going

160
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,220
to defy your mother for her?

161
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,030
Sister.

162
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,160
- Sister.
- Aunt.

163
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,430
Don't let it affect your health.

164
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,270
Sister.

165
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,460
I heard that this time,

166
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,220
you made the madam very angry.

167
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,660
After Father's death,

168
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,390
I haven't seen you and the madam

169
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,490
quarrel like this.

170
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,900
Didn't you say before that it

171
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,490
didn't matter whom you married,

172
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,020
as long as she could

173
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,950
take on the role

174
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:29,790
of the Princess?

175
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,900
People do change.

176
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:36,820
Now I only feel

177
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,050
that status doesn't matter,

178
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,780
as long as I marry her.

179
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,030
Xingzhou.

180
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,120
You've never been infatuated

181
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,100
with romantic love.

182
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,000
Now, with the court

183
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,020
and you at odds,

184
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,160
anything could become a tool

185
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,340
for malicious people.

186
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,410
Do make sound decisions.

187
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,430
Isn't it unsound to marry someone

188
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,370
I don't love?

189
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,100
- Xingzhou.
- Xingdi.

190
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:03,970
My mind is made up.

191
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,900
I know I can't persuade you.

192
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,170
I only hope you won't regret it.

193
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,320
I'm leaving.

194
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,110
Madam.

195
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,590
What's wrong?

196
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,720
Fresh candied hawthorn.

197
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,850
The street is full of porcelain shops.

198
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,340
It's best not to break any.

199
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,010
- But he
- Candy.

200
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,590
- still sells unlucky fringes.
- Not sweet, no money.

201
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,460
It's strange.

202
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,370
- There are always fools.
- Candied hawthorn.

203
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,070
Fresh candied hawthorn.

204
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:04,580
Fresh candied hawthorn.

205
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,060
I've seen you.

206
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,010
At the market.

207
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,730
(Jewelry)
How much is this hairpin?

208
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,920
One guan.

209
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,870
The jade on it is real, right?

210
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,730
Only one guan?

211
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,130
I misspoke.

212
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,680
One tael of gold.

213
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,540
I changed places.

214
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:28,920
Fresh candied hawthorn.

215
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,080
Not sweet, no money.

216
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,340
How much is this hairpin?

217
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,440
One guan of silver.

218
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,200
Not sweet, no money.

219
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,250
But it's just some silk flowers.

220
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,060
How can it be sold like jade?

221
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,840
Sir.

222
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,700
Did you make a mistake?

223
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:45,970
This kind of hairpin

224
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,010
is worth at most one hundred wen.

225
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,550
Yes. My memory is poor.

226
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,390
I made a mistake.

227
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:53,350
It's one hundred wen.

228
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,070
Fresh candied hawthorn.

229
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,840
Two wen each.

230
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,000
The remaining accounts

231
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,060
must be delivered tomorrow.

232
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,130
My eyelid keeps twitching these days.

233
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,250
I'm worried there might be something bad.

234
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,630
Yes. Rest assured.

235
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,100
Miss. Miss.

236
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,600
Lord Huaiyang and the army

237
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,730
have returned to Zhenzhou.

238
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,030
Mrs. Cui

239
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,180
should have returned as well.

240
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,040
Prepare.

241
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,920
To the North Street.

242
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,040
Yes.

243
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,730
Sister, Sister.

244
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,960
Sister, someone sent this for you.

245
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,080
It must be from some suitor

246
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,220
admiring our lady.

247
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,730
Jasmine is the heavenly flower.

248
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,100
The fragrance cools down.

249
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,280
My Lord.

250
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,350
Miss He.

251
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,800
Long time no see.

252
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,370
Glad to see you're safe.

253
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,840
What?

254
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,590
Did you miss me?

255
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,180
You sent supplies for the country.

256
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,420
I wouldn't want you to die in battle.

257
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,420
I missed you.

258
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,180
After returning to Lingquan Town,

259
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,540
it seemed you were avoiding me.

260
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,850
I've been looking for you.

261
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,060
Did you know?

262
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,820
After I sent you off that day,

263
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,060
my heart ached deeply,

264
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,420
reluctant to part.

265
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,730
Later, on the battlefield,

266
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,300
I've experienced extreme danger.

267
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,010
I fell and hurt my head

268
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,890
and then was captured.

269
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,840
Every time,

270
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,610
it was extremely dangerous.

271
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,340
Every time I faced danger,

272
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:03,820
I thought of you,

273
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,100
secretly relieved.

274
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,010
Fortunately, I sent you away,

275
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,250
- and you weren't there.
- Lord Zhao.

276
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,820
What are you trying to say?

277
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,550
Miss He.

278
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,650
You're independent

279
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,180
and graceful.

280
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,420
When I see jasmine,

281
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,370
I think of you.

282
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,080
Zhao Quan.

283
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,420
I know

284
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,510
what you're up to.

285
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,300
Ms. Liu returned with the army.

286
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,100
Lord Huaiyang is worried.

287
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,650
He sent you here

288
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:39,710
to block my words.

289
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:46,340
That's their family matter.

290
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,340
If you regard Liu Miantang as a friend,

291
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,080
you should wish her well.

292
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,180
Why do this thankless job?

293
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,590
Besides,

294
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,460
even if you told her,

295
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,790
what if Liu Miantang

296
00:12:58,790 --> 00:12:59,890
forgives the Lord?

297
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,650
Wouldn't you be causing trouble for yourself?

298
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,890
We don't lie to each other.

299
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,820
I'll tell Miantang the truth.

300
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,420
Whether she forgives him,

301
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,370
that's their business.

302
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,890
I'll have no guilt.

303
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,890
Miss He. Miss He.

304
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,650
I'll tell you honestly.

305
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,580
Times have changed.

306
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:27,580
They've fallen for each other.

307
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,700
Through lies?

308
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,320
I mean

309
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,510
they reunited on the battlefield.

310
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,580
They like each other.

311
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,870
They took that chance

312
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:37,940
to clear everything up.

313
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,340
He's about to propose to her.

314
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,320
Well.

315
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,130
Does Ms. Liu already know?

316
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,840
So, I'm worried

317
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,150
that if you speak carelessly,

318
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,650
you'll provoke unwanted hostility.

319
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,130
I'm just being considerate.

320
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,180
Are you deceiving me?

321
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:08,700
Deceive?

322
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,820
Deceive?

323
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,250
Why?

324
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,580
Why would I deceive you?

325
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,610
Think about it.

326
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,960
They're a couple.

327
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,490
They have experienced danger together.

328
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,030
Compared to life,

329
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,420
these small matters are nothing.

330
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,490
Besides,

331
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,770
has Lord Huaiyang never seen a woman?

332
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,940
If he can't even speak about this,

333
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,420
either he is a useless piece of mud

334
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,590
or

335
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,110
he is

336
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,490
a dark-hearted maniac.

337
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,820
How can he govern Zhenzhou?

338
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,890
You've seen him.

339
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,460
What do you think?

340
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,730
With Liu Miantang's temperament,

341
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,580
she has been deceived like this.

342
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,010
How could she endure it?

343
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,730
No other waters can beat the sea.

344
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,390
She could.

345
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,160
She could.

346
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,610
Say it

347
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,100
again.

348
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,890
Lord Zhao gave flowers to Miss He

349
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,220
and accompanied her.

350
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,340
They talked for a while.

351
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,970
I was following them.

352
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,220
The Lord said he missed Miss He.

353
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:34,890
I thought

354
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,010
this matter had come to an end.

355
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:43,220
Unexpectedly, the situation turned around.

356
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,300
Good, good.

357
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,060
What's good?

358
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,670
Perhaps the Lord was

359
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,850
trying to buy porcelain.

360
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,870
The Lord said something

361
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:52,870
about the sea.

362
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:55,180
No other waters can beat the sea.

363
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,120
On the battlefield...

364
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,150
So, he realized

365
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:00,580
his feelings for Zhen.

366
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,460
I knew it.

367
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,730
Perhaps that's what he meant.

368
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:08,000
The Lord also mentioned a proposal.

369
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,840
What?

370
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:09,990
A proposal?

371
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,320
Miss He said,

372
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,540
"Are you deceiving me?"

373
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,940
They also mentioned Lord Huaiyang.

374
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,700
Lord Huaiyang as the matchmaker?

375
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,870
Good.

376
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,420
That's great.

377
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,060
Great.

378
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,280
Very good.

379
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,790
How could I marry Zhao Quan?

380
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:28,630
Nonsense.

381
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:30,730
Lord Zhennan

382
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,220
has found a matchmaker.

383
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,100
How can you be so picky?

384
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:36,970
But I have

385
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,850
no feelings for him at all.

386
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,960
Lord Zhao is so proactive.

387
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,490
You should seize it.

388
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,510
But at the critical moment,

389
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,350
you...

390
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,820
You are useless.

391
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,630
Besides,

392
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,700
when borrowing the convoy,

393
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,440
he also personally

394
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,940
agreed to the engagement.

395
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,650
Father, you should know.

396
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,370
To borrow the convoy,

397
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,550
the Lord was willing

398
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,740
to agree to anything verbally.

399
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,240
Father.

400
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,850
Don't be deluded.

401
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,210
The Lord's family

402
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,310
isn't one our family

403
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,260
can reach.

404
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,410
Where are you going?

405
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,260
To the porcelain shop.

406
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,520
Someone.

407
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,580
Without my permission,

408
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:27,610
she's not to leave this room.

409
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:28,630
- Yes.
- Yes.

410
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,840
Father.

411
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,500
Open the door.

412
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,650
I won't marry him.

413
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,020
Why did you come back so late?

414
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,720
Did the Lord ask you

415
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,300
to stay for a meal?

416
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,200
A meal?

417
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,540
They didn't even let me in.

418
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,070
Said it's inappropriate to discuss marriage

419
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,590
after the war.

420
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,070
They said

421
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:05,110
Zhen was a woman of great virtue.

422
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,580
He's not worthy.

423
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,170
I think

424
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,300
he wants to go back on his word.

425
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,450
Unbelievable.

426
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,080
Father.

427
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,080
Well.

428
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,300
Calm down.

429
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,590
I still

430
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,930
have a brilliant plan.

431
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,150
A brilliant plan?

432
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,130
The game is over.

433
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,540
- Can he win?
- Definitely not.

434
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,850
If he can't, then leave.

435
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,260
I admit defeat.

436
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,200
Yes, very clever.

437
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,040
Very clever.

438
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,750
- This move is too clever.
- Clever.

439
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,740
From the move,

440
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:04,890
I knew who it was.

441
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:08,930
I admit defeat.

442
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,040
Guangcai.

443
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,300
Long time no see.

444
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,240
Thank you all.

445
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,740
Let's meet another day.

446
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,170
Goodbye.

447
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,760
Xingzhou.

448
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,820
Long time no see.

449
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,310
But I've heard

450
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,410
about you in Beizhou.

451
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:35,590
In a situation of overwhelming odds,

452
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,130
you achieved a great victory.

453
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,820
I'm deeply impressed.

454
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,890
As a scholar,

455
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,830
I find it hard to compare with you.

456
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,030
Enough, enough.

457
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,410
Can't you be less modest?

458
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:46,670
The No.3 scholar.

459
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,820
If the late Emperor
hadn't withdrawn your paper,

460
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,110
and you missed the Palace Exam,

461
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:53,200
how could I have ranked among the top three?

462
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,170
Back then, in the mansion,

463
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,920
you and my sister started the poetry society.

464
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,100
Every poem you wrote left me utterly defeated.

465
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,690
Years have passed.

466
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,410
How

467
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,610
is your sister,

468
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,210
Mrs. Guo?

469
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,320
She is well.

470
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,820
How about you, Guangcai?

471
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,390
I'm doing well.

472
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,720
I'm well.

473
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,210
It's just

474
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,060
that I can no longer write poetry.

475
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,850
I've completely changed my interests.

476
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,150
I've taken up Go.

477
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,560
By the way,

478
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,200
I was on my way

479
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,740
back to the capital to report my duties.

480
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:36,540
Hearing that you had urgent business with me,

481
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,370
I changed my route here.

482
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,540
What's the urgent matter?

483
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,110
You've been the magistrate

484
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,820
in Beizhou for many years.

485
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,100
Have you heard of the Shenwei Escort Agency?

486
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,480
Of course.

487
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,300
It's a time-honored brand in Beizhou.

488
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,580
It declined and closed years ago,

489
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,450
But their master is still alive.

490
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,280
What? Are you investigating a case?

491
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,300
Be my matchmaker.

492
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,280
You?

493
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,210
Yes.

494
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,440
What's so strange?

495
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,280
Help me propose.

496
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,350
Xingzhou, you must be joking.

497
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:11,740
How could I be joking with you?

498
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,270
You're among the top three

499
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,980
and hold an important position in Beizhou.

500
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,450
You're the most suitable.

501
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,070
But I didn't expect

502
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,820
that they had such an outstanding woman

503
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,340
who could be your match.

504
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,820
I forgot to tell you.

505
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,930
This woman is in Zhenzhou.

506
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,510
After hearing so much from me today,

507
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:33,070
do you understand why

508
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,100
I must marry her?

509
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:35,670
Not quite.

510
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,200
But since you trust me so much,

511
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,040
I will

512
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,560
definitely help.

513
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,190
That's good.

514
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,780
By the way, there's another matter.

515
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,350
This person

516
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,890
is named Qiulin Xian.

517
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,650
(Qiulin Xian)
He is a suspect involved with the tribes.

518
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,060
He appeared in Beizhou before.

519
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,340
This kid is really capable.

520
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:05,950
That's right.

521
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,410
He was recommended by the boss.

522
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,380
- Fugui.
- Watch on him.

523
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,350
Okay.

524
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,760
Come.

525
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,040
Boss.

526
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:15,030
We're praising the worker you brought.

527
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,370
He really makes things easier.

528
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,800
That's good.

529
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,030
This is a new batch of goods.

530
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:20,980
Go check it.

531
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,980
Okay, I'll go immediately.

532
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,850
You, come with me.

533
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,130
Qiulin.

534
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,130
He's a Qi person with a tribe surname.

535
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,370
Pay more attention to him.

536
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,920
See if there's anyone named Lin

537
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,500
who's an escaped convict.

538
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,170
I remember the "Clan Records" said

539
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,500
the western tribes'

540
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,740
Qiulin in the Han people is Lin.

541
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,930
Nobles change their surname

542
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,000
to Qiao.

543
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,370
How's the situation in Beizhou?

544
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,590
Don't worry.

545
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:56,060
My alias is very convincing.

546
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,510
Even if he's smart,

547
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,740
he'll only check the Lins.

548
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,540
How would he think that I'm a Qiao?

549
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,100
What about Grandfather?

550
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,780
Your grandfather

551
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:10,210
thinks you've married into the Cui family.

552
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,030
He knows nothing

553
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:12,870
about the iron mine.

554
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,300
So he won't be implicated.

555
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:19,880
But if he knew what you had done

556
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,980
these years,

557
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,260
he would definitely break my legs.

558
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,450
Lu Zhong and Lu Yi will be in Zhenzhou soon.

559
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,980
Your plan

560
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,300
will soon come to fruition.

561
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,210
Check everyone one by one.

562
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,320
What's going on?

563
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,930
Are you two workers here?

564
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,430
Yes.

565
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,020
What's inside?

566
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,210
Those are newly painted clay bricks.

567
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,030
They must be kept in a cool place.

568
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:21,870
No sunlight.

569
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,500
No sunlight?

570
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,830
If you lift this curtain,

571
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,650
we will have wasted two days' work.

572
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,030
There are ten worker plates.

573
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:30,980
But only nine people.

574
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,150
Where's the tenth one?

575
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,170
Come on.

576
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,550
Take down

577
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:37,390
your plates.

578
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,300
- Hurry up.
- Alright.

579
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,890
- Hurry up.
- Hurry up.

580
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,150
Move.

581
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,320
- Move.
- Hurry up.

582
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:47,890
Hurry up.

583
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:50,420
(Huang Zichun)

584
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,890
Whose plate is this?

585
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,020
It's still hanging here.

586
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,650
I thought it was lost.

587
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,060
Ms. Liu.

588
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:13,780
I'm late.

589
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,820
What's going on?

590
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,450
Just a routine inspection.

591
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,690
Are you also a worker here?

592
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,200
I thought

593
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,060
I was an untalented painter.

594
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,780
Sir, please don't make fun of me.

595
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,110
Let's go.

596
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,610
Get back to work.

597
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,780
- Yes.
- Hurry up and work.

598
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,410
Thank you for your help.

599
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,780
To be honest,

600
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,170
this is my uncle.

601
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,200
He has suffered

602
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,780
some false accusations back home,

603
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,410
so he came here to avoid them.

604
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,450
Ms. Liu, no need to explain.

605
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,070
Ms. Liu.

606
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:03,030
Everyone knows

607
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,850
your character.

608
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,000
Moreover,

609
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,100
these people are all grateful
and repay the kindness.

610
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,390
Goodbye.

611
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,980
Come, My Lord.

612
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,240
The people haven't arrived yet.

613
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,080
Why serve the wine?

614
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,280
Yes.

615
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,750
When will Father

616
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,610
and the uncles arrive?

617
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:41,910
They are almost here.

618
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,890
While the elders haven't arrived,

619
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,270
let me first offer a drink

620
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,070
to the contributors of the grain transport.

621
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,790
Without your joint efforts...

622
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:51,630
No need for that.

623
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,130
Today, I'm here

624
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,980
to clarify matters with Mr. He.

625
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:56,190
When will he arrive?

626
00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:00,370
Perhaps he is delayed at the ancestral hall.

627
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,060
Zhen, fill the cup

628
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,340
and drink with the Lord.

629
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,200
Quarrels in bed are soon reconciled.

630
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,170
A couple's grudge won't last overnight.

631
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,210
Stop talking nonsense.

632
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,750
Today, I invited you here

633
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,340
to explain to the elders

634
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:18,890
the promises made when you asked

635
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,300
for our assistance.

636
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,270
As I said, this is a misunderstanding.

637
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:24,110
A misunderstanding.

638
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,240
I'm here today

639
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,610
to clear things up with everyone.

640
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,020
It's not a misunderstanding.

641
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:31,630
It's deceit.

642
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,060
How can you say that?

643
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,540
Your words are too harsh.

644
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:36,910
I didn't deceive you.

645
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,040
I won't talk to you.

646
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,480
When your father arrives later,

647
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,740
I'll confront him directly.

648
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,690
How dare you mention my father?

649
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,640
It was your idea to confine me

650
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,740
at home, wasn't it?

651
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,840
You were confined?

652
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,540
Why are you sitting here?

653
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,410
If it were my idea,

654
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,060
I would keep you confined forever.

655
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,260
Things will be simpler.

656
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:58,590
See?

657
00:27:58,790 --> 00:27:59,930
It's your idea.

658
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,820
You're afraid I would come out

659
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:03,960
and ruin the good plans of you nobles.

660
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,800
You...

661
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,840
This...

662
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,130
Come on, My Lord.

663
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,750
Calm down.

664
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:10,750
I will tell her.

665
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:11,590
Dare you!

666
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,480
You speak grandly

667
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,440
but deceive and cheat.

668
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,300
I won't tolerate it.

669
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,480
Who are you talking about?

670
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,340
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

671
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,060
You've made me feel hot.

672
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:37,630
My Lord.

673
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:40,910
My Lord.

674
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,610
Father should be here.

675
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,200
I'll go to welcome him.

676
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,040
Go ahead.

677
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,100
Have you been drinking?

678
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,890
There's tea on the table.

679
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,260
Have some to sober up.

680
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,130
What are you saying?

681
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:32,540
I said

682
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,210
there was tea on the table.

683
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,100
Go drink a cup

684
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,480
to help you sober up.

685
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,450
How much have you drunk?

686
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,020
Come on. Have some tea.

687
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,280
No.

688
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,580
I haven't been home these past few days.

689
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,450
Are you angry?

690
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,270
It was common for you

691
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,060
to not return for Go games before.

692
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,820
Now you have official duties.

693
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,410
I'm very glad.

694
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,410
How could I be angry?

695
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:20,130
Anyway, you're different

696
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:22,390
now.

697
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,170
You now have a bright future.

698
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,690
As your wife,

699
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,410
I don't want to fall behind.

700
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,170
Miss He,

701
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,610
I rarely see you

702
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:55,850
like this.

703
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,130
My Lord.

704
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,690
You speak so harshly.

705
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:08,780
It's really not proper.

706
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,100
Then I won't speak.

707
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:16,060
What are you laughing at?

708
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:32,890
Why is it so hot

709
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,370
in this room?

710
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,260
What are you looking at?

711
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,820
You're really beautiful.

712
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,340
Sweating.

713
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,610
The beautiful lady is drinking.

714
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,890
You should be happy

715
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,780
and drink with me.

716
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,100
Nonsense.

717
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,300
Talking in riddles.

718
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:50,890
Aren't you hot?

719
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:54,870
Yes.

720
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,060
Miss He.

721
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,100
Miss He.

722
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,450
Miss He.

723
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:12,980
Miss He.

724
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:15,590
My Lord.

725
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,840
Stop shouting.

726
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,980
It seems we've been drugged.

727
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,820
Someone!

728
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,020
Hurry and come!

729
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,410
Hurry and come!

730
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,580
Hurry and come!

731
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:57,210
Help!

732
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,550
Help!

733
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:01,780
Someone!

734
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,650
Help me!

735
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:07,030
Someone!

736
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,070
Seems something happened.

737
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,230
Should we go check?

738
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,130
Don't meddle.

739
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,920
It's my private room.

740
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,920
Is anyone there?

741
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:13,980
I know what's going on.

742
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,980
Let me out!

743
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,640
- Get me another pot of wine.
- Someone!

744
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:24,500
Help!

745
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,810
Dry wood meets a fierce fire.

746
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,650
Let me out!

747
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:43,510
Miantang.

748
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,980
I've said before.

749
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,030
I

750
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,690
promised you

751
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,460
that when we returned to Zhenzhou,

752
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,980
I would live a good life.

753
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,980
Now that day is approaching.

754
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,250
So,

755
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:05,130
don't be so hard on yourself.

756
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,060
If one day you feel

757
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,030
tired

758
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,350
and weary,

759
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:15,250
just let go

760
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:19,060
and leave everything to me.

761
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,800
I'll give you

762
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:23,250
everything you want.

763
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,250
Honey.

764
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,760
Can you take me

765
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,020
to meet Lord Huaiyang?

766
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:32,550
You...

767
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:34,580
Why do you want to see him?

768
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,590
The Lord has been very kind to you.

769
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:38,510
Out of gratitude,

770
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,210
I should go thank him.

771
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,580
He is secluded

772
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:47,550
and taking care of the Consort Dowager.

773
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:49,060
I can't even see him.

774
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,540
How filial of the Lord.

775
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,210
Once he returned to Zhenzhou,

776
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:55,480
he's forgotten about the soldiers who risked

777
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,420
their lives for him.

778
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:57,610
No, no.

779
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,280
He won't.

780
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,810
The Lord values the soldiers.

781
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,420
The Lord

782
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,380
will set up a memorial altar

783
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:10,100
for the soldiers who died in battle

784
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,280
to save their souls.

785
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,590
Why are you so worried?

786
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:13,690
I'm not talking about you.

787
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:15,870
Well.

788
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,460
I'm not worried.

789
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,030
Honey,

790
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,330
sleep in the guest room tonight.

791
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,210
I'm not feeling well.

792
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,250
Why?

793
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:34,950
My period.

794
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:41,320
Since you're unwell,

795
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,650
I can't go.

796
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,070
Get up.

797
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,100
What should we do?

798
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,250
Don't look at me like that.

799
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,650
It's too cruel.

800
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,250
Aren't you a physician?

801
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,730
Where are your needles?

802
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,170
Miss He, stay calm.

803
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,900
Who brings silver needles when going out?

804
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,650
Don't make any beastly acts.

805
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,980
At this moment...

806
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:22,470
Beastly?

807
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,280
My Lord.

808
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,800
Miss.

809
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,070
My Lord.

810
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,120
Miss.

811
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,200
I'm sorry.

812
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,690
Zhao Quan!

813
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,650
Is it better?

814
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:09,210
For the next few days,

815
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,290
don't go out.

816
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,730
Zhenzhou is under martial law.

817
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,320
The Lord will send

818
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,210
additional personnel for patrols.

819
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,330
It's a good time

820
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:21,020
for you to rest.

821
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:24,690
The war is over.

822
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,130
Why is there still martial law?

823
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:30,810
That rat

824
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:32,810
might come to Zhenzhou.

825
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,170
Are you sure?

826
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:42,500
I'm not sure.

827
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,940
Just being cautious.

828
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,330
I see.

829
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:54,860
I'm feeling much better now.

830
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,640
Zhao Quan.

831
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:44,990
You're awake.

832
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,600
You...

833
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:09,990
Where's Zhen?

834
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:15,210
Lord Zhennan is also here.

835
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,020
Did they spend the night?

836
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,810
I used something for them.

837
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,100
You jerk!

838
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,130
- Father.
- Is this your solution?

839
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:30,760
You're ruining

840
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,860
our family's reputation!

841
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,200
My Lord.

842
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:36,800
My Lord.

843
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:40,860
Don't touch me.

844
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,380
My Lord, please spare me.

845
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,940
Please spare me.

846
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:47,020
It's my fault

847
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,540
for not disciplining my son.

848
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:50,610
My daughter, Zhen,

849
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:52,610
has also offended you.

850
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,730
Miss He

851
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,130
and I

852
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,170
are clean and innocent.

853
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,900
Once we leave this door,

854
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:09,060
I will

855
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,980
protect Miss He's reputation.

856
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,720
Of course.

857
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:17,130
If Miss He

858
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,250
still feels unsettled,

859
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,610
I will take full responsibility.

860
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:27,730
With all the rituals,

861
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,980
I will marry you.

862
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:32,500
Thank you, My Lord.

863
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:40,510
My...

864
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:42,940
My Lord.

865
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,380
From now on,

866
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,100
if anyone

867
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:55,810
dares to speak ill

868
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,860
of you,

869
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,500
I will make them

870
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,130
have no place to live

871
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,900
