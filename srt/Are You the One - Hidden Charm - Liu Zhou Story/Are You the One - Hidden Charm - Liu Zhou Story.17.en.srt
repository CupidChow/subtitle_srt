=Episode 17=

14
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,330
Were we in the capital

15
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,860
at this time last year?

16
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,500
Yes, we were in the capital.

17
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,330
We were doing porcelain business.

18
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,300
Why did you suddenly ask about this?

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,170
I'm just thinking

20
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,300
that the days now are so good.

21
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,860
It's almost scary.

22
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,780
What's there to be afraid of?

23
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,230
Honey,

24
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,660
did you ask Mr. Fan to follow me

25
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,710
because you were worried

26
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,180
about me, right?

27
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,480
Yes.

28
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,810
I have military duties

29
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,620
and can't always be by your side.

30
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,620
With Fan Hu protecting you, I'm more at ease.

31
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,530
Besides, Xizhou is different from Zhenzhou.

32
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,570
There could be disturbances at any time.

33
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,410
Especially tonight.

34
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,590
You must stay inside

35
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,940
and not run around, understood?

36
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,060
I see.

37
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,620
Honey, you're so good to me.

38
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,060
This is far from enough.

39
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,020
(Fangtang Villa)

40
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:19,340
(Fangtang Villa)

41
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,220
Madam, you called for me?

42
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,920
I got some good wine today.

43
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,570
Nanny Li, join me for a drink.

44
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,180
Madam, that's not appropriate.

45
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,730
My husband is on night duty.

46
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,940
It's cold and boring on a rainy night.

47
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,830
Nanny Li, have a drink with me

48
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:17,880
to warm up

49
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,230
and chat.

50
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,580
What's inappropriate about it?

51
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,400
Sit down.

52
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:23,900
Thank you, Madam.

53
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,790
Madam, let me do it.

54
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:27,630
No need.

55
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,800
My Lord, please.

56
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:31,750
Governor, please.

57
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,710
My Lord, you've risked your life
for our country.

58
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,850
That's a lasting achievement.

59
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,930
How admirable.

60
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,530
I've prepared some wine.

61
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,820
Please honor me by drinking.

62
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,020
Governor, you're too kind.

63
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,490
This is to you.

64
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,050
How dare I?

65
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,780
Along the way,

66
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,020
you invested all your effort

67
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,820
to take great care of me.

68
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,410
It's what I should do.

69
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,780
You're getting on in years,
so just sip lightly.

70
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,490
Madam.

71
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,830
Let's drink together for fun.

72
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,290
Stop calling me "Madam".

73
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,280
My Lord,

74
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,480
I,

75
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,140
on behalf of the people of Qi,

76
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,660
toast to you.

77
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,050
I'll drink first.

78
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,600
My Lord,

79
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,410
you've been on the battlefield.

80
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:48,930
You're so meticulous.

81
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,780
Governor, don't take offense.

82
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,730
Lately, someone's been targeting me,

83
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,660
so I must be more cautious.

84
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,410
My Lord, you're the pillar of the nation.

85
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,230
Who would dare cross you?

86
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,820
Of course, there are.

87
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,700
Those who collude

88
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,580
with the western tribes,

89
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,660
trying to smuggle iron ore.

90
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,820
Salt and iron

91
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,050
are national reserves.

92
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:19,990
Governor,

93
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,200
if someone is colluding with the western tribes

94
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,050
to smuggle iron ore,

95
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,580
what are they planning?

96
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,530
Could it be

97
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:33,970
to prepare for war?

98
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,170
My Lord,

99
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,100
have you investigated thoroughly?

100
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,290
Such an accusation

101
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,850
could lead to the death of their entire family.

102
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,580
Didn't I tell you?

103
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,850
A Gushan has confessed everything.

104
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,410
Dinner is ready.

105
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,460
Governor.

106
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,590
The weather's cold.

107
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:31,490
Why are you sweating so much?

108
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,780
Here, keep it to wipe your sweat.

109
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,900
I'm recovering from a cold,

110
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,730
so I'm still weak.

111
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:44,140
Then let me help you refresh yourself.

112
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,360
Someone.

113
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,700
Bring A Gushan here.

114
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,140
For questioning.

115
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,260
My Lord, this handkerchief...

116
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,140
Please keep it.

117
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,540
Let me think.

118
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,850
Since the founding of the nation,

119
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,110
there's never been a precedent

120
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,850
for killing prisoners of war.

121
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,390
But if the prisoner decides

122
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,770
to commit suicide out of guilt,

123
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,650
even a god couldn't save him.

124
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,680
Relying solely on A Gushan's words

125
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,490
isn't enough.

126
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,940
But if someone

127
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,180
is eager to silence him

128
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:02,820
and

129
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,010
is caught red-handed,

130
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,100
that's a whole different story.

131
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,340
My Lord, we've captured a live one.

132
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,100
We owe this to the Governor's cooperation.

133
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,490
What's going on?

134
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,080
If you reveal the mastermind behind this,

135
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,940
I guarantee your safety.

136
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,420
My Lord, I'm unwell.

137
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,850
Please wait a moment.

138
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,470
Please wait.

139
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,280
Yes.

140
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,320
Come on.

141
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,800
Dear.

142
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,890
- Honey.
- Dear.

143
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,760
Honey.

144
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:05,730
- Go pack.
- Father.

145
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,680
Pack? Pack what?

146
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,580
We're going to Huizhou.

147
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,220
Governor.

148
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:12,550
Governor.

149
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,300
The Zhenzhou army is outside.

150
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,800
I see. You may leave.

151
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,640
- Yes.
- No.

152
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,770
What's happening?

153
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,120
Don't worry, dear.

154
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,770
I work for Prince Sui.

155
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,700
He'll protect us.

156
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,180
Hurry. Pack your things.

157
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,370
Hurry up.

158
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,590
Go.

159
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,370
Purple Snake Root.

160
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,300
It's indeed poisonous.

161
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,550
My Lord,

162
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,590
the body's been laid out.

163
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,940
A Gushan is back in the jail.

164
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,340
I bet Sheng Zong never thought

165
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,650
the one silenced wasn't A Gushan

166
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,220
but himself.

167
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,460
From the moment I captured A Gushan alive,

168
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,100
he started plotting.

169
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:30,650
So cunning. Such tactics.

170
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,180
Sheng Zong is dead.

171
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,060
Who will be next?

172
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:52,660
(Warehouse)

173
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:57,940

(Pingyuan Escort Agency)

176
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,420
Let me see.

177
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,520
Let me see.

178
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,970
No, I won't.

179
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,200
(Escort)
No, I won't.

180
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,220
Let me see.

181
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:23,990
Uncle Qiao gave it to me.

182
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:25,160
If you wanna see it, ask him.

183
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,040
Stingy.

184
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,880
Yes, I am.

185
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,610
Don't you know I'm famously stingy?

186
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,890
What are you snatching?

187
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,940
Ms. Zhao.

188
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,220
Qiao!

189
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,940
You jerk!

190
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,970
Of all things, why did you bring back

191
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:43,960
this "Beauty Pictures"

192
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,580
from the western tribes?

193
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:46,830
Ms. Zhao.

194
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,230
The book...

195
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,070
My book...

196
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,280
Be good. Listen now.

197
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,920
Look, look.

198
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,420
I'm giving you something nice.

199
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,940
Your sister's favorite orange.

200
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,590
Sister.

201
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,110
- Sister.
- Sister.

202
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:04,130
Miss.

203
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:30,460
(Escort)

204
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,320
Brothers,

205
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,650
our deal is done.

206
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:45,010
Do the tribe people
really want us to transport iron?

207
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:48,010
If you don't trust the old Wolf Lord,

208
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,280
you should believe

209
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,820
in my silver tongue, right?

210
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,800
From now on,

211
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,730
this will be your new identity in Xizhou.

212
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,700
You've followed me despite the danger.

213
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:57,970
I will remember

214
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,010
this kindness.

215
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,320
You're in charge here.

216
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,510
We'll do whatever

217
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,590
you want us to.

218
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,320
Yes, yes.

219
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,220
We'll listen to you.

220
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,200
Here you go.

221
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,920
Miantang.

222
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,880
Where's mine?

223
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,850
Of course, your plate

224
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,770
is carved by me.

225
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:23,420
(Qiulin Xian)

226
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,610
Miss.

227
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,770
It really is you.

228
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,130
You finally came back.

229
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,490
Where have you been all this time?

230
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,590
Zhao...

231
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,300
Ms. Zhao?

232
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,060
Where is everyone else?

233
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,250
Those boys

234
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,770
have a night escort

235
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,700
and are all asleep now.

236
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,340
Let's go inside.

237
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,060
Come on.

238
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:07,710
Let's go.

239
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,010
It's cold and rainy.

240
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,490
Don't get cold.

241
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,190
Come.

242
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,340
Sit down.

243
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,040
Look.

244
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,540
I just roasted this on the stove.

245
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,300
It's still hot.

246
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,710
Warm your hands

247
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,550
before eating.

248
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,130
I need to go wake up those boys.

249
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,440
When they see you,

250
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,650
who knows how happy they'll be?

251
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,890
Eat, eat.

252
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,580
I'll be right back.

253
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,540
Eat.

254
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:10,610
Haichao.

255
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,700
- Haichao.
- Grandma.

256
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,460
Ms. Liu is back.

257
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:15,510
Sister is back?

258
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,820
- She's back.
- Sister.

259
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,650
I'll go call...

260
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,310
Who are you?

261
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:13,740
Haichao?

262
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,170
Sister, come with me through the front door.

263
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,020
- Your hand...
- Hurry, come with me.

264
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,440
Ms. Zhao!

265
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,580
Sister, I'm sorry.

266
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:58,140
(Escort)

267
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,890
- Search!
- Yes!

268
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:59,740
(Escort)

269
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,740
Boss, the bodies are all loaded onto the carts.

270
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:02,840
We couldn't find

271
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,890
any trace of Qiulin Xian.

272
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,210
He's not in the escort agency.

273
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,690
He won't last much longer.

274
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:09,910
How about the ledger?

275
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,300
All packed up.

276
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,240
Retreat.

277
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,200
Sister.

278
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:42,870
Uncle.

279
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,650
How did I do in this act?

280
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,360
Tell the brothers to retreat.

281
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,450
Don't let them get caught.

282
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,020
Don't let Grandfather find out.

283
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,100
Don't worry.

284
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,160
I'll tell him

285
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,650
you safely married into the capital.

286
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,170
But Miantang,

287
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,100
once you go,

288
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,450
there's no turning back.

289
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,210
I know.

290
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,200
Go.

291
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,680
Miantang,

292
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,210
have you regretted this?

293
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:25,340
I chose this myself.

294
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,060
What's there to regret?

295
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,300
If I hadn't met your uncle,

296
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,370
we would have remained strangers.

297
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,820
You wouldn't have to live this life,

298
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,410
always risking your life.

299
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,740
Then I

300
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,890
would have chosen my own path as well.

301
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,980
(Lu Wen)

302
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,610
Lu Wen.

303
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,060
Why use this alias?

304
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,990
My grandfather was
the sixth child in the family.

305
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:05,060
His courtesy name was Luwu.

306
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,850
As his granddaughter,

307
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,820
I must be both scholarly and martial.

308
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,710
A woman can't roam the world.

309
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:12,890
From now on,

310
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:15,060
the name Liu Miantang

311
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:17,100
will belong to Lu Wen's concubine.

312
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,410
And Lu Wen

313
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,410
will be the mastermind of Mount Yang.

314
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:27,180
(Pingyuan Escort Agency)

315
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,720
Break in!

316
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,060
Such a strong smell of blood.

317
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,210
There must've been
a fierce battle here just now.

318
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,550
They've cleaned up well.

319
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:56,590
Looks like they're used

320
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,780
to murder and robbery.

321
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,470
My Lord, there's no one inside

322
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,310
and no ledger.

323
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,070
My Lord, the escort carts are gone.

324
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,500
They didn't leave behind any ledger.

325
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,780
My Lord, there's no one in the backyard.

326
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:12,960
No one here either.

327
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,350
Seal the city gates.

328
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,500
They can't have gotten far.

329
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,860
Search the nearby streets.

330
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,680
Yes.

331
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,210
Come with me.

332
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:21,390
- Let's go.
- Go.

333
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:19,830
Dear?

334
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,720
Dear?

335
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,200
Dear?

336
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,200
Honey.

337
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,130
The Xizhou wine

338
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,610
sure packs a punch.

339
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,740
If I hadn't drunk so little,

340
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,540
I'd be

341
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,130
lying drunk

342
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,540
on the ground by now.

343
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:09,020
Honey, why were you so tense just now?

344
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:18,130
Oh, you took another woman's umbrella.

345
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:22,650
I see.

346
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,260
You've gained favor in front
of My Lord Huaiyang

347
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:27,930
and won a battle.

348
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,500
It's natural that others admire you.

349
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:35,450
Dear,

350
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,500
you must have misunderstood.

351
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,650
I found it

352
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,980
on our doorstep.

353
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,450
It must be yours.

354
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:51,850
How could that be?

355
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,410
My umbrella

356
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,370
is right here.

357
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:02,100
Xizhou is full of umbrellas like this.

358
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,130
Honey.

359
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:10,650
Don't overestimate your cleverness.

360
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,360
You might end up

361
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,060
leaving someone in the rain unknowingly.

362
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:37,740
Sorry.

363
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:40,610
I overthought it.

364
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,740
Your clothes are soaked.

365
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:46,170
Go change them quickly.

366
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,060
I'll make the sober-up soup.

367
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:22,410
Honey.

368
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,130
Three years ago,

369
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,100
when we were in the capital,

370
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,410
what were things like?

371
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,130
Why are you asking about that again?

372
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,340
I can't sleep.

373
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,100
I want to hear you talk.

374
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:45,690
Haven't I told you many times before?

375
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,340
Tell me again.

376
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:53,100
I've forgotten

377
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:57,690
a lot of the past.

378
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,210
This year,

379
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,890
I've often felt like a blind person.

380
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,060
Trapped in my heart.

381
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,600
Burdened by worries.

382
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,690
Completely lost.

383
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,890
We are bound by marriage.

384
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,500
No matter the circumstances,

385
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,210
I'm willing to trust you.

386
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,170
Please be my eyes.

387
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,740
So, honey.

388
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,740
Please tell me again.

389
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,650
What were we like

390
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:39,100
in the past?

391
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,890
I'm tired.

392
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:46,580
I don't want to talk about this.

393
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,710
You seem unhappy

394
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:52,890
since you came back.

395
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,990
I've encountered some

396
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:00,370
unpleasant things.

397
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,060
Why?

398
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:06,710
There's nothing to rely on,

399
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:07,740
nothing to trace.

400
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,750
The enemy on the battlefield

401
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,370
can be confronted directly,

402
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:15,340
but now, the challenges are

403
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,130
a hundred times

404
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,370
harder.

405
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,850
I shouldn't be telling you this.

406
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:37,300
You can tell me.

407
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,130
First,

408
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,300
you won't feel oppressed.

409
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,020
Second,

410
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,930
whether you're powerful or frustrated

411
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,650
outside,

412
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,740
you can enjoy my massage at home

413
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,610
and act like a child at ease.

414
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,740
Thank you, Miantang.

415
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:19,170
Did you also thank me

416
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,780
when I comforted you in the past?

417
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,100
In the past,

418
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,260
we didn't open up to each other like this.

419
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:30,550
Why?

420
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,340
Because

421
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,890
the affairs of the capital were very complex.

422
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:42,500
I didn't have time to come home every day.

423
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,650
If we didn't meet often,

424
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,740
how did our relationship become so deep

425
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:51,300
that you sold family assets
to treat my illness?

426
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:56,170
No.

427
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,170
It's not that it wasn't deep.

428
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,100
Dear,

429
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,980
when you just married me,

430
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,580
you had to learn business every day

431
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,100
as arranged by families.

432
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,730
We were

433
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,210
respectful to each other.

434
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,730
And then?

435
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,770
Then,

436
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,460
every day

437
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,420
when I came home,

438
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,900
I could see you,

439
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:25,580
with dinner prepared,

440
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,080
waiting for me.

441
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,600
Honey,

442
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,290
didn't you rarely come home?

443
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:39,500
After establishing a strong foundation,

444
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,770
I came home every day.

445
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,130
Every time

446
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,360
I came back,

447
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,770
I could see you

448
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,290
in the courtyard,

449
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,770
learning to weave sashes

450
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,770
and embroider pouches.

451
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,610
Once you finished one,

452
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,460
you would give it to me.

453
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,030
In my cabinet,

454
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,760
I still have many things

455
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,210
you made by hand.

456
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,210
Later,

457
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:12,460
we hired

458
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,540
a manager

459
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,500
to help run the business.

460
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,290
That way, I could

461
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,250
come home every day,

462
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,250
and have time to spend with you.

463
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,210
We had a courtyard.

464
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,290
You liked to grow crabapple flowers,

465
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,330
so many varieties

466
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,020
that they could bloom

467
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,810
from early spring to late autumn.

468
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,330
I enjoyed sitting with you in the courtyard

469
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,420
on windy days,

470
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:47,810
drinking tea,

471
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,020
watching the crabapple petals

472
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:53,170
slowly fall.

473
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,210
Or,

474
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,540
we'd go to the other end

475
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:00,650
of the courtyard and fish.

476
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,060
You had two cats

477
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,130
that loved to eat fish.

478
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,730
In winter,

479
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,980
they gave birth to a litter of kittens.

480
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,770
You'd hold them in your arms.

481
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,060
