00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,280
To impeach

15
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,840
Cui Xingzhou, Lord Huaiyang,

16
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,350
for abusing the favor
of royal family to be greedy,

17
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,590
keeping Traitor Lu's property for himself,

18
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,070
not handing illegal assets
over to the National Treasury,

19
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,120
embezzling military funds,

20
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,590
seizing estates on his own,

21
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,040
bribing officials heavily,

22
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,680
acting without shame,

23
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,950
and disrupting the court's order.

24
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,910
Lord Huaiyang

25
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,630
concealed private assets?

26
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,120
Yes.

27
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,590
Cui Xingzhou took advantage of his position

28
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,310
to keep money that should
belong to the National Treasury.

29
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,270
Traitor Lu's property

30
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,590
has been fully reported.

31
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:26,030
The Ministry of Revenue and the Ministry of War

32
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,080
both verified it.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,280
What else could be hidden?

34
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,080
This, this, this...

35
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,710
Ten days ago,

36
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,190
The Minister of Revenue inspected
the land deeds in the capital

37
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,190
and found that many deeds

38
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,310
had been tampered with and transferred.

39
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,240
Upon investigation,

40
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,080
the Ministry of Revenue's Secretary

41
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,280
Wen Tinghe confessed.

42
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,470
It was illegal property

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
of Traitor Lu,

44
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,150
which was hidden under the cover

45
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,960
of his wealth as the Prince.

46
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,750
We then followed the clues.

47
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,310
Cui Xingzhou

48
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:02,710
did contribute to the suppression
of Traitor Lu.

49
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,640
However,

50
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,190
in Dongzhou and the capital,

51
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,560
a lot of the traitor's properties

52
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,710
were misappropriated

53
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,430
to become his private wealth.

54
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:12,750
Duke.

55
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,470
Why are you framing me?

56
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,470
Cui Xingzhou.

57
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,910
Do you think

58
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,750
that with Wen Tinghe dead,

59
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,310
there would be no evidence?

60
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,430
(The Register)
The bureaus and I

61
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,190
secretly investigated Traitor Lu's
hidden assets for days

62
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,240
and tracked down accomplices.

63
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,750
You embezzled money and violated the law.

64
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,710
We found the witness and irrefutable evidence.

65
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,120
Cui Xingzhou,

66
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,750
though our families have a marriage alliance,

67
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,870
I cannot turn a blind eye

68
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,000
to your unforgivable crimes.

69
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,280
I'm innocent.

70
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,870
I truly feel unfortunate for my family

71
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,430
to be associated with the Guo family,

72
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,400
a treacherous family
that frames loyal ministers,

73
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,310
and have a marriage alliance with you.

74
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,920
The Regent condoned

75
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:22,190
his adopted daughter to poison His Majesty.

76
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,120
This crime has not yet been charged.

77
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,510
You are already forming factions
and attacking dissenters

78
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,430
and even regarding him as the leader
of the ministers.

79
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,390
Fine.

80
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,000
I would like to see

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,510
who is truly the traitor to the nation.

82
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,160
Let's wait for His Majesty to wake up.

83
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,190
He will make a clear judgment.

84
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,870
Fellow officials, did you see that?

85
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,190
Cui Xingzhou is

86
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,950
so arrogant due to his achievements

87
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,310
that now he

88
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,160
looks down on everything.

89
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,040
Now that His Majesty is critically ill,

90
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,040
how can we allow a traitor

91
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,070
who deceives the public and perverts the law

92
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,750
to act arrogantly in the court?

93
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,510
He should be apprehended now and sent

94
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,870
to the Court of Judicial Review.

95
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,240
He should be interrogated there

96
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,950
for us to find out his crimes
and uphold the national law.

97
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,240
We agree.

98
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,270
We should apprehend him

99
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,270
to uphold the national law.

100
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,110
Chief Judge Zhang,

101
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,050
I am here.

102
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,610
You're in charge of the Court
of Judicial Review.

103
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,070
You shall be fair and just.

104
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,190
Now, Lord Huaiyang

105
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,240
is handed over to you.

106
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,880
I shall

107
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,830
go to the inner palace

108
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,430
to report this petition

109
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,920
and ask Grand Empress Dowager

110
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,680
about her decree.

111
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,120
Regent, we follow your command.

112
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,440
Guards,

113
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,950
arrest Cui Xingzhou!

114
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,110
Yes.

115
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,630
Lord Huaiyang embezzled
the traitor's property in Dongzhou,

116
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,040
and is involved in several major cases.

117
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,290
He's detained in the Court of Judicial Review,

118
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,750
awaiting further orders.

119
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,720
No one from the Cui family shall

120
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,680
leave the capital without permission.

121
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,960
This special notice

122
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,120
will be executed by the responsible parties.

123
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,480
- Open the door.
- Yes.

124
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,240
Lord Huaiyang,

125
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,510
back then, you and Liu Yu

126
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,190
pretended to fight over a woman.

127
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,630
He treated you like nothing

128
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,040
and you treated him as an enemy.

129
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,950
I was almost deceived

130
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,240
by you two.

131
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,240
And now,

132
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,190
your plans have failed.

133
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,480
One has become a poisoned wreck,

134
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,390
and the other a prisoner who embezzled money.

135
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,840
You made one wrong move,

136
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,960
and lost the entire game.

137
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,510
Lord Huaiyang, don't worry.

138
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,910
I won't kill you

139
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,080
immediately.

140
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,600
I must witness how you, a man so proud,

141
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,320
watch your enemy

142
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,240
climb to the pinnacle

143
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:53,320
of the Imperial Court step by step,

144
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,480
and destroy the most important things to you

145
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:59,200
in a flip of the hand.

146
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,390
For example,

147
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,480
that delicate Princess-

148
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,440
What did you do to her?

149
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,720
I'm asking you. What have you done?

150
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,790
Calm down.

151
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,150
Liu Miantang is now

152
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,030
a criminal's wife.

153
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,910
Naturally, she's confined in the mansion,

154
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,000
awaiting further orders.

155
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,320
During these days,

156
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,670
she can live peacefully,

157
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,480
or get slapped every day.

158
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,550
You can beg me.

159
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,750
I can have Liu Miantang

160
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,790
transferred here

161
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,240
to be locked up with you.

162
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,030
How about a reunion with your wife?

163
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,200
Cui Xingzhou,

164
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,320
I'm giving you one last chance.

165
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,440
Kneel before me.

166
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,440
And I guarantee she can live.

167
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,910
The Lord commands you to kneel.

168
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,800
Stand down!

169
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,320
Kneel.

170
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,750
Kneel in front of me!

171
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,080
My Lord.

172
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,040
- My Lord.
- You, you.

173
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,350
My Lord.

174
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,480
Crazy! You are crazy!

175
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,670
Yes, I'm crazy.

176
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,870
Even if I fall into the hell,

177
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,320
I will crawl up from it!

178
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,480
For anyone who failed to kill me,

179
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,270
I will make them pay back

180
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,240
a thousandfold!

181
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:08,630
How about that?

182
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,790
Do you want to kill me now, or wait until you

183
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,150
ascend the throne to grant me a death

184
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,390
by a thousand cuts
or by tearing me apart by chariots?

185
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,040
Your Lordship,

186
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,080
you better ascend the throne quickly.

187
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,510
Otherwise, when His Majesty wakes up,

188
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,390
you

189
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,600
will be the real traitor.

190
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,360
The one kneeling and begging

191
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,790
for mercy from me in this prison

192
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,720
will be you, Liu Pei!

193
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,550
I will kill you now!

194
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,800
My Lord.

195
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,200
Fine.

196
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,240
As you wish.

197
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,120
Tonight, I will ascend the throne.

198
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,670
By then, you must listen to the death knell

199
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,150
at the city gate carefully.

200
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,320
Close the door.

201
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,900
(Abdication Edict)

202
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,750
Mother, where is your

203
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,000
Imperial Seal?

204
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,720
I have forgotten.

205
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,590
It doesn't matter.

206
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,320
I have plenty of time

207
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,480
to wait for you to remember.

208
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,630
But...

209
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,440
But Liu Yu does not have time.

210
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,630
Liu Pei, Prince Sui,

211
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,390
is of noble character,

212
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,390
and deeply resembles the Late Emperor.

213
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,360
He is surely capable of inheriting the throne.

214
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,920
Son,

215
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,670
on this Edict,

216
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,440
which line is true about you?

217
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,320
Mother, even if you don't acknowledge it,

218
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,240
Liu Yu has no heir,

219
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,320
and I am the only one,

220
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,120
who can inherit the throne.

221
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,720
As long as His Majesty is still alive,

222
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,000
I will never condone you.

223
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,080
Mother, are you really insisting on this?

224
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:40,200
The Imperial Court of Qi Kingdom is leaderless.

225
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,630
Lords of various states

226
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,000
will all act upon hearing the news,

227
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,150
like wolves and tigers eyeing the prey.

228
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,080
As long as you give me the Imperial Seal,

229
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,960
and make this Edict legitimate,

230
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,870
the chaos will cease.

231
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,670
Mother, you will only become

232
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,000
more noble than you are now.

233
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,320
Mother,

234
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,360
I really don't understand

235
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,510
why every time,

236
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,030
you always side with others.

237
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,550
We are blood relatives.

238
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,630
Why can't the throne

239
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,440
be given to me?

240
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,510
Pei.

241
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,910
- Mother.
- You.

242
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,480
Grand Empress Dowager, Prince Sui,

243
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,600
The Imperial Medical Institute

244
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,710
said that His Majesty's condition

245
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:29,550
has suddenly improved.

246
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,720
Several physicians found

247
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,910
a way to detoxify.

248
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,080
- Move aside.
- Pei.

249
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,120
Where are you going?

250
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,240
Mother, please

251
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,600
remember as soon as possible

252
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,510
where the Imperial Seal is.

253
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,390
Pei.

254
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,550
Stop! Who are you?

255
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:05,510
Officer,

256
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,510
I'm from Duke Qing's Mansion.

257
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,200
By the order of Her Ladyship,

258
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,750
I'm delivering food to Lord Huaiyang.

259
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,500
(Inspection of Prison)

260
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,100
(Permission for meal delivery.
Do not obstruct.)

261
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:22,750
Open the door.

262
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,840
Your Lordship, eat while it's hot.

263
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,040
After tonight, maybe

264
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,510
you can never eat.

265
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,040
You-

266
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:20,870
I'm here

267
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,750
by the order of Grand Empress Dowager,

268
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,750
to care for His Majesty.

269
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,910
Everyone, leave.

270
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,440
My Lord.

271
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,510
His Majesty can be saved.

272
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:31,590
The poison can be

273
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,750
neutralized in a few days.

274
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,510
Everyone, leave!

275
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:35,680
- Yes.
- Yes.

276
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,790
Prince Sui is not keeping his promise

277
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:58,720
of letting me live

278
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,670
till he takes the throne.

279
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,480
But he also said,

280
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,440
if a criminal tries to escape,

281
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,160
he'll be killed without mercy.

282
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,240
Why are you laughing?

283
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:08,310
The last time I heard

284
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,680
the words 'killed without mercy',

285
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,280
they were from you.

286
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,840
Me?

287
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,110
When did I ever say that?

288
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,400
Remnants of Mount Yang,

289
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,640
surrender now, or you'll be

290
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,830
killed without mercy.

291
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,840
Didn't you say that?

292
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,790
I never said such high-sounding words.

293
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,750
I haven't even made a move

294
00:17:58,830 --> 00:17:59,680
before you killed him.

295
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,840
Here, kill this one.

296
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,390
Dear,

297
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,680
it seems a bit hard

298
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,110
for us to get out

299
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,510
of here today.

300
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,920
Let's have a good fight

301
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,800
with them then.

302
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:34,640
Don't make a move.

303
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,240
Don't make a move.

304
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,640
General Shi.

305
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,390
My Lord. My Lady.

306
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,800
I'm late.

307
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,800
I'm late.

308
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,030
Looks like me saving you

309
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:50,960
won't be happening.

310
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,590
Then let me welcome you.

311
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,760
Thank you, General Shi.

312
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,590
Qingzhou Army, listen to orders.

313
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:02,000
Escort the Lord Huaiyang and the Princess.

314
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,190
Yes.

315
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,880
Liu Yu,

316
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,350
if you don't die,

317
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,960
how can I become the Emperor?

318
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,520
You. Liu Yu?

319
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,160
Uncle, why panic?

320
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,590
If I don't die,

321
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,550
then you

322
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:05,030
will become a traitor.

323
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,160
Something's wrong.

324
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,200
- Go check it out.
- Yes.

325
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,430
Something's wrong?

326
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,280
Someone!

327
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,790
Someone!

328
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,480
Father.

329
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,560
Father.

330
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,160
Yun'er is here.

331
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,000
Save me, save me!

332
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:34,910
Father.

333
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,680
Consort Xian graces the realm.

334
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,920
Consort Xian graces the realm.

335
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:47,880
Who is it?

336
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,160
Who is pretending to be a ghost?

337
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,390
Come out.

338
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,640
Consort Xian graces the realm.

339
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,790
Why is it you?

340
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,400
Stop pretending.

341
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,000
Consort Xian, who else

342
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,310
do you think would come?

343
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:40,880
That horn was clearly

344
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,960
from my foster father's personal guards.

345
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:45,200
He must have stormed into the palace

346
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,720
and captured Lord Huaiyang alive.

347
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,920
Consort Xian graces the realm.

348
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,000
Consort Xian graces the realm.

349
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,270
Impossible.

350
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,590
I, I clearly already-

351
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,680
Already poisoned it to death,

352
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,760
right?

353
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:13,070
The mortal ephemera perishes over and over.

354
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:16,440
Seeing the falling dragon as a heavenly sign.

355
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,480
(Great Fortune)
Seeing the falling dragon as a heavenly sign.

356
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:23,880
My husband spent

357
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,000
half a day composing this poem.

358
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,590
As you instructed,

359
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,240
Consort Xian has taken the box.

360
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,550
Thank you for the work.

361
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,000
Madam, how did you know

362
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,310
that Consort Xian would come?

363
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,070
She lost her power in the palace.

364
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,790
She will definitely urgently
report to Prince Sui.

365
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,400
I learned she was leaving the palace today,

366
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,270
so I immediately arranged for you

367
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,720
to deliver goods to his mansion.

368
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:48,920
Now, she

369
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,480
has no way out,

370
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,750
and no one to turn to.

371
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:54,200
She has no choice but to believe it.

372
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:57,110
You need to tell them

373
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,720
that I am the one

374
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,680
who embezzled a huge fortune.

375
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,070
Cui Xingzhou, Lord Huaiyang,

376
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,510
took advantage of his position

377
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:09,480
to keep the wealth that should be
in the National Treasury.

378
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,720
You just need to remember

379
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,920
to tell all of this

380
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,640
to Prince Sui,

381
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,240
and ask him to help you.

382
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,880
Make him believe

383
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:21,030
that the Duke is desperate to save his son,

384
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,510
and has enough reason

385
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:25,240
to frame me and put me in prison.

386
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,960
I know that I am not on your team,

387
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,000
but this time,

388
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:31,000
I really have no other way.

389
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,110
My Lord,

390
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:35,920
please save my son.

391
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,550
I promise you.

392
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,680
After you achieve such great merit,

393
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:42,110
you can save Guo Yi's life.

394
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:43,720
As long as you still

395
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:44,830
adheres to righteousness,

396
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,000
you will definitely not

397
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,880
aid the wicked.

398
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,790
Cui Xingzhou!

399
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,160
This expression looks really good.

400
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,590
In the future, when I think of you,

401
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:06,270
I will always see this look
of a failed traitor,

402
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,030
who was so helpless.

403
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,560
Impossible.

404
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,350
You,

405
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,550
you also touched this poison powder.

406
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,310
Why didn't your hand

407
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,680
change color at the feast?

408
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:17,920
Don't you understand?

409
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,550
The poison was fake,

410
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,030
and the change of color was also fake.

411
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,720
I had Physician Song prepare

412
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,310
a powder that changes color

413
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,960
upon contact with water.

414
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,720
The Lord and I watched

415
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,830
your every move clearly.

416
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,680
What you saw

417
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,510
was what we wanted you to see.

418
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:40,430
Liu Pei,

419
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,150
you lost.

420
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:43,910
Minister Cui,

421
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,240
what do you plan to do with him?

422
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,440
My wife is not here tonight,

423
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,550
but she specifically

424
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,830
instructed me to repay

425
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,110
Prince Sui

426
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:58,720
for his previous 'kindness'.

427
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,790
End your own life.

428
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,270
You brat,

429
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,960
I've endured humiliation for so many years.

430
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,200
When have I ever lost?

431
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:44,200
Right now, my personal guards
have occupied here.

432
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:49,910
Guards!

433
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:03,110
Guards!

434
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:12,590
My guards,

435
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,550
my guards are right outside.

436
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:20,350
Guards!

437
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,000
Guards!

438
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,680
Guards!

439
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,680
My foster father will not lose.

440
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,790
My foster father will not lose!

441
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,240
Guards!

442
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,760
Guards!

443
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,040
The throne

444
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,030
should be mine.

445
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:02,960
All of this should be mine!

446
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,480
This kingdom

447
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:10,480
should be mine!

448
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,680
It belongs to me, Liu Pei!

449
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,240
Twenty years ago,

450
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:25,200
among the princes of the previous dynasty,

451
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,390
only I

452
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,400
was the most outstanding one.

453
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,310
Empress Wu usurped the throne.

454
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,030
Among the royal family,

455
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,720
the only one who survived,

456
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,480
the legitimate heir,

457
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,830
was me, Liu Pei!

458
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:47,720
I was the one

459
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:52,110
who wiped out the Wu faction

460
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:57,070
after a long time of planning.

461
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,440
I was the one

462
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,240
who supported you from Mount Yang

463
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:03,640
step by step,

464
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:05,750
to sit on this throne!

465
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,270
I thought you were a puppet

466
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:15,160
that I could manipulate.

467
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,790
So, being ensnared by one's own trap
feels like this.

468
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,350
Power should be used for the people.

469
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,920
No one can seek personal gain.

470
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,110
Only then can we restore our kingdom

471
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:41,200
to a righteous nation!

472
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,240
Liu Pei!

473
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,480
This imperial court

474
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:48,000
cannot tolerate you.

475
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,640
Tonight,

476
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:07,830
tonight you must die!

477
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,750
The court officials won't know

478
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:17,070
whether you were poisoned
or stabbed to death.

479
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,830
You are finished.

480
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,240
This kingdom

481
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,720
belongs to me, Liu Pei!

482
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:36,640
Even if I die today,

483
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,030
this kingdom

484
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,750
will never be yours.

485
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:56,680
Liu Pei!

486
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,790
Greetings to you, Grand Empress Dowager.

487
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,320
Mother.

488
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,880
Mother, Mother.

489
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,310
Mother.

490
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,750
I, I, I-

491
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,070
Grand Empress Dowager.

492
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,110
We all heard

493
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,000
and saw

494
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,030
what Prince Sui did.

495
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,830
We do not acknowledge

496
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:58,640
such a ruler.

497
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,790
We do not acknowledge him.

498
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,240
Liu Pei.

499
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,030
You have lost.

500
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,320
It's over.

501
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,760
It's all over.

502
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,760
All of Prince Sui's faction
has been brought to justice.

503
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,710
Your Majesty, you can finally rule the kingdom

504
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,710
and realize your grand ambitions.

505
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,480
With the imperial power in hand,

506
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:41,760
and the court purged,

507
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,190
I finally have

508
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,440
what I longed for day and night.

509
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,800
But I often feel that the days are not real.

510
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,280
Maybe it's because, all these years,

511
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,230
I was often restless,

512
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,510
and always on edge,

513
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,030
and I'm not used to the peace.

514
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,150
I feel the same way.

515
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:09,510
You have always been at a high position.

516
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:11,440
How come just gaining some military power

517
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:12,440
makes you feel uneasy?

518
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,550
I was born and raised in Zhenzhou.

519
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,070
I am used to the climate of Jiangnan.

520
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:20,360
Now living in the capital

521
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,110
makes me somewhat uncomfortable.

522
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,070
Miantang feels the same way.

523
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:28,280
She often says

524
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,320
she wants to return to Zhenzhou

525
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:31,710
to live in Lingquan Town.

526
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,070
Did she really say that?

527
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:35,510
Yes.

528
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,320
She also told me

529
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,070
that the nobles in the capital

530
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,000
all have multiple wives and concubines.

531
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,190
It bothers her.

532
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:46,280
She fears I might follow suit.

533
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:48,150
It's better to return to Zhenzhou.

534
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:49,440
It sounds like things

535
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,510
she would say.

536
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:52,670
I also promised her

537
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:54,590
that once these

538
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,030
mundane affairs are settled,

539
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,110
I would accompany her to travel

540
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,420
and return to our hometown.

541
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,800
Now,

542
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:06,190
it's time for me to fulfill that promise.

543
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:41,440
I should have made

544
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,510
this toast to you long ago.

545
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,070
Your Majesty,

546
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,680
take care.

547
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,640
Take care.

548
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:17,550
What's so different
about these piles of soil?

549
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,920
Aren't they from the same mountain?

550
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,070
There's not much distance.

551
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:29,190
You can taste the difference?

552
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,240
Of course.

553
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,440
Why don't you try it?

554
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,070
I saw it.

555
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,190
You put the middle finger in it

556
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:53,550
and licked your index finger.

557
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,880
Why didn't you expose me

558
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:57,960
since you knew?

559
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,400
Because I like seeing your smile.

560
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,550
Before we get married,

561
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,030
how many more mountains

562
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,880
do we need to search to find the soil?

563
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,030
This is the last one.

564
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,640
Really?

565
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,320
So, I'm getting married?

566
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,590
I'm getting married!

567
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:25,840
I'm getting married!

568
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,440
I'm getting married!

569
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,320
Songhua,

570
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,590
tell Grand Empress Dowager.

571
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:34,430
No need to wait.

572
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,360
