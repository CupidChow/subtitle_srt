14
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,310
I've been keeping a close watch.

15
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:46,950
Everything about Wen Tinghe is fine.

16
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:48,200
There's nothing suspicious.

17
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,430
He has made no personal contact.

18
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,150
Have we alerted the snake?

19
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,190
Your Majesty.

20
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:56,350
Lord Sui seeks your audience.

21
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,070
Granted.

22
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:09,140
(Virtuous and Disciplined)

23
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,840
Greetings, Your Majesty.

24
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,270
Hi, Uncle.

25
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,680
What is it?

26
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,150
Naturally,

27
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,840
it's about the disaster relief in Xuanzhou.

28
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,470
All the relief supplies have been distributed.

29
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,630
I've also mobilized the Ministry of Personnel

30
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,430
to reward the rich squires

31
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,750
who donated the supplies,

32
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:29,560
giving them official positions.

33
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,080
I believe that soon

34
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,240
the people who suffer from the cold weather

35
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,400
will be able to celebrate the New Year
with peace of mind.

36
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,560
With your supervision,

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,470
I'm sure the relief efforts
will be effective.

38
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,310
I'm very relieved.

39
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,240
It's all part of my job.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,840
And...

41
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,120
What else is troubling you, Uncle?

42
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:52,870
Let's hear it.

43
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,750
It's nothing to do with governance.

44
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,270
It's...

45
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,360
I just want to ask

46
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,310
how many gifts Your Majesty

47
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,590
gave to Lord Huaiyang?

48
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,080
Gifts?

49
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,150
He and his wife are coming
to the capital in a few days.

50
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,030
I need to send a gift.

51
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,520
So I need a reference.

52
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,360
What are you talking about?

53
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,560
I don't understand.

54
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,120
Lord Huaiyang got married in Zhenzhou.

55
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,560
Doesn't Your Majesty need to send a gift?

56
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,750
Lord Huaiyang

57
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,030
got married?

58
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:35,990
He...

59
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,750
Don't you know?

60
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:41,990
Well...

61
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,960
I'm not surprised.

62
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,310
I heard

63
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,080
he had a quick wedding

64
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,840
before the journey to the capital.

65
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,150
I guess it will only be a few days

66
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,360
between the envoy

67
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,800
and Lord Huaiyang's arrival in the capital.

68
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,960
Normally,

69
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,710
a lord's wedding should be organized
by the Ministry of Rituals.

70
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:02,990
Lord Huaiyang

71
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,030
broke our ancestors' rules.

72
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,280
It's...

73
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,590
It seems after the tragedy,

74
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,030
he holds his wife dearly.

75
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,180
(Qi'an)

76
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,560
Summon

77
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:05,120
Lord Huaiyang.

78
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,480
Greetings, Your Majesty.

79
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,320
Rise,

80
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,390
Lord Cui.

81
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,830
Thank you, Your Majesty.

82
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,240
How was your trip?

83
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,920
It was great.

84
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,960
Great?

85
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,190
Why did you come so late to your duty?

86
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,430
The position of Deputy Minister of War
has been vacant.

87
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,430
The officials slack on their duty.

88
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,360
Should I remove them from their duty

89
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,800
or punish you?

90
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:08,750
Your Majesty,

91
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,830
I heard Lord Huaiyang had a grand wedding.

92
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,630
But it hasn't been recorded
by the Ministry of Rituals.

93
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,880
The priority

94
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,510
of the Ministry of War should be
following orders.

95
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,070
But Lord Huaiyang

96
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,070
deliberately goes against the ancestral order.

97
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,070
So he cannot fill this position.

98
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,480
I think

99
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:28,750
Secretary Cao is the best candidate.

100
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,390
Your Majesty,

101
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,270
Secretary Cao is inexperienced.

102
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,390
And he has never been to the battlefield.

103
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,950
Compared with Lord Huaiyang,

104
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,030
he's not the best choice.

105
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,110
Lord Cui,

106
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,040
what do you say?

107
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,590
I

108
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:45,870
have nothing to say.

109
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,120
I took an oath

110
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,870
to stay single until the state has peace.

111
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,390
That was why I didn't get married.

112
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,920
I did my job as your loyal servant,

113
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,600
but I failed my mother as a son.

114
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,120
During the unrest in Dongzhou,

115
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,040
defeated troops infiltrated Zhenzhou

116
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,270
and abducted my mother and my fiancee.

117
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,670
I

118
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:12,510
almost lost both my parents and my home

119
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,600
during their suppression.

120
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,760
Your Majesty,

121
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,720
misfortune is unpredictable.

122
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:23,830
Lord Huaiyang

123
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:26,000
was alone at war.

124
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,680
He did disobey the rules,

125
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,360
but if it was to fulfill his parents' wish,

126
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,070
it would be understandable

127
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:34,000
to get married earlier.

128
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,920
After the unrest was put down,

129
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,630
His Majesty intended to let you
lead the Ministry of War.

130
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,360
That means he has let go of the past.

131
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,480
But sometimes, I get the feeling

132
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:57,720
that you have a bigger grudge
with His Majesty.

133
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,120
You're a wise man.

134
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,560
I'll ask no more.

135
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,720
Come to my mansion in a while.

136
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,190
Mrs. Meng hasn't met you for a long time.

137
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,720
I'm sure she has a lot of questions to ask.

138
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,270
Nanny Li.

139
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,560
Moru.

140
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,040
My lord,

141
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,030
I knew you'd come here.

142
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,200
So I've been waiting for some time.

143
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:42,870
My lord,

144
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,510
soon after you left the mansion,

145
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,720
the princess was invited to the palace

146
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:49,080
for the Empress' tea party

147
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,360
for noble wives.

148
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,870
No maids were allowed.

149
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,280
How long has she been gone?

150
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,510
Not long,

151
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,390
about two hours.

152
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,030
Is this the Princess of Huaiyang?

153
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,550
This is Lord Sui.

154
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,960
Greetings, my lord.

155
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,080
Without His Majesty's gifts,

156
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:29,120
you can't be addressed
the Princess of Huaiyang.

157
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,600
You're like a fairy, Princess Huaisang.

158
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,510
No wonder Lord Huaiyang

159
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,200
is so obsessed with you

160
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,480
and loses sleep over you.

161
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,840
I'm here today to pay my respects

162
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,120
and send some gifts to the Yongshou Palace.

163
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,510
If I knew you were in the palace,

164
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,510
I would have given you some.

165
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:57,200
The finest lambs in Xizhou,

166
00:09:58,390 --> 00:09:59,320
freshly killed

167
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,390
and brought in before the blood was cold.

168
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,200
It must taste

169
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,750
so delicious.

170
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,630
It's too good for me.

171
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,990
My lord.

172
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,590
Excuse me.

173
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,480
Forgive me, Your Highness.

174
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,240
I'm late.

175
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,360
Concubine Xian,

176
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,200
why do you look like you've seen a ghost?

177
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,630
Princess Huaisang,

178
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,840
do you know Consort Xian?

179
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,270
Your Highness,

180
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,270
Miantang and Consort Xian

181
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,550
go way back.

182
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,550
We're like sisters.

183
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,030
It's been a long time.

184
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:07,790
Now

185
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,080
we can meet again at this party
in the palace.

186
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,670
I'm sure

187
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,150
you must be as overjoyed

188
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,670
as I am.

189
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,440
Yes.

190
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,630
I haven't seen you for a long time,
Sister Liu.

191
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,240
How can I let you address me

192
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,630
sister?

193
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,360
You have lost weight.

194
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,270
I don't know

195
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,390
if you're still as skillful

196
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,550
with your hands as before

197
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:33,200
and good at needlework.

198
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,840
I didn't notice.

199
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,040
Who's that?

200
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,080
I think she's a princess from the North,

201
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,550
a guest of the Empress.

202
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,630
She looks familiar.

203
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:00,360
Consort Xian is like a sister to her.

204
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,670
Why didn't you introduce us earlier?

205
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,630
Gladly my sister-in-law invited her.

206
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,600
I see, the Empress invited you.

207
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,790
It's so different now.

208
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,360
Now that everyone is here,

209
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,790
let the party begin.

210
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,480
At previous parties,

211
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,120
tea was always served.

212
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:49,790
At least, it was Mengding tea.

213
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,790
Nowadays,

214
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,510
His Majesty advocates frugality.

215
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,550
So Your Highness is using fruit tea.

216
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,240
You're really supportive

217
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,440
of His Majesty's decision.

218
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:02,200
Her Highness comes from a family
of military generals.

219
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:05,360
She understands people's life.

220
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,030
I guess she chose this drink

221
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,750
for us

222
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,080
to share the fun with the people.

223
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,870
Your Highness is so thoughtful.

224
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,630
Do you know what it's made of,
Princess Huaisang?

225
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,240
This is no ordinary drink.

226
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,000
It has a rose-scented base.

227
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,160
One sip,

228
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,550
and you'll have

229
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,790
a bursting flavor of lychee in your mouth.

230
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,080
It's sour and sweet.

231
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,080
Really refreshing.

232
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,600
It's made of chilled lychee pulp.

233
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,360
With these mushy fruits,

234
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,550
it's even better.

235
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,270
Much better than the ones that look good

236
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,670
but don't taste good.

237
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,000
Princess Wuyang, you've eaten many delicacies.

238
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,960
If you say so, it has to be good.

239
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,550
Forgive me, Princess Huaisang. Forgive me.

240
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,870
Only a corner of my dress is wet.

241
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,870
Get up.

242
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,150
Isn't this Fu Yushen's

243
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,390
apprentice?

244
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,120
Why is he here?

245
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,000
Please come with me.

246
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,440
I'll get you some clean clothes

247
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,510
to change into.

248
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,600
It's alright. They'll be dry in a moment.

249
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,480
- But...
- Princess Huaisang,

250
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,280
go with Songhua

251
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,840
to change your clothes.

252
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,790
It won't look right in wet clothes.

253
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:37,990
Yes.

254
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:02,750
Your Majesty.

255
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:08,630
Miantang.

256
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,150
Your Majesty has invited me to the palace.

257
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,790
Why do you have to do this

258
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,870
to meet me?

259
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,630
I was afraid you wouldn't come.

260
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,150
So I have to resort to this.

261
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,200
This is quite a difficult thing

262
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,080
for the Empress to do.

263
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,630
The Empress.

264
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,270
I have to leave.

265
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,320
Is he nice to you?

266
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,120
Did you choose him

267
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,960
out of love?

268
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,600
If it was against your will,

269
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,480
the betrothal, the wedding,

270
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,910
and everything else can be annulled.

271
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,200
I can do it for you.

272
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,150
The Ziyu I knew

273
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,150
would be happy for me.

274
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,870
My lord,

275
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,510
it's getting dark.

276
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,120
The princess hasn't come back.

277
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:28,120
If she stays the night in palace,

278
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,840
won't it...

279
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,910
I pray for her.

280
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,320
She's here.

281
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,840
- Where is the princess?
- Miss...

282
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,790
Miss Fu is here.

283
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,440
Jiu.

284
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,560
Sister.

285
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:46,750
Why won't you go?

286
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,630
My mother-in-law has held a banquet for you.

287
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,550
And where is your princess?

288
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,280
Sister,

289
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,870
send my apology

290
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,080
to Her Ladyship. And,

291
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:58,960
on another day,

292
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,630
my princess and I

293
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,440
will pay a visit.

294
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:04,870
Jiu,

295
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,640
did you run into trouble?

296
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:08,390
No.

297
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:13,030
Then I'll go back and explain it.

298
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,070
I have a great gossip.

299
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,000
Do you want to hear it?

300
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,240
Today in the palace,

301
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,000
I met a princess from the North.

302
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,830
I found her familiar.

303
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,400
She looks

304
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,880
quite like the barbarian girl

305
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,830
who helped you try the jade belt on.

306
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:31,950
Well,

307
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,720
it's quite invigorating, huh?

308
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,070
How is she?

309
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,480
Be patient.

310
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,510
The princess is named Liu.

311
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,640
She's Consort Xian's best friend.

312
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,240
She's very beautiful.

313
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,160
It's a pity she's less noble.

314
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:52,960
It seems the princess is fine.

315
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,590
Now the thrilling part is,

316
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,200
a young eunuch

317
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,550
stained the princess' clothes.

318
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,800
The Empress

319
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,550
told her to change in a chamber.

320
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,640
My best friend told me

321
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,110
she saw

322
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,440
that princess

323
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,350
meeting His Majesty in the backyard.

324
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,350
We hadn't seen her

325
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,310
till the party was over.

326
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,840
Muru, get the carriage.

327
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,800
Yes.

328
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,000
Hey.

329
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,460
Where are you going?

330
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:26,380
(Jian'an Gate)

331
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,670
My lord,

332
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,960
the word from Chonghua Palace says

333
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,640
that Princess Huaisang has left the palace.

334
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:47,880
My lord, why don't you

335
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,310
look around outside the palace?

336
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,110
Your Majesty.

337
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:21,950
Rise.

338
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,480
You can decide on the gifts

339
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,950
for the Grand Empress Dowager's birthday.

340
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,000
Why did I have to come all the way here?

341
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,680
It's because I'm indecisive.

342
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,790
I don't want to let Your Majesty down.

343
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,160
So I'd like to ask you to join me.

344
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,750
Gold and silver objects and Shoushan stones

345
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,270
are a bit boring.

346
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,880
I've heard

347
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,880
that rare birds are popular in the Harem.

348
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,070
It so happens that the other day,

349
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,680
two yellow-rumped willow warblers
flew into the palace.

350
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:54,750
Their singing is so melodious.

351
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,550
I managed to catch one of them.

352
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,110
The yellow-rumped willow warbler
is really nice.

353
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,510
Your decision.

354
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,150
Your Majesty.

355
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,920
Have you noticed

356
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,960
that the willow warbler has stopped singing?

357
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,680
I've been thinking.

358
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,750
The yellow warbler used to sing in pairs.

359
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,350
I'm afraid

360
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,030
once put in a cage,

361
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,640
she's frightened

362
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,830
and won't sing anymore.

363
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,350
What about the other one?

364
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,280
Dead.

365
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,640
The male was very aggressive.

366
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,640
The female struggles and cries every day.

367
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,720
That's why I can't decide.

368
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,920
I'd like to hear Your Majesty's opinion.

369
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,920
I am the emperor of the world.

370
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,440
Why can't I keep

371
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,790
even a single warbler?

372
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,400
I feel the same way.

373
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,960
So I've used the most expensive materials

374
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,750
and hired the best craftsmen

375
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,310
to create a unique birdcage for it.

376
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:07,910
And I gave it plenty of food.

377
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,200
Even the flowers

378
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,750
it was familiar with before

379
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,510
have all been brought to it.

380
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,280
Sadly,

381
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:20,480
this female bird is loyal.

382
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,960
She'd rather go on a hunger strike
for three days

383
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,000
than give in for a moment.

384
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,790
I'm afraid...

385
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,510
I'm afraid she'll die like the male.

386
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,680
A loyal bird?

387
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:50,960
Your Majesty,

388
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,440
if we want to be friends with birds,

389
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,200
we shall let a phoenix choose
its sycamore tree

390
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,270
and a roc fly to the sky.

391
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,790
Birds have their own destinies.

392
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,640
If we're truly their friends,

393
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,440
why not set them free?

394
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:31,880
Is he nice to you?

395
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,000
The Ziyu I knew

396
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,000
would be happy for me.

397
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,510
I'm sure

398
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,960
Your Majesty will never have regrets

399
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,830
about your choices.

400
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,000
This birthday gift

401
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,150
is not appropriate.

402
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,160
Release the warbler.

403
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,160
Your Majesty is wise.

404
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,760
My lord,

405
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,830
please follow me.

406
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,590
When we get to the capital,

407
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,160
I'm afraid His Majesty will
find all sorts of reasons

408
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,040
to summon me to the palace.

409
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,240
I'm aware of that.

410
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,590
I've already made preparations.

411
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:47,110
I don't want you to do anything.

412
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,480
A conflict between you

413
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,000
and His Majesty,

414
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,160
or even an armed remonstrance

415
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,790
is what Lord Sui wants to see.

416
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,310
I want you to trust me

417
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,270
and trust Ziyu.

418
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:20,110
I'm Fu Yushen. Nice to meet you, my lord,

419
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,960
Princess.

420
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,400
Please take a look.

421
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,720
These glazed lamps

422
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,640
are made by a famous craftsman
in the Western Mountains.

423
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,800
It's often said,

424
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,960
"Good things in this world are not strong;

425
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,960
Colored clouds are easily dispersed
and glass is brittle."

426
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,510
But when these glazed lamps were fired,

427
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,000
a unique kind of jade resin was added.

428
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,510
That's why the glazed lamps

429
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,310
are stronger than all the glazes

430
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,440
in the world.

431
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,560
His Majesty

432
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,480
wishes Lord Huaiyang and Princess

433
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,720
a harmonious life

434
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:55,030
and a bond stronger than gold.

435
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,000
His Majesty didn't summon me

436
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,480
to the palace

437
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,720
only for his gifts, right?

438
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,310
You're right, my lord.

439
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,790
His Majesty has been waiting for you.

440
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,550
Please come with me.

441
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,800
Your Majesty.

442
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,840
Thank you

443
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,270
for putting on such a bitter show with me.

444
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,920
Your Majesty did this to make Lord Sui think

445
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,000
that you and I are at odds.

446
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,280
Yes.

447
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,680
What do you think of me,

448
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:49,750
Your Majesty?

449
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,400
In terms of love,

450
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,480
I'm jealous of you.

451
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:56,440
In terms of character,

452
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,240
I respect you.

453
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,960
You don't work for me

454
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,480
out of submission to the Emperor.

455
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,510
It's because you don't want any wars.

456
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,200
Your loyalty to the people

457
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:09,030
makes you an enemy of Lord Sui.

458
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,110
As an important official,

459
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:13,680
you can't stay far from politics.

460
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,760
That

461
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,790
is what you should do,

462
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:18,830
Lord Huaiyang.

463
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,270
Charge against blades and arrows

464
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,880
without fear

465
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:25,790
and do whatever you have to do.

466
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,640
In the past when we played chess,

467
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,160
we each had our intentions.

468
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,160
The cycle of the four horrors

469
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,960
was the last thing we wanted.

470
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,790
Now it seems

471
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,750
a draw

472
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,310
is not meaningless.

473
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,510
My guards

474
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,160
have been watching Lord Sui for some time.

475
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:11,270
Every visitor has been investigated.

476
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,440
But I found nothing.

477
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,880
Perhaps

478
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,880
this chief instructor is not a member
of Lord Sui's household.

479
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,200
What about Wen Tinghe?

480
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,720
Following Wen Tinghe's lead,

481
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,350
I found a gambling house in the capital.

482
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,680
It's where they meet.

483
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,440
I sent guards to ambush them.

484
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,960
But the strange thing is,

485
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,550
as soon as my men arrived,

486
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,790
they disappeared.

487
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,750
One day later,

488
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,680
Wen Tinghe died at his home.

489
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,830
It's not a bad thing.

490
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,520
What do you mean?

491
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:47,030
They're aware of Your Majesty's plans

492
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,590
and are able to respond

493
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,640
in such a short period of time.

494
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,960
That means the chief instructor

495
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,880
is not an outsider.

496
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,240
I was worried

497
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,110
he was far away from the capital.

498
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:02,640
It would be difficult to find him.

499
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,200
But if he's still in the capital,

500
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,480
I'm sure he'll give himself away.

501
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:08,750
But everything related to him is classified.

502
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:11,550
Even the guards don't know who he is.

503
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,720
From the very beginning,

504
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:15,920
I

505
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,960
have only mentioned it to Mr. Meng
and Duke Qing.

506
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,350
Lord Cui.

507
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,350
Mr. Meng is your teacher.

508
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,310
Duke Qing is your in-law.

509
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,510
I really don't want to doubt them.

510
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,880
This investigation

511
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:37,830
into this matter requires a low profile.

512
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,310
Tomorrow, we will

513
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,440
move into Duke Qing's Mansion.

514
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:43,930
It'll be easier for the investigation.

515
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:51,200
It's not easy for you to do things
in the capital.

516
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:52,790
If you need men,

517
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,240
take this badge.

518
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,880
And you can command

519
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,200
anyone on this list.

520
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,790
I haven't congratulated you
on your wedding yet.

521
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,000
Mr. Cui.

522
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:41,270
Mrs. Cui.

523
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,150
Good night.

524
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,160
Has Liu Yu

525
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,270
really fallen out with Lord Huaiyang?

526
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,440
Or is he unwilling to be controlled

527
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,310
so he's using Cui Xingzhou
as a check on me?

528
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,960
Lately, I've been

529
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,720
observing His Majesty carefully.

530
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:25,070
He wouldn't dare disobey you.

531
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,350
Father,

532
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,270
please don't corner him.

533
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,640
Don't corner him?

534
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,960
Did he give me the chance to?

535
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,310
If I fall,

536
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,830
will you be safe?

537
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,080
Go.

538
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,000
Greet your godmother

539
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,480
first.

540
00:31:58,590 --> 00:31:59,430
Yes.

541
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,240
You stingy man.

542
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,880
You're always hiding something.

543
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,510
Do I have to force you

544
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,510
to show me something good?

545
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:18,960
Princess, you flatter me.

546
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:21,440
You're a noble lady.

547
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,200
Even the jewels

548
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,160
a heavenly fairy wears

549
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,880
are too humble

550
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,270
to be presented to you.

551
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,550
Good day, Godmother.

552
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,030
You come right on time.

553
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,190
It's alright.

554
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,480
He's one of the household.

555
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,720
His Lordship and Princess treat me well.

556
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,030
I'm deeply honored.

557
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,960
I'm just an errand man.

558
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,960
I'm so humbled.

559
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:58,440
Head accessories from his Yuruyi

560
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,310
are as good as anything in the palace.

561
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,400
Since I came to the capital,

562
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,270
I've never bought anything from other stores.

563
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,830
Why don't you take a look?

564
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,640
If there's anything that catches your eye,

565
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,200
tell him to wrap them up.

566
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:18,390
Yes.

567
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,750
Greetings, Duke Qing.

568
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,110
Your Ladyship.

569
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,240
I'm Liu. Greetings, Duke Qing.

570
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,280
Your Ladyship.

571
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,030
We're all family.

572
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,270
There's no need to be formal.

573
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,110
Please sit down.

574
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:31,750
Yes, sit down.

575
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:38,310
We've just gotten married.

576
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,000
My wife has prepared some gifts

577
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,070
for you to enjoy.

578
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,190
Alright.

579
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,040
Please have some tea.

580
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,270
I have to congratulate you, Lord Huaiyang,

581
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,190
Princess.

582
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,050
Yes.

583
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,510
Such a beautiful princess.

584
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,640
I can't take my eyes off her.

585
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,110
Your Ladyship is so kind.

586
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,110
My visit to your graceful residence

587
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,680
is an eye-opening experience.

588
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,680
A century-old family is really something.

589
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,920
We get this for our ancestors' feat.

590
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,510
Unlike Lord Huaiyang,

591
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,760
who is His Majesty's henchman.

592
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,030
His Majesty favors His Lordship

593
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,590
because the Duke

594
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,670
is a man of great virtue.

595
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,710
We're related by marriage.

596
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,480
So we share the honor

597
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:22,590
and losses.

598
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:23,990
That's

599
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,360
what His Lordship

600
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,070
has been preaching to me day after day.

601
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,110
Well...

602
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,110
- Father.
- Father.

603
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,120
- Mother.
- Mother.

604
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,320
Sister, brother-in-law.

605
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:44,510
Fu,

606
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,470
what's wrong?

607
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,960
I spent too much time on my makeup.

608
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,320
Please forgive me, Mother.

609
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,710
It's alright.

610
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,240
Xingzhou,

611
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,000
have you found an ideal residence?

612
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,240
Not yet.

613
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,550
My mansion

614
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,880
is not a big one.

615
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,440
But we do have vacant courtyards.

616
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:10,070
If you don't mind,

617
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,810
you can stay here as long as you like.

618
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:14,300
Thank you, Duke.

619
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,190
This house

620
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:18,110
is the residence of the former
Minister of Public Works.

621
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,920
The pavilions, flowers, and trees

622
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,480
were all his design.

623
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,760
It looks simple.

624
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,840
In fact, there's a hidden mystery.

625
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,880
There's water on the left

626
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,920
and a wide road outside.

627
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:30,800
Sufficient water suggests luck.

628
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,960
The ground of the main house is
low in the front and high in the back.

629
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,540
The eaves are low on the left
and high on the right.

630
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,150
It means prosperity.

631
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,440
Are you a scholar, brother-in-law?

632
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,440
You know so much about houses.

633
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,000
Princess, you're too kind.

634
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,550
I'm not yet a scholar.

635
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:45,290
I don't dare to compare myself
with His Lordship.

636
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:47,480
Our brother-in-law is a better man
than I am.

637
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,440
He'll have a great future.

638
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:51,320
I'll take your word for it, Your Lordship.

639
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,230
My father asked me

640
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,710
to let you two rest.

641
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:58,110
I'll leave you now.

642
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,670
Your brother-in-law

643
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,710
is so considerate.

644
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,550
I'm sure it's out of his care
for your sister.

645
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,510
Jiu.

646
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:11,430
Sister.

647
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,480
Mother asked me

648
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:14,670
to send some servants over.

649
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,590
Greetings, my lord, princess.

650
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,510
Thank you, Sister.

651
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,360
Jiu, walk me back.

652
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:26,590
I have something to tell you.

653
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,240
Sure.

654
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,600
Liu

655
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,320
is the princess from the North

656
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,920
I told you about.

657
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,630
She and His Majesty

658
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:45,920
- is having an affair.
- Sister.

659
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,510
There is nothing between them.

660
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,680
And now,

661
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,510
she's my wife.

662
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,800
You know that?

663
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,230
That's history.

664
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,550
When we have time,

665
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:02,480
I'll explain it to you.

666
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,150
Now, sister,

667
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,920
don't give her a hard time.

668
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:09,230
Why would I give her a hard time?

669
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,150
I'm just worried about you.

670
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,960
I fear that

671
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:15,000
she calls you her husband

672
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,880
for another purpose.

673
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:17,950
She needs you to...

674
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,030
It's alright, sister.

675
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,150
These things

676
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,400
are my responsibility.

677
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,670
I didn't reassure you.

678
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,320
How are you doing

679
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,920
nowadays?

680
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,110
Why are you staring at me?

681
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,550
I'm looking well.

682
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,150
Naturally, I'm doing well.

683
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,710
Maybe you look good

684
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,320
because you're wearing too much makeup.

685
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,150
Hey.

686
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,230
You're always straightforward.

687
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:57,840
Come on, have some tea.

688
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,300
(Tolerance)

689
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,140
(Quiet)

690
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,110
Did I write these two characters?

691
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,920
They're your writings.

692
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,230
Your brother-in-law framed them.

693
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,680
He said

694
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,760
that to be calm and tolerant

695
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,510
is the quality

696
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:22,400
of a man with ambitions.

697
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,960
It's worth learning.

698
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,320
I wrote them for fun.

699
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,920
They're not worth the framing.

700
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,670
Who said that?

701
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,960
Nowadays, you're

702
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,480
very popular in the capital.

703
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,760
Your calligraphy

704
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,480
is highly sought-after.

705
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,440
Tomorrow, some noble ladies
will come to visit.

706
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,630
I'm planning

707
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,400
to show them the writings

708
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:43,030
while we're having tea

709
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,840
and conversation.

710
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,000
It's getting late.

711
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,440
Sister, get some rest.

712
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,360
I'll leave you now.

713
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,120
Wait.

714
00:38:55,700 --> 00:39:00,740
(Map of the Capital)

715
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,240
What's this?

716
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,600
I received it today.

717
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:10,740
(We surveyed the staff of the Duke's Mansion
in the capital. Zhongyi.)

718
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,710
It's convenient for them as citizens.

719
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:16,280
(Respect and Simplicity)
So I ordered them to keep watch

720
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:17,550
and find out...

721
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,630
Find out Her Ladyship and Sister's

722
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:20,590
preferences.

723
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,110
I'll buy something they like

724
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,400
to please them.

725
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,550
Why is my life so miserable?

726
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,440
I finally got rid of that mother-in-law.

727
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:33,150
And now there's a sister-in-law.

728
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:36,920
Can you keep your voice down?

729
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:37,920
(Duke Qing)
We have company.

730
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,230
(Map of the Capital)
Words will get out.

731
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,150
Cui Xingzhou.

732
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:43,110
What did you say before you married me?

733
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,630
You said you'd be good to me.

734
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,800
But what happened?

735
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:47,840
Your sister gave me a hard time.

736
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,230
But you didn't say a word.

737
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,150
What did my sister do?

738
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,880
(Minister Meng)
She didn't dislike your background.

739
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,670
She didn't ask you to serve her.

740
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:55,840
Why are you making such a fuss?

741
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,630
Don't think I don't know.

742
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:00,190
My affair with His Majesty stings her.

743
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,070
Maybe she'd say

744
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:04,190
I'm a seductress.

745
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,480
My sister is a straightforward woman.

746
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,360
(Traveling Routes)
If you two have any misunderstandings,

747
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,400
why don't you two talk it over?

748
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,630
She's a straightforward woman.

749
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,920
So you're saying

750
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,150
I'm cheap?

751
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:17,380
(Where do I start?)

752
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:20,030
I was talking about my sister,

753
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,330
not you.

754
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:22,960
Why are you mixing it up?

755
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:29,420
(I'm hungry.)

756
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:32,430
I've told you before

757
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,800
I'm a man

758
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:36,800
of my word.

759
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,920
Don't mess around with me.

760
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:43,340
(I'm hungry.)

761
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:48,100
(Hungry)

762
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:48,950
Alright,

763
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,630
your words are good advice.

764
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,190
My words are trash.

765
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:57,280
Where does this come from?

766
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,590
You're a lord.

767
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,360
You're so full of words.

768
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,400
Did you listen to what I said?

769
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:06,420
(Respect and Simplicity)

770
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,690
I always listen to you.

771
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,070
My lord, Princess.

772
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,480
Madam Fu sent these servants over

773
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,880
to help

774
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,400
with tomorrow's tea banquet.

775
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,920
Alright.

776
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,070
Nanny Li, you may leave.

777
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:35,510
Yes.

778
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:49,990
My dear,

779
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,320
good work.

780
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,670
Gladly it was a false alarm.

781
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:58,000
We're under someone else's roof.

782
00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:59,030
In the dark,

783
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,880
I don't know how many people

784
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,190
are watching us secretly.

785
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,000
I'm glad you've thought of this, my dear.

786
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,230
We can't be too careful.

787
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,190
You took away my men

788
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,760
and made this map.

789
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,840
Are you going to use
a strong medicine tomorrow?

790
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:19,710
Whether it's a strong medicine or not,

791
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:20,880
we'll have to see

792
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:22,360
if it's effective.

793
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,760
If we want to find the hidden disease,

794
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:31,550
we need your silver-needle acupuncture

795
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,230
to find out what's going on inside.

796
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:37,800
Don't worry, honey.

797
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:39,920
I'll take care of things with the women.

798
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:43,920
Tomorrow, Sister will introduce me
to the noble ladies.

799
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,880
By then, I can try them out.

800
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:47,840
When they're all here,

801
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:48,950
I'll tell them

802
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,840
we're moving out

803
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:51,880
of Duke Qing's Mansion

804
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:53,360
and mention a few houses

805
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,280
to choose from.

806
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,550
Are you planning

807
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,510
to blend Traitor Lu's residence in?

808
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,190
If any noble lady is related

809
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,710
to the chief instructor,

810
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:06,840
I guess

811
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,590
she won't want me to buy it.

812
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,000
That's a good idea.

813
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:17,510
I guess you must be needing something.

814
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:18,640
What is it?

815
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,560
It's a list of noble families that'll be
attending tomorrow's party.

816
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:33,760
My dear,

817
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,440
memorize it tonight.

818
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:42,060
