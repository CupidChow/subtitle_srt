14
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,620
My Lord, the shadow guards report.

15
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,290
Qiulin Xian didn't return to Hong House.

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,210
He won't go back.

17
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,570
Deploy more men.

18
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,900
Search for anything related to divination.

19
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,070
Yes.

20
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,290
How's your side?

21
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,260
The Governor's servant's family

22
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,080
were tenant farmers for three generations.

23
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,100
They were dirt poor.

24
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,100
But now they've bought a farm.

25
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,100
They said the son's salary

26
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,290
was sent back home.

27
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,050
Murder for profit.

28
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,260
Maybe Qiulin Xian's doing.

29
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:27,940
Who knows?

30
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,470
Master.

31
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,010
Madam asks when you'll return to the room.

32
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,290
She said it was urgent.

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,140
What urgent matter?

34
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,700
I don't know.

35
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,500
What could be so important?

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,850
After reading the marriage compatibility,

37
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,660
don't waste this beautiful night.

38
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,800
Fine, I'm leaving too. I'll come back tomorrow.

39
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:06,980
Wait.

40
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,330
Don't come tomorrow.

41
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:10,800
I need you

42
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,050
to help me with something.

43
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,400
What is it?

44
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,710
I want you to leave

45
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,730
for Zhenzhou at once.

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,660
Is the trail leading to Zhenzhou?

47
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,270
Not exactly.

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,260
I need you

49
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,170
to keep an eye on He Zhen.

50
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,770
Lower your voice.

51
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,940
I'm determined to marry Liu Miantang.

52
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,170
Before I convince my mother,

53
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,170
I don't want any more complications.

54
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,010
Liu Miantang says you're just a lackey.

55
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,520
Why doesn't she pity me instead?

56
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,150
I'm your lackey. I'm not going.

57
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,540
You're my brother.

58
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,590
This is the first time

59
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,700
I'm doing what I truly want.

60
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,850
You're the only one I trust.

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,730
I must owe you from a past life.

62
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,540
Drink up. Then be on your way.

63
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,140
Dear, you aren't asleep.

64
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,820
Honey, come warm yourself by the fire.

65
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,410
I wanted to ask.

66
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,260
Did the fortune teller's words today

67
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,650
bother you?

68
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,940
I don't really believe in those things.

69
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,380
It's just for good luck.

70
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,670
That's fine, then.

71
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,840
Honey.

72
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,450
I've missed you.

73
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,620
I'm right here.

74
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,020
But your heart isn't.

75
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,860
You've just survived a deadly ordeal

76
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,700
and won a hard-fought battle.

77
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,060
Why are you still so busy

78
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,300
and rarely stay at home?

79
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,900
I only saw you today

80
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,900
because I ran into you

81
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,460
chasing fugitives.

82
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,460
Honey.

83
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,820
Can you spare half a day tomorrow
to spend with me?

84
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,300
Let's go out, shall we?

85
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,380
Dear.

86
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,660
I have military duties.

87
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,700
I'm afraid...

88
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:38,980
Alright, alright.

89
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,340
Don't be mad.

90
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,980
I'm not mad.

91
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,260
It's just

92
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,180
I miss Qingzhou so much.

93
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,100
Why do you miss that place?

94
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,780
It's not just a place.

95
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,620
It's our most

96
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,140
beautiful memory together.

97
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,620
Carefree and joyful.

98
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,860
Reluctant to leave.

99
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,100
Now.

100
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,980
Things have changed.

101
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,100
That's just how it is.

102
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,580
It's rare to see you like this.

103
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,980
Do you think I'm being unreasonable?

104
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:25,820
No.

105
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,140
I was going to say

106
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:29,980
tomorrow,

107
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,900
I'll take you out.

108
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,820
Should we have Fan Hu and the others

109
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,620
form a cuju team as we stroll?

110
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,660
I was worried

111
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,500
about your safety back then.

112
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,820
Tomorrow.

113
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,660
It'll be just you and me.

114
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:48,820
It's a deal, then.

115
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,460
Just the two of us.

116
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,060
At most, we'll bring Nanny Li.

117
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:54,900
Dear,

118
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,860
as you wish.

119
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,740
Honey.

120
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,940
Let's look over there.

121
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,620
Take a look.

122
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,340
Top-quality rouge.

123
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,270
Sachets and trinkets.

124
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,500
Forget it. I don't want it.

125
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,020
Come and see. Take a look.

126
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,780
I'm telling you.

127
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,740
These candied hawthorns are big and sweet.

128
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,820
- Here.
- Which one?

129
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,820
I want that one.

130
00:07:59,140 --> 00:07:59,980
What's wrong?

131
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,700
Want it? I'll buy it for you.

132
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,380
Let's see what's ahead.

133
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,300
(Fried Pastries)

134
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,180
This is delicious.

135
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,820
Slow down. Don't burn yourself.

136
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,260
- Hold it well.
- Thank you.

137
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,220
Here. Master.

138
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,540
Nanny Li, sit down.

139
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,380
Alright.

140
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,940
Kitty, guarding your food?

141
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,780
Come here.

142
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,180
Done.

143
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:29,860
You don't know.

144
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,860
These fried pastries

145
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,060
are best with crispy pork lard.

146
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:34,300
In my hometown,

147
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,300
that's how they're made.

148
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,660
Tasty.

149
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,540
Amazing.

150
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,580
Shopkeeper.

151
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,340
I want a pastry.

152
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,980
Sure, just a moment.

153
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,780
Is it good?

154
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,140
Too slow.

155
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,460
I don't want it.

156
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,300
Dear.

157
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,780
I still want that candied hawthorn.

158
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,140
I'll go buy it.

159
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,180
Such a delicious pastry.

160
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,020
It's a pity my husband only ate a few bites.

161
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,860
Candied hawthorn!

162
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,520
Trinkets!

163
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,540
Go.

164
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,500
What are you playing with?

165
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,700
Stones.

166
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,380
Pretty stones.

167
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,580
We found it on the road.

168
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,580
Can I see it?

169
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,180
Such a beautiful stone.

170
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,060
Where did you get it?

171
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,820
It fell out when they

172
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,620
were moving things in this courtyard.

173
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,180
Fell out?

174
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,980
They have lots of these stones.

175
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,260
Loading them by the sackful.

176
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,500
Do you know who they are?

177
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,940
No, they always leave at night.

178
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,180
We rarely saw them.

179
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,660
Alright, keep playing.

180
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,900
(Escort)

181
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,620
Miss, come take a look.

182
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:38,420
(Fried Pastries)

183
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,580
Shopkeeper.

184
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,700
Where's the lady who was with me?

185
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,340
They probably left a while ago.

186
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,510
Huzi, bring the pastry.

187
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,010
Sachets and trinkets.

188
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,410
This is nice.

189
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:02,130
I'll give you a discount for more.

190
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,600
I'll take this.

191
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,440
Alright.

192
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,300
Hold it well.

193
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,570
Sachets and trinkets.

194
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,020
The candied hawthorn?

195
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:20,860
It's fine.

196
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,740
Didn't get it?

197
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,340
You don't need to apologize like this.

198
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,780
There were too many people.

199
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,340
I was afraid of losing you.

200
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,340
Honey, I heard

201
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,180
today is the Flower Goddess Festival in Xizhou.

202
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,420
Later, the streets will be
even livelier. Let's...

203
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,460
I have military duties tonight.

204
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,740
I'm afraid I can't stay with you.

205
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,140
We stole half a day together.

206
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,100
I'm not greedy.

207
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,500
You're forgiven.

208
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,820
After tonight,

209
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,100
I'll have more time to be with you.

210
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,140
Since you have official duties,

211
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,380
go tend to them first.

212
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:16,980
But remember.

213
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,060
Come home early.

214
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:31,900
Madam.

215
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,780
My husband said

216
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,580
he had duties tonight.

217
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,180
He can't accompany me.

218
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,140
Nanny Li.

219
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,060
Please go to the street

220
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,140
and buy some things for me.

221
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,140
I've written it all down.

222
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,100
So much?

223
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,300
We rarely come to Xizhou.

224
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,380
I want to bring some crafts

225
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,980
for the folks at the kiln to see.

226
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,460
Please make sure to get everything.

227
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,420
Well.

228
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,180
Madam, you...

229
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,740
My husband has

230
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,180
already ordered a fine meal at the tavern.

231
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,580
I can't let it go to waste.

232
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:15,620
Yes.

233
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:38,900
(Xizhou Warehouse)

234
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,900
Huang Gui, go through the front.

235
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,700
The rest, surround the back.

236
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,060
Yes, sir.

237
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:01,940
Cheers.

238
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,340
This wine is pretty good.

239
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,820
What's going on?

240
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,220
You're suspects
in the Pingyuan Escort Agency massacre.

241
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,620
Come with us to the camp.

242
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,940
Officer, you must be mistaken.

243
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,620
We're just porters.

244
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,060
How could we kill anyone?

245
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,220
The Lord will decide
whether you've killed or not.

246
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,420
Take them.

247
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,500
My Lord, it's the ledger
from Pingyuan Escort Agency.

248
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,380
(Beizhou Iron Ore Escort)

249
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,740
I see.

250
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,860
They were transporting iron ore.

251
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,980
Qiulin Xian.

252
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,180
Who is he to you?

253
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,420
I'm just a local bandit.

254
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,340
All I do is rob.

255
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,580
As for

256
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,900
iron ores

257
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,380
or Qiulin Xian,

258
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,780
I know nothing.

259
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,820
I'll talk. I'll talk!

260
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,780
I'll talk.

261
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,340
It was Mr. Cao who ordered it.

262
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,020
I really don't know.

263
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,620
Mr. Cao?

264
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,620
Who's pulling the tricks?

265
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:23,660
Who?

266
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,420
Are you afraid of this?

267
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,780
Ms. Liu.

268
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,180
Such a romantic occasion.

269
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,980
Why leave your husband in the alley to suffer

270
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,460
instead of spending time with him?

271
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,460
You're having

272
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,260
a secret meeting with an outlaw

273
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,500
like me.

274
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,460
I'm truly flattered.

275
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,980
Who ordered you to kill me?

276
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,140
Tell me.

277
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,180
And you can die in one piece.

278
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,900
Your hand is healing quite fast.

279
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,500
You're asking me this,

280
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,740
so you must have half the answer in mind.

281
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,380
In these three years,
you've been too deeply involved.

282
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,060
Not to mention,

283
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,140
you've damaged the young master's reputation.

284
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,180
If things come to light,

285
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,140
you'll be the biggest liability.

286
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,860
So how could we keep you alive?

287
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,940
Are you saying

288
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,500
Ziyu...

289
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,340
On the Shangsi Festival night,

290
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,620
it was the young master
who sent me to kill you.

291
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,780
Later, when we arrived at Lingquan Town,

292
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,660
the young master

293
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,300
asked me to confirm if you were alive.

294
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,700
In fact,

295
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,580
he had long ordered me

296
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,100
to eliminate your faction.

297
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,740
The Pingyuan Escort Agency has been

298
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,220
running to this day just for business.

299
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,220
Once the money was enough,

300
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,380
it was necessary to erase it all cleanly.

301
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,140
It's quite a story.

302
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,660
I almost believed it.

303
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,740
Fortunately,

304
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,380
you accused Ziyu of that,

305
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,860
which made me believe

306
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:20,700
it wasn't him.

307
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,980
The person who wanted to kill me

308
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,780
was Sun Yun'er, the one you never mentioned.

309
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:31,260
You...

310
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,380
Uncle.

311
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,580
My revenge is settled.

312
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,340
It's your turn now.

313
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,660
You need to return the twenty lives

314
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,340
of the Pingyuan Escort Agency.

315
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,740
After settling the accounts with Cao,

316
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,980
there's only your deceitful bedmate left.

317
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,700
Miantang.

318
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,340
What are you planning to do?

319
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,380
Clarify his identity,

320
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,700
and then use it.

321
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,260
Once Cao Duo is dead,

322
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,900
Sun Yun'er will send people to hunt me down.

323
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,620
In Zhenzhou,

324
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,020
what support could compare

325
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,660
to Lord Huaiyang?

326
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,860
- Search.
- Yes.

327
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:11,700
Yes.

328
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,380
My Lord.

329
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,620
Mr. Cao.

330
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,900
Mr. Cao.

331
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,620
Mr. Cao, Mr. Cao...

332
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,460
Take him away.

333
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,820
- He looks
- Mr. Cao.

334
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,260
the same as the criminals described.

335
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,380
He should be Cao Duo.

336
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,420
Someone beat us to it to silence him.

337
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,380
Do you remember in Lingquan Town,

338
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,940
when Sun Yun'er said that Liu Miantang

339
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,900
took a large sum of money?

340
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:54,860
I remember.

341
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,420
I don't believe it.

342
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,100
How could there be much money

343
00:21:58,100 --> 00:21:59,380
in a mountain bandit's den?

344
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,220
The Pingyuan Escort Agency

345
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,540
started transporting iron ore

346
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,020
three years ago.

347
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,380
The initial page of the ledger

348
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,420
has Lu Wen's seal

349
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,140
and secret marks for reconciliation.

350
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,980
This shows that this person

351
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,180
personally facilitated

352
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,780
the major deal with the western tribes.

353
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,940
And Mount Yang

354
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,460
started its business three years ago.

355
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,060
This...

356
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,060
From the start of business

357
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,220
to when we encountered Liu Miantang,

358
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,580
the total amount of iron ore,
considering the market price,

359
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,660
exceeds 800,000 taels of gold.

360
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,620
So much money.

361
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,900
Then next...

362
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,980
Then next, Mount Yang surrendered

363
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,340
and allied with Prince Sui.

364
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,100
Lately, I've always felt

365
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,500
that there is someone

366
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,660
who understands my thoughts,

367
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,780
spies on my actions,

368
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,460
and constantly leads me by the nose.

369
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,660
Even if I gain something like today,

370
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,460
it's still because he made me this way.

371
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,100
I haven't felt this way for a long time.

372
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,260
When did you last

373
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,700
have this feeling?

374
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,580
The last time

375
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,780
was when I dealt with Lu Wen.

376
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,420
Lu Wen

377
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,180
should have returned.

378
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:26,610
Flower Goddess.

379
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,000
Wait for me.

380
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,570
Flower Goddess.

381
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,100
Honey.

382
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,020
Nanny Li said

383
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,740
you were sulking all night.

384
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,580
How did I not notice?

385
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:53,820
Finished your work?

386
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,740
Did it go smoothly?

387
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,220
It was as usual.

388
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,220
Actually, tonight,

389
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,260
I'm really happy.

390
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,340
What's wrong?

391
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,100
There's something

392
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,660
I've been longing for,

393
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,980
and tonight I finally got it.

394
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,820
What did you buy?

395
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,180
Just this?

396
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,100
It took a lot of effort

397
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,260
to get it.

398
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,180
The color

399
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,660
is a bit plain, isn't it?

400
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,740
You don't understand.

401
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,860
I also have something

402
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,300
very exciting today.

403
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,700
The person I had been

404
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,580
searching for has

405
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,300
finally come to light.

406
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,140
Then you

407
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,940
must've caught the criminal.

408
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,780
This one is more important.

409
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:46,900
Who is it?

410
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,300
Things are not settled.

411
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,300
I can't say.

412
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:54,020
The world is unpredictable,
and human hearts are hard to read.

413
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,060
Don't overestimate your cleverness.

414
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,260
What do you mean?

415
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,060
What are they doing?

416
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,900
The Flower Goddess will scatter fortune lots.

417
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,020
Those who get them

418
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,820
will be blessed with a happy marriage.

419
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,900
There shouldn't be any bad luck lots, right?

420
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,060
Let's go.

421
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:29,900
Here, here, here.

422
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,100
Too many people here. I can't grab one.

423
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,740
Put me down. Put me down.

424
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,260
- What's wrong?
- I'm embarrassed.

425
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,020
Then, I want one.

426
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,500
Can you help me get one?

427
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,780
Okay, wait for me.

428
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,060
How is it?

429
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,020
- Hurry.
- Let me see.

430
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,580
What does it say?

431
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,820
Let me see what it says.

432
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,700
Let me see. Let me see.

433
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,940
Let me tell you.

434
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,580
There's a sentence here.

435
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,900
It says

436
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,020
that love and hate

437
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,980
might be the same kind of illusion.

438
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,620
What does it mean?

439
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,660
Honey.

440
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,060
Do you want to taste

441
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,460
what hatred feels like?

442
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:12,910
♪The boat drifts, bringing back the sunset♪

443
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:20,110
♪When we reunite, we still joke

00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:26,300
♪Who passed by, the crabapple

445
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,180
Sorry.

446
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:31,570
♪Loving rightly but choosing wrong♪

447
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,060
The taste of hatred

448
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,260
is quite good.

449
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,380
Honey, I want to go home.

450
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,060
Let's go home.

451
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:51,680
♪Always hard to stay, yet easy to part;

454
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:18,660
(Xizhou)

455
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:22,820
The General

456
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:26,700
of the Western Front,
Lord Huaiyang, Cui Xingzhou

457
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,300
won the war and captured the general,

458
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,900
striking fear in the western tribes.

459
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,660
Meritorious deeds are recorded in history.

460
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,500
Granted a reward of 10,000 taels of gold.

461
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,220
1,000 bolts of silk and satin.

462
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,900
Since the war started,

463
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,620
the wind and frost have grown cold.

464
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,300
The hardships have been enough.

465
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,020
The general is spared the effort
of entering the capital

466
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,620
and can return home with honor.

467
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,500
I kowtow in thanks

468
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,940
for the imperial favor.

469
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,940
His Majesty appreciates

470
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,460
your great achievements and hard work

471
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:10,620
and has ordered you

472
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,980
to leave the west immediately

473
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,220
to return to Zhenzhou
to reunite with your mother.

474
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,260
No need to enter the capital
for reporting duties.

475
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,980
This is the Empress Dowager's edict.

476
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,260
Please take a look, My Lord.

477
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:29,700
(Return home with honor
and reunite with family.)

478
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,820
But I have important matters

479
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,940
to report to the court.

480
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,900
I must meet the Emperor.

481
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,140
That's not possible.

482
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,900
Without a decree, you cannot enter the capital.

483
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,220
You're aware of this.

484
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,140
May I ask how A Gushan

485
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,260
will be handled?

486
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,100
The Empress Dowager's order.

487
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,780
For offenses against our country,
death is not a pity.

488
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:53,300
Lord Huaiyang is ordered
to execute him on the spot.

489
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,580
No.

490
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,220
A Gushan's is important,

491
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,420
involving many parties.

492
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,180
He must be thoroughly investigated.

493
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,540
Presumptuous.

494
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,220
How dare you, an aide,

495
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,980
question the Empress Dowager?

496
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,140
My Lord.

497
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,380
Kneel.

498
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:12,500
Kneel.

499
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,020
Cui Xingzhou!

500
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,780
Cui Xingzhou!

501
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:22,900
You faithless scoundrel.

502
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,940
I curse your flesh

503
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,300
to be devoured by the Wolf Lord

504
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,340
and your soul

505
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,780
to be consumed by vultures.

506
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,180
- Shut up.
- Cui Xingzhou!

507
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,020
Execute him.

508
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,700
Do you remember back in Qingzhou?

509
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,820
We were just like this.

510
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,820
Honey,

511
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,620
you even skipped stones with me.

512
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,060
Honey?

513
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:38,780
Honey.

514
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,940
You'll get frostbite like this.

515
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,540
I heard today

516
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,140
Lord Huaiyang supervised
the execution of prisoners.

517
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,540
I was present.

518
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,420
In the past,

519
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,660
you only played Go.

520
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,940
Now,

521
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,500
you must witness

522
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,980
others die beside you.

523
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:17,980
Your state of mind

524
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:20,460
must be different from before.

525
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,500
Indeed, you understand me.

526
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,780
Is that so?

527
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,860
But I always feel

528
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:31,380
I don't understand you at all.

529
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,540
On the battlefield,

530
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,460
it's always a matter of life and death.

531
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,220
I had

532
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,980
already become numb.

533
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,100
So,

534
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,500
what's different this time?

535
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,620
The court is in turmoil.

536
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,180
Lord Huaiyang has won a victory.

537
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,620
Empress Dowager Wu's fear of him

538
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,420
has made her forbid him to enter the capital.

539
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:54,620
Even if any major cases

540
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,380
affecting the country are discovered,

541
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,460
he cannot change the situation.

542
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:05,980
Honey, you seem

543
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:06,940
no longer

544
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,460
like the merchant's son I knew.

545
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:12,180
Now, all you talk about is state affairs.

546
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,860
All about Lord Huaiyang.

547
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:15,980
Alright, dear.

548
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,540
Honey.

549
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,580
You seem like a different person.

550
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,700
Last time, when mentioning this scar,

551
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,420
you only said it was left by an archenemy

552
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,380
and skipped the rest.

553
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,220
But I can't understand.

554
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,220
Why would a Go archenemy

555
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,900
suddenly resort to violence

556
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,220
and injure you?

557
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,340
Alright, dear,

558
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,980
The past is unclear.

559
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:57,260
Don't take unclear things seriously.

560
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,740
Dear, you don't believe this, do you?

561
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:08,100
But I believe you're not honest enough.

562
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:13,220
This enemy

563
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:16,340
was once a mountain bandit.

564
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,660
He harmed my family and robbed my wealth.

565
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,780
This scar

566
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:24,180
came from an arrow from him

567
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,500
from a distance.

568
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:42,380
Honey, do you hate him?

569
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,060
Some say he wreaks havoc.

570
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:48,460
Others say he robs the rich to help the poor.

571
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,060
I used to try every means

572
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,100
to defeat him.

573
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,860
But after that incident,

574
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:55,740
he became a good person

575
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:57,820
who turned from darkness to light.

576
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,940
No longer possible to defeat him.

577
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,220
Even so,

578
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,100
I still do not hate him.

579
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,980
I always feel he is like me.

580
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,300
We

581
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,700
admire each other.

582
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,420
Dear.

583
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,860
Why do you ask these things now?

584
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,180
Just a whim.

585
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,820
By the way, honey.

586
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,860
Are we setting off

587
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,300
for Zhenzhou tomorrow?

588
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,780
Qiulin Xian has not yet been captured.

589
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,220
There might be more trouble.

590
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,300
Dear.

591
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:40,260
On the way, you must stay
with the army's families.

592
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,780
I will personally escort you back.

593
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,660
Thank you, honey.

594
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,220
Uncle Qiao.

595
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,940
The lady is leaving.

596
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,580
She let me give you this.

597
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:13,340
(Cui Jiu is Lord Huaiyang.)

598
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,820
What did the lady say?

599
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,060
Did she mention me?

600
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:20,060
That man is indeed Lord Huaiyang.

601
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,860
Lord Huai?

602
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,300
Miss, a letter from Xizhou has arrived.

603
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,460
What did Cao Duo say?

604
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,740
Did Liu Miantang

605
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,060
die in Xizhou?

606
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,900
Lord Huaiyang has eliminated Cao Duo.

607
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,060
Liu Miantang

608
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,140
has returned.

609
00:36:58,270 --> 00:36:59,230
Fresh.

610
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,300
Mrs. Cui.

611
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,660
Has she really returned?

612
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,740
Indeed.

613
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,100
Mrs. Cui.

614
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,780
Still looking?

615
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,260
Daring to look in front of me?

616
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,020
- I dare not.
- Come home with me.

617
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:22,860
Ouch. Ouch.

618
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,420
(Cui Mansion)

619
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:42,740
(Cui Mansion)

620
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,860
(Cui Mansion)

621
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,340
The war is over.

622
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,860
It feels like times have changed.

623
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,380
But Lingquan Town

624
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,740
seems unchanged.

625
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,780
Madam.

626
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,740
Let's go inside.

627
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,980
The wonton stand is set up here.

628
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,700
When did we get

629
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,460
such a good market at our door?

630
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,580
Nanny Li.

631
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,340
I want wontons.

632
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,140
With mushroom and chestnut filling.

633
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:56,860
Alright.

634
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,060
I'll go buy them.

635
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,260
Sir.

636
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,420
One bowl of wontons.

637
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,460
Mushroom and chestnut filling.

638
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,420
Sure thing.

639
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:11,420
Please wait a moment.

640
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,140
Manager Li.

641
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,860
It seems someone has been
watching Ms. Liu recently.

642
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:26,860
The Lord already knows.

643
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,060
Alright.

644
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,380
Madam.

645
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,020
Bicao.

646
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:38,980
Fangxie.

647
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,340
Didn't you...

648
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,540
We've returned the contracts to the study.

649
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,220
Bicao and I always believed

650
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,700
you would return.

651
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,180
Honey, you're back.

652
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,740
Madam, what are you looking at?

653
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,820
Why are you still standing there?

654
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,060
The madam had a headache in Xizhou.

655
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,620
Hurry and help her inside.

656
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:29,740
Madam.

657
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,420
Nanny Li, when will the master return?

658
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,820
The master achieved military merit

659
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,340
and is valued by Lord Huaiyang.

660
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:37,420
For these few days, he must stay in the camp

661
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,660
managing military affairs.

662
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:43,620
My Lord.

663
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,220
My Lord.

664
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,980
The madam has safely arrived home.

665
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:53,020
Tell the shadow guards not to slack off.

666
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,260
Take good care of her.

667
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:55,620
Yes.

668
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,620
Then, what about those people?

669
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:00,780
Kill them.

670
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,500
No need to interrogate them?

671
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,340
We can find out who they are.

672
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,460
I already know who they are.

673
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:17,700
Why is everyone asleep?

674
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:44,940
Cut off their hair.

675
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,060
Clean up.

676
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,060
- Yes.
- Yes.

677
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:05,580
Ms. Sun's methods

678
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,060
indeed show results.

679
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,900
But the Prince only asked

680
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:11,060
for 50 people to enter the capital.

681
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,380
Commander Gongsun.

682
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:14,020
You may return to report.

683
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:16,700
I will have everyone trained

684
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,340
before the New Year.

685
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:20,060
That will be best.

686
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,180
But

687
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:22,980
don't forget the Prince's instructions.

688
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,780
It ends in Xizhou.

689
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,420
Think of the big picture.

690
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:28,660
Don't create disputes

691
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:30,020
for personal desires.

692
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,380
Of course.

693
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:35,540
Miss.

694
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,140
Why are you here?

695
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,180
The package just arrived.

696
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:53,780
(Mansion of Lord Huaiyang)

697
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:55,020
You're finally back.

698
00:42:56,730 --> 00:42:57,660
Thinner.

699
00:42:58,960 --> 00:42:59,900
And darker.

700
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,220
Xizhou's climate is harsh.

701
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,300
But

702
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,980
you've been back for days.

703
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:09,060
I've been waiting day and night.

704
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,540
Why did you only come home today?

705
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:14,060
Though the war is won,

706
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,220
the affairs in Zhenzhou

707
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:16,860
cannot be delayed for a day.

708
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:18,420
Sorry for neglecting you.

709
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:20,060
Please don't blame me.

710
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:22,500
Didn't we win the battle in Zhenzhou?

711
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,580
Why is it still so hard?

712
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:26,940
Have you written to the court?

713
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:29,300
Have you expressed loyalty
to the Empress Dowager?

714
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:30,700
Mother. Mother.

715
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:31,540
You can

716
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:32,740
rest assured.

717
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,340
I have it all under control.

718
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:36,060
How is your health lately,

719
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,180
Mother?

720
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:41,420
Let's not mention it.

721
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,300
During the time you were away,

722
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,980
the Consort Dowager couldn't eat or sleep.

723
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:47,940
She cried every day.

724
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,460
You were on the battlefield.

725
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:53,300
Fu'er was far in the capital.

726
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:55,580
I felt lost.

727
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:57,620
Very distressed.

728
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:00,700
Luckily,

729
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,380
