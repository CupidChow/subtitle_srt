(Qingzhou Inn)

15
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,840
Honey.

16
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,960
After talking things out,

17
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,410
I feel much more at ease.

18
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,200
From now on,

19
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,100
let's not hide anything from each other.

20
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,500
Let's be open and honest.

21
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,510
Alright?

22
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,410
I noticed you have a scar here.

23
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,760
How did you get it?

24
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,940
It's caused

25
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,410
by an archenemy.

26
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,760
An archenemy?

27
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,460
A Go opponent?

28
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,220
He was a strong opponent.

29
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,380
But things

30
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,010
are different now.

31
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,690
Honey,

32
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,390
we've left the capital.

33
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,850
Let's stop dwelling on the past.

34
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,850
Think about the future.

35
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,410
Once I recover,

36
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,130
and the porcelain business stabilizes,

37
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,460
let's hire a good shopkeeper.

38
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,080
And then

39
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,180
we can travel by boat.

40
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,320
There's a broad world outside.

41
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,070
East, west,

42
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,060
north, and south,

43
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,940
we'll go wherever we please.

44
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,940
By then,

45
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,690
maybe we'll

46
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,730
have a son and a daughter.

47
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,290
We can take them along

48
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,900
to see all the seasons' blooms.

49
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,550
As you ordered,

50
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:59,150
all shadow guards
have entered the city in disguise,

51
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,620
without alarming any civilians.

52
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,760
My Lord.

53
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,060
Their lair is here.

54
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,380
All exits are under surveillance.

55
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,470
There are over ten bandits inside.

56
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,100
All of them are under our watch.

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,840
The shadow guards

58
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:20,920
are ready to move

59
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,020
at any moment.

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,840
Tomorrow,

61
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,100
we'll capture the Mount Yang bandit leader.

62
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,980
(Cold Rain Courtyard)

63
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,840
Move.

64
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,930
Oh, no. Trespassers.

65
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,590
Young Master, should we...

66
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,430
No need.

67
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,190
Lu Wen.

68
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,140
It's been a while

69
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,850
since the last battle.

70
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,710
Your strategy and authority

71
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,030
have grown even stronger, Lord Huaiyang.

72
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,410
You've followed me to Qingzhou

73
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,260
(Insights from Observing)
and broke into my house.

74
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,660
Once you're arrested,

75
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,830
everything will be handed over to the state.

76
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,410
You won't have a house anymore.

77
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,900
Let me tell you.

78
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,820
All three gates

79
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,920
and your secret passage

80
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,120
are under my control.

81
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,820
You have no escape.

82
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,730
I advise you to surrender

83
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,020
to avoid unnecessary suffering.

84
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,900
Are you telling me

85
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,530
that I've reached a dead end?

86
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,260
After years of struggle,

87
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,730
can't believe I lost in the end.

88
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,390
What if

89
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:13,780
I refuse to surrender?

90
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,790
Then don't blame me

91
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:16,700
for being ruthless.

92
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,230
Charge!

93
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:19,430
Stop!

94
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,120
My Lord, why didn't you tell me

95
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,230
you're coming?

96
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,850
I haven't had the chance
to host you in the past two days.

97
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,050
I feel truly ashamed.

98
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,400
General Shi,

99
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,880
are you interfering with my arrest

100
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,610
of a wanted criminal?

101
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,340
How could I?

102
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,660
But

103
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,490
the imperial decree

104
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,780
must be followed.

105
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,640
Mount Yang's Lu Wen and his men,

106
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,920
out of righteousness,

107
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,970
have announced

108
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,170
the cease of their rampant

109
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,970
and disturbing activities in the past.

110
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,630
With the Emperor's deep benevolence,

111
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,410
this decree is issued

112
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,020
to pardon past offenses,

113
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,790
accept their surrender,

114
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,630
and grant them peace and order.

115
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:23,990
My Lord,

116
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:25,870
Lu Wen

117
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,760
is no longer the leader
of the Mount Yang bandits

118
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,340
but a law-abiding citizen.

119
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,230
If you continue to cause trouble

120
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,350
in his courtyard

121
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,610
for no reason,

122
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,610
you'll be breaking the law

123
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,340
and defying the imperial court.

124
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,610
So, General Shi,

125
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,660
you've made secret plans with Lu Wen,

126
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,700
determined to protect him.

127
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,340
There's no need to put it so harshly.

128
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,370
We're just trying to relieve
the court's worries.

129
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,290
Let me offer you some advice.

130
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,930
Peace is precious.

131
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,260
Take your men

132
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,150
and return to Zhenzhou

133
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,640
to dig your canals.

134
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,700
Shi Yikuan!

135
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,370
I'm simply doing my duty.

136
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,260
If there's anything unclear,

137
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,310
My Lord,

138
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,900
you can submit a petition to the Emperor.

139
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,490
Why trouble me?

140
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,170
I have one more thing to ask him.

141
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,050
Please go ahead, My Lord.

142
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,970
Lu Wen,

143
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,900
I know you became a bandit

144
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,490
but were unwilling
to associate with traitors and rebels.

145
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,130
At least you're an honest man.

146
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,850
On the Shangsi Festival,

147
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,940
I sent a signal with sky lanterns.

148
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,730
Why did you break your promise
to cease the battle

149
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:48,890
and make a dishonorable attack on me?

150
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,650
You've been a military commander
for many years.

151
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,650
Don't you know all's fair in war?

152
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,420
I intended to accept you,

153
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,100
and you were willing to surrender.

154
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,730
Why didn't you do that before?

155
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,990
Why now

156
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,540
are you surrendering to Qingzhou?

157
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,110
No matter whom I surrender to,

158
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,490
it's still to the court.

159
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,730
Why cling to past grievances?

160
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:38,770
I only hope the feud
between you and Mount Yang ends here.

161
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,610
Farewell, Lord Huaiyang.

162
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,940
One more thing.

163
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,130
Someone I love

164
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,370
has settled in Zhenzhou.

165
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,700
She's now an ordinary woman,

166
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,100
no longer connected to Mount Yang.

167
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,610
If you ever find her,

168
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,010
please show mercy,

169
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,610
and spare the innocent.

170
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,160
- Tea, please.
- OK.

171
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:41,710
Madam.

172
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,060
I was thinking

173
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,490
this rain came at just the right time.

174
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:54,970
Shopkeeper,

175
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,200
our master

176
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,010
bought an expensive painting.

177
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,850
We're worried about it getting damp.

178
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,300
Can we

179
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,100
hang it here?

180
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,830
Sure, no problem.

181
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:09,850
No problem.

182
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,130
Whose work is it?

183
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,890
Mr. Hate Brush.

184
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,340
Mr. Hate Brush?

185
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,070
Look closely.

186
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,320
The dragonfly's eyes

187
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,540
seem to have something.

188
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,520
Indeed.

189
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,470
Who would've thought a masterpiece

190
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,010
would be in such a small place?

191
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,350
- Indeed.
- Truly.

192
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,560
May I ask if your master

193
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,820
would sell this painting to me?

194
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,680
The painting by Mr. Hate Brush

195
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,850
is a treasure to my master.

196
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,820
It's not for sale.

197
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,160
Isn't that a pity?

198
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,110
If it's not for sale, why hang it here?

199
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,350
The painting isn't for sale,

200
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,820
but the porcelain is.

201
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,820
Come take a look.

202
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,910
Yes, yes.

203
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:58,780
Exactly the same.

204
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,560
Madam, I've collected the 18 taels of gold

205
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,920
from the sale.

206
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,510
A distinguished guest

207
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,920
paid a deposit.

208
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,250
He plans to pick up the goods
later in Zhenzhou.

209
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,230
It seems our Yushao Porcelain Shop

210
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,730
has made quite a name in Qingzhou.

211
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,370
- Moru.
- Madam.

212
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,340
Why are you alone?

213
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,470
Where is my husband?

214
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,990
Madam, you must be tired.

215
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:27,460
I'll ask someone to prepare a meal.

216
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,470
Wait.

217
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,760
Where's my husband?

218
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,310
He's in the backyard.

219
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,430
The master

220
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,650
lost a game today.

221
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,490
He said he wanted to be alone.

222
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,820
What's this about?

223
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,110
Well,

224
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,730
rain is not a good thing.

225
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,700
It makes us feel melancholy.

226
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,460
So, I have to accompany you.

227
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,700
When you're troubled,

228
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,730
seeing me makes you happy again.

229
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,730
You rarely smile at me.

230
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:24,950
How could that be?

231
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,970
Even when you do smile,

232
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,970
it always feels elusive.

233
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,540
The lost game

234
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,890
reveals your true self.

235
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:35,940
Lost game?

236
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,060
Moru told me.

237
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:40,010
You don't need to feel embarrassed.

238
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,470
To others,

239
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:44,310
Go is trivial.

240
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,940
But it matters a lot to you.

241
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,820
Its significance is different.

242
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,180
So, from now on,

243
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:52,820
whether it's raining

244
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,970
or losing a game of Go,

245
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,370
I will always be with you.

246
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,890
Dear.

247
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,370
This time,

248
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,420
I'm afraid it's not just about losing a game.

249
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,250
Do you remember the archenemy I mentioned?

250
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,460
You met him?

251
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,400
Today's game

252
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,610
was against him.

253
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,420
Three years ago,

254
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,300
I played against him.

255
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,540
I lost that time.

256
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,970
It was my first defeat in life.

257
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,250
Strangely,

258
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,610
I didn't

259
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:37,490
feel sorrowful.

260
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:40,180
Instead, I felt

261
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:43,850
a kind of joy in meeting a worthy opponent.

262
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,420
Since then,

263
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,890
I've played against him several times.

264
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,220
We're almost even.

265
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,100
Each game is a battle

266
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,400
of wits and courage,

267
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,340
thrilling and intense.

268
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,870
Rather than

269
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,610
seeing him as an archenemy,

270
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,130
I consider him

271
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,010
a close friend.

272
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,480
I enjoy

273
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,770
each game against him.

274
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,540
As long as he's my rival,

275
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,650
the result

276
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,180
doesn't matter.

277
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,540
Until that time.

278
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,880
In short,

279
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,370
I wanted to settle the score with him.

280
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,100
To win,

281
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:28,850
I stayed up

282
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,750
all night

283
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,770
and used all means,

284
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,370
even at the cost

285
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,460
of harming some people.

286
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,730
And then?

287
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:40,710
Then,

288
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:42,970
we had a showdown today.

289
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,430
Today,

290
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,580
I set a trap

291
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,490
in the game,

292
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,650
encircling him layer by layer.

293
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,310
His pieces

294
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,100
have no room to move.

295
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:00,940
The final move

296
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,540
is in my hands.

297
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,940
But unexpectedly,

298
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,540
at this moment,

299
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,370
he suddenly stood up,

300
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,940
threw his pieces away,

301
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,300
and left,

302
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,180
leaving me

303
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,850
with an unfinished game.

304
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,300
What a jerk.

305
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,220
How is this different from retraction?

306
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:35,800
Such a lousy player

307
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,820
deserves to lose forever.

308
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,940
Honey, don't be angry with him.

309
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:42,950
Honey,

310
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,370
you don't actually care about this game at all,

311
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,550
do you?

312
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,540
You see him as an opponent

313
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:53,850
and a close friend,

314
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,250
thinking about him day and night.

315
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,310
In your heart,

316
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,370
you've developed different feelings for him

317
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,060
and projected your imagination onto him.

318
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,590
But now,

319
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,450
this person is not the same as before.

320
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,450
This archenemy

321
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,410
is not what you thought he was.

322
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,300
So, all your feelings

323
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,300
and illusions have shattered.

324
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,690
Meeting a worthy opponent

325
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,020
was merely your wishful thinking.

326
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,500
Honey,

327
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,170
I understand

328
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,980
why you're upset.

329
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,780
You're wise.

330
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,130
But I don't know how to comfort you.

331
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,170
You've already cheered me up.

332
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,780
I have another question

333
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,650
for you.

334
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,040
Go ahead.

335
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,450
Though the game is over,

336
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,650
the last piece is still

337
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,930
in my hand.

338
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,450
I don't know what to do with it.

339
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,820
Honey, that question is strange.

340
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,270
The opponent has run away.

341
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,740
Why keep the piece?

342
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,440
It's late and the dew is heavy.

343
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,930
Go and change your clothes.

344
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,710
Throw away the useless piece,

345
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:31,580
and be done with it.

346
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,640
Are your men all settled?

347
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,300
Thanks for asking, General.

348
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,370
They're settled.

349
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,120
Lord Huaiyang

350
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,410
disregarded the court's orders

351
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,060
and attacked you privately.

352
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:03,100
I will report this to the Empress Dowager

353
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,930
and give you an explanation.

354
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,650
We believe in the integrity of General Shi

355
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,880
and will not change our allegiance

356
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,890
due to Lord Huaiyang's actions.

357
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,820
You are a sensible person.

358
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,750
From now on,

359
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,540
we are all in the same boat,

360
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,540
without distinction
between the court and Mount Yang.

361
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,210
I will restrain my subordinates,

362
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,830
eliminate mountain bandit habits,

363
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:33,820
and reform,

364
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,780
to alleviate the court's worries.

365
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,780
To alleviate the court's worries?

366
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,110
Yes.

367
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,300
Since it has come to this,

368
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:45,980
there is something

369
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,060
you need to handle.

370
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,980
The money has been collected.

371
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,370
The madam says

372
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,960
the reputation is made.

373
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,850
Today,

374
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,780
we need to continue the business.

375
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,040
Understood.

376
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,210
Please forgive me for speaking out of turn.

377
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,170
Since Lu Wen has been pacified,

378
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,850
what about the madam?

379
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,370
Today, I will tell her the truth

380
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,740
and send her away.

381
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:15,820
Do you mean

382
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,410
to return her

383
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,980
to Lu Wen?

384
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,680
My Lord.

385
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:25,030
The madam was a pure lady.

386
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,200
She was abducted,

387
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,410
lost her chastity,

388
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,840
had her tendons severed,

389
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,060
and discarded in the water.

390
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,850
You can't let her return

391
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,780
to such a den of wolves.

392
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,680
If you let her choose,

393
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,890
she would not want to go back.

394
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:41,650
She is

395
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:44,020
devoted to you wholeheartedly.

396
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,930
If she learns the truth,

397
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,440
how heartbroken she will be.

398
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,450
Nanny Li.

399
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,350
Sorry,

400
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,060
I overstepped.

401
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,150
Honey.

402
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,110
You're awake.

403
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,370
I want a cup of tea.

404
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:49,130
Why are you up so early today?

405
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,690
Are you having a Go game?

406
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,400
I heard from Nanny Li

407
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,580
that your porcelain

408
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,370
sold well yesterday.

409
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,060
I don't feel like playing now.

410
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,500
I'll join you today.

411
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,960
All along the way,

412
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,500
you've been with me.

413
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,200
Now that the shop's business is open,

414
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,170
its reputation spread,

415
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:17,630
let me

416
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,410
properly accompany you today.

417
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,410
Dear, what do you mean?

418
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,640
I see that you are troubled.

419
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,340
It must be related to the game.

420
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:39,930
Since the piece

421
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,580
makes you unhappy,

422
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:42,850
let's just throw it away.

423
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,010
♪Flowers falling by the river again♪

424
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,510
In this world, what lasting match
between equals is there?

425
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,930
It's rare to have a fierce battle

426
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,780
and then leave gracefully

427
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,930
for the next match.

428
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:06,590
Cui Jiu.

429
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,580
Today, your opponent is me.

430
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,890
Can you beat me?

00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,590
Honey,

441
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,650
your smile is beautiful.

442
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,540
Have you finished it?

443
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:44,890
The Go skills align with the heavens and earth.

444
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:46,980
You and I

445
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:50,100
truly had a game

446
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,820
here in this world.

447
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,840
But indeed,

448
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,260
the game was a bit chaotic.

449
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,740
After all, I can't beat you.

450
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,980
Since we're placing pieces in this world,

451
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,370
you needn't be so fixated on winning.

452
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,370
It's not in a closed room

453
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,690
where you can only see the rival

454
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,300
and think only

455
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,780
about who can leave with a smile.

456
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,780
Let's just

457
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:24,020
watch this vast world together,

458
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,100
see the changes in the clouds,

459
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,750
observe the changes in weather,

460
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,300
and enjoy the life circle.

461
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,540
That's a fortune too.

462
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,210
Why care about anything else?

463
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,980
You seem to have found a way to comfort me.

464
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,590
Indeed,

465
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:49,340
being with you

466
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,850
is a fortune.

467
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,780
Why care about other things?

468
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,260
It's because you are wise.

469
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,820
You don't need my comfort.

470
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,040
Miantang.

471
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,930
Why are you so good to me?

472
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,650
Because you are my husband.

473
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,500
But you've lost your memory.

474
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,020
You have to believe whatever I say.

475
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,820
Aren't you afraid

476
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,340
that I may have deceived you,

477
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,410
hurt you,

478
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,130
or made you

479
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,500
waste your true feelings before?

480
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,850
I believe every choice I make.

481
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,820
If I had chosen someone,

482
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,410
believed in him,

483
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:36,930
and entrusted my whole life to him,

484
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,820
he would surely give me the best response.

485
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:46,300
Are you feeling better now?

486
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,280
Much better.

487
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:51,930
Let's go home tomorrow.

488
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,210
Tomorrow?

489
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,890
I miss home.

490
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,200
Alright then.

491
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,400
Let's put everything down today.

492
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,820
Rest well.

493
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,210
We'll go home early tomorrow.

494
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:04,930
Our home.

495
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,820
Going back to our home.

496
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:09,450
Our little home.

497
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:18,100
(There's something you need to do.)

498
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,650
(The biggest concern for the court now)

499
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,260
(is Lord Huaiyang,)

500
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,820
(Cui Xingzhou.)

501
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:25,960
This time,

502
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:28,060
he came in disguise.

503
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,500
When he returns,

504
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,540
I want you to bring people to ambush him

505
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,100
and kill him.

506
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,500
(Don't leave any trace.)

507
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,820
Young Master, at dawn,

508
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,500
they left the city.

509
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,800
Pursue them.

510
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,260
Young Master, what is this?

511
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:34,880
A deadlock between the black and white sides.

512
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,410
In the end, it became a meaningless draw.

513
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,130
Did Lord Huaiyang leave this behind?

514
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,280
Change the route.

515
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,300
Return to Qingzhou.

516
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:57,060
I let Lord Huaiyang escape,

517
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,450
which has disappointed you.

518
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,170
Please punish me.

519
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:11,850
Cui Xingzhou's actions were strange.

520
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,060
He didn't use the main road

521
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,450
but fled.

522
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,690
It is quite reasonable.

523
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:21,890
It is my fault for not warning in time.

524
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,130
If you want,

525
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,130
I'm willing to bring people to Zhenzhou

526
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,340
to make up for the mistake.

527
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,430
Zhenzhou

528
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,410
is the Cui family's territory.

529
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,500
If we go there,

530
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,890
it would be like seeking trouble.

531
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,150
Look,

532
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,170
don't be anxious.

533
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,100
Return,

534
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,100
and prepare well

535
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,060
for your future wedding.

536
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,720
Yes.

537
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,100
Ladies,

538
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,170
the time has come.

539
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,350
Classes are over.

540
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:24,870
Miss Shi.

541
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,790
The teacher praised your copy

542
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:29,820
of "Lessons for Women".

543
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,500
You are engaged.

544
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:32,780
The wedding is coming soon.

545
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,600
So you should focus

546
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,060
on needlework.

547
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,100
There's no need

548
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,370
to study here anymore.

549
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,300
I understand.

550
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,340
- Ladies.
- Alright.

551
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,230
The Gold Jewelry

552
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:50,210
has sent the latest accessories.

553
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,300
The madam asks you

554
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,020
to choose for yourselves.

555
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,070
Girls, come here.

556
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:58,200
Let's go choose too.

557
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,040
Let's go.

558
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,060
This one looks good.

559
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,000
This one is prettier.

560
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,880
Mine is prettier.

561
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,300
- Mine.
- Mine.

562
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,450
Give it to me.

563
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,060
Xueji is about to marry.

564
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,370
Let her choose first.

565
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,070
Give it to me.

566
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,520
Why not choose?

567
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:43,500
Don't you like them?

568
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:45,630
Sister...

569
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:46,780
Sister, don't forget.

570
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,580
Xueji is marrying the leader

571
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,740
of Mount Yang whom Father pacified.

572
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,650
It's a good match.

573
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,540
Xueji has suffered enough.

574
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:58,780
It is rumored that the leader isn't very cruel.

575
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,120
Though he was once a bandit leader,

576
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,020
such people are usually affectionate.

577
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:04,370
Don't talk nonsense.

578
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:25,500
This one is exquisite.

579
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,650
I like it.

580
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,850
Such a small ring.

581
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,350
Can you wear it?

582
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,060
Sister, look.

583
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,060
It fits perfectly.

584
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,920
This ring is very similar

585
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,890
to the one my mother used to wear.

586
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,060
Will you let me have it?

587
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,690
I hope you don't mind.

588
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,720
Sister.

589
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,000
This one.

590
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,260
This one suits you.

591
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,040
Daughters.

592
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:09,870
- Let's go.
- Go.

593
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:10,840
Let's go.

594
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,450
- Dad.
- Dad.

595
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,070
You're finally back, Dad.

596
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,020
My dear daughters.

597
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,020
My dear babies.

598
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:27,070
The western tribes are rioting.

599
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,980
(Easily Well-Governed)
They attack surprisingly.

600
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,160
General Pei led the troops to resist.

601
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,170
He exhausted himself and died.

602
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,120
Also, scouts sent secret reports.

603
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,160
They're having civil unrest

604
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,210
with the clan leader.

605
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,240
That's enough.

606
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,260
So much nonsense.

607
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,240
Empress Dowager,

608
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,580
Qingzhou reports

609
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,690
that the bandits have been pacified.

610
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:50,380
How to handle Lord Huaiyang

611
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,370
awaits your instructions.

612
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:54,080
No rush.

613
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,170
I already have a plan

614
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,930
for Cui Xingzhou's matter.

615
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:05,620
(Mansion of Lord Huaiyang)

616
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,940
They say

617
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,400
the garden here

618
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,100
can rival that of the capital.

619
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:18,030
Today's visit

620
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:19,940
confirms the reputation.

621
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:22,650
Since we're all family,

622
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,990
there's no need

623
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:25,330
for formalities.

624
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,330
I envy you.

625
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,900
Your son is successful

626
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,730
and causes less worry.

627
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,670
Unlike my Quan,

628
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,500
always joking around.

629
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,380
A dignified lord

630
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:42,420
today studies medicine,

631
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,580
tomorrow studies opera,

632
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,060
and now,

633
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,130
he is obsessed with painting.

634
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,810
By the way,

635
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,460
Binglan and Xingzhou are about to marry.

636
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,940
Why hasn't Lord Zhennan made a move?

637
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,160
Mother.

638
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,170
Don't mention it.

639
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,100
Princess Lin'an

640
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,210
canceled the engagement.

641
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,940
It changed his temperament.

642
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,130
He spends all day wandering around.

643
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,900
I don't want to intervene.

644
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,020
Not to mention remarrying.

645
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,330
Aunt, don't worry too much.

646
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,510
Cousin Quan and Cousin Xingzhou

647
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,500
are so close.

648
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:22,840
They influence

649
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,650
each other on many things.

650
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,980
Once my mourning period is over

651
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:29,650
and marries Cousin Xingzhou,

652
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:31,070
Cousin Quan

653
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,460
will naturally settle down.

654
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:35,290
Our Xingzhou

655
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,330
will not act recklessly.

656
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,690
We can rest assured.

657
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,510
I heard Mount Yang has been pacified.

658
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:44,400
Then Xingzhou

659
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,420
is bound to be promoted again, right?

660
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,170
Who knows?

661
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,940
The epiphyllum blooms late.

662
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,760
Mrs. Zhao, Aunt,

663
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,130
you have come too early.

664
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,120
Cousin Xingzhou.

665
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:57,190
You arrived just in time.

666
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,650
We were just talking about you.

667
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,690
Sister.

668
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:04,050
We'll watch the epiphyllum with you.

669
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:06,430
Yes.

670
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,730
We older ones talk.

671
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,860
The young ones don't like to listen.

672
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,860
I see

673
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:14,770
the laurel is blooming nicely.

674
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:16,440
You should walk

675
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,810
in the garden with your cousin.

676
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:32,390
Here.

677
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:45,900
Cousin Xingzhou,

678
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,460
I wrote a poem these past few days,

679
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,810
but I haven't found a rhyme.

680
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,900
I wonder if you have time

681
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,540
to help me polish it.

682
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,100
You're talented.

683
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,690
You're much better.

684
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,100
Everyone knows

685
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,280
that if it weren't for the late Emperor

686
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,960
canceling the exams,

687
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,650
you would've been the top scholar.

688
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,760
Cousin Binglan,

689
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:17,210
I have something to say.

690
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,250
Please go ahead.

691
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,420
You know what happened

692
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:22,730
in Lingquan Town.

693
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:23,980
I have my own plans

694
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,810
for that woman.

695
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,690
You don't need to tell me.

696
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:32,950
I know

697
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,250
you're a thoughtful person.

698
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,290
Since you already have a plan,

699
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:40,770
just make your own decision.

700
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,330
I just

701
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,420
want to be a good wife

702
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,900
and relieve your worries.

703
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,860
It's my duty not to interfere

704
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:57,060
with your decisions.

705
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,540
Say it again.

706
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,070
Are you hard of hearing?

707
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,190
You keep saying this.

708
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,500
You keep scaring me.

709
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,120
Lu Wen

710
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:10,460
has been pacified,

711
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,900
so I must arrange her future well.

712
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,590
So you're arranging for Liu

713
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:15,690
to marry another man?

714
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,590
That's not what I meant.

715
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:19,280
I have a matchmaker

716
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,170
find a suitable family for her.

717
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,250
Her background is complicated

718
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,320
and she has no support.

719
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,160
She thinks

720
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,630
I can arrange her future well,

721
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:28,580
then I will

722
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,810
help her with that.

723
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,020
I can do that.

724
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,080
You can't.

725
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,250
Why can't I?

726
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,460
Is it my appearance,

727
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:40,240
my character,

728
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,190
my family background,

729
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,170
or my virtues?

730
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,770
Don't use official matters to brush me off.

731
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,150
You've said

732
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,730
Lu Wen's matter is settled.

733
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,600
You're not good enough.

734
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,120
You...

735
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:58,210
You're nobly born.

736
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,550
If she marries you,

737
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:02,190
how will she face those acquaintances here?

738
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,030
How about her shop?

739
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,030
I need to ensure she lives a stable

740
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,860
and carefree life.

741
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:16,420
Why did you hum?

742
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,720
It's nothing.

743
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:20,330
I just feel

744
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,540
that the once cold-hearted Lord Huaiyang

745
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,860
now has a bit of humanity.

746
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,200
My Lord,

747
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,420
according to your instructions,

748
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:42,150
I have used my niece's name

749
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,690
to find some candidates through a matchmaker.

750
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,020
This is a widower.

751
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,340
He couldn't cure his wife's illness.

752
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,180
No.

753
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,260
(20 years old, widower)

754
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:56,510
This...

755
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,540
A 30-year-old scholar?

756
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:01,220
(Scholar, 30 years old)

757
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:02,470
My Lord,

758
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,110
she's trying to remarry...

759
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,580
She hasn't been married before.

760
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:08,060
She is not inferior to other noble ladies.

761
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:15,580
Let her review the others herself.

762
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:18,430
I also want to see.

763
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,640
Yes.

764
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:29,980
I want to see

765
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,960
what kind of man she can find.

766
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,860
More suitable than you.

767
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:36,130
I'm the most suitable in the world.

768
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:40,420
I didn't expect Lord Huaiyang

769
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,580
to have this day.

770
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,630
Honey, what are you doing here?

771
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:55,960
We finished the Go lesson early.

772
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,800
So, I came here.

773
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,150
You came just in time.

774
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:59,650
We've got some fine porcelain.

775
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,800
Look.

776
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,510
This porcelain plate looks ordinary,

777
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:03,770
but its body is excellent.

778
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,460
Its glaze is very delicate,

779
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,500
and it sounds clear.

780
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:12,020
Such fine porcelain.

781
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,770
I wonder who will buy it.

782
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:17,020
Many customers are vying for it.

783
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,810
I can pick the customer.

784
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,210
Honey, you rest first.

785
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,940
Please come in.

786
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,060
I'll take a look at the porcelain.

787
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:36,440
You've come at the right time.

788
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,860
These are our new arrivals today.

789
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,380
See which one you like.

790
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,770
It's white jade porcelain.

791
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,280
Good.

792
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,720
It's not for sale.

793
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:04,130
Honey, what are you doing?

794
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,800
This man is big and burly.

795
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,580
He doesn't deserve our porcelain.

796
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:11,630
The customer's preference matters.

797
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,170
It's not our choice.

798
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:16,730
Didn't you say

799
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:18,500
we can choose our customers?

800
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,690
We can't do business like this.

801
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:31,510
Stop talking.

802
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:32,540
Or I'll really get angry.

803
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:35,290
Sir, do you want some porcelain?

804
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,860
Hello, ma'am.

805
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,500
I just came to take a look.

806
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:44,900
These are our new arrivals today.

807
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:45,950
Look at this.

808
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,200
This...

809
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:53,130
Is this white jade porcelain?

810
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:54,980
You have a good eye.

811
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:56,580
You must be an expert.

812
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,940
When I was young and poor,

813
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:02,030
I used to make porcelain with my mother

814
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:02,870
to trade for books.

815
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,650
The crafts here are much better.

816
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,770
You worked hard on your own

817
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:08,380
and had a good mother.

818
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:10,540
Lessons for Women

819
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,670
recorded various virtues,

820
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:14,100
but only women like my mother

821
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,670
and you are truly praiseworthy.

822
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:16,690
- Dear.
- You...

823
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:20,860
Don't hold the plate too long.

824
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:22,730
It might tire your arm.

825
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:24,760
Who is this?

826
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,730
I'm her husband.

827
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:28,760
Sir, this porcelain...

828
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:29,600
Ma'am,

829
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:30,770
if you're uninterested,

830
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,290
why bother teasing me?

831
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:35,860
What's he talking about?

832
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:38,460
Who's teasing him?

833
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:43,470
