=Episode 35=

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,410
Today, I want

15
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,360
to share with you

16
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,530
a few heartfelt words.

17
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,300
You're well aware

18
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:56,830
that Xingzhou and Binglan

19
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,380
were originally betrothed.

20
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,780
But due to a misunderstanding,

21
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,860
the engagement had to be called off.

22
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,960
You've been too indulgent with Xingzhou.

23
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,410
He's no longer a child

24
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,670
and carefully considers

25
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,220
all his decisions.

26
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,970
Even so,

27
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,360
Binglan suffered greatly

28
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,810
because of him.

29
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,690
After you reprimanded her harshly

30
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,060
the other day,

31
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,080
she stopped eating and drinking for days.

32
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,690
She's been crying

33
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:27,960
and hasn't

34
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,130
left her room since.

35
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,570
If this continues,

36
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,130
she'd be collapsed.

37
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,800
Rumors are swirling

38
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,500
in Zhenzhou,

39
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,660
saying that Xingzhou

40
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,870
abandoned Binglan for you,

41
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,570
blinded by beauty.

42
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:44,990
That rumor

43
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,380
does her reputation no good

44
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,410
at all.

45
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,060
I've pondered this

46
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,220
for many sleepless nights

47
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,500
and thought…

48
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,100
Perhaps

49
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,730
both you and Binglan could

50
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,530
become wives of equal status

51
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,730
and marry him together.

52
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,830
Wives of equal status

53
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,240
are usually a practice among merchants

54
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,410
who travel far and wide.

55
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,080
With one wife in the south

56
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,110
and one in the north,

57
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,340
it works out peacefully.

58
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,680
But if two wives reside

59
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,100
within the same mansion,

60
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,660
even the most virtuous could

61
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,810
lose their virtue.

62
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,220
If you refuse,

63
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,500
you'd be labeled as jealous.

64
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,250
A reputation for jealousy…

65
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:35,780
I don't care.

66
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,010
But it could tarnish the Cui's name.

67
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,570
Consort Dowager,

68
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,240
your words

69
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,850
have shattered the sincerity

70
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,690
I've held onto for so long.

71
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,850
I've genuinely cared for you.

72
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,780
I've even given you that hairpin.

73
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,130
I thought so.

74
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,810
I lost my mother when I was young.

75
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,900
During my time in the mansion,

76
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,100
I've always treated you as my mother.

77
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:13,810
I believed,

78
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,660
despite your sharp tongue, you had a soft heart

79
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,610
and would warm up to me

80
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,170
one day.

81
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,290
It wasn't until Madam Zhao's birthday banquet

82
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,140
that I realized

83
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,580
you still disapprove of me.

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,340
Today, you've crossed

85
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,850
my bottom line.

86
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:41,730
I'll take my leave

87
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,340
from the mansion now.

88
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,140
Please rest well,

89
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:46,730
Consort Dowager.

90
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,850
I'll take my leave.

91
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:11,740
(Virtuous and Disciplined)

92
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,220
Greetings, Your Majesty.

93
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:22,310
Minister Shi,

94
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,900
if reinforcements from the Ji and Lu armies
do not arrive soon,

95
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,610
the Zhenzhou army will be annihilated.

96
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,800
Your Majesty,

97
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:31,320
the Ministry of War has issued
three urgent orders,

98
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,520
urging them to dispatch troops.

99
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,260
However, the two generals reported

100
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,850
that although
the Hebei Camp's soldiers have arrived,

101
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,490
the provisions are not yet ready.

102
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,720
Why?

103
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,440
They expected

104
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,760
the nearby counties

105
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,370
to supply the necessary provisions,

106
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:47,790
but

107
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,000
when they reached the Hebei Camp,

108
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,370
they found the numbers were inflated.

109
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,640
This is a lingering problem

110
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,020
from the previous Wu regime.

111
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,000
They've already sent men back

112
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,530
to their respective counties

113
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,910
to requisition grain.

114
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,170
When will they be able to deploy?

115
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:03,830
As soon as the provisions arrive.

116
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,850
At the earliest, four days.

117
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,260
We can't afford any more delays.

118
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,480
Your Majesty,

119
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,760
an army marches

120
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,340
on its stomach.

121
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,350
Traitor Lu is fortified

122
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,370
at three passes of Tongyu,

123
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,100
which are easy to defend and hard to attack.

124
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,000
Without enough provisions,

125
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,490
we mustn't proceed.

126
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,040
Moreover,

127
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,490
I have been busy these past few days,

128
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:32,730
arranging

129
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,780
the war supplies

130
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,410
and military fees.

131
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,370
I've ordered all departments to coordinate.

132
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,720
Your Majesty,

133
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,900
without sufficient funds and provisions,

134
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,260
the troops

135
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,460
may rebel.

136
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,290
I understand.

137
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,850
Let's hope the Zhenzhou army

138
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,930
can hold on for another ten days.

139
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,050
With a pincer attack,

140
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,040
Traitor Lu

141
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,170
will surely fall.

142
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,780
Consort Dowager,

143
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,930
Princess Huaisang has left
through the back gate.

144
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,410
She really left?

145
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,730
She left something for you.

146
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,050
Quickly.

147
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,610
Bring her back.

148
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,800
Yes, ma'am.

149
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:45,930
I know you're a filial girl.

150
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,050
But now that you're the Empress,

151
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,970
let the servants

152
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,170
handle these tasks.

153
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,340
Father, do you know the origin
of the Deer Calls cakes?

154
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,200
Did you want me here

155
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,580
just to chat?

156
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,170
I'm not some palace concubine.

157
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,340
I don't care

158
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,460
about

159
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,780
the cakes.

160
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,390
Father, you've always doted on Xuelu.

161
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,730
Can't you see

162
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,820
this is her pastry?

163
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,560
It's good

164
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,400
that you are so close.

165
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,370
Xuelu's skills are impressive.

166
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,110
These are as fine

167
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,300
as the palace's delicacies.

168
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:35,700
Not exactly.

169
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,460
At least,

170
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,340
this piece is different.

171
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,180
I've added

172
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,850
deadly poison to it.

173
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,580
Deadly poison?

174
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:56,580
What do you want?

175
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,300
I am wholly devoted to His Majesty

176
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,250
and ask for your support

177
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,890
in aiding Lord Huaiyang.

178
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,220
Did he put you up to this?

179
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,650
This is my decision.

180
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,630
From the Shi family to the palace,

181
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,130
I've never had a choice.

182
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,700
But today,

183
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,940
it seems Father is the one without a choice.

184
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,460
- You…
- Father, do you know

185
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,730
the consequences

186
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,770
if I die today?

187
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,580
Consequences?

188
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,060
The Shi family's position in the court

189
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,040
is because of me.

190
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,250
Me.

191
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,970
It was,

192
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,490
but not anymore.

193
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,710
Father always said

194
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,540
I wasn't important at home.

195
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,580
Even if I lost my position as Empress,

196
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,890
there are other Shi daughters.

197
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,650
But if I die today

198
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,560
from eating

199
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,700
my elder sister's pastry,

200
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,100
I wonder

201
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,850
how the Shi daughters will ever
marry into the royal family again

202
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,490
and how will you

203
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,540
explain it to the public.

204
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,760
Of course,

205
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,320
you could snatch it

206
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,820
from my hand.

207
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,730
If you want it,

208
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,060
you can have it.

209
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:25,060
Nonsense.

210
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,060
Utter nonsense!

211
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,520
Father,

212
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,490
if you leave today,

213
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,270
you might not even have a choice

214
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,220
to make tomorrow.

215
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,250
Do you know what you must do now?

216
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,130
Your Highness.

217
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,490
Why are you all so nervous?

218
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,670
I spoke my mind

219
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,100
to my father today.

220
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,580
What a relief.

221
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,370
These cakes aren't enough.

222
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,470
Go.

223
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,300
Get me more pastries.

224
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,850
Go.

225
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,310
Yes, Your Highness.

226
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,850
What should we do now?

227
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,940
Your Majesty.

228
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,700
What unnerved you so?

229
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,340
An imperial decree.

230
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,650
His Majesty decrees:

231
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,100
General Shi

232
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,110
has volunteered
to lead the troops southward to reinforce.

233
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:39,540
His bravery ensures peace in our country
and comforts me.

234
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:42,220
Shi's female members
are all to be bestowed with honorary titles.

235
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,220
(Minister's Mansion)
We thank His Majesty.

236
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,770
General Shi, please rise.

237
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,580
Please rise.

238
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,540
I rushed here to bestow the honorary titles

239
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,200
upon the female members of the Shi household

240
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,580
before the General's departure.

241
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,340
Congratulations, General Shi.

242
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,940
Congratulations, Mrs. Shi.

243
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,010
Congratulations, ladies.

244
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,970
General Shi, His Majesty also said

245
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,230
that the Empress is virtuous

246
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,870
and her reputation will be recorded in history.

247
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,960
This is a testament
to the Shi family's excellent upbringing.

248
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,630
Mrs. Shi shall bring the Empress's sisters

249
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,850
to the palace the other day.

250
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,370
The Grand Empress Dowager will preside

251
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,970
over the selection of suitable husbands
for the ladies.

252
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,590
Good.

253
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,130
You must all thank His Majesty.

254
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,490
We thank His Majesty.

255
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,160
General Shi,

256
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,060
I have other official duties to attend to

257
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,200
and must take my leave.

258
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,040
Of course.

259
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,250
If I were you,

260
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:39,730
I'd be in tears by now.

261
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,770
Why?

262
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,300
Didn't you catch the meaning?

263
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,560
Everything the Shi family has now

264
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,940
is because of Xueji.

265
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,590
As she rises,

266
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,700
so does the Shi family.

267
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,580
Her position as Empress

268
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,220
is irreplaceable now.

269
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,800
We march.

270
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,300
That old fool, Shi Yikuan,

271
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,490
must have

272
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,080
been completely bewitched

273
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,460
by the fatuous emperor.

274
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,540
He left for the front lines overnight,

275
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:14,590
claiming to supervise the battle.

276
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:15,490
But in truth,

277
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,060
he rushed to the Hebei Camp

278
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,100
to lead reinforcements for Cui Xingzhou.

279
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,770
He's harbored enmity towards Cui Xingzhou.

280
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,180
Is it possible that he is going to assist him?

281
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,250
Regardless of his true intentions,

282
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,370
Zhenzhou's defenses are now vulnerable.

283
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,130
I've already sent Gongsun Ye there.

284
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,970
Let your assassins meet up with him.

285
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,250
I want the family of Cui Xingzhou.

286
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,300
It has been days now,

287
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,870
and there hasn't been a word

288
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,490
from her since she left.

289
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:48,650
It seems

290
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,490
she is serious this time.

291
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,060
After all, she hails from a humble background,

292
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,850
lacking the magnanimity anyway.

293
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,650
Consort Dowager,

294
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,540
those involved are often confused,

295
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,420
while onlookers see clearly.

296
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,010
What are you implying?

297
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,490
I don't think

298
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,890
she likes to put on a show.

299
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,180
She treats you with sincerity.

300
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,920
If you wish to resolve it properly,

301
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,340
you must treat her with sincerity.

302
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,420
Make your intentions

303
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,420
clear and honest,

304
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,760
or it will be difficult

305
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,650
to bring this to a good end.

306
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,540
Only the one who tied the knot can untie it.

307
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,080
As an outsider,

308
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,420
I shall not interfere any further.

309
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,420
I will take my leave now.

310
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,180
Take care.

311
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:48,140
(Graceful Blossoms)

312
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,230
Pass an order:

313
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,820
no one is allowed to discuss the matter

314
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,700
of Princess Huaisang leaving the mansion.

315
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:55,830
Yes, ma'am.

316
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,000
Consort Dowager.

317
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,400
Why has this letter

318
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,640
been returned?

319
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,210
The dispatch from the front lines reports

320
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,850
that the courier route has been blocked.

321
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,820
The letters cannot be delivered.

322
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,070
Madam, spies have infiltrated the Western Camp,

323
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,400
and the provisions have been destroyed.

324
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,060
We failed to hold back Prince Lu's forces.

325
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,310
Prince Lu's two armies have formed

326
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,500
a pincer movement at Tongyu,

327
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,540
forcing His Lordship to retreat to Mount Li.

328
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,060
The stalemate continues,

329
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,650
and the situation remains unresolved.

330
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,500
Is he in danger?

331
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,440
Since Xingzhou has retreated to Mount Li,

332
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,920
it must be because

333
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,990
the terrain is easier to defend

334
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,370
and suits his next move.

335
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,130
He never fights a battle he isn't prepared for.

336
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,060
I believe he will find a way to break through.

337
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,050
Madam,

338
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,840
the courier route has been blocked
due to the battle,

339
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,570
and all trade routes to Dongzhou
have been severed.

340
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,030
Recently, many wandering merchants

341
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,690
appeared in Zhenzhou.

342
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:02,830
My Lord,

343
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,100
our troops tightened the encirclement

344
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,370
of Mount Li to Tingyun Gorge.

345
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,060
We have now secured

346
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,450
every way to retreat from Mount Li.

347
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,410
Undefeated?

348
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,960
That's what he's capable of?

349
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,820
Just by slowly wearing him down,

350
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,840
I can exhaust Cui Xingzhou

351
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,160
completely.

352
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,930
I congratulate you.

353
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:34,960
My Lord,

354
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,060
everything has been arranged.

355
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,680
However, without reinforcements,

356
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,580
breaking out would result

357
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,930
in even greater losses.

358
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,580
Take some elite soldiers
to the top of the mountain.

359
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,070
Prepare according to the plan

360
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,260
I just mentioned.

361
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,680
As you command.

362
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,740
Great Deities,

363
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,450
please protect Xingzhou

364
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,000
and keep him

365
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,370
safe and sound.

366
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,070
Consort Dowager.

367
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,640
Liu Miantang?

368
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,890
I brought her here.

369
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,020
Xingdi, why are you here?

370
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,400
It is quite urgent.

371
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,300
Ladies,

372
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,360
please

373
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,260
remain calm.

374
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,030
Some bandits

375
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:20,370
secretly came to Zhenzhou.

376
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,540
They disguised as peddlers,

377
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,060
evading the patrols.

378
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,650
They are heading here right now.

379
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:28,890
Where did they come from?

380
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,210
While His Lordship is not here,

381
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,300
are they trying

382
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,300
to revolt?

383
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,600
His Lordship has been ordered
to the front lines in Dongzhou,

384
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,540
yet these bandits have come directly
to his mansion.

385
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,200
They likely intend

386
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,370
to capture Xingzhou's family

387
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,550
to force him

388
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,740
to retreat.

389
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,120
Brother Xingdi and I made some preparations.

390
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,200
I ask that all of you come with me

391
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,400
to leave the mansion and take shelter.

392
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,450
Nonsense.

393
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,850
Let alone the bandits,

394
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,540
are our guards here not more capable

395
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,580
than a woman like you?

396
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,480
Staying here

397
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,740
is the safest option.

398
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,410
Why should we follow you?

399
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,610
I want to stay with Xindi.

400
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,110
I understand

401
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,170
that this is unexpected,

402
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:08,120
but every moment we delay
increases the danger we face.

403
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,580
We don't have time to argue.

404
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,990
The enemy lurks in the shadows.

405
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:11,960
If they're after his family,

406
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,500
the mansion is now their target.

407
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,840
No one can guarantee

408
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,210
that this place is safe.

409
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,740
Princess Huaisang is correct.

410
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,780
It was she who first noticed it

411
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,170
and immediately informed me.

412
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,240
Before leaving,

413
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,230
Xingzhou entrusted the shadow guards
to Princess Huaisang.

414
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,340
Her decisions

415
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,020
are Xingzhou's decisions.

416
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,780
Must we really leave the residence?

417
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,890
Consort Dowager, rest assured.

418
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,400
Brother Xingdi and I have decided

419
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,020
to take you all to a safe place
for the time being.

420
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,440
Whether Xingzhou is crushing the enemies

421
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,960
or finding a way out of a desperate situation,

422
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,260
the most important thing
is that his family is safe.

423
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,050
If he's about to attack

424
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:44,070
and yet the enemy is holding your life
as a bargaining chip

425
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,210
to force him to retreat,

426
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,280
what do you think

427
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,890
he should do?

428
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,390
Well...

429
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,650
Consort Dowager, please leave with me.

430
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,890
Please, follow Princess Huaisang.

431
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,690
I swear to defend the mansion with my life.

432
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:34,830
Halt.

433
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,340
Where is the Consort Dowager?

434
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,020
- She is...
- Speak.

435
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,540
In the inner chambers.

436
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:41,910
Lead the way.

437
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,100
Seize them.

438
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,340
Please have some tea.

439
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,760
How are things?

440
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:33,540
The shadow guards sent word

441
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:36,000
that it was fortunate

442
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,060
that you left in time.

443
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,360
A group of bandits

444
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,690
attacked shortly after.

445
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,840
Thankfully,

446
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,070
Xingdi and the guards

447
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,300
set a trap

448
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,070
and ambushed the bandits

449
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,980
in the courtyard by the northwest gate.

450
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,540
We don't know how many of them there are.

451
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,580
And since those bandits

452
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,540
didn't find any family members,

453
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,340
they'll surely be searching around the mansion.

454
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,020
It is uncertain

455
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,100
when they might search Lingquan Town.

456
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,450
Mother.

457
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,100
I have already stationed men

458
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,100
to guard the North Street.

459
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,740
There's been nothing unusual so far.

460
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,690
No one is likely to approach us tonight.

461
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,210
We will have to make do here for the night.

462
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,740
I will think of a plan soon.

463
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,100
What?

464
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,820
Stay here?

465
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,400
In this shabby,

466
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,240
ramshackle hut?

467
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,130
Mother.

468
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,000
Consort Dowager

469
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,840
is of such noble birth,

470
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,690
how can she endure this?

471
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,130
The situation is uncertain now,

472
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,340
and our safety lies in vigilance.

473
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,690
Everyone must be cautious tonight

474
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,410
and not leave the courtyard.

475
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,550
If someone causes a commotion

476
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,650
and attracts trouble,

477
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,750
it's hard to say

478
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,160
what might happen

479
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,100
in this shabby place.

480
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,580
Consort Dowager,

481
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:39,020
you're awake.

482
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,740
I'll go prepare some food for you.

483
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,520
Here.

484
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,650
Please, do not worry too much.

485
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:16,060
Xingzhou is likely safe.

486
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,370
How come?

487
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,930
Those bandits who broke into the mansion

488
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:24,960
were likely

489
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,450
after Xingzhou's family.

490
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,210
They dared to act so recklessly

491
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,880
because the battle in Dongzhou

492
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,260
is not going in their favor.

493
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:35,610
Those with ill intentions in the dark

494
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,260
are making a desperate gamble,

495
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,680
hoping to capture his family

496
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,300
and use them as leverage.

497
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,370
He will be fine.

498
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,720
Please, eat.

499
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,370
Stop.

500
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:07,740
Come here.

501
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,480
You.

502
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,780
Make us some noodles.

503
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:40,930
Stop.

504
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,260
Why did you smile?

505
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,890
You owe us.

506
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,960
You brought me and Binglan

507
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,650
to this filthy place.

508
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,270
Those bandits

509
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,990
are after the Cui family.

510
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:55,450
But I'm from the Lian family.

511
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,690
I don't need to hide like this.

512
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,020
You intentionally

513
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,160
dragged us

514
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,130
into this mess.

515
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:05,880
Since we're here,

516
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,930
let's make the best of it.

517
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,130
It's late.

518
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,690
You should get some rest.

519
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,580
We have a distance to walk tomorrow.

520
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,310
Aunt.

521
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,500
If you think

522
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,980
I've implicated you,

523
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,580
you're free to seek a better refuge.

524
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,150
Aunt.

525
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,780
Mother.

526
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:33,550
Let's go.

527
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,040
What?

528
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,450
Are we leaving now?

529
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,600
As you ordered,

530
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,500
I led a unit of elite soldiers
to feign an attack,

531
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,840
pretending to be defeated and retreat.

532
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,360
As expected, this emboldened the enemy,

533
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,920
and their night watch has become somewhat lax

534
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,890
compared to previous days.

535
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,450
We will do the same tomorrow.

536
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,400
We must make them believe

537
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,600
we are desperate and cornered,

538
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,580
fighting for our lives.

539
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:09,370
Understood.

540
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,680
Madam.

541
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:15,910
Mother.

542
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,690
Sorry about all the fuss.

543
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,030
The situation was urgent,

544
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,450
and I had no time to explain.

545
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,840
This strategy was born

546
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,210
out of necessity.

547
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:24,980
I hope

548
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,520
you can understand.

549
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,890
Don't mention it.

550
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,230
You protected the mansion

551
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,450
and ensured everyone's safety.

552
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,340
You did well.

553
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,580
Can we return now?

554
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:42,230
There are still some bandits

555
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,580
lurking around.

556
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,850
They will soon reach Lingquan Town.

557
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,880
Therefore,

558
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,740
you must leave this place as soon as possible.

559
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,980
What should we do?

560
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,680
Madam.

561
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:56,960
Mother.

562
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:58,680
I understand

563
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,450
your fear and anxiety at this moment.

564
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,020
As a son,

565
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,640
I vow to protect my family with my life.

566
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,980
As Xingzhou's elder brother,

567
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,680
I will fight with all my might

568
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,170
to defend the mansion.

569
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:10,370
I've already ordered the guards

570
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,890
to conduct a thorough search of Zhenzhou.

571
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,260
Within three days,

572
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,890
I will eliminate all threats

573
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,740
and welcome you all back.

574
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:24,640
Where are

575
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,540
Mrs. Lian

576
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,520
and Binglan?

577
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,370
My troublesome sister has

578
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:31,410
been making things difficult for Miantang.

579
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,130
She stormed off in a huff,

580
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:35,020
taking Binglan with her.

581
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,820
I don't know if the people Miantang sent

582
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,580
have found them yet.

583
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:41,260
Even if we find them,

584
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,170
we still need to leave.

585
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,410
But where

586
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,500
can we go now?

587
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,680
Consort Dowager, Aunt,

588
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,840
I have

589
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,690
packed our belongings.

590
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,160
There's a porcelain kiln

591
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,160
on a mountain outside the town.

592
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,020
We'll go there to hide for a while.

593
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,020
Brother Xingdi, I don't have enough men.

594
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:07,450
I need you to send more people

595
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,170
to find Mrs. Lian and Binglan.

596
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,400
Don't worry. I'll have the guards

597
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,410
search for them right away.

598
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,890
The conditions in the mountains will be harsh.

599
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,580
I apologize for the discomfort

600
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,890
you will have to endure.

601
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,310
As long as Xingzhou can fight

602
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,410
without worries,

603
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:24,610
this hardship is nothing.

604
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,820
The greater good is paramount.

605
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,410
I'll do as you say.

606
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,400
I have to stay behind

607
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,680
to eliminate any remaining threats

608
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,410
and cannot accompany you.

609
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:34,790
I hope Princess Huaisang

610
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:35,680
will take good care

611
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,060
of the Head Lady and Mother.

612
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,840
There's no need for such formalities.

613
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,170
I will not fail you.

614
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,390
I am

615
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,740
deeply grateful.

616
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:49,990
Search this place.

617
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,020
- Aye.
- Aye.

618
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,720
No one in the front yard.

619
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,240
No one here either.

620
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,990
- No one in the backyard.
- No one here either.

621
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,820
Search every checkpoint

622
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,070
and nearby village.

623
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,160
Don't let them escape.

624
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,000
- Aye.
- Aye.

625
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,800
Be careful.

626
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,520
We're here.

627
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,690
We're here.

628
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,520
Come on.

629
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,760
Let's go.

630
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:50,550
Be careful.

631
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,450
Soldiers.

632
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,520
Aye.

633
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,460
In ancient times,
renowned generals scaled cliffs

634
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,790
and conquered the Motian Ridge,
launching a surprise attack on Yinping

635
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,060
and achieving extraordinary victory.

636
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:01,390
Today,

637
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,890
it is our turn.

638
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,040
Failure

639
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,710
means death,

640
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:06,550
but success means

641
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,130
our chance to strike the enemy.

642
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,840
I thank you all

643
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,690
for standing by my side

644
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,210
through life and death.

645
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:16,780
We will follow you till death.

646
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,760
Move out.

647
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:20,120
Your Highness,
the Zhenzhou army is launching a night attack.

648
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:21,910
What?

649
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:28,340
Cui Xingzhou...

650
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:36,800
General,

651
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,240
Lord Huaiyang has taken the opportunity

652
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,510
to launch a night raid on Prince Lu's army.

653
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,310
This is our chance.

654
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,580
We must send our troops now

655
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,740
and not let Cui Xingzhou claim all the glory.

656
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:57,500
I wonder how Xingzhou is doing.

657
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,740
He will be safe and sound.

658
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,890
He's such a devoted family man.

659
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,400
As soon as he can,

660
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,130
he'll rush back without stopping.

661
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,580
If we take care of ourselves,

662
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,330
that will be his greatest comfort.

663
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,200
What's wrong?

664
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,810
Are you feeling unwell?

665
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:26,060
I never expect I still cannot

666
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,330
discern the true nature of people at my age.

667
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,980
Those bandits were after me.

668
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,020
Thankfully, you were here.

669
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:38,420
Otherwise, I would have
become a burden to my son.

670
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,130
But I've dragged you into this mess.

671
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,730
I am sorry,

672
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:46,100
both to you and to Xingzhou.

673
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,980
Don't be so harsh on yourself.

674
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,210
My family runs an escort agency.

675
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,580
I'm used to traveling and facing hardships.

676
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,470
I'm not just talking

677
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,610
about the present situation.

678
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,580
It's good that I've experienced hardship.

679
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,720
It has allowed me

680
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,810
to finally see

681
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,210
who my true family is,

682
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,980
and who will stay by my side

683
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:16,170
and care for the Cui family
when disaster strikes.

684
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:20,130
It's all in the past.

685
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:23,330
You are Xingzhou's mother.

686
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,420
We are family.

687
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,500
There's no conflict or misunderstanding
within a family

688
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,900
that can't be resolved.

689
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:45,470
My Lord.

690
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,390
My Lord.

691
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:47,430
My Lord.

692
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:50,130
Cui Xingzhou and Shi Yikuan joined forces

693
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,690
and defeated Prince Lu.

694
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,250
My Lord, I have failed in my duties

695
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,690
and beg for your forgiveness.

696
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:59,210
So many days have passed,

697
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,900
and after sending so many assassins,

698
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:03,730
you haven't captured a single person, huh?

699
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,650
I've warned you before

700
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:17,150
that Liu is full of tricks.

701
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,940
You should have been more vigilant.

702
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,150
But time and again,

703
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:23,770
that couple has played you for a fool.

704
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,900
Do you still have the face to see me?

705
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,580
Consort Dowager, please rest well.

706
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,250
Miantang,

707
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:52,290
I'm a bit frightened.

708
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:54,860
Stay with me for a while, will you?

709
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:56,830
Of course.

710
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,330
I'll stay with you.

711
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,420
There's a forest near this kiln.

712
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,460
At this time of year,

713
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:13,130
it's full of bright red berries

714
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,330
that make a delicious tea when boiled.

715
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:16,920
I'll go pick some for you

716
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,980
in the morning.

717
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,210
I'm sure you'll love it.

718
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,500
Now I understand why,

719
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:25,730
despite Xingzhou's high standards

720
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:28,540
and indifference toward women,

721
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:29,900
he chose you

722
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,730
eventually.

723
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,900
What's that sound?

724
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,900
Someone's here.

725
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,440
This kiln has been discovered.

726
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,610
Should we leave?

727
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:49,070
You take care of the Consort Dowager.

728
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,250
- Be quiet.
- All right.

729
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,900
Miantang, be careful.

730
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:21,310
Who's there?

731
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,800
Be careful.

732
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,990
Leave my daughter-in-law alone.

733
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:27,770
- Ma'am.
- I'll fight you.

734
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:30,610
Xingzhou?

735
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:41,900
Xingzhou!

736
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,500
Are you hurt?

737
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,720
Mother,

738
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,020
sorry I'm late.

739
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:52,730
I've made you suffer.

740
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,940
Are you all right?

741
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,420
I'm all right.

742
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,460
We're all fine.

743
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:02,380
Thanks to Miantang,

744
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:04,960
otherwise, we might never

745
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,420
have met again.

746
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,810
Xingzhou,

747
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,540
you've found a wonderful wife.

748
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,860
Lord Huaiyang found Princess Huaisang
before I did.

749
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,420
I was a bit late.

750
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,440
Shouldn't he have been securing the battlefield

751
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,890
and clearing out the remaining enemies?

752
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,330
After defeating Traitor Lu,

753
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:31,250
Cui Xingzhou led a team of elite soldiers

754
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,860
and hurried back to Zhenzhou overnight.

755
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,100
He reunited with his family

756
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:36,770
then returned to the residence.

757
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:40,540
Cui Xingzhou truly moves with remarkable speed.

758
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:42,650
It was my failure.

759
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:44,900
I was unable
to locate Princess Huaisang's hiding place

760
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,810
and could not assist her in time.

761
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,170
Who attacked Zhenzhou?

762
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:50,830
It was the subordinates

763
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:53,290
of Prince Sui and Consort Xian.

764
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,810
Summon Mr. Meng to the court.

765
00:39:58,510 --> 00:39:59,720
Have him send a letter

766
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,860
commanding Cui Xingzhou
to report to the capital immediately

767
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,130
and not to linger in Zhenzhou.

768
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,500
I shall reward him.

769
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

770
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:14,220
(The Mansion of Lord Huaiyang)

771
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:17,650
Lately, Binglan has been in a daze,

772
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,060
smiling foolishly.

773
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,990
She calls everyone she sees "Cousin."

774
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:24,900
If this continues,

775
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:28,420
I fear she might lose her sanity.

776
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:29,950
I…

777
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:36,650
What should I do, Sister?

778
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,100
Say something.

779
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:42,210
I'm not a physician.

780
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,060
How would I know?

781
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,770
We've all suffered this

782
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,940
because of Xingzhou.

783
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:56,650
I'm just an old woman,

784
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,990
and it doesn't matter if I'm humiliated.

785
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,250
But Binglan…

786
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,880
Her reputation is ruined.

787
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,730
Look at the state she's in.

788
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:06,770
How am I supposed to live with this?

789
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,770
Aunt,

790
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,170
Princess Huaiyang is delicate

791
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:12,510
by nature.

792
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:13,720
Please don't scare her

793
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,840
with such

794
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,980
crazy talk.

795
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:20,580
You only care about your new beloved,

796
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,100
but look at your cousin.

797
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:26,100
Look at what she has become.

798
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:31,130
Xingzhou,

799
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:35,540
one must not be ungrateful.

800
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,060
Today, I demand

801
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:40,290
a clear answer from you.

802
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,900
I've told you many times before.

803
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,540
No matter how many times you ask,

804
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,760
my answer remains the same.

805
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,600
In this life,

806
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:58,280
I will only marry Liu Miantang,

807
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,250
and I will never

808
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:02,250
take a concubine.

809
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:09,290
Why don't you kneel

810
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:11,440
and beg Princess Huaisang to be magnanimous

811
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,420
and give you a place in her household?

812
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:18,020
My poor daughter,

813
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:22,330
your merciless cousin won't take you in.

814
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,470
How will you

815
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:26,500
live the rest of your life?

816
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:31,380
Princess Huaisang, please take her in

817
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:33,730
as you would a stray dog or cat.

818
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,590
Binglan will serve you

819
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:37,630
without complaint,

820
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:40,100
bringing you tea and all.

821
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,690
I'm so useless,

822
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:49,760
having no husband

823
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,020
to support me,

824
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:56,390
and even

825
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,770
my sister

826
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,730
refuses to help.

827
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:22,730
I'm willing to exchange my life

828
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:26,500
for Binglan's place.

829
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:30,060
Let me go.

830
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,360
Let go. Princess Huaisang.

831
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,550
I'm begging you.

832
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:33,940
If you do not agree,

833
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:35,110
on your wedding day,

834
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:35,960
we will hang ourselves

835
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:38,130
in front of the mansion.

836
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,420
Aunt.

837
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,760
If you're so determined,

838
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:44,860
then I'll have two coffins prepared for you.

839
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:49,940
I've already given you enough respect.

840
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:52,860
Sister.

841
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,670
Is this the fine son you've raised?

842
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:56,860
Enough.

843
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:10,430
Mother,

844
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,060
this ends here.

845
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,150
Binglan.

846
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:22,840
Look at her. Will she end her life?

847
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:23,680
Enough.

848
00:44:24,590 --> 00:44:25,980
If she truly intended to take her life,

849
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:27,540
why didn't you go after her?

850
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,560
Sister.

851
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:36,380
All of you, please leave.

852
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:39,810
