But

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,500
will your mother

16
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,890
agree?

17
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,170
You can rest assured.

18
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,890
I can handle my household.

19
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,050
And my mother

20
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,780
does not interfere in this matter.

21
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,050
Then I can rest assured.

22
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,880
When do we set off?

23
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,720
Set off?

24
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,480
Where to?

25
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,460
To transport grain.

26
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,340
Transport grain?

27
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,460
My Lord, you see.

28
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:21,100
Our family runs a porcelain shop.

29
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:22,950
We...

30
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,500
We don't have grain.

31
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,220
I have gathered the grain.

32
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,830
I am appointed by Lord Huaiyang to supervise

33
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:30,810
the provisions.

34
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,620
I want to borrow some goodwill

35
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,620
to use the trade guild's convoy

36
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,260
to assist with the transportation.

37
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,460
Assisting with transportation of grain?

38
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,140
This matter,

39
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,540
on a small scale,

40
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,500
is a trivial matter.

41
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,180
On a larger scale,

42
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,100
it's a significant contribution.

43
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,820
We will be family in the future anyway.

44
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,020
- Yes.
- Good.

45
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,740
- Family?
- Family.

46
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,340
According to etiquette,

47
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,020
we are not yet family.

48
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,020
But for you and Zhen,

49
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,940
isn't it only a matter of time?

50
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,300
Moreover,

51
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,300
it'll give me an excuse

52
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,380
to explain it to the trade guild, right?

53
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,540
What do you say?

54
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,940
(Auspice and Fortune)
Slow down, Mr. He.

55
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,100
The lives and blood of the common people.

56
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,740
The soldiers wrapped in their own armor.

57
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,140
Our Lingquan merchants rely

58
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,580
on the protection of the kingdom.

59
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,460
If we can't repay the country,

60
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,460
what use is it?

61
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:42,820
Yes.

62
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,180
You and I

63
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,260
have no excuse.

64
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,860
Yes.

65
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,700
Do you want me to go

66
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,740
with Lord Zhennan?

67
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,020
You go back

68
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,700
and reallocate manpower.

69
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,740
Hurry and go.

70
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,580
Hurry up.

71
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,340
- Let's go.
- Goodbye.

72
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,060
Goodbye.

73
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,500
Zhen.

74
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,020
Father.

75
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,220
I can deliver

76
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,300
the provisions,

77
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,260
but if you still want to sell me,

78
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,020
I'm not willing.

79
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,900
Marriage is a match

80
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,340
made in heaven.

81
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,300
How did it become a transaction?

82
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,980
You can marry the Lord

83
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,340
and enjoy a good life.

84
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,660
Our family can also change its status.

85
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,260
What's wrong with that?

86
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,140
If the Lord is willing

87
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,140
to promise this,

88
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,980
why aren't you willing?

89
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,260
Yes.

90
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,660
I'm a thousand times unwilling.

91
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,500
You...

92
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,260
You don't want to marry the Lord

93
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,860
as his wife?

94
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,140
If I must marry,

95
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,100
I would not marry such a person.

96
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,060
I know his character too well.

97
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,060
Father, he...

98
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,020
No need to say more.

99
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,100
You have

100
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,300
to marry Lord Zhennan.

101
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,980
This is non-negotiable.

102
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,620
For the sake of our family,

103
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,780
you have to marry.

104
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,780
You must marry.

105
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,340
Everyone, quiet down.

106
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,820
Quiet down and listen to me.

107
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,740
Listen to me.

108
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,260
The war ahead is perilous.

109
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,740
The commander has ordered

110
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,620
not to proceed.

111
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,220
Let us pass.

112
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,710
Why can't we pass?

113
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,220
Why not?

114
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,660
These women don't understand the big picture.

115
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,740
Actually, not letting them proceed

116
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,100
is for their own good.

117
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,340
Everyone.

118
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,740
Madam.

119
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,140
I understand your anxiety

120
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,980
about the war and your concern

121
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,180
about your loved ones.

122
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,980
But as you can see,

123
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,460
with the war ahead,

124
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,820
the military order is in place.

125
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,460
We've already arrived.

126
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,740
Talking more is useless.

127
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,740
Why not use your energy

128
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:03,940
for the right purpose?

129
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,100
That sounds nice,

130
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,020
but we can't fight in the war.

131
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,100
What's the right purpose?

132
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,060
Exactly. We're old and weak.

133
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:10,980
What can we do?

134
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,460
My husband used

135
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,380
to be a weak scholar

136
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,020
who spent all day at home on arts.

137
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,580
But with the war imminent,

138
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,340
he resolutely went to the battlefield.

139
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,860
Since the men of Zhenzhou

140
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,900
can fight and die for the country,

141
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,780
who says that the women of Zhenzhou

142
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,900
can't stabilize the rear

143
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,300
and contribute to the warfare?

144
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,460
How can we help?

145
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,580
We can stay here.

146
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,500
We can clean up the houses,

147
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,420
collect food, and find physicians and medicine.

148
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,660
If they're short of anything,

149
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,700
we can help provide it.

150
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,100
If they get injured,

151
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,260
we can offer them a place to rest and heal.

152
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,540
This way, those soldiers will know

153
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,140
that their loved ones

154
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,380
won't distract them

155
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,460
from their desire to fight.

156
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,700
Instead, we are a strong shield for them,

157
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,780
closely connected.

158
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,500
Let's go back.

159
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,420
Even if the men die in battle,

160
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,420
we will wipe our tears

161
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,340
and bring them home.

162
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:23,220
(Carriage and Horses)

163
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,220
Miss, the carriages
and horses have been checked.

164
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,260
Please take a look.

165
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,500
Get ready to set off.

166
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,700
Yes.

167
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,300
In the past few days, thanks to Miss He,

168
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:58,220
the grain transportation has gone smoothly.

169
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,660
Lady He?

170
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,500
Lord Zhao.

171
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,460
I am just a merchant's daughter.

172
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,980
I don't deserve the title

173
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,340
of Lady He.

174
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,540
You do deserve it.

175
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,620
If there's nothing else, let's set off.

176
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,140
What else needs to be settled?

177
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,300
The merchant's daughter

178
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,660
should check all the expenses

179
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,140
on this trip.

180
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:24,980
That's all I can do.

181
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,060
Unlike you noble lords,

182
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,300
born into wealth.

183
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,180
Miss He, your words are biased.

184
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,980
If I had a choice,

185
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,420
I would rather be a commoner,

186
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,940
choosing to be a physician

187
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,300
or a soldier if I want.

188
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,020
That's an easy thing to say.

189
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,980
You're a lord,

190
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,940
so you can choose what you want to do.

191
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,380
Common people don't have such options.

192
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,620
I will handle the tasks given to me

193
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,980
by the trade guild,

194
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,500
but I disagree with what my father

195
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:09,900
wants you to promise.

196
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,260
I can't do that.

197
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,220
I see.

198
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,140
Miss, rest assured.

199
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,860
When the time comes, I will deny it.

200
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,180
This matter

201
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,540
is your father's wishful thinking.

202
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,300
I am merely going with him.

203
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,740
It's all for the sake of the border war.

204
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,980
All the coercion

205
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,420
and deception.

206
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,460
You and Lord Huaiyang

207
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,860
are the same kind of people

208
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,740
who use the people.

209
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,700
For your own gain,

210
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,860
you'll use others.

211
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,060
How have I deceived?

212
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,540
Your father was deluded

213
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,940
and caused trouble.

214
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,540
Even if I am foolish or vile,

215
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,180
I wouldn't make a joke out of this matter.

216
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,180
Moreover,

217
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,140
are the provisions for my benefit?

218
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,540
I also want to be an idle person at home.

219
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,180
Do you think I want

220
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,260
to deal with those who prioritize profit?

221
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,260
Don't speak ill of my family.

222
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,380
I just said it.

223
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,220
Lingquan merchants

224
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,100
wouldn't make the transportation so smooth

225
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,190
for the sake of Zhenzhou

226
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,500
and the court, right?

227
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,020
Won!

228
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:25,810
Mr. He.

229
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,820
Mr. He, how can you still eat at this time?

230
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,260
What's the hurry?

231
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,660
Early this morning,
we received news from the capital.

232
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,980
Lord Huaiyang is leading the army to war

233
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,420
because the court wants to kill him.

234
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,700
With no funds, food, and reinforcements,

235
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,300
victory is impossible.

236
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,180
If that's the case,

237
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,220
our merchant convoy

238
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,220
is doomed.

239
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,300
Is this true?

240
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,220
Absolutely true.

241
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,460
Quickly.

242
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,380
Call your sister back.

243
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,100
No matter what,

244
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,180
the convoy cannot leave.

245
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:01,050
Go!

246
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,860
There's no time to lose.

247
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,660
You can't leave!

248
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,780
You can't leave! Stop!

249
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,140
This battle is doomed.

250
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,540
You're heading to your death.

251
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,060
Set off immediately!

252
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:23,900
Set off what?

253
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,820
My Lord,

254
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:27,980
are you leading

255
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,340
the trade guild into a fire pit?

256
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,180
- Lord Huaiyang...
- Shut up!

257
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,540
This cannot be discussed publicly.

258
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:35,940
Tell Father.

259
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,700
Merchants keep their promises.

260
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,060
The convoy must leave.

261
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,500
It was Father who told you to return.

262
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,700
Are you defying him?

263
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,700
Zhen.

264
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,500
He Zhen!

265
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,060
Alright.

266
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,100
Dare not to speak the truth?

267
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,300
Let me say it.

268
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,620
Everyone, listen up.

269
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,140
- Cover his mouth.
- This battle...

270
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,300
Everyone, continue.

271
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,060
Miss He.

272
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,500
You should go back too.

273
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,060
The guild has let me in charge

274
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,020
of the escort.

275
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,700
I must lead them out

276
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,500
and bring them back safely.

277
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,140
What if your brother

278
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,700
was telling the truth?

279
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,100
Merchant women

280
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,620
also have integrity.

281
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,620
The soldiers of Zhenzhou fear nothing.

282
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,700
What is there for me to fear?

283
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:36,820
Alright.

284
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,180
Let's set off.

285
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,740
Prepare to set off.

286
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,580
- Sure.
- Sure.

287
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,220
There is no space left here.

288
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,980
You'll have to find another way.

289
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,140
Isn't there a spot there?

290
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,460
That's for the coachman.

291
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,340
I'm the coachman.

292
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:02,410
You?

293
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,940
I supervise the grain.

294
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,420
I must lead by example.

295
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,980
You don't think

296
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,500
that I was pampered since childhood

297
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,700
and am unable to do anything, right?

298
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,220
Lady He.

299
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,300
Get on the carriage.

300
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,340
Why are you crying?

301
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,100
So annoying.

302
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,260
Your Wen is a cook.

303
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,740
Naturally, you are not worried.

304
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,340
Who said that?

305
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,540
The cook is also in the army.

306
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,020
If the battle gets fierce,

307
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,420
who cares if you cook

308
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,460
or handle horses?

309
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,740
What if my husband dies?

310
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,260
What will I do?

311
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,340
Don't worry.

312
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,420
No one will die today.

313
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,940
No one will die?

314
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,660
This war has dragged on for so long.

315
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,740
Seems the enemy leader, A Gushan,

316
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,140
is not only brave

317
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,980
but also a strategist.

318
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,300
If he's a skilled strategist,

319
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,340
the first battle

320
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,220
against a rival will be a test

321
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,420
to demonstrate power.

322
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,460
So, this first battle

323
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,740
might not happen.

324
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,220
Might not happen?

325
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,500
If they fight the moment they meet,

326
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,580
that's a village brawl,

327
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,620
not a war.

328
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,940
(Jinjia Pass)

329
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,260
Go back and mourn your mother.

330
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,020
Go back and mourn your mother.

331
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,700
What are they shouting?

332
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,300
You know their language. Translate it.

333
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,860
The western tribes

334
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,940
are wishing your mother good health

335
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:36,900
and a long life.

336
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,460
Is that what it means?

337
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,260
In our first meeting,

338
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,660
we can't lose our manners.

339
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,500
Besides their mother,

340
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:45,860
send regards

341
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,980
to their fathers,

342
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,220
and grandparents as well.

343
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,220
Yes.

344
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,380
A good general

345
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,460
will be preparing

346
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,260
to hold his ground in this battle.

347
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,500
They won't launch a decisive attack

348
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,540
until the time is right.

349
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,300
They are traveling day and night.

350
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,740
Isn't it because Lord Huaiyang

351
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,060
is eager for a decisive battle?

352
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,300
No.

353
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,660
From what I've heard

354
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,900
these past few days

355
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,820
about the arrangements,

356
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,340
it seems Lord Huaiyang intends

357
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,460
to wear out the enemy.

358
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,620
(The Art of War by Sun Tzu)

359
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,740
Continue to extend greetings.

360
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,700
Yes.

361
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,700
(Jinjia Pass)
Greetings to your mom.

362
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,540
Go back and mourn your mother.

363
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:25,980
General,

364
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,620
A Gushan intends to retreat.

365
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,140
He is certain that it'll take long,

366
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,500
dividing and conquering in their own territory.

367
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,340
That's why he placed us here.

368
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,140
Thus,

369
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,060
in this operation,

370
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,380
the main army is moving urgently,

371
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,900
not to fight immediately,

372
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,460
but to respond to the court's military orders.

373
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,980
We must hold on.

374
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,980
Grain and supplies

375
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,420
will gradually arrive.

376
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,460
They'll be prepared before the war.

377
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,220
It's done.

378
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,580
- Thank you.
- Rest now.

379
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,060
The tent is cool.

380
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,620
I've made a fire for you.

381
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,100
I'm not afraid of the cold.

382
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,300
I'm a physician.

383
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,020
Follow my medical advice.

384
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,220
If you catch a chill,

385
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,220
I'll need to give you acupuncture.

386
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,140
In the past,

387
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,540
I had a female patient who was

388
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,180
afraid of the cold

389
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,220
and had been in poor health.

390
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,860
One night,

391
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,980
she knocked on my door for a consultation.

392
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,860
I took one look at her

393
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,500
and closed the door.

394
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,180
Why?

395
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,740
Was she a beautiful woman?

396
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,700
Were you afraid

397
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,420
of ruining your reputation

398
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,700
or of losing control?

399
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,700
She had a red string tied to her wrist.

400
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,180
In Zhenzhou customs,

401
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,380
only the deceased are buried

402
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,020
with a red string.

403
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,220
I'm also from Zhenzhou.

404
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,980
How come I've never heard of this?

405
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,260
I'm not lying to you.

406
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,020
Don't believe me? Look.

407
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,100
Boring.

408
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,500
You're not scared by this?

409
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,420
You're so bold.

410
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,060
Let me tell you another one.

411
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,380
Try saying another word.

412
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,780
Where did you get the bones?

413
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,660
Zhao Quan, you...

414
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,700
Aren't you bold?

415
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,540
Stop!

416
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,100
- Now you're a patrol guard.
- Give me it.

417
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,180
It'll be more convenient

418
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,060
to visit the madam.

419
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,940
And the relatives will be safer too.

420
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,060
After this while,

421
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,060
it's quite orderly here.

422
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,180
Thanks to the madam's

423
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,660
coordination and arrangements.

424
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,620
If there are sick women,

425
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,060
the madam even lends her carriage

426
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,980
to take them to the village to see a physician.

427
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:27,220
Here, the madam

428
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,820
can be considered a commander too.

429
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:41,620
(Medicine)

430
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,340
Why is there a pharmacy here?

431
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,020
The madam opened it.

432
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,940
They've traveled a long way.

433
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,620
Most suffer from the change in environment.

434
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,460
(Medicine)
So, the madam started

435
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,860
a pharmacy to help everyone
with their troubles.

436
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,900
Mrs. Wen, everything you wanted is here.

437
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,020
Thank you, Mrs. Cui.

438
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,900
It's thanks to your pharmacy.

439
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,380
Honey, why are you here?

440
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,260
The Lord sent me to inspect.

441
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,220
I passed by.

442
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,100
We were wondering

443
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,300
what kind of handsome man Mr. Cui must be

444
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,060
to marry such a good wife.

445
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,140
Seeing you today,

446
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,820
you really are a fine gentleman.

447
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,300
You're indeed fortunate.

448
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,500
You can often see your husband.

449
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,020
I don't know

450
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,580
when Wen will come back.

451
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,340
I won't delay your reunion any longer.

452
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,540
I hope Mr. Cui

453
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,980
will take care of Wen in the army.

454
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,540
He's the cook Wen Shisan.

455
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,180
Everyone knows him.

456
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,020
Of course.

457
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,500
I'll leave it to you.

458
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,460
I'll go back first.

459
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,820
Take care.

460
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,140
I came here just to tell you

461
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,780
not to work too hard.

462
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,420
I'll continue my patrol.

463
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:57,940
Honey.

464
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,300
You too.

465
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,900
Where did you come from?

466
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,420
Occupying my house and acting so brazenly.

467
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,700
How dare you?

468
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,700
You don't belong here.

469
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,140
How dare you cause trouble here?

470
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,380
This land has always been
part of my outer estate.

471
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,340
It was managed by servants before.

472
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,380
After the war began,

473
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,860
the servants fled with their families.

474
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,380
The house was left empty.

475
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,140
Not only did you occupy my house,

476
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,380
but you also ruined it.

477
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,780
I haven't even settled accounts with you.

478
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,340
What are you shouting about?

479
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,700
You know there's a war going on.

480
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,220
Let me tell you.

481
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,420
This is the territory of the Qi Kingdom.

482
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,660
Exactly.

483
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,620
Your tribes will be driven out.

484
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,900
What use is your land deed?

485
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,740
It was valid before.

486
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,500
But it's no longer valid now.

487
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:04,860
Hand it over.

488
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,420
Give it to me.

489
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,900
How can you rob?

490
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,940
Are you alright?

491
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,340
Madam.

492
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,540
Physician.

493
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,540
Is there a resident physician?

494
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,460
Quick, save our madam.

495
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,020
Our village doesn't have a physician.

496
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,380
Take her to another place.

497
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,220
Don't delay.

498
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,540
Madam, given the current chaotic war situation,

499
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,900
we really can't get to a faraway place.

500
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,620
And within several miles,

501
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,660
there's only this pharmacy open.

502
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,540
Please, help us

503
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,300
and save my madam.

504
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,140
I can prepare a stabilizing medicine

505
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,460
according to the medical book,

506
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,460
but I'm not sure

507
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,660
whether it'll work.

508
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:41,900
What should we do?

509
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,660
Don't you Qi people always say,

510
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,980
"Treat a dead horse as if it were alive"?

511
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,620
Let's get her into the house.

512
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,900
Nanny Li, lend a hand.

513
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,820
She looks like she's about to give birth.

514
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,940
Why is your madam

515
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,340
traveling at such a time,

516
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,420
with imminent childbirth?

517
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,700
Where is the child's father?

518
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,340
You speak the mandarin so well.

519
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,500
You must've lived here for a long time.

520
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,260
If you're here to seek help from family,

521
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,540
I can inquire for you.

522
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,100
I don't have any relatives.

523
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,140
At the moment,

524
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,740
you have no other place to go.

525
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,100
Since that house is yours,

526
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,500
you can stay here for now.

527
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,340
I'm Lin Siyue.

528
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:04,660
What about you?

529
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,460
It's Liu Miantang.

530
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,020
You've helped me today.

531
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,620
I'll certainly repay you.

532
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,660
It's late and cold.

533
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,940
I warmed a pot of wine for you.

534
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,060
I don't want it.

535
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,780
I came to sincerely apologize.

536
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,180
I'll come in.

537
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,820
I specially warmed it for you.

538
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,580
Just have a sip.

539
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,220
What's wrong?

540
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,140
Afraid the wine will make you

541
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,860
think of something inappropriate?

542
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,300
Don't worry.

543
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,460
I can control myself.

544
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,340
What a joke.

545
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,100
You're good at drinking.

546
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,100
No wonder Mr. He said

547
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,380
that you're more generous

548
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,500
and broad-minded

549
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,340
than ordinary men.

550
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,500
In that case,

551
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,860
I'm relieved.

552
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,340
Relieved of what?

553
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,540
If there are any ghosts or wild beasts here,

554
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,620
you'll surely protect me.

555
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,940
The dignified Lord Zhennan

556
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,500
speaks and acts

557
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,180
so out of composure.

558
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,420
What does composure mean?

559
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,260
Like Lord Huaiyang,

560
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,660
always with a stern face,

561
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,660
directing the nation's affairs?

562
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,100
Do you like men like that?

563
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,580
Of course not.

564
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,620
What did you

565
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,540
put in my wine?

566
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,060
Just a little powder

567
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,060
to make you obedient.

568
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,220
I warn you.

569
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,820
If you dare touch me,

570
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,540
I'll...

571
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,780
I'll kill you.

572
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,060
I'm waiting.

573
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,220
Zhao Quan.

574
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,100
Zhao Quan, you...

575
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,740
Stop the carriage.

576
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,420
Miss, you're awake.

577
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,980
Where are we going?

578
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:28,940
Miss,

579
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,860
we're heading to Lingquan Town.

580
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,260
We're already on the official road.

581
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:33,940
And Zhao...

582
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:36,620
Where is the Lord?

583
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,300
The Lord has gone to Jinjia Pass

584
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,900
with a few guards and a supply convoy.

585
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:42,780
Miss, rest assured.

586
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:45,340
The Lord instructed me to take you
back to Lingquan Town

587
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,700
to avoid worrying your father.

588
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,300
He left on his own?

589
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:20,340
(Feitang Valley)

590
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:27,940
My Lord.

591
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,620
The war is coming.

592
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,900
The ones with families
have come to bid farewell.

593
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,340
It's been a long time,

594
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,660
but the madam only saw you once.

595
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,980
- You...
- Enough.

596
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,380
Come back.

597
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,460
Yes.

598
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:48,820
Prepare the horse?

599
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,140
I need to tell her everything

600
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,780
so she

601
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,260
can know sooner

602
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,300
and not get more deeply entangled.

603
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,300
You go in first.

604
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,500
Call out Nanny Li.

605
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:20,780
Go.

606
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,700
Yes.

607
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,100
(Medicine)

608
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,180
Nanny Li, Nanny Li.

609
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,220
Please step outside.

610
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,060
What's the matter?

611
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,860
What's going on?

612
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,380
Today, it seems the Lord

613
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,940
is going to confess to the madam.

614
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:41,980
What?

615
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,540
What a sin.

616
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,300
You're back.

617
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,940
Dear, why aren't you eating?

618
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,100
I'm not hungry.

619
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,180
You haven't eaten home food for a while.

620
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,300
Nanny Li's cooking is good.

621
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,140
You should eat more.

622
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,420
Dear, stop with the medicine.

623
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,620
Come on. Sit here.

624
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,980
I have something to tell you.

625
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:39,260
You're not a physician.

626
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,580
There isn't a proper assistant in the store.

627
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,180
How can you prepare medicine for people?

628
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,380
I still have the medical book

629
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,300
given by Mr. Zhao.

630
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,460
Moreover,

631
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,740
a patient is also a physician.

632
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,620
I have at least a little medical skill.

633
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,860
Besides, I don't handle serious illnesses.

634
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,060
I send them to the towns

635
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,660
or Xizhou clinics.

636
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,780
What about the pregnant woman?

637
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,820
She's a pitiful person.

638
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,180
Deceived by a man's sweet talk,

639
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,980
she came here alone,

640
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,980
thinking she was the lady of the house.

641
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,180
In fact, she was a mistress

642
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,580
kept outside by that man.

643
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,180
That unfaithful man also is a merchant.

644
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,420
What do you mean by "also"?

645
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,660
Just like us.

646
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,620
That man is hateful.

647
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,020
He used the pretense of business

648
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,580
to deceive both women.

649
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,500
She realized the truth
when her belly grew large.

650
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,900
In a fit of anger, she proposed divorce.

651
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:47,780
I find you seem quite sympathetic toward her.

652
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,420
I admire her.

653
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:52,300
In such a disgraceful and absurd situation,

654
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,100
she neither compromised

655
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,740
nor was blinded by love.

656
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,940
Instead, she wrote
a divorce letter for her husband.

657
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,860
She forged her own path.

658
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,700
What are you looking at me for?

659
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,780
Honey, speak honestly.

660
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,380
What exactly is your current position?

661
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,740
Why do the village soldiers

662
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,860
not recognize

663
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,220
any centurions named Cui Jiu?

664
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:24,820
Dear.

665
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,820
I am Lord Huaiyang.

666
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,100
You're eating

667
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,100
without telling me.

668
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,580
Physician Zhao.

669
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,380
Ms. Liu is also here.

670
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:33,980
Sit down.

671
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,900
You two are enjoying yourselves,

672
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,860
making so much good food

673
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,060
and not inviting me.

674
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,500
What are you doing here?

675
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,180
I also joined the army.

676
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,780
I'm a military physician now.

677
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,860
My title is inferior

678
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,700
to this centurion who divorced his wife.

679
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,700
Do you know about his divorce?

680
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,300
How broad-minded of you

681
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,620
to tell everything.

682
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,300
He knows his mistake

683
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,900
and has torn up the divorce letter.

684
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,980
For my sake...

685
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,580
You can't forgive him.

686
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,020
Let's write one too.

687
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,340
I'll get you a brush and ink.

688
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,700
- Let's write.
- What? Sit down.

689
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,060
He just loves to joke around.

690
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,060
I'm not joking.

691
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,420
Weren't you here to drink with me?

692
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,340
Dear, see if there's any wine available.

693
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,340
I'll drink with him until we're drunk.

694
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:33,020
I see you also like to joke.

695
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,780
Everything's a mess here.

696
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,060
Where can there be a wine shop?

697
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:41,100
But at the Wen family's place,

698
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,060
there might be some.

699
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,740
Her husband is a cook.

700
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:44,580
I'll go and check.

701
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,420
Alright, alright.

702
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:47,580
Thank you, Mrs. Cui.

703
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,900
I talked too much.

704
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,420
Still pretending?

705
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,420
I have to pretend

706
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,540
because of you.

707
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,260
Then promise me one thing.

708
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,100
What?

709
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,940
Next time when you tell her,

710
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,140
stay away from me.

711
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:16,300
I'm afraid of getting splashed with blood.

712
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,980
Then don't come for drinks.

713
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,020
Go away.

714
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,380
I'm hungry.

715
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,060
Can I use her bowl?

716
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,900
That bowl has a murderous aura.

717
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,020
Madam.

718
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,460
Madam.

719
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,580
Madam, where is the master?

720
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,900
Is he alright?

721
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:45,940
He's fine.

722
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,060
Physician Zhao is here.

723
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,140
They were just talking

724
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,180
about drinking.

725
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,500
That's good.

726
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:54,980
Where's Nanny Li?

727
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,100
She might have gone back to Zhenzhou.

728
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,260
Why are you speaking nonsense

729
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,820
like Physician Zhao?

730
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,580
Have some tea.

731
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,100
Thank you, dear.

732
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,500
Physician Zhao

733
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,140
really has no restraint.

734
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:45,300
After a few sips, he was already tearful,

735
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,380
talking about how you'd be

736
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,860
at peace even if you died

737
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,420
for the country,

738
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,220
as Lord Huaiyang would take care of me.

739
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,420
If it weren't for you,

740
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,580
I'd really want to slap him.

741
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,140
Actually, he's not wrong.

742
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,740
The Lord is benevolent

743
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,060
and loves his people.

744
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,100
The Lord will take care

745
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,860
of the widows and orphans.

746
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,820
You really are devoted

747
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,780
to your lord.

748
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,420
In the end,

749
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,020
you are all the same.

750
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,340
What do you mean by that?

751
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,260
The Lord broke off his engagement
with Ms. Lian.

752
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,980
You left a divorce letter.

753
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,420
You

754
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,620
are all such people,

755
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,500
using the pretense of serving the country

756
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,740
to dispose of women

757
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,700
according to your own wishes.

758
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:43,940
You're better by correcting

759
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,060
your mistakes.

760
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,460
The Lord is much worse than you.

761
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,340
What did the Lord do?

762
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,820
I've heard that the Lord's romantic scandals

763
00:37:58,820 --> 00:37:59,700
are quite numerous.

764
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,260
Despite having a fiancée for a long time,

765
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,620
he still flirts with other women.

766
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,540
This causes Miss He to be anxious.

767
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,340
From what I see,

768
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,540
besides Miss He,

769
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,740
there must be many innocent women

770
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,300
whose feelings he has toyed with.

771
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,100
Dear.

772
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,980
What if the Lord realizes his mistake?

773
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,180
The Lord has grown up in luxury and prestige,

774
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,740
adored by everyone.

775
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,620
He's always been high up

776
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,620
and doesn't understand

777
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,100
how to respect women,

778
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,260
nor does he empathize with their feelings.

779
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,540
He won't admit he's wrong.

780
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:38,620
Stop defending your lord.

781
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:41,980
By the way, honey.

782
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,540
Before Mr. Zhao arrived,

783
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,100
you mentioned you were Lord Huaiyang?

784
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,940
I'm Lord Huaiyang's

785
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,100
patrol guard.

786
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:06,140
We are a confidential unit

787
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,260
responsible for intelligence gathering.

788
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,620
Dear, it's getting late.

789
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,780
I should take him back first.

790
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,380
Cui Xingzhou.

791
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,260
(How are you?
Mother)

792
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,260
Why did I leave

793
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:41,260
that soft, fragrant couch?

794
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,660
Why have I returned to this shabby place?

795
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:45,860
It's quite a beautiful thought.

796
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,980
I slept for a few hours.

797
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,940
Just over an hour or so.

798
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:57,860
What?

799
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,140
To sober up.

800
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,620
So many family letters.

801
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,060
You're awake now.

802
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,420
Come on. Sit down.

803
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,100
Awake, right?

804
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,380
Come on. Take a look.

805
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,020
What?

806
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,980
Half of this says

807
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:31,700
that I am

808
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,220
impulsive and authoritative,

809
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,900
breaking off

810
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,140
the engagement

811
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,780
without informing my venerable mother.

812
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:41,060
The sky of Aunt Lian's family
has almost collapsed.

813
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:43,060
And Cousin Lian

814
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:45,180
is crying all day long.

815
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:46,980
If I don't clear up

816
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,260
these misunderstandings,

817
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,700
she will never marry.

818
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:50,820
Something like this.

819
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,460
In that case,

820
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,380
Cousin Lian must have

821
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,540
deep feelings for you.

822
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,100
Don't be too perfunctory.

823
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,300
Am I perfunctory?

824
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,020
Zhao Quan, look at the words here.

825
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:08,380
It's obvious that my aunt

826
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,140
polished my mother's words.

827
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,700
Even so,

828
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,940
doesn't that show that they

829
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,260
care about you?

830
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,020
Think about me.

831
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,780
The lady I was engaged to

832
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,180
didn't care about me at all.

833
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,260
When it came time for marriage,

834
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:24,100
she...

835
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,500
Forget it.

836
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:26,740
Enough about me.

837
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,180
I'm too angry.

838
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,460
You're ungrateful in the midst of blessing.

839
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,420
Is this a blessing?

840
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,260
Fine. If it's a blessing, I'll give it to you.

841
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,700
You'll give them the job

842
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,100
and money the Lian family asks for.

843
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,340
Let me tell you. From now on,

844
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,860
my aunt can come
to your house daily to interfere

845
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:49,900
with your official duties,

846
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,700
your family, and your personal life.

847
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:52,980
I'm not Lord Huaiyang.

848
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:54,980
Why give it to me?

849
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,180
Give me something nice.

850
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,860
Let me tell you. I've figured it out.

851
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,300
The Lian family is

852
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:13,020
ungrateful.

853
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,540
Marrying one of them means
marrying the whole family.

854
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:18,740
Aren't you tolerant?

855
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,860
- It's yours.
- I don't want it.

856
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,420
This is your family matter.

857
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,900
You need to sort it out.

858
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:26,660
Otherwise,

859
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,660
you'll never be able to explain things

860
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:30,140
to Liu Miantang.

861
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,500
Move aside. Move aside.

862
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:46,500
I'm at the edge.

863
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,420
Where else can I go?

864
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:01,580
(Mother)

865
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:06,660
So aloof.

866
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,660
Cousin Lian will be heartbroken again.

867
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:11,620
Heartbroken?

868
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,540
It's better than holding on

869
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,380
to pointless hope every day.

870
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:21,220
(So)

871
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:22,180
How will you

872
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,940
confess to Liu Miantang?

873
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:24,900
Confess what?

874
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:26,740
I'm not confessing.

875
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:27,780
Why?

876
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:32,740
You're right.

877
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,740
Before I confess to her,

878
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:37,700
I have to handle

879
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,500
