(Shenwei Escort Agency)

15
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,150
Be gentle.

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,840
Mr. Lu.

17
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:02,740
Brothers, from today onwards,
the Escort Agency will have a new owner.

18
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,620
Mr. Lu here renames it
to Liangxin Escort Agency.

19
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,940
It will no longer have any relation
to the Qiao Family.

20
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,880
Miss Liu,
you mentioned yesterday

21
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,710
that you wanted to eat Vinegar Pig Trotter
from Lingnan.

22
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,850
I prepared it early this morning.

23
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,230
Please try it.

24
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:25,730
I just mentioned it casually.
Mrs. Lin, you are so considerate.

25
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,340
Your grandfather always says you are too thin.

26
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,130
Now that the escort agency has been sold,
we should add more meat dishes to the table.

27
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,810
What? Is the taste not authentic?

28
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,100
It's too authentic.

29
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,970
Is this sweet vinegar from...

30
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,180
Lingnan.

31
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:49,130
I searched the market.

32
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,250
At first,
I didn't find any sweet vinegar from Lingnan.

33
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:57,500
I thought of mixing brown sugar
with aged vinegar as you mentioned.

34
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,380
But guess what? An hour later,

35
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,620
a peddler chased
after several shops to find me.

36
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,850
He said he happened to have sweet vinegar
from Lingnan, and it wasn't expensive.

37
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:14,730
How lucky I am
to have encountered such a thing?

38
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:21,620
Mrs. Lin, do you know
how to make Rouge Goose Breast?

39
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,130
Rouge Goose Breast?

40
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,710
Yes.

41
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,040
My lord, in my opinion, you've spoiled Ms. Liu.

42
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,150
Her taste is too picky.

43
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,660
Black-maned goose with white eyes.

44
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:39,730
The servant from the Qiao Family specifically
asked for this goose.

45
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,970
But I searched the market in Beizhou
for a whole day

46
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,410
and couldn't find any.

47
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,130
My lord, should we substitute it
with another goose?

48
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:02,740
(Lord Beizhou's Mansion)

49
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,050
He came to chat with me for half a day
and left with a goose?

50
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,260
What exactly is he trying to do?

51
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,780
Perhaps they are not used
to the food in Beizhou.

52
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,950
The two subordinates
that Lord Huaiyang brought along

53
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,990
have been browsing the market
in Beizhou these past few days.

54
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,660
Who would have thought he is a gourmet?

55
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,050
Rouge Goose Breast.

56
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,850
What a plump goose.

57
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,820
I asked you to buy something tasty,
and you really went all out.

58
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,050
Mr. Qiao, this goose isn't expensive.

59
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,030
Nonsense, I have transported rare birds before.

60
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:52,370
For poultry of this quality,
it would cost at least 2,000 coins.

61
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,610
Two thousand?

62
00:04:56,150 --> 00:05:00,290
That could feed my family of five
for quite a few days.

63
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,630
Miantang,

64
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,930
you are used to a life
of luxury in the capital.

65
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,170
But this is Beizhou.
We can't afford such extravagance.

66
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:10,990
I think...

67
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,970
How about I contribute some money
to the household?

68
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,820
Aunt, you worry too much.

69
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,100
Mrs. Lin said this goose only costs 200 coins.

70
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,100
Two hundred coins per 500 grams?

71
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,730
For the whole goose.
That's how the hunter sells it.

72
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,780
The meat is very fresh.

73
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,160
It really is delicious.

74
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,050
This goose is so good.

75
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,720
Eat more.

76
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,040
Grandfather.

77
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:39,260
Buy one more tomorrow and stew it.

78
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,970
Eat it.

79
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,550
Father.

80
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,820
This Cui Xingzhou is taking advantage of me.

81
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:07,160
Didn't you say that Lord Huaiyang wouldn't

82
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,200
have a good time at Lord Beizhou's Mansion?

83
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,790
Now he takes delicacies
from the Lord Beizhou's Mansion every day.

84
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,970
He even gets to eat a black-maned goose.

85
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,080
My lord, you said it yourself.

86
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,970
Who said that?

87
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:32,700
Youzhou can be equal to Beizhou
and Qizhou today

88
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,900
thanks to my decades of effort.

89
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,760
I absolutely cannot watch Beizhou
take advantage

90
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,900
and leave Youzhou far behind.

91
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:47,630
Listen carefully.

92
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,810
The reports on Beizhou will change
from once every three days

93
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,030
to three times a day.

94
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:57,530
If Lord Beizhou makes any move,
you must report it immediately by fast horse.

95
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,220
Yes, my lord.

96
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:07,460
My master enjoyed the goose yesterday
and asked me to buy another one.

97
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,960
Give it to me.

98
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:18,020
You can't leave without selling the goose.
How will you explain it when you go back?

99
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:32,170
Mr. Fan, that beard doesn't suit your face.

100
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,050
I'll be careful next time.

101
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,780
He actually dared to come to Beizhou.

102
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,020
Ms. Liu, you must be joking.

103
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,580
His Lordship fights battles
all over the country.

104
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,260
This time he came to Beizhou

105
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,970
- on official business.
- Official business?

106
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:54,460
Then how does he know what I like to eat?

107
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,080
Did he have a shadow guard by my side

108
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,490
or bribe some servant
to report to him?

109
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:06,530
No, no, no. It's just a coincidence.

110
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,260
I don't believe it.

111
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:16,660
But it's out of good intentions,
not to poison or trouble you.

112
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,460
Knowing you love this,
His Lordship personally found it for you.

113
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:29,960
Ms. Liu, please, show some kindness
and don't ask anymore. I...

114
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,700
Hu,

115
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,850
great job.

116
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:46,970
Also, my lord,

117
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:53,830
Ms. Liu bought the goose
at double the usual price.

118
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,650
- Good.
- And she also

119
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,340
paid the price difference for the goose
that the servant bought a few days ago.

120
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,460
Then she asked me to send you a message.

121
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,730
She said...
she has nothing to do with you anymore.

122
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,130
My lord,
this is the money from selling the goose.

123
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,100
What... did she say?

124
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,610
She, she...

125
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:29,060
She said she has nothing to do with you anymore
and doesn't want to owe you any favors.

126
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,180
- Leave.
- Alright.

127
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:39,550
Xingzhou.

128
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,800
Xingzhou.

129
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,880
Well, it's not a good time.
I will come back later.

130
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,340
You stay.

131
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,340
Grandfather, what are you doing?

132
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,540
Do you remember?

133
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:10,060
When you were little,
you loved to swing here the most.

134
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:17,180
But I was worried every day
that you would fall and get hurt.

135
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:24,490
But you just laughed and said you wanted
to be like a bird.

136
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:31,490
Only by flying high could you see the scenery
outside the courtyard.

137
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:39,970
At that time,
I knew that this home couldn't keep you.

138
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,250
Now you have grown up.

139
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:53,540
Do you know why I rebuilt this swing
for you today?

140
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,180
You once used the swing to advise me

141
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,700
that life is not a smooth path.

142
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,650
It has its ups and downs,
and honors and humiliations.

143
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:08,180
I've remembered all of your words.

144
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,800
Have you eaten?

145
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,060
I don't have much appetite.

146
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,890
Why have you become so delicate?

147
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:24,770
When you were little,
you even chewed on the bowl while eating.

148
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,100
You always joke with me.

149
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,250
Look at how thin you are, how unsightly.

150
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,970
Take this,
and buy something good to eat tomorrow.

151
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,080
I can't accept this.

152
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,820
As I said,

153
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,320
the Escort Agency sold for a good price,
so you don't need to save for me.

154
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,700
A girl should be pampered.

155
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,460
So she can find a suitable husband early.

156
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,940
I'm satisfied with you, Grandfather.

157
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,220
Married life can't be as comfortable
as the days now.

158
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,350
Nonsense.

159
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,820
Your future is still uncertain.

160
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,560
I can't eat or sleep well.
Are you satisfied already?

161
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,370
Who said my future is uncertain?

162
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:13,100
Grandfather,
there is something I must confess to you.

163
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:18,340
It says here that Ms. Liu hasn't purchased
any property in Beizhou.

164
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,770
That's impossible.

165
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:28,460
Given her personality,
if she stayed quietly at home for three days,

166
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,100
the sun would rise from the west.

167
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,610
Do you really understand her?

168
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:35,100
I think you are overthinking it.

169
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,300
The Qiao Family's financial situation
is worsening.

170
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,460
The Shenwei Escort Agency has also changed
ownership and name.

171
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:48,250
The buyer is a man named Lu Zhong.

172
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,650
He's young, but his offer is quite generous.

173
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:02,060
They sold off family assets to make ends meet.

174
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,820
How can you laugh about this?

175
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,540
Liu Miantang arranged all of this.

176
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:13,340
By doing this, she helped the Qiao Family

177
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:17,550
and also preserved her Grandfather's dignity.

178
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:18,850
How do you know this?

179
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:20,250
Lu Zhong.

180
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:23,420
What? Lu Zhong is your man?

181
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:32,320
Now that I have the Escort Agency,
I can support myself with my own hands.

182
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,030
Respecting the elders and standing firm

183
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:39,130
in this world is already the best outcome.

184
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,650
Ms. Liu is loyal and righteous,
and she has a talent for business.

185
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:57,970
Lord Huaiyang,
you're not that important to her anymore.

186
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:02,180
True friends do not speak empty words.

187
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:08,130
Such a woman is remarkable wherever she goes.
Why should she depend on you?

188
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,610
It's just like the principle of drinking tea.

189
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:15,970
People need to drink water
when they are thirsty.

190
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:20,490
I've never heard of water needing people.

191
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:30,430
Fine, I admit it.

192
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:35,250
I need her.

193
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:43,300
(Liangxin Escort Agency)

194
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,040
Please.

195
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,280
- Congratulations.
- Please.

196
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,990
- Congratulations, congratulations.
- Please.

197
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,730
- Congratulations.
- Please come inside.

198
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:51,850
Please come in.

199
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,520
Please come inside.

200
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,640
Uncle, you take care of things here.
I'll be right back.

201
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:02,970
Grandfather.

202
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,220
Since you're here,
why not come in and have a seat?

203
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:12,060
I... I was just passing by
and thought I'd take a look.

204
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:19,820
I've been at this Escort Agency for decades.
I won't go in.

205
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,010
Alright,
if you don't want to go in, then don't.

206
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,010
But recently,

207
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,980
I hired new craftsmen
to renovate and repair this building.

208
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,890
There are a few places
where I'm unsure how to refurbish.

209
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:32,250
Grandfather, you have a lot of experience.
Why not give me some advice?

210
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,490
Alright, I'll take a look for you.

211
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,180
Let's go.

212
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,240
Please come inside.

213
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,590
Father.

214
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,240
Master Qiao.

215
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,650
Not bad, not bad.

216
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,940
It's really quite good.

217
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:57,590
Today, your new Escort Agency just opened,
and there are so many guests to host.

218
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,680
I'll head back first.

219
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,540
Father, all the guests are already seated.
They're all waiting for you.

220
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:09,180
Have you all conspired
to trick me into coming here?

221
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,220
Where's Lu Zhong? Why didn't he come along?

222
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,960
Maybe he's outside. I'll go get him.

223
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,730
It's alright. I'll go.
You entertain the guests first.

224
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,820
Let her manage the Escort Agency for now.

225
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:28,700
Once she's had enough,
our business will have turned around.

226
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:32,280
We still need to find Miantang a good husband.

227
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,710
Father, you know Miantang's temperament.

228
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:39,610
No, think about your sister.
If we always let her have her way,

229
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,890
sooner or later, trouble will come knocking.

230
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,190
That's right.

231
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,880
What are you doing here?

232
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:57,950
Rude!

233
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,960
How can you be so disrespectful
to Lord Huaiyang?

234
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,800
Moru.

235
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,450
Today, the Liangxin Escort Agency
opens as scheduled.

236
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,580
I have also prepared a small gift
to express my goodwill.

237
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,690
Lord Huaiyang,
I advise you to give up on Miantang.

238
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,830
She doesn't want to see you.

239
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:17,340
Is she engaged with someone?

240
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,590
That's right.

241
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,100
What if I don't leave?

242
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,170
Then don't blame me for being rude to you.

243
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,070
Be careful.

244
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,740
You are still no match for me.

245
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,410
Don't bring trouble upon yourself.

246
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,840
You, you...

247
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,680
Honey.

248
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,740
The guests have all arrived.
Why aren't you going in?

249
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,170
Your arm...

250
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,440
I...

251
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,540
Did you get into a fight?

252
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,680
It's only been a few months, and yet you...

253
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,690
Is it not enough to injure him, Lord Huaiyang?
Do you also want to bully us?

254
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,690
I'll take you to apply some medicine, honey.

255
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:12,980
(Hall of Benevolent Rule)

256
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:17,630
Miantang.

257
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,690
Did you get hurt just now?

258
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:29,340
If you encounter that person again,
don't be so reckless.

259
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:31,930
You are not his match, understand?

260
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,990
Your archery skills are impressive, my lord.

261
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,820
Um, you've been practicing all afternoon.
How about taking a break?

262
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,210
- I'm worried...
- Not tired.

263
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,130
I'm worried the target won't hold up.

264
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,200
Replace it with a new one.

265
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,800
Yes.

266
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:20,000
From now on,
words like marriage and flower arch...

267
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,600
In any case,
the word "marriage"

268
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,850
must not be mentioned again.

269
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,020
Yes.

270
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,820
Go, go, go.

271
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:32,920
(Wumei Courtyard)

272
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,020
- My lord.
- My lord.

273
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,170
The flower arch you asked me
to order has arrived.

274
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,820
We'll set it up in the backyard.

275
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,580
Later, we can plant some flowers
or graft spring willows.

276
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,270
Couldn't you say something else?

277
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,110
What did I say?

278
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,410
You really just won't go away.

279
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:12,980
How can you speak to me like that?

280
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,780
Grandfather, I wasn't speaking to you.

281
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:20,740
There are mosquitoes buzzing around me.
I can't get rid of them.

282
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,540
Are you referring to mosquitoes or a man?

283
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:31,930
Come to my study.
There are no mosquitoes there.

284
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:42,500
Miantang, you have managed
the Escort Agency so well.

285
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,580
Since you have the skills and ambition
to do business,

286
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:49,850
I will support you to go out.

287
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,160
You are the closest elder to me in this world.

288
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,780
If you don't support me, who else will?

289
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,300
I have prepared dowries
for both you and Qingying.

290
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,980
Even when the family was tight-handed,
I never touched it.

291
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,370
This is the largest one, for you.

292
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,880
But when I got married,
you already gave me one.

293
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,160
I was always afraid you wouldn't suffer
in the capital,

294
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,470
or be mistreated by the Cui Family.

295
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,780
So I prepared it.

296
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:21,650
When you hastily got married,
I didn't feel good about it.

297
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,640
You disliked the Cui Family in the capital
and fled to Mount Yang.

298
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,690
I don't blame you.

299
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,020
Grandfather.

300
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:33,060
Let bygones be bygones.

301
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,850
From now on, I will find you a good husband.

302
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:41,130
Didn't you just say you support me
in managing the Escort Agency?

303
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,930
Business and marriage are irrelevant.

304
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,170
A woman, after all, needs to get married.

305
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,880
In a few days, I'll find you a good matchmaker.

306
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,340
We'll choose a good husband.
He's not necessarily wealthy.

307
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,020
We must find someone with good character
who knows how to care for you

308
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,400
and supports you in doing business.

309
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:08,370
If so, I will have no regrets in this life.

310
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:16,500
(Rice)

311
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,760
Alright, let's go.

312
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,450
- Let's go.
- Let's go, let's set off.

313
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,820
I got hit.

314
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,610
- Are you alright?
- They hit me.

315
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,900
- They hit me.
- Come and see.

316
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,450
They hit me.

317
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,670
They hit me.

318
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,760
- Let go.
- They...

319
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,610
You dog. Ignore him. Let him here.

320
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,980
Neighbors, please help me.

321
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,170
- They hit me.
- Let go of me.

322
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:51,500
And they insulted me in public.

323
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,790
- You...
- They cursed him.

324
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,230
They refused to apologize.

325
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,460
What nonsense are you talking about?

326
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,790
Now he wants to beat me.

327
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:57,820
You can't beat him.

328
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,030
What are you doing?

329
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,890
- We can't let them go.
- I...

330
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,110
Let's go.

331
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,000
- You wanna leave?
- What are you doing?

332
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,130
Not until we allow it.

333
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,920
We absolutely cannot let them go.

334
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,260
I... He...

335
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:10,630
Let go of him.

336
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,720
Let go of him.

337
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,210
I can't take it anymore.

338
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,850
You all, I...

339
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,450
I didn't hit anyone.

340
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:24,550
What? Cui Xingzhou extorted people in public.
What happened next?

341
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,170
Then they started fighting.

342
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,540
The constables from the Prefecture's Office came
and took both parties away.

343
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,850
What about Cui Xingzhou?

344
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,360
Lord Huaiyang is fine.

345
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,680
He didn't show up. He commanded it.

346
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,740
Who was the other side?

347
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,930
Rice buyers.

348
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,370
Unbelievable guy.

349
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,540
Ridiculous, utterly ridiculous.

350
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,040
Uncle.

351
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,580
The Huizhou Branch has sent
over the account books.

352
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,780
Lu Zhong found me a good manager.
He was very diligent and hardworking.

353
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,370
Where are Lu Zhong and Lu Yi?

354
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,690
At the Prefecture's Office.

355
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,740
After buying rice,
they hit someone with the cart.

356
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,340
Was it serious?

357
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:17,780
Not at all.

358
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,340
But the person they hit
was Cui Xingzhou's shadow guard.

359
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:23,020
He extorted them.

360
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,700
Miantang, what kind of trick
is Lord Huaiyang playing?

361
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,890
Is he trying to cut
off our business?

362
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,780
Lord Huaiyang is a very petty person.

363
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:37,020
A while ago,
Lu Zhong had some minor conflicts with him.

364
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:40,210
But Uncle, don't worry too much.
His target is me.

365
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:42,390
I believe the constables
won't make things difficult

366
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:44,020
for Lu Zhong and Lu Yi.

367
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,850
If he's targeting you, I'm even more worried.

368
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,650
He can't outwit me.

369
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,020
I hope so.

370
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,370
By the way,
I heard he's acting on the Emperor's order

371
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,500
to summon Lord You to the capital.

372
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,580
For some reason, he took a detour to Beizhou.

373
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,740
He just can't give up on you.

374
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:12,890
If he gets any closer,
he'll just be inviting more humiliation.

375
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:25,210
It's been just a few days,
and you've got quite the business going.

376
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:30,780
I thought I had made myself clear enough.

377
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,580
You're right.

378
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:38,450
There was indeed nothing
between us until today.

379
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,890
Until today?

380
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,540
Today,

381
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,100
I...

382
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:56,590
I am here at your Liangxin Escort Agency
to request an escort service.

383
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,100
But I want you
to personally handle this escort.

384
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:06,170
What do you need us to escort?

385
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,780
I want to escort myself.

386
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,410
My lord, you must be joking.

387
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,020
Do you really need such protection?

388
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,980
Then let me be frank.

389
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:32,340
I came to Beizhou without any armor or weapons.

390
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,730
I only brought two subordinates,

391
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,930
and today they were even taken
to the Government Office.

392
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,890
I am constantly worried about my safety.

393
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,820
I can't eat or sleep.

394
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,450
This is the deposit.

395
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,780
You just need to accompany me
whenever I leave my residence.

396
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:54,410
Once this escort is completed,
there will be a generous reward.

397
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,760
Absurd.

398
00:26:57,230 --> 00:26:59,300
We will definitely not accept this escort,
Lord Huaiyang.

399
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,540
Please find someone else.

400
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:02,630
Wait.

401
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,370
I can take this escort.

402
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:12,310
But Lord Huaiyang, you're of noble status.

403
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:15,580
For someone of your stature,
this amount is not enough.

404
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:19,350
Triple the escort fee, and I'll take it.

405
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,720
Deal.

406
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:32,360
Lord Huaiyang went
to a newly opened Escort Agency

407
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,440
to request an escort.

408
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,510
He paid a hefty sum
to ensure his personal safety.

409
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,080
Moreover,
I found out that the two people

410
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:40,170
he previously swindled were also
from this Escort Agency.

411
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,850
What on earth is he trying to do?

412
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,210
Is it a diversion,
or is there another scheme at play?

413
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,660
Previously,
he searched the entire city for gourmet food.

414
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,350
Was it not to satisfy his appetite?

415
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,410
But rather...

416
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,850
To familiarize himself with the layout of Beizhou?

417
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:04,540
Is he planning to escape
or does he have evil intentions on Beizhou?

418
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,360
Investigate the background
of that Escort Agency.

419
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,030
Increase surveillance on Cui Xingzhou.
He must not leave Beizhou.

420
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:12,870
Yes.

421
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,130
Enjoy, sir.

422
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,200
Thank you.

423
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,150
Mian...

424
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,040
Ms. Liu.

425
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,020
What important matter do you have today,
my lord?

426
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:50,060
I am going to... observe the public life.

427
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:01,980
(Tea)

428
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,070
Don't be discouraged, sir.

429
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,170
Do come again to have fun.

430
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,930
Ring toss! Ten rings for one silver coin.

431
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,390
Sir.

432
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,040
Consider it borrowed.

433
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,760
Here, sir.

434
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:25,630
Thank you.

435
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:26,550
Here are your rings.

436
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,520
You men either play rings or set rings.
Nothing new.

437
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,910
Which one do you want? Tell me.

438
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,540
I can get what I want myself.

439
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:46,040
Then go ahead and get it yourself.
I support you.

440
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,340
Who cares about your bamboo rings?

441
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,020
Bye, sir.

442
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:56,060
(Grain)

443
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,290
Strolling and playing around,

444
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:07,340
is this what you call
"observing the public life"?

445
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,580
Candied Hawthorn.

446
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,440
I don't eat it.

447
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,350
I want you

448
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,680
to hold it for me.

449
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,500
My lord, manners.

450
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,540
There is a catkin on it.
I wanted to help you remove it.

451
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,890
You misunderstand.

452
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:57,020
It... it was just an instinctive reaction
of a martial artist.

453
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:00,310
You couldn't even dodge that move?

454
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,610
I never intended to defend...

455
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:09,410
After all, I paid and hired you to protect me.

456
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,210
Is that so?

457
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:13,780
Then why do I feel you hired me
for another purpose?

458
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,890
I do have another purpose.

459
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,740
I hired you for another purpose.

460
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:30,260
I came to Beizhou for another purpose as well.

461
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,890
My lord,
why are you going to such great lengths?

462
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,850
What is your intention?

463
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:40,820
I just want to figure out what I need to do
to get your forgiveness.

464
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:44,880
Then teach me. How can a young woman,

465
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,650
who was deceived by a former enemy for so long,
with her reputation ruined,

466
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,370
not be angry and upset?

467
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:55,150
Back then, you were seriously injured.

468
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,070
Wasn't it me who saved you?
Wasn't it me who healed you?

469
00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:00,930
So, you owe me your life at least.

470
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:03,240
According to you,
you deceived me for so long,

471
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,740
and I should reward you
and thank you for your great kindness.

472
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,750
Before I went to war,

473
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:12,820
I wanted you to live a peaceful life,
so I wrote the divorce letter.

474
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,150
But Miantang,

475
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:20,540
my identity was fake and it was my fault
for deceiving you.

476
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:26,300
But my feelings for you were never fake, right?

477
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,780
I never doubted your feelings.

478
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,100
But because of these feelings,
our relationship...

479
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,130
It's getting late.
I'll escort you back to the mansion.

480
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,290
A bodyguard's duty is only
to ensure your safety,

481
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,820
not to engage in idle chatter.

482
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,340
Come on, it won't hurt to chat a little.

483
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:55,580
My lord, in the past few days,
Lord Huaiyang has shown no unusual behavior.

484
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,370
He just wandered around the city casually.

485
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:00,060
However, that female bodyguard
has quite a background.

486
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:01,590
Tell me quickly.

487
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:04,100
This woman is named Liu Miantang.

488
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:06,540
She and her uncle Qiao Xian both
received an imperial pardon.

489
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:09,780
It is said that they worked for the Emperor
before he took the throne.

490
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,340
But a few days ago,
they returned to Beizhou

491
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,300
and focused solely
on running the Escort Agency.

492
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,370
So, she is the Emperor's supporter.

493
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,020
It seems Cui Xingzhou
and that woman are birds of a feather.

494
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,930
I knew Cui Xingzhou's trip wasn't that simple.

495
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,110
Keep a close watch on them.

496
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,060
If there's any unusual movement,
take them down immediately.

497
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,520
Yes.

498
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,350
That's not good.
The Beizhou border is just ahead.

499
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,060
Report it to His Lordship.

500
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,200
Yes.

501
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:08,380
(Beizhou)

502
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,810
Actually,

503
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,650
I agreed to take this escort mission
and be your bodyguard

504
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,250
because I also wanted
to tell you some heartfelt words.

505
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:22,650
I admire you and understand your difficulties.

506
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:27,860
But I also have my ambitions.

507
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:34,130
Two strong horses on different paths
can only meet on a narrow road.

508
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:39,280
Instead of forcing them
to share the same trough,

509
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:45,020
it's better to let them go their separate ways
from now on and forget each other.

510
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:54,100
Cui Xingzhou,
there is no future between us anymore.

511
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:06,060
What if I want to fight for a future?

512
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,460
(Youzhou)

513
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,940
I can cross the boundary
and go away if I want to.

514
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:23,830
Can you?

515
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,730
You're carrying heavy shackles
and are too proud to give up anything.

516
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,130
What makes you think you can fight?

517
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,460
(Beizhou)

518
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,210
Can I fight now?

519
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,100
Madman.

520
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,330
- Go quickly.
- Alright.

521
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,240
My lord.

522
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,720
My lord.

523
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,590
Lord Beizhou suddenly
dispatched a large number of troops

524
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,250
to follow Cui Xingzhou to the Beizhou border.

525
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:26,170
I knew it. I knew it.

526
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,580
That man from Beizhou may want to
get to the capital first.

527
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,940
How can we let him take the advantage?

528
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:36,170
Saddle my horse, the fastest one.

529
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,160
Yes.

530
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:41,580
Cui Xingzhou, you are so bold.

531
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:46,170
Anger harms the liver.
My lord, there's no need to get so worked up.

532
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,900
Today, you broke your promise and left Beizhou.
What exactly are you planning?

533
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,980
This is a misunderstanding.

534
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,100
You have so many spies watching my every move.

535
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,240
Recently, more personnel have been assigned

536
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,980
to keep watch day and night.

537
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,810
You should be well aware
that I didn't even bring my subordinates.

538
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:05,920
If I really wanted to escape from your Beizhou,

539
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,590
could you bring me back without any fighting?

540
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:11,460
Then how do you explain
that suspicious female bodyguard by your side?

541
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,580
She...

542
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:17,470
I'll bring her here immediately
for a thorough interrogation.

543
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:19,720
I want to see what you two are up to.

544
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,560
No.

545
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,380
Are you finally scared?

546
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,800
Let them all leave. It's personal.

547
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,170
You can speak now.

548
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:49,540
She is actually my fiancée.

549
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:53,210
We had a little disagreement,
so she went back to her grandfather's home.

550
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,100
Besides having official duties
from the imperial court,

551
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:00,810
I do have a personal matter
that's hard to explain.

552
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,170
I need to make up with her.

553
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,770
You're talking nonsense.

554
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:10,320
How could the dignified Lord Huaiyang
marry a woman from such a lowly family?

555
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,290
Don't say that.

556
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,380
Liu Miantang is the wife I have chosen.

557
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,100
She was in the past,
and she will be in the future.

558
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:22,880
When I was in Zhenzhou,
I pampered her in Lingquan Town.

559
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,310
When I went to battles, I kept her by my side.

560
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:31,630
Now, I'm using the escort mission
as an excuse to get close to her.

561
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:33,360
If you don't believe me,
investigate it yourself.

562
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,200
Fine.

563
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,080
Fine.

564
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,500
I will find the truth.

565
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:40,440
If you truly are a bold romantic,

566
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,940
I will respect you as a man.

567
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,720
But until the matter is clarified,
you must stay in my residence.

568
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,210
- You can't go anywhere.
- Alright.

569
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,940
Even if you want to drive me away,
you won't be able to.

570
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,200
Guards!

571
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,080
- My lord.
- My lord.

572
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,580
Escort Lord Huaiyang to the South Wing Room
and keep a close watch.

573
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,060
Without my orders,
no one is allowed to approach.

574
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:04,510
- Yes, my lord.
- Yes, my lord.

575
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:11,900
Ma'am, come take a look.

576
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,360
Candied Hawthorn.

577
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,060
Ma'am, take a look.

578
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:24,590
Not bad.

579
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,780
I'll give you a discount.

580
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:33,290
The poetic scenery is in early spring.

581
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,250
The green willows are just half yellow.

582
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,020
When the flowers
in the forest bloom like brocade,

583
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:44,170
everyone who goes out will be a flower viewer.

584
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:51,020
Each flower is spirited and each leaf tender.

585
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:56,210
The fragrance after the rain intoxicates.

586
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,460
But what did these flowers do wrong?

587
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,290
It seems Ms. Liu is not interested in flowers.

588
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:14,170
Then, what about me?

589
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,330
I usually don't bother with others.

590
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:25,290
But today, seeing Mr. Su,
I suddenly feel an impulse to punch something.

591
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:34,860
It seems that in Ms. Liu's heart,
I am somewhat different.

592
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,670
If you weren't the future virtuous
son-in-law chosen

593
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:40,170
by my second uncle,

594
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:44,380
I would definitely show you
how it feels to be different today.

595
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,240
Please.

596
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,470
Your niece Miantang has just opened
a new Escort Agency.

597
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:59,730
What's it called?

598
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,810
Liangxin Escort Agency.

599
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:03,720
What a name.

600
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,980
It's a great name.

601
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:09,130
My family's fabric business
also runs the Xizhou route.

602
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:15,380
The staff said that Liangxin Escort Agency
is cost-efficient and fast.

603
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,860
Right.

604
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:22,810
Madam Su,
why do you keep asking about Miantang?

605
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:26,770
Isn't it Qingying that you're interested in?

606
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:28,100
Naturally.

607
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:33,380
But soon, we'll be family,
so it's good to know each other.

608
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,730
Only after they get married can we be family.

609
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:41,460
Madam Su, are you really set on our Qingying?

610
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:43,020
Of course.

611
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:48,170
My son likes the straightforward young lady.

612
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,780
The last time he came to your house,
he saw Miantang

613
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,860
managing the household in an orderly manner.

614
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,290
When he got home,
he kept praising her,

615
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:01,330
saying that the Qiao Family's daughter
has a mind of her own.

616
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:05,060
Yes, she is indeed very opinionated.

617
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,110
What do you mean by that?

618
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:12,290
Alright, let's not talk about Miantang.

619
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,460
Why can't we talk about her?

620
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,390
Miantang's mother passed away early,

621
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:19,460
and she has been spoiled
and willful since childhood.

622
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,990
She was sent back home
after being divorced

623
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:24,100
because her husband's family
couldn't stand her temperament.

624
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:32,250
Alright, it's my fault for asking too much.

625
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:33,760
Have some wine.

626
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,720
Here.

627
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:38,650
The jar is empty.

628
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,860
I'll ask the innkeeper to bring some more.

629
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,540
Thank you, Madam Su.

630
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:53,980
Come on,
whose father didn't help his own daughter?

631
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:56,770
Why are you so grumpy
when it comes to Miantang?

632
00:42:57,030 --> 00:42:59,540
Can you watch your mouth?

633
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,170
Do you even know what you said?

634
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:03,860
What did I say?

635
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,940
I'm just stating the facts.

636
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:09,650
If she weren't so headstrong,
would they have divorced her?

637
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:16,100
