=Episode 16=

14
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,430
Honey, you've changed.

15
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,500
Why aren't you soaking?

16
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,570
I'm a little drunk.

17
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,340
I need to rest for a while.

18
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:19,830
Honey.

19
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,810
This peaceful and quiet time

20
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,380
feels somewhat unreal

21
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,850
compared to the recent days.

22
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,380
It's good that it's finally over.

23
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,250
Spending time with you these days,

24
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,800
I feel that you are

25
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,550
much more responsible

26
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,850
and ambitious than I imagined.

27
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,040
When we were in Lingquan Town,

28
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,470
I really thought you were

29
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,250
a Go enthusiast without care about the family.

30
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,000
Though I am the ninth child

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,130
in the family,

32
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,660
I am the only legitimate son.

33
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,500
When my father was alive,

34
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,730
he had high hopes for me.

35
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,760
My aunts and brothers

36
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,630
were waiting to see

37
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,850
if I was worthy of taking

38
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,810
on the family business.

39
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,780
I don't

40
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,660
remember all that now.

41
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,940
Before I was born,

42
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,240
Mother had

43
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,530
a hard time at home,

44
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,250
suffering and enduring much hardship.

45
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,180
After I was born,

46
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,110
she endured even more,

47
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,180
keeping a low profile

48
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,010
and being extremely careful

49
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,900
to ensure I grew up safely.

50
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,900
Over the years,

51
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,060
Mother must have had a very tough time.

52
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,920
Yes.

53
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,410
I can only be a good legitimate son,

54
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,920
making no mistakes,

55
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,810
to be recognized by everyone,

56
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,940
and to be worthy of her hard work.

57
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,430
You're still young,

58
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,780
bearing the weight of this family.

59
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,570
Isn't it exhausting?

60
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,850
But with you by my side,

61
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,620
I don't feel as tired.

62
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,690
Looks like I'm your lucky star.

63
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,410
How will you thank me?

64
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:34,610
What's wrong, honey?

65
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,780
I think I might've strained the injury.

66
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,700
Does the hot spring help? I'll try.

67
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,480
Honey, enjoy the soak.

68
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,820
I'll go change first.

69
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,140
Well.

70
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,260
Sorry to interrupt your pleasant time,

71
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,830
but there's an urgent matter.

72
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,100
You need to return.

73
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,360
I understand.

74
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,710
My husband is changing.

75
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,140
Physician Zhao, please wait a moment.

76
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,440
The military affairs are pressing,

77
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,820
so I have to disturb you.

78
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,220
That's more important.

79
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,730
Ms. Liu, you look quite well.

80
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,660
It seems the hot spring in this valley

81
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,370
is indeed very effective.

82
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,270
After soaking,

83
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,050
I feel my hands are much stronger.

84
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,020
Don't get too happy too soon.

85
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,760
Severe injuries like yours

86
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,930
still take time to recover.

87
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,480
If you use too much force,

88
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,170
it might aggravate the old injuries.

89
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,050
How is he?

90
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,480
After soaking in the hot spring

91
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,410
and drinking the wine you taught me to make,

92
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,530
he looks much better.

93
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,900
The medicinal wine is so effective.

94
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,340
Tomorrow I'll make

95
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,290
another batch of herbs for him.

96
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,850
A whole batch seems excessive.

97
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,530
Is there something wrong?

98
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,560
He drinks so fast.

99
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,660
He might want more.

100
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,220
May I ask

101
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,050
how much did he drink?

102
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:45,580
Just that pot.

103
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,930
He drank the whole pot.

104
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:48,850
Did he drink it all?

105
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,290
Did he

106
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,410
have any reactions?

107
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,660
His face was red.

108
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:06,370
He was sweating profusely.

109
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,370
But sweating after drinking is normal.

110
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,140
Ms. Liu,

111
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,260
I didn't make it clear earlier

112
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,000
Though this medicinal wine

113
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,220
helps with qi and blood,

114
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,900
it shouldn't be consumed in excess.

115
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,220
Normally,

116
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,610
this much daily

117
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,460
is sufficient.

118
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,370
What happens if you drink too much?

119
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,220
As you mentioned.

120
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,460
Red face and sweating.

121
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,010
It depletes vital energy

122
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,010
and is bad for the body.

123
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,000
Come on.

124
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,460
Prepare the horse.

125
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,460
Take the madam back.

126
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,430
Yes.

127
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:58,970
You go down first.

128
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,580
I'll be there soon.

129
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,850
There's something

130
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,010
I haven't told you.

131
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,850
If you're upset, it's fine

132
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,650
- if you don't tell me.
- Not the same.

133
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,100
Give me some time.

134
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,540
Once the war is over,

135
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:23,670
when we return,

136
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,970
I'll tell you everything.

137
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,850
The wine is good.

138
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,310
My Lord.

139
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,310
After all night,

140
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,650
A Gushan has finally spoken.

141
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,220
But he says he won't confess
unless he sees you.

142
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,280
Let's go.

143
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,730
I heard you wanted to see me.

144
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,890
Cui Xingzhou.

145
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,220
Cui Xingzhou.

146
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,770
I command elite troops,

147
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,180
far superior to your troops.

148
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,280
Yet, I was defeated by you

149
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,650
due to a single mistake.

150
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,610
I'm not here today

151
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:01,990
to listen to your grievances

152
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:03,340
about the defeat.

153
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,830
If you haven't figured out

154
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,060
what you need to confess,

155
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,560
I have time to wait

156
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,130
for you to think it through.

157
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,850
This battle wasn't a provocation from my side.

158
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,220
The events have unfolded to this point.

159
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,600
The officials of your country

160
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,890
are also to blame.

161
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,800
You're here.

162
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,420
I came to see you and the child.

163
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,180
How are you?

164
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,610
Childbirth is like walking

165
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,540
on the edge of the underworld.

166
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,640
Ms. Lin.

167
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,850
I have something to ask you.

168
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,580
If I tell you the truth,

169
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,630
can you ensure I won't die?

170
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,940
The decision is up to His Majesty.

171
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,770
I will report what you say truthfully.

172
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,890
If everything you say is true,

173
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,850
you might receive a lighter punishment.

174
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,490
Good.

175
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,730
I'll speak.

176
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,490
I was the adopted son of the former Wolf Lord.

177
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,370
To obtain the boundless wealth

178
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:23,300
of the western tribes,

179
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,220
I killed him.

180
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:31,940
The former Wolf Lord is dead now.

181
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,700
The western tribes and Mount Tiebei

182
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,490
are now under my control.

183
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:41,180
So you are the new Wolf Lord.

184
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,240
Nice to meet you.

185
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,490
I'll be straightforward.

186
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,920
I came here to discuss

187
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,270
the iron ore business

188
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:50,460
of Mount Tiebei.

189
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,490
That person led a raid

190
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,100
and slaughtered my brothers.

191
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,010
If I don't avenge them,

192
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,730
I'm unworthy to be the Wolf Lord.

193
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,890
Is that why you invaded my country?

194
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,780
You Qi people broke the agreement first,

195
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,680
so you should pay the price.

196
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,060
Is what you just said

197
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,890
all true?

198
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,130
If there's a single lie,

199
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,180
may I be torn apart by five horses

200
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,940
and die a miserable death.

201
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:38,750
What you said before

202
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,510
is the common language in our tribes.

203
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:42,100
The accent is almost perfect.

204
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:44,370
Unless you have lived in the tribes
for a long time

205
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,540
or have dealt with people from the tribes,

206
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,700
you wouldn't have learned so well.

207
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,230
I've never heard of our kingdom

208
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:58,130
having an iron trade with the western tribes.

209
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,400
Cui Xingzhou,

210
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,460
this must be taken seriously.

211
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,580
Iron mine has always belonged to the court.

212
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,920
Private trade is a serious taboo.

213
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,700
It's considered treason.

214
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,200
How could a mere governor of Xizhou City

215
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,250
dare to do this?

216
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:17,420
This must not be his doing alone.

217
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,060
There must be a major backing him.

218
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,240
He's secretly managing

219
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,650
a large-scale iron ore trade,

220
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,230
even resorting to a disastrous war

221
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,300
to cover up everything.

222
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,650
The key is where the black iron

223
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,010
that entered our kingdom

224
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,250
ended up.

225
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,180
The western tribes are brave

226
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:40,940
and will revenge.

227
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,870
It's precisely because

228
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,250
they saw their brothers killed

229
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,890
that they fought with their lives in this war.

230
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,630
Empress Dowager Wu deliberately

231
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,100
pushed you into a dead-end.

232
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,550
The western tribes

233
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,650
have become her death warriors.

234
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,580
I'm afraid she

235
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,060
is also kept in the dark.

236
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,540
(Sealed in Xuanwen's second year)

237
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,890
Be careful.

238
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,850
One tree can't survive.

239
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,300
A lone wolf is lost.

240
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,130
A solitary tree cannot survive.

241
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,970
A lone wolf cannot run.

242
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,820
It's better to recite it

243
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,250
in our language.

244
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,970
The wolf is the most loyal animal.

245
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,540
On the wasteland,

246
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,010
wolves travel in pairs.

247
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,370
They only have one partner in their lifetime.

248
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,820
If the partner dies,

249
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,770
the wolf will not live alone.

250
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,220
Did I wake you by covering you with a blanket?

251
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,300
Honey, I just fell asleep.

252
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,580
I saw you frowning all the time.

253
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:09,710
Had a nightmare?

254
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:11,590
No.

255
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,700
I'm just a bit tired.

256
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,920
Honey.

257
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,080
What will you do

258
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,220
to the prisoners?

259
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,300
Why do you suddenly care?

260
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,770
Yesterday,

261
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,100
when I returned to the village with Mrs. Wen,

262
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,700
we saw a group of prisoners.

263
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,230
They talked about it on the way,

264
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,490
and I was a bit curious.

265
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,960
Those boundless rumors

266
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,010
scared you.

267
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,920
The handling of prisoners

268
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,540
depends on the court's decision.

269
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,990
If peace talks are held,

270
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,460
they might not be executed.

271
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,440
Those collaborators

272
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,100
will definitely be executed and displayed.

273
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,820
For worse crimes, their families

274
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,250
will be implicated.

275
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,610
What's this?

276
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,300
Today, a wolf

277
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:08,850
accidentally entered the camp.

278
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,820
They captured it.

279
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,470
The wolf's tail is very hard.

280
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,550
Perfect for making a brush

281
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,650
for you to practice writing.

282
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,150
Is this

283
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,890
made of the wolf's tail?

284
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,720
Don't like it?

285
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,680
It's not that.

286
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,780
I just heard

287
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,020
in the wasteland, wolves travel in pairs.

288
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,930
If one is captured and killed,

289
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,210
their partner cannot live alone.

290
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,610
I also know that wolves are revered here.

291
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,300
It was released.

292
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,210
Don't worry about it.

293
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,710
I just suddenly remembered

294
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,500
this saying I heard before.

295
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,610
You seem quite familiar with this place.

296
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,500
Today, Nanny Li told me that you

297
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,340
learned the tribe's language.

298
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:55,740
What?

299
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,690
How to say the brush?

300
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,540
Of course, I don't know.

301
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,270
I only know

302
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,210
a few simple phrases.

303
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,260
Honey, what's wrong?

304
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,120
I noticed you

305
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,210
look unwell.

306
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,930
You need to rest well.

307
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,740
I'll leave early later.

308
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,210
There's military business tonight.

309
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,100
I'll take care of myself.

310
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,450
Don't worry.

311
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,040
My Lord.

312
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,100
There's news from Xizhou.

313
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,000
Tell me.

314
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,640
A Gushan has been defeated

315
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,930
and captured by Lord Huaiyang.

316
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,260
The situation

317
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,850
may change.

318
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,440
My Lord,

319
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,740
when we led the troops for a surprise attack,

320
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,960
we caused A Gushan to lose control and invade.

321
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,710
We wanted them to suffer from the war

322
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,850
and wipe out the clues to the iron business.

323
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,480
This was a perfect plan.

324
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,610
A Gushan is an incompetent fool.

325
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,310
I'm worried that if Cui Xingzhou

326
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,850
continues to investigate,

327
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,020
the Mount Tiebei business

328
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,650
might come to light.

329
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,260
That day will never come.

330
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,210
Let Yun'er handle it properly.

331
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,100
As for the Mount Tiebei,

332
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,260
it ends here.

333
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,310
Yes.

334
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:45,340
You just won a victory.

335
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,590
Why are you wary

336
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,130
of foreign merchants like us?

337
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,400
We'll finish unloading

338
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,240
and leave at once.

339
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,720
Hu Rongge.

340
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,340
You worked for the former Wolf Lord.

341
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,470
Since you already know,

342
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,130
I have nothing left to hide.

343
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,260
We came to Wuning Town this time

344
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,850
not with ill intentions,

345
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,160
but to welcome the exiled Princess Chunyue

346
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,100
of the former Wolf Lord.

347
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,240
I understand.

348
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,640
Otherwise, you wouldn't

349
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,820
have come so smoothly.

350
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,680
The name of Princess Chunyue here

351
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,410
should be Lin Siyue, right?

352
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,150
My Lord.

353
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,280
She's here.

354
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,720
You...

355
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,120
I've only heard

356
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,400
of a male bird in spring

357
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,550
plucking its tail feathers

358
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:44,540
to pretend to be a female

359
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,260
and avoid conflicts,

360
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,820
trying to reproduce.

361
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:50,780
I didn't expect a lord

362
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,440
to disguise himself as a centurion

363
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,650
to deceive a woman.

364
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,780
The men of your country

365
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,690
truly are the most hypocritical.

366
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,760
How dare you!

367
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,160
Lord Huaiyang will not tolerate slander.

368
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,000
Huang Gui.

369
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,540
Princess Chunyue,

370
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,100
today I can either let you go

371
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,410
or detain you under the guise

372
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,850
of a spy.

373
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,000
My Lord.

374
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,750
If you wanted to detain me,

375
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,980
you wouldn't have waited
until Hu Rongge arrived.

376
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,790
I heard that A Gushan

377
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:21,980
killed your father

378
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,170
and replaced your royal family.

379
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,600
My defeat of him

380
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,990
was merely to drive the wolves out

381
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,020
and guard the border.

382
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,060
I didn't mean to harm your tribe.

383
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,110
Princess,

384
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,410
you needn't see me as an enemy.

385
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,840
A Gushan's defeat and capture

386
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,210
are what he deserves.

387
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:37,750
Aside from him,

388
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,720
we have never

389
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,610
interfered with each other.

390
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,210
There's no need for you
to overthink my intentions.

391
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,240
Good.

392
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,980
How straightforward.

393
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:49,910
Please sit.

394
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,510
I invited you here today

395
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,820
to discuss the iron ore business

396
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,450
between the Qi Kingdom and the western tribes.

397
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,470
You know about Mount Tiebei?

398
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,820
Salt and iron are the foundation.

399
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,000
Our kingdom can't tolerate actions

400
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,340
that damage national strength.

401
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,020
If you can provide clues,

402
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,610
not only will I release you,

403
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,030
but I will report it

404
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,210
to open official channels

405
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,890
and facilitate

406
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,780
this mutually beneficial business.

407
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,480
My Lord.

408
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,270
Previously, Qi people did trade iron

409
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,450
with our tribe,

410
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,510
but the person in charge

411
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:32,990
only worked with the former Wolf Lord.

412
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,650
We were not aware.

413
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,500
I only remember three years ago

414
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,340
seeing a Qi convoy in the western tribes.

415
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,340
Do you remember the convoy's name?

416
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:42,630
I don't remember.

417
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,260
They were very mysterious,

418
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:45,780
with their faces covered.

419
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,510
They came to the tribe once a month.

420
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,060
My father personally received them,

421
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,100
so I didn't recognize them.

422
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,410
Later, I got married

423
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,820
and lost contact.

424
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,040
Thank you, Princess.

425
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,130
With the war just ended,

426
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:03,740
at Jinjia Pass,

427
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,210
there may still be remnants of A Gushan.

428
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,100
I will send a team of elite soldiers

429
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,610
to escort you back.

430
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:10,980
Just like that?

431
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,260
Just like that.

432
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,470
But afterward, please hand over

433
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:17,580
the previous ledger to my army

434
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,820
for detailed follow-ups.

435
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,550
Agree.

436
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,390
We have to leave.

437
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,690
My father's turned into a gray wolf.

438
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,410
The ledger is of no use to me now.

439
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,930
I can agree

440
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,410
to give you the ledger.

441
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,890
This is a condition

442
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:42,930
between the Qi Kingdom and the western tribes.

443
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:44,820
There's another condition

444
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,980
between me and you.

445
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,450
Another condition?

446
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,410
Please tell me.

447
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:52,690
Do not reveal my identity

448
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,450
to Liu Miantang.

449
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,840
She has treated me sincerely

450
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,100
and saved my life many times.

451
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,300
Yet you want me to help you deceive her?

452
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,450
I will never harm her.

453
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,410
This is also a promise made

454
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,210
in my name.

455
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,930
I'm a princess now, responsible

456
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,740
for the people behind me.

457
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,820
What right do I have to refuse?

458
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,310
Thank you.

459
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:32,980
(Medicine)

460
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,650
Mrs. Cui.

461
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:39,910
Thank you.

462
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,740
I haven't done much.

463
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,930
I will always remember your support

464
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,410
for me and my child,

465
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:47,850
just like

466
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,340
the spotted cat on the grassland.

467
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,780
I have heard more animals these days

468
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,790
in Wuning Town

469
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,450
than I have seen in my whole life.

470
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,590
Take it.

471
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,740
As a memento.

472
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,720
Coincidentally,

473
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,610
I also have a gift for you.

474
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,890
This is a black iron dagger.

475
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,650
You people rarely see it.

476
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,540
It's only given to the precious friends.

477
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,500
This dagger is made of black iron.

478
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,820
Take it for self-defense.

479
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,210
Take care of yourself.

480
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,060
You too.

481
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,100
Be cautious of your husband.

482
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,300
Be cautious of your husband.

483
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,820
Only dealing with the convoy?

484
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,690
The convoy?

485
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,240
The convoy?

486
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,310
Liu Miantang's family

487
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:04,610
runs a convoy, doesn't it?

488
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:05,930
I've checked.

489
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,370
Their Shenwei Escort Agency

490
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,450
began to decline ten years ago.

491
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,370
It only does nearby business,

492
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,610
not reaching as far as the northwest.

493
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,130
Before I return to the capital,

494
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,260
I need to visit Xizhou.

495
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,740
To see the governor, Sheng Zong?

496
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,100
I want to ask him

497
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,990
how he turned

498
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:32,370
the dirty business

499
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,300
into a war with countless casualties.

500
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:38,890
The smuggling of iron ore is a great disaster.

501
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:42,070
If Princess Chunyue's words are true

502
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,740
and trading began three years ago,

503
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,890
then such a large amount of iron ore

504
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,340
has entered our kingdom.

505
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,500
Think the worst of it.

506
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,480
What's it for?

507
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:55,550
No idea.

508
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,210
Weapons.

509
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,880
What do they intend to do?

510
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,740
Cui Xingzhou.

511
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,210
You narrowly escaped death.

512
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,690
You shouldn't push your luck.

513
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,410
Besides,

514
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,510
even if someone intends to rebel,

515
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:13,210
the current Empress Dowager is unjust.

516
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,210
She always wants to kill you.

517
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,980
Why do you risk your life for her?

518
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:27,820
I've made up my mind.

519
00:28:53,100 --> 00:29:00,020
(Xizhou)

520
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,890
I'm Sheng Zong, Governor of Xizhou City.

521
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,340
Welcome, Lord Huaiyang.

522
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,790
When we asked you for provisions,

523
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,780
you claimed to be ill and stopped going out.

524
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:11,710
It seems you've recovered well now,

525
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,310
even running to welcome the Lord.

526
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,610
My Lord, you may not know.

527
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:17,550
When I heard the Zhenzhou army
was lacking provisions,

528
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,500
I was indeed anxious.

529
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,270
However,

530
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,680
the court's orders for Xizhou

531
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,540
were only to defend the city.

532
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,150
Currently,

533
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,640
Xizhou is facing a year of famine.

534
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,100
I was so anxious

535
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,370
that I caught a cold.

536
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:33,610
I had no time to make arrangements.

537
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:36,370
I could only burn three incense sticks daily,

538
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:39,120
wishing you victory

539
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,540
in every fight.

540
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,710
I won the battle

541
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:45,580
thanks to your incense.

542
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,650
You flatter me.

543
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,170
You have quelled the western tribes' turmoil,

544
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:52,850
a great contribution to the court.

545
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:54,450
How could I be negligent?

546
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,230
That's why I came personally

547
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:57,410
to welcome the army

548
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,740
into the city to rest.

549
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,240
Good.

550
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:03,870
Governor.

551
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,780
Finding the prisoners?

552
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,650
I captured A Gushan alive.

553
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:11,750
Please put the entire city under martial law

554
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:12,930
and carefully guard them.

555
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,440
Yes, My Lord.

556
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:15,350
Please come in.

557
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,820
Look around as you like.

558
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,800
Madam.

559
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,020
What's wrong?

560
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,260
Is it your headache again?

561
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,720
Stop the carriage.

562
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,000
Stop the carriage.

563
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,780
What's going on?

564
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,550
The officials here

565
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:36,130
are so lazy.

566
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,340
The pass records must be moldy.

567
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,980
Let's split to find them according

568
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:44,390
to the ledger.

569
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,130
The camel is here, isn't it?

570
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:15,580
The camel!

571
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,210
Don't throw it around.

572
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,500
Look over there.

573
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,580
Isn't that the camel?

574
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,450
The camel!

575
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,690
- Ms. Xu.
- Coming.

576
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,410
Your veggies.

577
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:41,910
Thank you.

578
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,800
And this.

579
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,210
A toy after he's born.

580
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,020
Thank you.

581
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:59,070
Do you like it? The camel?

582
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,020
Look over there.

583
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:01,830
Do you like it?

584
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:13,630
Madam?

585
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:16,350
Nanny Li.

586
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:17,650
You should go back.

587
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,410
I want to take a walk alone.

588
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,690
- No, no.
- Don't follow me.

589
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:50,500
(Escort)

590
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,750
On this trip back,

591
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,260
you can find a wife.

592
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,500
Miantang,

593
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:01,690
look at all the girls on the street.

594
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:03,340
There are all kinds of them.

595
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:06,130
Why should I stick to just one woman?

596
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,580
(Guanghe Tower)

597
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,030
Madam?

598
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,280
Come.

599
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:39,610
Are you alright?

600
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,500
I'm still worried,

601
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,290
so I followed you.

602
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,860
Sitting in the carriage

603
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,420
makes me feel dizzy.

604
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,800
Let's go.

605
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:49,850
Sure.

606
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,690
The master specially

607
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,280
asked the Lord

608
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,120
for this villa,

609
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:07,100
so that you could

610
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,100
rest and recover here.

611
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:12,310
Where is he?

612
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,210
He has military duties today,

613
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,810
so he probably won't come back.

614
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:33,310
Nanny Li.

615
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,320
The courtyard is spacious.

616
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,250
Arrange for everyone to stay here.

617
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,610
Everyone?

618
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,460
Mr. Fan.

619
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:44,500
Come out.

620
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:47,150
Stop hiding.

621
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,320
I saw you

622
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,540
on the street just now.

623
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,640
Madam.

624
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,540
Didn't you join the army?

625
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,110
Why are you following me

626
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:09,380
instead of the Zhenzhou army?

627
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:10,990
Well.

628
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,610
It must be a coincidence.

629
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,480
It's really a stroke of luck.

630
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,670
Yes, yes. What a coincidence.

631
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:18,510
What a coincidence.

632
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:20,980
So it was arranged by my husband.

633
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:26,020
No, no, no.

634
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,860
Yes, yes.

635
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,170
After we joined the army,

636
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:34,500
we just happened to follow Mr. Cui.

637
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,580
He said

638
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:40,250
there are many remnants disturbing

639
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,060
the soldiers' families,

640
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,250
so we should be wary of the surroundings

641
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,600
and protect you.

642
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:46,840
Yes, yes, yes.

643
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,680
Of course.

644
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,630
And other soldier's families.

645
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:50,690
Yes, yes, yes.

646
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,540
Since it's a military order,

647
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,420
why be so sneaky?

648
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:55,910
Sneaky?

649
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:58,250
Sneaky? We?

650
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,020
Are we sneaky?

651
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,770
- No, no.
- No.

652
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:02,870
No.

653
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,940
Madam, it's me.

654
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,440
We're just

655
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,380
a bunch of men.

656
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,980
We're afraid of disturbing you,

657
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,100
so...

658
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:12,800
But don't worry.

659
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,800
We're only doing routine patrols.

660
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,860
We won't disturb your life.

661
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,170
Yes, yes, yes.

662
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:20,880
Nowadays, there are

663
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,610
very few men as considerate and attentive

664
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,900
as the master.

665
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:25,350
You...

666
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,860
Please don't disregard his kindness.

667
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,900
Anyway, Mr. Fan and the others

668
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,860
have joined the master's team.

669
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:34,020
Let them stay with us.

670
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:35,960
Just don't be

671
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,770
so sneaky and frightening in the future.

672
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,720
Yes.

673
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,210
Nanny Li.

674
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,210
Let them move their luggage in.

675
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,810
Arrange for everyone to stay here.

676
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,610
Prepare a good meal.

677
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,130
Make sure they enjoy it.

678
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,280
Yes.

679
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:52,810
- Thanks, Madam.
- Thanks, Madam.

680
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:54,500
Come with me.

681
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,250
Take it slow.

682
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,540
- Aren't you eating?
- I'm not eating.

683
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,020
You might not have enough.

684
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:25,420
Just made you check
the pass documents for half a day.

685
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,130
Is it really necessary?

686
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:32,950
Cui Xingzhou.

687
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,250
Are you still human?

688
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:38,910
I...

689
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:40,650
I'm a lord.

690
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,400
Not your family's helpers,

691
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,280
who will help you

692
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,500
check this and that.

693
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,030
Alright.

694
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,210
Thank you.

695
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,350
Pour it up.

696
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:02,100
Let me serve it for the Lord.

697
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,650
Thank you again, My Lord.

698
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:09,380
Is that it?

699
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,170
What else?

700
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,440
Would you just brush it off

701
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,540
if Liu Miantang gets mad?

702
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,990
My wife is understanding

703
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:19,250
and won't be so wilful.

704
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,810
See for yourself.

705
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,640
What to see?

706
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:33,500
Pingyuan Escort Agency.

707
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:36,020
The agency was established three years ago.

708
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:38,610
There are a total of 21 escorts.

709
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:41,400
The convoy comes to Xizhou City every month,

710
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,240
despite the weather.

711
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,250
The agency's pass records

712
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:45,990
match the ledger

713
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:46,900
Lin Siyue provided.

714
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,130
But since A Gushan replaced

715
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,540
the former Wolf Lord six months ago,

716
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:54,900
the iron ore business stopped,

717
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,810
and the agency's pass records

718
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:58,060
also stopped.

719
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,420
That is indeed suspicious.

720
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,160
My Lord,

721
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,650
as you wish, the city gates have been closed.

722
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,810
Good for you.

723
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,770
That's it?

724
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:24,990
Yes.

725
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,730
This is the name list of the escort agency.

726
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:35,650
They claim

727
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:38,020
to be locals of Xizhou.

728
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:39,440
But I think

729
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,670
you should have Huang Gui

730
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:42,420
verify each person carefully.

731
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:44,330
No need to verify each one.

732
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,820
(Qiulin Xian)

733
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:52,210
Don't find it strange.

734
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,060
My great-grandmother's surname is Qiu.

735
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:57,100
It's not a rare surname.

736
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,100
Don't find it strange?

737
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:02,210
His surname isn't Qiu but Qiulin.

738
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,610
I've seen this surname in Beizhou.

739
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,210
Only western tribes people use this surname.

740
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,540
Do you mean...?

741
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,210
They use such ambiguous surnames

742
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,650
to facilitate dealing.

743
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,100
between two places?

744
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:50,030
It's raining so heavily.

745
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:51,980
(Music and Ink)
Why are you sitting outside?

746
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:53,060
Honey, you're back.

747
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:56,940
Is your hand hurting?

748
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:00,350
Let me see.

749
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,600
Is it here?

750
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:43,390
Let me do it.

751
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:44,470
No, it's nothing.

752
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:46,240
It's gonna work this time.

753
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,060
I see this corner is just like this one.

754
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,420
I see.

755
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:06,350
What's wrong?

756
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,330
I was thinking about you.

757
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:11,440
You're an excellent Go player

758
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,940
and a brave fighter,

759
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,100
but you can't manage a corner of a quilt.

760
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:21,350
Honey,

761
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,690
were we in the capital

762
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,170
at this time last year?

763
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:28,860
Yes, we were in the capital.
