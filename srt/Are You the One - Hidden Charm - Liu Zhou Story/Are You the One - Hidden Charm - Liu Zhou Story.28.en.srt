=Episode 28=

14
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,560
Get in.

15
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,170
Ms. Liu.

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,750
Madam Su, you're so inquisitive.

17
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,590
No.

18
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,100
What a coincidence. I also love to inquire.

19
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:12,250
Last year,
Mr. Su gambled extravagantly in Huizhou.

20
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,290
He even wagered his own fabric shop.

21
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,940
But in the end, he lost everything

22
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,250
and is 850 taels of gold in gambling debts.

23
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,940
Madam Su, out of deep love for your son,

24
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:29,460
you moved the entire family
to Beizhou overnight to escape the debts.

25
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,100
But you couldn't stay quiet and instead tried
to marry a lady from the Qiao Family,

26
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:37,970
hoping to use the dowry
to pay off her gambler son's debts.

27
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,550
Ms. Liu, you misunderstand.

28
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:44,530
Madam Su, you know well
if it's a misunderstanding.

29
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:50,870
But I want to remind you
that the creditor is already on the way.

30
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,570
They should arrive in two or three days.

31
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,730
Madam Su, if you don't leave now,
you won't be able to escape.

32
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,850
Liu Miantang, you...

33
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,570
Alright, put it away quickly.

34
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:05,850
It's not a big deal.
Don't let it escalate to a fatal situation.

35
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:08,510
Alright.

36
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,570
Good for you.

37
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,620
Aunt, welcome back.

38
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,660
What are you so proud of?

39
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,230
Me?

40
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,250
I know very well what you used to do.

41
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,690
You never went to the capital to marry Cui.

42
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,690
A woman wandering alone for three years,
what good could come of it?

43
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,620
I heard you found a man in Xizhou.

44
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:55,100
You must have been so disliked
that you came back in disgrace.

45
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,410
Aunt, you're so angry.

46
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,810
It seems the engagement
with the Su Family fails.

47
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,500
Your cousin is different from you.

48
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,690
Even without the Su Family,
there will be other wealthier families.

49
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:11,250
I have already asked the matchmaker
to arrange a date in the next few days.

50
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,820
However, I advise you
to stay put and behave yourself.

51
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,970
Don't come out
and make a fool of yourself.

52
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,150
Otherwise,

53
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,820
don't blame me
for spreading the truth about you.

54
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,970
I wouldn't do that.

55
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,460
At this critical moment,
you will surely treat me like your own daughter

56
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:33,930
and risk your life to protect my reputation.

57
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:38,220
Otherwise, how could
my cousin Qingying get married?

58
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,660
But here I am, a petty jealous woman,
living a miserable life.

59
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,220
And I have to watch my cousin marry gloriously.

60
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,410
Take care, Aunt.

61
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,520
(That dog often visits the courtyard,)

62
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,500
(pretending to be friendly
while actually disliking me.)

63
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,230
A secret letter?

64
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:23,230
After Lord Huaiyang fell asleep,
I sneaked in and read the letter.

65
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,340
Was it a plea for help?

66
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,050
This is what Lord Huaiyang wrote.

67
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,740
"That dog often visits the courtyard,"

68
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,850
"pretending to be friendly
while actually disliking me."

69
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,260
He called me a dog?

70
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,080
It might not be referring to you.

71
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,920
What about the rest?

72
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,680
Lord Huaiyang also wrote,

73
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,910
"That dog seems to know my fears."

74
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,700
"He makes it difficult for me
to enter and exit the front yard freely."

75
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,790
He is clearly referring to me.

76
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,230
If he hadn't broken the rules himself,

77
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,990
would I have nothing better
to do than to confine him?

78
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,820
I even gave him a courtyard
with the best sunlight.

79
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,660
So, my lord, what should we do next?

80
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,850
Keep him confined until he dies.

81
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,850
Stuff the door cracks with cloth.

82
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,460
- Yes.
- Wait a moment.

83
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:04,900
First, find a doctor
to cure his annoying cough.

84
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,190
Don't let him die in my courtyard. Go now.

85
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,110
Yes.

86
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:15,730
Summon Lord You for an audience.

87
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:26,020
Greetings, Your Majesty.
I wish you good health.

88
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,900
Lord You, you may rise.

89
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,370
Thank you, Your Majesty.

90
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,430
Your Majesty,
Lord You has traveled thousands of miles

91
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:40,370
to wish you well.

92
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:44,360
This shows his sincerity
and sets an example for the vassal lords.

93
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:47,850
He should be richly rewarded.

94
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:53,700
What you said is very true. I deeply agree.

95
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:58,780
Lord Liu Qi of Youzhou is loyal and upright,
and adheres to principles and propriety.

96
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,490
His resolve is unbreakable,

97
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,370
and his mind remains unshaken
by any distractions.

98
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,850
He shall be elevated to a duke
and promoted to Minister of Rites.

99
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:11,660
He will also oversee the mining,
smelting, and minting

100
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,730
of the Northern Region, namely Youzhou,
Yanzhou, Beizhou, and Yunzhou.

101
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,260
Thank you for Your Majesty's grace.

102
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,820
I usually feed the fish here.

103
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,970
These red carp often wait nearby.
They grow fat and large.

104
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,010
But the small fish are left hungry.

105
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:53,820
I need to take care of them as well.

106
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,700
Your Majesty's grace is unpredictable.

107
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:04,850
Your Majesty, look,

108
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:08,100
these red carp wait here every day.
They never slack off.

109
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,340
Originally, they earned their food
through hard work.

110
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,770
But unexpectedly,

111
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,940
they are worse off
than those small fish that do nothing.

112
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,480
Their food is easily taken away.

113
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,320
This is...

114
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,820
Which red carp has been treated unfairly

115
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,970
and complained to you, Uncle?

116
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:31,730
Your Majesty,

117
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,700
Zhang Di is both talented and virtuous,
and he has also worked hard for Your Majesty.

118
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,640
I think he's an honest and loyal person,

119
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,890
which is why he was given
an important position.

120
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,580
Originally, I intended for him

121
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,800
to manage the minting of the North Region
for Your Majesty.

122
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,640
But...

123
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:53,940
Why didn't you tell me about this earlier,
Uncle?

124
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,370
With the bond between you and me,

125
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:02,180
would I deliberately use this favor
to gain personal advantage?

126
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,010
The decree has been issued.
It is difficult to change it.

127
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,340
Uncle, now that the Lord You has submitted,
it is a joy for the court as well.

128
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,080
Uncle, you are wise and just.

129
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,340
You wouldn't make things difficult for me,
would you?

130
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:28,890
Your Majesty, how could you say that?

131
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:34,160
For the benefit of the country and its people,
how could I be so petty?

132
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,000
That's good to hear.

133
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:36,990
Sorry to disturb Your Majesty's enjoyment.

134
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,540
(Jian'an Gate)

135
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,400
My lord.

136
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,060
Liu Yu has extended his hand to my domain.

137
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,580
I could let slide the position
of Minister of Rites.

138
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,850
But even the minting of the four prefectures
has been granted to Lord You.

139
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,490
This is clearly an attempt
to dismantle my power.

140
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,320
I thought of using one villain
to deal with another

141
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,220
and Cui Xingzhou would either
suffer physical pain on this trip.

142
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:28,650
I didn't expect Lord You
to come to the capital so quickly.

143
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:35,100
Maybe His Majesty has already allied with him.

144
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,040
Whether they have secret dealings
is not important.

145
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,370
As long as their common weakness
is in my hands,

146
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:47,420
I can still take them down.

147
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,940
You mean Ms. Liu in Beizhou?

148
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,130
I have no feelings of pity for that girl.

149
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,890
Find an opportunity to capture her alive.

150
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:04,640
It's alright if you have
to break her arms or legs.

151
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,890
How are you, Great Grandmother?

152
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,120
It's all old ailments, nothing serious.

153
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,070
Come, sit.

154
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:36,010
Lord You's submission sets an example
for all the other lords.

155
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,370
Cui Xingzhou has done well in this matter.

156
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,240
In my opinion,

157
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:51,010
Lord Huaiyang has previously achieved merits
in the western campaign.

158
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,060
Yet he remains humble and unassuming.

159
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:59,850
Now he is also dedicating himself
to the future of the Qi Kingdom.

160
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,580
He is truly a hero of our times.

161
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:09,010
If the Imperial Court had more
capable ministers like him,

162
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,610
I would be at ease.

163
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,170
Your Majesty,

164
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,890
Lord Huaiyang has made great contributions
this time.

165
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,420
How do you plan to reward him?

166
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:28,460
Great Grandmother, rest assured,
I will reward him generously.

167
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,590
Zhong, time to cross the fire basin!

168
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:32,430
Come on.

169
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:33,800
Alright.

170
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,350
Stop it. That's enough.

171
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,480
Is the prison food good?

172
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,320
Shut up.

173
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,460
Is the manager Liu Miantang?

174
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:45,890
What is it, young lady?

175
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,480
She was so sick before

176
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,370
that she couldn't even sew
a handkerchief properly.

177
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,060
Yet she can command a group of men
to escort goods.

178
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,180
Since you recognize Ms. Liu,

179
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:58,510
then you should know
she is the best businesswoman in the world.

180
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:01,600
She wouldn't tolerate anyone mocking her
on her property,

181
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,130
and still be able to walk out safely.

182
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:08,240
Great. I don't plan to leave right now.

183
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,580
Lu Zhong, Lu Yi.

184
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,880
Sister.

185
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,400
Sister.

186
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,220
I should have come to visit
when I found out you were back.

187
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,730
But I was busy firing porcelain a few days ago,
and couldn't get away.

188
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,580
You won't blame me, will you?

189
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,750
So the new porcelain is finished?

190
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,850
Why didn't you bring some to show me?

191
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,820
Well, it's finished.

192
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,280
As per the guidance in your previous letter,

193
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,320
there is indeed a purple gold clay mine
in Ruben Mountain in the suburbs of Beizhou.

194
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,890
As soon as I arrived in Beizhou,
I started setting up a kiln site.

195
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:39,540
Under high fire, it indeed produces black clay.

196
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:42,020
I brought some down the mountain this time

197
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,970
and intended to present them
to Lord Beizhou first

198
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,750
so that Lord Beizhou would allow me
to open a trade route in Beizhou

199
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:49,130
and earn some capital.

200
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,860
I didn't show you
because I was afraid my porcelain

201
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,920
wouldn't meet your expert standards.

202
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,540
I'm no expert.

203
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,220
Then wait until I produce porcelain
that can rival Lingquan premium.

204
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,460
I'll let you be the first to appraise it.

205
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:07,970
You are meticulous and never tired of hard work.
You will definitely succeed.

206
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,650
By then, I'll be responsible
for supplying the goods,

207
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,220
and your escort agency
will handle the delivery.

208
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:17,890
Let's work together sincerely
and make a fortune.

209
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:26,970
Miantang, what was happening outside just now?

210
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,300
Is it to ward off some bad luck?

211
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,770
Indeed, some bad luck has come.

212
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,890
Bad luck from Zhenzhou.

213
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,820
But didn't you say in your letter
that you two had already parted ways?

214
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,000
How come...

215
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,370
Is he already at the door?

216
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,890
Yes, even Master Qiao was alarmed
and went over with your husband.

217
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:01,400
That carriage is quite impressive.

218
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,100
I just don't know which family
is coming to visit.

219
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,100
We'll know once we see him.

220
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:09,900
(Qiao Residence)

221
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:14,060
You must be Master Qiao.

222
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:31,320
I didn't know you were coming, Lord Zhennan.
I apologize for not welcoming you properly.

223
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,160
- It's alright.
- My lord.

224
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,830
I have been a close friend of your eldest son
for many years.

225
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:37,250
Passing by your esteemed place,
I have to pay a visit.

226
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,470
Please.

227
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,070
Let's go.

228
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,070
My lord.

229
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,730
How much money did you
give the matchmaker yesterday

230
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,510
to get a lord to come?

231
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:55,770
I didn't give any money.
How could I have any money?

232
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,370
Didn't give any?

233
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,100
Isn't this a visit for a marriage proposal?

234
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,110
This...

235
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,480
Come.

236
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,820
My lord, please.

237
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:27,020
Come and greet His Lordship.

238
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,480
No need for formalities.

239
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,990
Many years ago,

240
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,820
I passed through Zhenzhou
while escorting a caravan.

241
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:37,410
I had the honor
of meeting His Lordship's father.

242
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,740
At that time,
my sons were still young and weren't with me.

243
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,550
Xian,

244
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,850
when did you become acquainted
with Lord Zhennan?

245
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,370
Lord Zhennan and I...

246
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,370
I met him at Lingquan.

247
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,610
We met while watering our horses
at Lingquan in Xizhou.

248
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,130
Watering horses?

249
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:12,200
That's quite a serendipitous encounter.

250
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,780
When did this happen?

251
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,890
Let me think.

252
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:22,740
My lord, it was one autumn.

253
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,300
My lord, please try this pastry.

254
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:44,790
Do you know my granddaughter?

255
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,630
No, I don't.

256
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,500
Then what are you looking for?

257
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:55,200
As soon as I arrived,

258
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,650
I noticed that all your descendants
are talented.

259
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:01,440
Even the young ladies in the family
are so graceful.

260
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,020
Indeed, you're so lucky, Master Qiao.

261
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,370
My lord, you flatter us.

262
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,600
My daughter, Qingying,

263
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,500
has been skilled in the four arts
since childhood.

264
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,070
Grandfather,
you have many important matters to attend to.

265
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,450
We should leave my uncle
and His Lordship to chat

266
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:23,170
so as not to disturb His Lordship
with other matters.

267
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,590
Alright.

268
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,200
Ms. Liu, don't.

269
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,760
It's me.

270
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,850
Zhao Quan.

271
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,440
I'm your friend.

272
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,540
We're not friends.

273
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:04,120
You can't push me away
because you're angry with someone else.

274
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:04,960
Is that so?

275
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,630
Don't.

276
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:15,690
Miantang, I'll stand guard outside for you.
Be quick.

277
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:16,870
Alright.

278
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,150
Thank you.

279
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,890
Wasn't it you
who helped Cui Xingzhou deceive me?

280
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,210
When I woke up,
you called him "Cui Jiu", didn't you?

281
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,650
Misunderstanding, a huge misunderstanding.

282
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,890
At that time,
I was only thinking of saving you.

283
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,780
It was all that Cui Xingzhou
who forced me to lie.

284
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:41,370
But even so, I cannot shirk my responsibility.

285
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,890
That's why I came to Beizhou specifically
to apologize to you.

286
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:53,870
What is this?

287
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,980
I have always been worried
about your hand injury,

288
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,100
so I found an ancient remedy.

289
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,170
My hand has long since healed.

290
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,500
If you can't see it,
we can have a little contest.

291
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,060
That won't be necessary.

292
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,170
I know you can move freely now,
but after all, it was a reattached tendon.

293
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:15,450
Even if it has healed,

294
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,630
it still hurts in cold and rainy weather,
doesn't it?

295
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:23,500
Apply this medicine to the injured area
once a day.

296
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:26,650
It will be fully healed within three months,
with no lingering effects.

297
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,700
This remedy contains a rare ingredient,

298
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,930
the eagle flower,
which is hard to come by.

299
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:37,170
I went through a lot of trouble
to find it and prepare this.

300
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:42,780
This is the only one in the world, Ms. Liu,
please don't waste it.

301
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,110
How much money do you want? I'll pay you.

302
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,370
Talking about money hurts our friendship.

303
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:55,500
But I have indeed hurt our friendship.

304
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,600
However,
this medicine is worth a thousand gold,

305
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:59,260
consider it my apology.

306
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:04,020
Ms. Liu,
please don't blame me anymore, alright?

307
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,540
Eagle flowers?

308
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,030
I've been searching for so long
and couldn't find any.

309
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,690
How did you get these?

310
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,930
Just follow your recipe and make the remedy.

311
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,890
And there's one more thing
I need your help with.

312
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,370
What is it?

313
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,830
Give the remedy to her for me.

314
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:34,260
Aren't you going to Beizhou?
Why don't you give it to her yourself?

315
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,440
If it's from me, will she use it?

316
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,410
I'm not going.

317
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,480
I'm begging you.

318
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,340
I can't go.

319
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:47,700
(Draft)

320
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,100
If you don't accept it,
then take the medicine back.

321
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,130
Fine, I'll accept it.

322
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,510
Ms. Liu, do you know
that Xingzhou is now trapped

323
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:09,260
in Lord Beizhou's Mansion?

324
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,680
What does his whereabouts have to do with me?

325
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:21,450
So you haven't seen him for a long time.
Neither have I.

326
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:24,030
I was thinking of going
to the mansion to build some connections

327
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:25,780
and say a few good words for him.

328
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,720
But who would have thought

329
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,450
that Lord Beizhou kept making excuses
to avoid me?

330
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:33,590
Do you think they might torture Xingzhou,

331
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,100
or even kill him over a disagreement?

332
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:40,130
You know, I'm rather slow-witted.

333
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,450
So I came here specifically
to discuss countermeasures with you, Ms. Liu.

334
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,500
Aren't you worried at all?

335
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:58,740
I only know that if I stay with you any longer,
my uncle will start to worry.

336
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:14,300
Light dust rests on weak grass.
Things have changed.

337
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,340
Miantang, darling.

338
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:35,410
Is the man you met

339
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,540
- in Xizhou...
- Aunt, don't get it wrong.

340
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:40,820
I am just the abandoned woman you mentioned.

341
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,580
Miantang, it was all my fault.

342
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,810
That day,

343
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,820
I was angry with the Su Family
and ended up offending you.

344
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,780
How could I be angry with you?

345
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:56,500
Look, in our family, I like you the most.

346
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:05,450
I am just worried that
as the Qiao family is in decline,

347
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,170
your cousin Qingying
might not find a good match.

348
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,890
She is your cousin, after all.

349
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:16,230
Do you remember?
When you two were little, you lived together,

350
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:19,200
learned embroidery, and flew kites together.

351
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,930
Aunt, you just need to know that
the Su Family is not a good match.

352
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,280
Yes.

353
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:29,690
And soon, I will have to congratulate you.

354
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:34,870
Congratu...

355
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:39,340
Which one is Mrs. Qiao?

356
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,450
Have you seen Mrs. Qiao?

357
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,750
- No.
- Is it this one?

358
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,590
Here she comes.

359
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:44,720
Mrs. Qiao.

360
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,510
- Mrs. Qiao.
- Mrs. Qiao.

361
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,650
Mrs. Qiao.

362
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,300
- Mrs. Qiao.
- Mrs. Qiao.

363
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,580
Mrs. Qiao.

364
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,850
- Mrs. Qiao.
- I came first. Let me speak first.

365
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:54,360
- Let me speak first.
- I usually let you go first.

366
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,310
This time, I will speak first.

367
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,400
I will speak first.

368
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,210
What exactly do you want to say?

369
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,370
A marriage proposal.

370
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,790
The news has spread throughout the town.

371
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:06,510
The Qiao family are friends
with the noble Lord Zhennan.

372
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:08,160
And they never boast about it.

373
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,680
This shows their modesty and noble character.

374
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,640
Exactly.

375
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,370
Yesterday, five families asked me
to propose a marriage.

376
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:16,690
I have eight families here.

377
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,230
Don't you have two young ladies
ready for marriage?

378
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,210
Do you?

379
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:36,440
Ms. He. I have already presented the porcelain
vases you brought to His Lordship.

380
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,540
Thank you, sir.

381
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,820
What does His Lordship say?

382
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,580
We have a distinguished guest today.
His Lordship is meeting him now.

383
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:48,100
However, please rest assured, Ms. He.

384
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:50,990
With such excellent porcelain,
His Lordship will surely agree

385
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:52,530
to grant you some business permits

386
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:54,100
to sell them in the various counties
of Beizhou.

387
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:59,020
Please rest in the north room first
and wait for His Lordship to summon you.

388
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,820
Thank you.

389
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,040
Please.

390
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:13,340
Cui Xingzhou called me a dog.

391
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:18,740
And on my territory, he seizes by force,
commits crimes, and bullies men and women.

392
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:22,260
If it were you, could you tolerate it?

393
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:24,830
I could.

394
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:27,930
I know you could.

395
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,890
You two were inseparable in Zhenzhou.
You're his cunning partner.

396
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:33,700
You canceled your engagement
before your wedding,

397
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,040
and so did he.

398
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:38,210
Anyone with eyes can see the relationship
between you two.

399
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,340
Nonsense!

400
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:42,850
How dare you!

401
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,500
You're a mere marquis,
and you come in demanding I release him.

402
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:49,450
And you offend me.
Aren't you afraid of dying in Beizhou?

403
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:53,980
Fine, if you dare, we'll die in your Beizhou.

404
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,680
Let's see if the Imperial Court
and my Zhenzhou army

405
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,610
don't wipe you out completely.

406
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,540
Farewell.

407
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:09,300
(Lord Beizhou's Mansion)

408
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,060
Isn't this the runaway young lady

409
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:26,820
who made my family lose face and dignity?

410
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,210
My lord, do you intend
to take me back to Zhenzhou?

411
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,690
That is unnecessary.

412
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:39,500
Ms. He, you ran quite far to avoid me.

413
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,740
My lord, you jest.

414
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:47,070
Merchants seek stability and livelihood.
I opened a kiln in Beizhou to make porcelain.

415
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,930
Is this porcelain vase yours?

416
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,510
Among all the vases I made,
this is the one

417
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,270
and only item to present to Lord Beizhou.

418
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:06,340
I hope to obtain
the ceramics merchant evidence of Beizhou.

419
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:10,610
Unfortunately,
it was shattered by an esteemed guest.

420
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,890
- It wasn't me.
- Then it must be Lord Beizhou.

421
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,740
I heard from the steward

422
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:20,470
that Lord Beizhou was
in a very good mood today.

423
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:23,210
Why would he break a vase for no reason?
To hear the sound for amusement?

424
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,890
He... he imprisoned Cui Xingzhou.

425
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,780
I argued with him.

426
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:31,310
He...

427
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,360
He scolded me and Cui Xingzhou.

428
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,930
Shouldn't you two be scolded?

429
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:38,350
No.

430
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,590
When...

431
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,920
I... I just couldn't explain it clearly.

432
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,980
Then don't.

433
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,650
Sorry, it was me who broke it.

434
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:01,930
Why should I take the blame?

435
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,140
(Qiao Residence)
Slow down.

436
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,110
It's a grand occasion.

437
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,960
The Qiao family is marrying
off their daughter today.

438
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,440
What a grand spectacle!

439
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,740
Truly magnificent!

440
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,610
The bridegroom is quite a handsome man.

441
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,430
The Qiao family is really fortunate.

442
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,130
Lift the sedan chair.

443
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,550
Lord Huaiyang, you haven't eaten

444
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:42,820
for several days, have you?

445
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,390
Not hungry.

446
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:49,450
Then it must be that the food in my mansion
doesn't suit your taste.

447
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,740
I'll immediately have some dishes
from Zhenzhou prepared and sent over.

448
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,350
No need.

449
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:02,780
Lord Huaiyang, do you always
say two words at a time?

450
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:09,650
Any other businesses, please?

451
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:17,260
I have good news and bad news.
Which one do you want to hear first?

452
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,210
As you said,

453
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:31,100
Lord You indeed went to the capital
to meet the Emperor a few days ago.

454
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:35,020
Is this the good news?

455
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,240
No.

456
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:42,020
Lord You encountered assassins
on his way back to Youzhou from the capital.

457
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:45,580
However, when the assassins showed up,

458
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:48,580
several secret guards appeared
to protect Lord You.

459
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:51,120
They have safely escorted Lord You
back to his mansion.

460
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,980
That's the good news.

461
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:58,170
Those secret guards are all your people,
aren't they?

462
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:02,610
You knew all along that someone
would try to assassinate Lord You.

463
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,450
If Lord You died,

464
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,120
you would have enough reason to kill me.

465
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:15,740
At that time,
the Zhenzhou Army would march north.

466
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:20,370
You and I, like the snipe and the clam,
would fight, and someone else would benefit.

467
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:26,580
You mean someone is manipulating
all of this from behind the scenes?

468
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,740
My lord, you appear to be fearless,

469
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:37,610
but in reality, you are the most adept
at assessing the situation.

470
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:42,400
After observing for a long time,
you naturally understand

471
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,640
the general trend.

472
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,850
Naturally, you can also
make the most appropriate decisions.

473
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:53,130
But I just want to be a stable vassal lord.

474
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:57,540
I don't want to get involved
in the court's intrigues and deceptions.

475
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:02,690
My lord, you are just stalling me.

476
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:04,980
I haven't promised you anything.

477
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,890
Lord You is currently safe,
and you have no ill intentions.

478
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:11,030
I can only grant you freedom.

479
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:14,910
Listening to more would be of no benefit.

480
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,070
Alright.

481
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:28,150
Cui, why don't you ask me what the bad news is?

482
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,410
The Qiao family is marrying off
a young lady today.

483
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:38,610
It's her cousin, isn't it?

484
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,340
No, no, that's completely wrong.

485
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:50,370
The groom is not Mr. Su.
Master Qiao carefully selected Mr. Qian.

486
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,070
He not only has a prosperous family background
and a handsome appearance,

487
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:57,780
but he also is a promising scholar.

488
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,740
Ms. Liu of the Qiao family

489
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,370
can definitely be described
as extraordinarily beautiful.

490
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,330
The people coming to propose marriage

491
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,670
to the Qiao Mansion have practically
worn out their threshold.

492
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:15,440
When Mr. Qian saw Ms. Liu,
he was completely captivated.

493
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,720
He sincerely and earnestly
proposed several times.

494
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,420
Master Qiao accepted it.

495
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,900
She agreed just like that?

496
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:28,330
It's the parental order
and the matchmaker's words.

497
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,690
She has no right to disagree.

498
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,930
I knew that the six rites
were proceeding smoothly,

499
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:35,210
and it was done quickly.

500
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,380
Given the time, the bridal sedan chair is...

501
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,830
Stop. Let him go.

502
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:44,980
You scared me.

503
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:47,700
(Auspice and Fortune)

504
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,110
Get down. You can't borrow this horse.

505
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:02,650
This is a Ferghana horse
that I transported from Xizhou.

506
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:07,540
This is a Ferghana horse
that even I'm reluctant to ride.

507
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,050
Congratulations.

508
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,100
Thank you.

509
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:22,880
Congratulations.

510
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:25,780
Congratulations.

511
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,810
Congratulations.

512
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:29,750
Congratulations.

513
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,240
Thank you.

514
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,640
Thank you.

515
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,940
Who are you to dare
to disrupt the wedding procession

516
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,510
on the street?

517
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,540
What are you trying to do?

518
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,900
Are you here to kidnap the bride?

519
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,680
I am a recommended official
of the Qi Kingdom. I'll...

520
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,540
I apologize for any offense. Please forgive me.

521
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,100
I'm not here to kidnap the bride.

522
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,330
I just have something to say
to the bride in the sedan chair.

523
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,210
Bride, don't interfere.
Don't break the etiquette.

524
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,860
Sir, stop making a scene.

525
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:16,280
They're married with proper rites.
The six rites are complete.

526
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,360
It must be mutual affection and true feelings.

527
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,210
- What are you trying...
- Are you truly willing

528
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,460
to marry this person?

529
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:24,910
You rat, where did you come from?

530
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:26,290
Someone, quickly drive him away.

531
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:36,980
If you truly care for him and are willing
to spend your life with him, I bless you.

532
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,420
But if you have even a moment of hesitation,
then come with me.

533
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,020
Nonsense.

534
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,210
Miantang.

535
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:51,860
I am not Liu Miantang.

536
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,860
If you continue to make a scene,
I will report you to the authorities.

537
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,030
I'm leaving.

538
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,080
I'm leaving.

539
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,080
I'm leaving.

540
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,280
Quickly leave.

541
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,600
Leave.

542
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:09,360
Lift the sedan chair.

543
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,330
This person must have a problem with his mind.

544
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,420
Indeed, he must have gone mad.

545
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:15,130
Truly insane.

546
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,020
Congratulations.

547
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,580
That is Lord Huaiyang.

548
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,760
Thank you, my lord.

549
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,210
My lord, I've brought you tremendous good news.

550
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:58,650
What good news?

551
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,170
I came with the decree
of the Grand Empress Dowager.

552
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,190
You have achieved military merit,

553
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,100
and the Grand Empress Dowager
is greatly pleased.

554
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,940
She intends to marry Princess Wuhua to you.

555
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:14,500
Cui Xingzhou, Lord Huaiyang,
receive the decree.

556
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,080
My lord, listen to the decree.

557
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:25,270
Now, Princess Wuhua,
with her noble character

558
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:27,940
and exceptional talents,

559
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:29,710
is gentle, respectful,

560
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:31,380
and possesses the qualities
of virtue and grace.

561
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:37,670
With her gentle and virtuous nature,
she is in the prime of her youth.

562
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:40,040
To avoid wasting her prime years,
the Office of the Imperial Clan

563
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:42,690
is specially ordered
to select a suitable husband for her.

564
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:45,220
It is heard that Cui Xingzhou,
Lord Huaiyang,

565
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,900
is proficient in both
civil and military affairs,

566
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,400
and his talents and virtues match hers.

567
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,100
His loyalty and dedication to the country
make him a perfect match for the princess.

568
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,720
It's a perfect match made by Heaven.

569
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:56,070
The officials will choose an auspicious
date for the ceremony.

570
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:58,420
The decree is to be carried out
by the appointed officials.

571
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:05,020
My lord, receive the decree.

572
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:11,650
Congratulations, my lord,
it's double happiness.

573
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,860
My lord, you must be overjoyed.

574
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:18,730
Before coming here,
I already met with Lord Beizhou.

575
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:21,770
He said that your affairs
in Beizhou are finished.

576
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,870
As long as you are willing,
he can send people

577
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:25,760
to escort you out
of Beizhou at any time.

578
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:31,290
Well, I... have other matters to attend to.

579
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,790
Other matters?

580
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:37,380
Are they more important
than the Grand Empress Dowager's decree?

581
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:39,630
This audience with the Emperor
cannot be delayed.

582
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,550
My lord,
it is better to pack up

583
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,510
and set off for the capital
as soon as possible.

584
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:45,900
Then I will take my leave first.

585
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:33,180
(Auspice and Fortune)

586
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:36,860
By the grace of Your Majesty,

587
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:39,290
an Imperial Envoy has come to me
to bestow military honors upon me.

588
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:45,610
In addition to this honor,
I hope to ask a favor for an old friend.

589
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:51,500
With Your Majesty's favor,
this old friend will not be mistreated.

590
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:55,290
In the future, when she gets married,
no one will dare to slight her.

591
00:41:03,150 --> 00:41:05,290
Seeking rewards for achievements.

592
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,730
What a demeanor.

593
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:10,690
Who does Cui Xingzhou think he is?

594
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,580
If I want to reward Liu Miantang,
why do I need him to ask for it?

595
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,330
Rise.

596
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,160
Yes.

597
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:37,170
How is the conferment of titles
for the imperial women and officials' wives?

598
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:40,000
It was initially reviewed
by the Ministry of Rites,

599
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:42,100
and the Hanlin Academy
is drafting the Imperial Edicts.

600
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,810
Once Your Majesty approves them,

601
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,100
they will be handed over to the Cabinet
for final writing and sealing.

602
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:54,060
I want to bestow the title
of Commandery Princess upon Liu Miantang.

603
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:58,710
In the Previous Dynasty,
there was a precedent

604
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:00,800
for rewarding non-imperial women
who contributed to the throne

605
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,280
with the title of Commandery Princess.

606
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,130
If Your Majesty has made up your mind,
the Imperial Clan

607
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,980
and the Ministry of Rites
should have no objections.

608
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,810
However, the honorary title still

609
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:09,210
needs Your Majesty's approval.

610
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:12,610
Huaisang.

611
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,770
Huaisang?

612
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:29,810
Your Highness, what is the meaning
behind these two words?

613
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:34,980
Huaisang evokes a sense of nostalgia,
reminiscent of one's homeland.

614
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:40,650
His Majesty is trying to remind that wretch
not to forget their past.

615
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:45,770
Take everything down.

616
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:47,210
- Be careful.
- Yes.

617
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:56,800
So this is the important matter you mentioned,
which I must attend.

618
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,420
In two days, you will be leaving.

619
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:02,880
Previously, I confined you to my residence.
It was quite offensive.

620
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,500
I feel deeply regretful about it.

621
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,460
Today, I invite you to go on an outing,
riding horses and shooting arrows.

622
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,690
Consider it a farewell and an apology.

623
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,250
