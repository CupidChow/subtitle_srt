14
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,670
Consort Dowager.

15
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,500
I've always loved dressing up.

16
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,410
Before Fu was married,

17
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,990
she was renowned

18
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:19,380
for her grace and noble bearing.

19
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,200
All these fine clothes

20
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,690
were crafted by my hands.

21
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,870
Later,

22
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,380
after she married far away in the capital,

23
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,500
Binglan came along.

24
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,410
I often prepared outfits for her as well.

25
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,480
It's a shame

26
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,660
she doesn't resemble me.

27
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,660
Though her features are delicate,

28
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:42,500
she's still somewhat a small-town beauty.

29
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,850
None of these hairpins

30
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,500
suit her.

31
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,100
I never expected

32
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,340
to end up

33
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:55,500
with a daughter-in-law like you.

34
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,380
Whether in light or heavy makeup,

35
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,340
you carry it all.

36
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,010
Dress well,

37
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,010
and you'll truly look like a noble lady.

38
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,290
No wonder Xingzhou, with all his pickiness,

39
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,290
is so deeply taken with you.

40
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,640
Xingzhou has been gone
for over ten days now.

41
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,080
You must miss him dearly,
Consort Dowager.

42
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,120
As women

43
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,130
married into military families,

44
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,380
we've spent

45
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,780
half our lives waiting.

46
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,730
There's no room left

47
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,500
for the word "longing."

48
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,780
I've lived like this,

49
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,600
and I believe

50
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,340
so will you.

51
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,620
For Xingzhou to be so enlightened,

52
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,780
he must take after you.

53
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,160
Is he?

54
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,810
I suppose.

55
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,060
He certainly takes after me.

56
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,900
A gentleman is slow to speak but swift to act.

57
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,360
Xingzhou's deep affection for you

58
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,340
must have been ingrained in him
from a young age.

59
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,380
No matter where he is,

60
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,730
his heart is always tethered to you,

61
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,660
to this home.

62
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,060
Nothing is more comforting

63
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,780
than hearing

64
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,850
that he is safe and sound.

65
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,970
You wouldn't believe it,

66
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,340
but Xingzhou has never

67
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,120
written home to say

68
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,530
he's safe since he joined the army.

69
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,290
Never?

70
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,780
Has he written to you?

71
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,580
No.

72
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,340
Then don't expect it.

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,850
I'm sure you will

74
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,290
get used to it eventually.

75
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,490
None of these

76
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,140
match the hairpin.

77
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,780
Do you have any other hair accessories?

78
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,530
There may not be any that are quite suitable.

79
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,020
It doesn't matter.

80
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,260
Bring them out, and I'll take a look.

81
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,530
There truly aren't any more.

82
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,490
Isn't your trousseau right here?

83
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,140
(To my beloved wife)

84
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,370
This is Xingzhou's handwriting.

85
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,030
To my beloved wife.

86
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,850
One day seems longer than months three.

87
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,530
This is the calligraphy sample he left me.

88
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,220
A calligraphy sample?

89
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,660
He left it before he went to battle.

90
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,290
He never wrote home.

91
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,780
It rains heavily in Dongzhou today.

92
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:50,170
I was reminded of your wrist pain,

93
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,020
and my heart longed to return.

94
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,140
Consort Dowager,

95
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,640
Xingzhou must miss you deeply too.

96
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,530
All right.

97
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,140
Knowing that you've been in touch

98
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,700
puts my mind at ease.

99
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:08,930
I just

100
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,170
didn't know about the pain in your wrist.

101
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,050
Make sure to have someone
take good care of you.

102
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:17,680
After all,

103
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,580
replying to so many letters

104
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,340
can be quite exhausting.

105
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:23,580
It's nothing serious.

106
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,340
The day grows late.

107
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,730
I shall leave you be.

108
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:30,370
Consort Dowager,

109
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,410
please stay for dinner.

110
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,580
The chef prepared your favorite delicacies.

111
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,850
Moyao, we shall proceed.

112
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,050
Consort Dowager.

113
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,490
Ten days later,

114
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:34,930
the official selection ceremony

115
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,900
will be held at the Zhenzhou Prefecture.

116
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,070
As usual,

117
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,170
each family must send a representative

118
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,780
to present their porcelain.

119
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,020
Mr. He,

120
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,680
none of us have been able

121
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,370
to produce black-bodied celadon.

122
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,220
If we go,

123
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,170
it might be in vain.

124
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,160
Indeed.

125
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,580
To go empty-handed...

126
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,140
The porcelain merchants of Lingquan

127
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,460
are in this together.

128
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,660
If one of us is selected,

129
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,820
it means we all are.

130
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,680
It was so in the past,

131
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,700
and it will be the same in the future.

132
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,260
The He family will share

133
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,660
our techniques and raw materials

134
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,530
with you all.

135
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,610
Wonderful.

136
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:20,930
This time,

137
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,140
I won't show up myself.

138
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,440
You will represent the He family

139
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,490
at the prefecture.

140
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,700
Starting next year,

141
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:31,610
you will take charge.

142
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,580
Thank you, Father.

143
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,340
Jia,

144
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,540
you're getting on in years as well.

145
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,200
It's time for your son

146
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,730
to gain some experience.

147
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,960
Otherwise, Lord Jiang might

148
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,100
not even recognize him.

149
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,940
Mr. He is right.

150
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,510
I'll have my son go out

151
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,770
and meet the challenges as well.

152
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,040
Everyone,

153
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,370
when did I ever say

154
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,490
this was the He family's work?

155
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,270
- What?
- What does that mean?

156
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,310
Zhen,

157
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,560
what do you mean?

158
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,770
The black-bodied celadon
was my creation in Beizhou.

159
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,340
It belongs to my Zhen's.

160
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,130
If it's to be presented,

161
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,610
it should be under the name
of Zhen's of Beizhou.

162
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:15,730
Ridiculous.

163
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,200
Zhen's?

164
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,240
That was a name

165
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,940
Father gave you.

166
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,070
Zhen's is merely

167
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,180
a branch of our He family.

168
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,350
Zhen,

169
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,420
we are all one family.

170
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,340
How could you

171
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,110
say something so disheartening?

172
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,610
Not only do I say it,

173
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,700
but I also refuse to share

174
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,760
the firing techniques

175
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,610
and raw materials.

176
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,700
You dare defy us?

177
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,870
Ingrate!

178
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:43,730
How dare you?

179
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,300
And why wouldn't she dare?

180
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,400
Princess.

181
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,730
- Princess.
- Princess.

182
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,130
Please sit.

183
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,830
Today, I am just the shopkeeper
of Yushao Porcelain Shop.

184
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,060
There's no need to be troubled.

185
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,610
Princess,

186
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,220
you must have heard

187
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,650
that the selection of Lingquan porcelain
as imperial tribute

188
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,540
is crucial

189
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,420
to the tax revenue
of the entire Zhenzhou County.

190
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,770
But my daughter insists on her own way,

191
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,160
and it could ruin

192
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,510
the hundred-year legacy

193
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,940
of Lingquan porcelain

194
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:33,080
and the financial stability of Zhenzhou.

195
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,200
Indeed.

196
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,010
That's right, Princess.

197
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,830
Zhen keeps speaking

198
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,850
of her Zhen's in Beizhou,

199
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,560
implying that her work

200
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,920
has no connection

201
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,060
to Lingquan of Zhenzhou.

202
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:47,960
You will

203
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,920
be the future Princess of Zhenzhou,

204
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,840
right?

205
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,230
Could you persuade her?

206
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,490
Yes. Please persuade her.

207
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:56,770
Persuasion usually requires

208
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,820
an exchange of conditions, does it not?

209
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,010
The imperial tribute is so important,

210
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,080
and He Zhen's black-bodied celadon

211
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,300
is the only choice.

212
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,110
Perhaps she should

213
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:07,460
be the one in charge from now on.

214
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,010
What? A woman in charge?

215
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:12,100
Why should she?

216
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,070
Mr. He,

217
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,560
do you know what He Zhen truly desires

218
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,970
upon her return?

219
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,730
Didn't you already say it?

220
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,540
She wants to take charge,

221
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,890
using the selection to bargain.

222
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,640
Princess,

223
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,000
this must

224
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,990
be an idea

225
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,370
you gave my sister.

226
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,460
What she wants

227
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,300
is not merely to take charge.

228
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,970
She wants the respect

229
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,340
of the He family,

230
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,720
the trade guild,

231
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,820
and all of Lingquan.

232
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,770
Taking charge isn't what matters.

233
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,120
The imperial tribute

234
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:46,580
isn't what matters either.

235
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,850
How can that not matter?

236
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,220
The Lingquan porcelain industry is complacent

237
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,560
and short-sighted,

238
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,830
selling only

239
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,320
to the imperial family

240
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,340
and the nobility.

241
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,400
Though this has been our century-old tradition,

242
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,100
it is not sustainable.

243
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,490
Losing half of the imperial tribute would mean

244
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:05,010
a loss of seventy to eighty percent
of our income.

245
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:06,890
But Lingquan's fine porcelain and celadon

246
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,250
are not the only porcelain in the world,

247
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,820
nor are Beizhou's black-bodied celadon.

248
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,870
What we need to do

249
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,250
is to open up trade routes,

250
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,680
making Lingquan

251
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,940
the capital of porcelain trade of the world.

252
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,250
As the saying goes,

253
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,970
porcelain flows throughout the world.

254
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:27,420
(He Mansion)

255
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,540
Haven't you

256
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,340
(He)
always wanted the He family?

257
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,350
You...

258
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:04,650
What is this about?

259
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,730
Father, only when you hold me in your heart

260
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,300
can I truly have the He family.

261
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,300
Inheriting the family business

262
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,490
is not important

263
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,580
for me.

264
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,390
(Black-Bodied Celadon)
This is the firing technique

265
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,610
and raw material formula
for black-bodied celadon.

266
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,100
I'm handing them over to you, Father.

267
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,710
I've also asked Ms. Liu

268
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,130
for Beizhou's deep brown clay.

269
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,680
She promised me

270
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,870
that in ten days,

271
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,350
she would have her escort agency

272
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,990
(Black-Bodied Celadon)
deliver a thousand dan.

273
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:37,940
Actually,

274
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,850
I've heard from the elders

275
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,850
that you praised my porcelain work

276
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,300
in front of them.

277
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:48,300
I may not have heard it myself,

278
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,300
but it made me

279
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,300
very happy.

280
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,460
Hard to say goodbye?

281
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,560
(He Mansion)

282
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,770
No need to be.

283
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,920
When your brothers get married,

284
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,160
we'll have to come back.

285
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,000
Isn't that right?

286
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,420
Don't be upset.

287
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,010
Let me take you somewhere.

288
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,650
Where?

289
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,700
Do you remember

290
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,370
when your brother

291
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,940
tricked us

292
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,340
into that restaurant

293
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,820
and drugged us?

294
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,040
When I held you

295
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,580
and put you on the bed,

296
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:40,700
I really wanted

297
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,280
to kiss you.

298
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:43,670
Why don't we

299
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,540
make up

300
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,490
for it now?

301
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,250
What are you talking about?

302
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,880
Look.

303
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,610
Being with me,

304
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:56,060
you'll be laughing so hard every day
that your stomach will hurt.

305
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,490
Physician Zhao,

306
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,700
I might need you to treat my stomach!

307
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,060
Why are you upset again?

308
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:11,830
Zhao Quan.

309
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,300
Are you sure you won't regret

310
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,730
going to the mountains
to make porcelain with me?

311
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,130
I've thought it over.

312
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,220
I can give up everything,

313
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,820
but I just want to be with you forever.

314
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,940
If you succeed in making porcelain,

315
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,970
I'll smile with you.

316
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,460
If you fail,

317
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,820
I'll cheer you up.

318
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,340
As long as you're willing,

319
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,010
I'll always assist you.

320
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,820
No matter where we go,

321
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,100
I'll stay with you forever.

322
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,180
Your Highness, ﻿practicing calligraphy?

323
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,180
Did you write this?

324
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,650
Do you like this piece?

325
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,680
I've seen many calligraphy works,

326
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,990
but I like yours the best.

327
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,440
(Kun)
This piece shows strength in the strokes.

328
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,440
It just so happens
that I don't have any decor at my place

329
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,060
that would be ideal for displaying calligraphy.

330
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:19,690
Miss Shi,

331
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,410
the character "Kun" is used by the Empress.

332
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,440
I may like it,

333
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,780
but in terms of status,

334
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,690
in front of others,

335
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,020
I absolutely wouldn't dare
to disrespect the Empress.

336
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:32,890
However,

337
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,850
as your elder sister,

338
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,540
it would be improper
for me to defer to you.

339
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,470
Do you remember

340
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,450
the jade pendant I always wear?

341
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:44,710
Why not add a stroke

342
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:45,820
to the character "Kun"

343
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,650
and make it "Shen"?

344
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,120
It signifies a beautiful jade,

345
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,640
and jade is a stone.

346
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,980
It suits us sisters perfectly.

347
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,640
But it would outshine

348
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,130
the Empress's "Kun" character.

349
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,780
Sister, if you want my calligraphy,

350
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,410
I shall not refuse.

351
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,060
But,

352
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,930
"Shen" is the ninth in the earthly branches,

353
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,070
and nine

354
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,650
is the number of the Emperor.

355
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:14,840
So in the calligraphy I give you,

356
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,750
I can't include the character "Shen,"

357
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,850
nor can I leave just the character "Wang."
[*Wang: Emperor]

358
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,410
Therefore...

359
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,060
(Tu)
[*Tu: Earth]

360
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,270
I'll give you

361
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,360
the character "Tu,"

362
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,300
signifying

363
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,750
that one should be down to earth.

364
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,610
What do you think?

365
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,480
I don't want it.

366
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,800
Sister,

367
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,410
the Empress wants you to have it.

368
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,820
So you must accept it.

369
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:51,410
Xueji,

370
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:54,060
don't forget Father's instructions.

371
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,210
Greetings, Your Highness.

372
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,240
Enter.

373
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,000
Your Highness,

374
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,340
I'm here to deliver the Emperor's decree.

375
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,580
His Majesty said

376
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,850
that as the weather turns colder,

377
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,130
the atmosphere in the palace
should change accordingly.

378
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,990
Warm clothing must be of the finest quality

379
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,230
but not wasteful.

380
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,650
We must practice thrift

381
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,200
and reduce the number of idle people

382
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,100
in the palace.

383
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,210
What does that mean?

384
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,260
I am not an idle person.

385
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:26,890
Of course not.

386
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,980
His Majesty cares for you, Miss Shi.

387
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,360
He said

388
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,790
that once you've visited

389
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:33,930
all the gardens in the palace,

390
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,850
you should be safely escorted out.

391
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:44,370
(Securing the Nation)
Your fourth daughter is talented and beautiful,

392
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,370
truly winning hearts.

393
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:50,210
She merely read some books

394
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,510
and learned a few minor skills,

395
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,170
nothing profound.

396
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,350
It's one thing for you

397
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,540
to be humble in front of me,

398
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,500
but you mustn't say that

399
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,980
at the betrothal discussion.

400
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:02,820
Betrothal discussion?

401
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:04,070
Yes.

402
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,070
With such a fine daughter

403
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,300
of marriageable age,

404
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,510
how can you not be anxious

405
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,020
to find her a good match?

406
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,210
Why do you look worried?

407
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,100
Is it because you haven't
found her a suitable match?

408
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,540
How about I take charge

409
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,920
and find a nobleman

410
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,930
for your fourth daughter to marry?

411
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,780
But she must also take this seriously.

412
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,740
If she always hangs out
with her sister in the palace,

413
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,740
she might miss out.

414
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,060
I am grateful for Your Majesty's concern.

415
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,850
No need.

416
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,610
This is also a matter of the royal family.

417
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,590
Yes.

418
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,980
However,

419
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,820
is this

420
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,210
Your Majesty's idea,

421
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,450
or did the Empress suggest it?

422
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,500
Pardon my directness,

423
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,850
(Virtuous and Disciplined)
but the Empress

424
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,540
lost her mother early

425
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,740
and was not properly guided,

426
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:15,270
so she retains some small-mindedness
from her lowly birth.

427
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:17,410
- I…
- The Empress

428
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,690
is the most virtuous and kind-hearted woman
I have ever known.

429
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,410
This is my own decision.

430
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,660
(Mansion of Lord Zhennan)

431
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,020
This year's flowers
are blooming better than ever.

432
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,440
Every year,

433
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,840
the flowers in your mansion

434
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,130
bloom the brightest.

435
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,740
Not at all.

436
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,690
It's the Mansion of Lord Huaiyang

437
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,020
that looks stunning.

438
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,600
Look over there.

439
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,640
There are even some new varieties.

440
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,840
Let's go over and take a look.

441
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,410
What kind is this?

442
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,340
It's called "Spring Day Mountain Bloom."

443
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,210
I apologize for being late.

444
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,020
Princess.

445
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,880
I wish you a joyous
and prosperous birthday, Madam.

446
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,340
I'm late today.

447
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,210
Please don't be upset.

448
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:11,840
You stand upon ceremony too much.

449
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,370
I am so delighted

450
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,450
that you could come today, Princess.

451
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,170
Greetings, Consort Dowager.

452
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,130
Greetings, Mrs. Lian,

453
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,210
Miss Lian.

454
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,710
The hairpin on your head

455
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,200
doesn't seem to be jade

456
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,880
or emerald.

457
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,580
Is it...

458
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,580
It's a night-glowing pearl.

459
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:34,930
A night-glowing pearl?

460
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:37,170
It's as big as a golden pill.

461
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:38,800
I've heard

462
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,200
that the Cui family has a legendary hairpin
with a night-glowing pearl.

463
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,690
Is this the one?

464
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:45,510
It's no longer in style

465
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,930
and isn't really a treasure.

466
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,920
It's been sitting at home

467
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,100
for so long.

468
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,260
Miantang looks good wearing it,

469
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,340
so I let her wear it.

470
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,610
But we'll have to wait until it gets dark

471
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:01,170
to see its glow.

472
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,590
There's still some time

473
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,370
before it gets dark.

474
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,120
I can't wait

475
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,100
to see the pearl's light.

476
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,740
Yes, Madam.

477
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:14,060
Before the banquet, let us have a look.

478
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,020
That's right.

479
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,070
In that case,

480
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,200
ladies,

481
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,510
since the other female guests

482
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,780
have not yet arrived,

483
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,820
please follow me to the tearoom.

484
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,740
How can this be?

485
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,720
The night-glowing pearl on this hairpin

486
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,980
isn't glowing.

487
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,370
What's going on?

488
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,540
This doesn't look like a night-glowing pearl,

489
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,890
more like an ordinary stone.

490
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,300
Sister,

491
00:23:58,030 --> 00:24:00,210
could it be that you don't want
to give it to her?

492
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,130
What nonsense!

493
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,980
I am a Consort Dowager.

494
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:07,020
If I didn't want to give it,

495
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,020
even the Great Deities

496
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,020
couldn't take it

497
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,610
from me.

498
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,820
If I wanted to give it,

499
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,640
why would I use a fake

500
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,540
to fool others?

501
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:20,070
Aunt, please don't be angry.

502
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,740
We all trust you.

503
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:24,030
But the gem on this hairpin

504
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,020
isn't the real night-glowing pearl.

505
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,370
Something must be wrong.

506
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,610
Let me ask you,

507
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,690
the other day I gave you the real hairpin,

508
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,890
did I not?

509
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,210
Yes, you did.

510
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,280
Good.

511
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,260
If that's the case,

512
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,820
then explain

513
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:48,690
why this hairpin has become a fake.

514
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,210
Did you switch it?

515
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,000
Yes.

516
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:55,890
Why?

517
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:04,120
I switched it

518
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,850
for the Consort Dowager's sake.

519
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,410
What do you mean?

520
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:10,370
The Consort Dowager has always

521
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,260
honored our ancestors and respected traditions.

522
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,510
According to ancestral rules,

523
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,580
this hairpin

524
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,960
should only be given to the new bride

525
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,210
after completing the six rites.

526
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,610
But the Consort Dowager,

527
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,610
out of kindness and deep affection for me,

528
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,020
feared that my humble origins

529
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,410
might invite criticism,

530
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:28,470
so she gave me

531
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,790
this hairpin early

532
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,300
to wear in public.

533
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:35,650
I wanted to honor her intention

534
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,990
but could not bear to let the Dowager

535
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,540
break the rules for my sake.

536
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,930
If I were to defy her,

537
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,690
I would be unfilial.

538
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,450
If I were to comply,

539
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,930
the Consort Dowager would
be going against family tradition.

540
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:51,100
I was truly in a difficult position,

541
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,890
so I came up with a foolish idea:

542
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:56,200
to wear an ordinary hairpin

543
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,780
before completing the six rites,

544
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,610
hoping to please both sides.

545
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,740
But today,

546
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,440
I have made a fool of myself

547
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,540
in front of all the ladies.

548
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:08,020
I am indeed guilty

549
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,690
and ask for the Consort Dowager's punishment.

550
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,300
So you're saying

551
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:15,980
the real hairpin hasn't been lost?

552
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,410
It hasn't.

553
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,450
Princess, please rise.

554
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:27,060
Your loyalty should be praised,

555
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,060
not punished.

556
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,170
Thank you for your kindness and mercy.

557
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,160
Since the real hairpin isn't lost,

558
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:37,960
why not bring it out?

559
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:41,030
It could clear up the misunderstanding

560
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,930
and prove the Princess's innocence.

561
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,060
Also,

562
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:48,210
we've all been curious

563
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,030
about the night-glowing pearl all day

564
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,820
and would love to see it.

565
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:53,370
Yes.

566
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,130
Well…

567
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,960
Binglan,

568
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,020
your manners.

569
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:02,680
How can the hairpin be shown here?

570
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,840
To see it,

571
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,020
you'd have to visit the mansion,

572
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,300
wouldn't you all agree?

573
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,890
Yes.

574
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,520
Consort Dowager.

575
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,610
Princess, what do you think?

576
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,300
You're all welcome to visit.

577
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,840
This is the best time of year

578
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,690
to see the flowers.

579
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,920
Lord Lian has an urgent case,

580
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,850
concerning the royal family.

581
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,240
What happened?

582
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,240
Sister,

583
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,260
Hanshan is dealing with an urgent case

584
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:43,820
involving the royal family.

585
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,580
How is the situation at the front?

586
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:17,350
My Lord.

587
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,650
When will reinforcements arrive?

588
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,980
We received word

589
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,820
that the Ji and Lu armies
haven't sent reinforcements.

590
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,650
They are holding their positions,
and it's unclear why.

591
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,680
What's worse,

592
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,100
the Left Wing of the Prince Lu's army,
originally heading for Dongling Pass,

593
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:30,890
was not intercepted

594
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:33,020
and is now turning back towards Tongyu.

595
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,880
If they form a pincer movement
with the Right Wing army

596
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,920
outside the valley,

597
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,100
we stand no chance of victory.

598
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,150
My Lord,

599
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,260
what should we do now?

600
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,540
We're outnumbered

601
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,210
and cannot afford a direct confrontation.

602
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,300
Today, they will surely launch an attack.

603
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,920
Mount Li's bare rocky walls

604
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,240
and narrow path

605
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,800
make it easy to defend and difficult to attack.

606
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,240
For now, we can only retreat to Mount Li,

607
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,450
use the terrain to hold them off,

608
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,100
and then find a way to break through.

609
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,640
Pass the order:

610
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,410
the entire army is to retreat to Mount Li.

611
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,800
As you command.

612
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,980
Bring him in.

613
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,340
Greetings, Consort Dowager.

614
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,030
I'm Gu,

615
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:22,340
the owner of Yongli Pawnshop.

616
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:24,580
I've been running the business
in Zhenzhou for ten years.

617
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,160
Repeat what you just said,

618
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,780
word for word.

619
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,820
Yesterday, a customer came to my shop.

620
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,260
It was a maid servant.

621
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:36,070
She wanted to pawn a hairpin.

622
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,550
The moment I saw it,

623
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:39,070
I knew it was no ordinary item.

624
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,360
After asking further,

625
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,540
she revealed that it belonged
to the Mansion of Lord Huaiyang.

626
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,260
Ladies, please take a look.

627
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,060
Could this be the real
night-glowing pearl hairpin?

628
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,610
What did the maid say?

629
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:09,750
After I questioned her repeatedly,

630
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,070
she only said

631
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,600
it belonged to her mistress,

632
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,690
who was in a hurry to pawn it.

633
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:14,890
I did not dare

634
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,980
to ask further.

635
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:19,130
Her mistress?

636
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:21,930
Does that not mean the Princess?

637
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,370
Bring Princess Huaisang here.

638
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,360
The item is in the room.

639
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,610
Wait here for a moment.

640
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,890
I just couldn't understand.

641
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,360
She's destined to become a princess consort.

642
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,210
The hairpin would be hers eventually.

643
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,600
Why pawn it?

644
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,360
I heard she has businesses

645
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,780
in Beizhou.

646
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,100
That explains it.

647
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:55,750
The rewards she gets stay in the royal family.

648
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,000
It's always better

649
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,820
to send money back home.

650
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:01,740
This is the way of small households.

651
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,170
If you wish to marry into the royal family,

652
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,410
you must be of equal status.

653
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,450
Enough, say no more.

654
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,360
I've changed my attire.

655
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,650
Sorry to keep you all waiting.

656
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,210
I find the pearl the Princess is wearing

657
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:28,930
seems even brighter.

658
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,760
Indeed.

659
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,450
How could there be two hairpins?

660
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,500
How did the fake

661
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,980
end up in the hands
of the Consort Dowager?

662
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,580
The fake?

663
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:41,780
It's fake?

664
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,690
How do you know it's fake?

665
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,650
Because I made it.

666
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:50,440
I mixed jade powder and fluorite powder,

667
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,340
melted them into a paste,

668
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,450
and coated a porcelain bead with it.

669
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,710
As long as it's exposed
to enough sunlight during the day,

670
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,370
it will glow for several nights.

671
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,590
The method is known to the craftsmen

672
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:01,740
at the Lingquan's porcelain kilns.

673
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,610
For a roll of silk, they can make one for you.

674
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,790
The fake one will shatter if dropped.

675
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:06,690
If you don't believe me,

676
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:07,930
you can try.

677
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,540
It's porcelain.

678
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,610
Bring the person in.

679
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,450
Madam Wang?

680
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,070
This Madam Wang has

681
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:56,210
been spying on my trousseau several times.

682
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,740
I became wary

683
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,510
and prepared a fake in advance

684
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,450
to prevent any mishaps.

685
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,720
Sure enough,

686
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,400
she took the hairpin

687
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,450
while I pretended to sleep.

688
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:07,110
I had the Lord's shadow guards

689
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,210
keep an eye on her.

690
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,820
It's strange

691
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,160
that this Madam Wang,

692
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,170
who came from the palace,

693
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:14,500
has visited not only the mansion
and her own house

694
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,960
but also several other places.

695
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,800
Be careful.

696
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,300
For instance,

697
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,760
the Lian Mansion.

698
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,070
Don't you dare slander me.

699
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,680
I merely had her come once

700
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,270
to teach the young ladies proper etiquette.

701
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:31,170
Once?

702
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,360
Once,

703
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,780
or twice at most.

704
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,610
What's the problem?

705
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,230
If you can invite her,

706
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,790
why can't the Lians?

707
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,400
Mrs. Lian, please calm down.

708
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,650
I didn't say anything.

709
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,240
Aunt, didn't you just think

710
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:53,340
this fake hairpin was real?

711
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:56,510
The Consort Dowager cherishes the hairpin.

712
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,790
She keeps it stored away

713
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:58,980
and rarely takes it out.

714
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,450
It's understandable

715
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:01,810
that she couldn't tell at first glance.

716
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,150
Indeed.

717
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:05,780
I've only worn it a few times.

718
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,680
It's always kept in my trousseau,

719
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,130
too precious to use.

720
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,330
The owner might not recognize it,

721
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,330
but there's someone

722
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,130
who surely can.

723
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:16,940
Mr. Gu,

724
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,170
you've been in the pawn business for decades.

725
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,280
How could you not tell the difference

726
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,880
between porcelain and a genuine pearl?

727
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,250
I...

728
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,860
I made a mistake.

729
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,720
It happens.

730
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,940
A mistake?

731
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,970
Madam Wang stealing the hairpin
would've been bad enough,

732
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,650
but it had to happen tonight,

733
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,860
when all the noble ladies of Zhenzhou are here.

734
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,190
Someone came forward

735
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,630
to accuse the mansion of harboring a thief,

736
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,610
tarnishing my reputation.

737
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,720
Isn't this intentional framing?

738
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,060
- General Fan.
- At your service.

739
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,580
Interrogate Gu thoroughly for me.

740
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,730
Right away.

741
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,690
I'm innocent.

742
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,810
- I'm innocent.
- I did it.

743
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,400
That day,

744
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,650
I took the hairpin

745
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,130
to pawn it.

746
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,760
That's her. I remember now.

747
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,960
She was the one yesterday.

748
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,860
No doubt about it.

749
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,470
Madam Wang,

750
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,860
you taught me the rules yourself.

751
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,380
Over the years,

752
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,170
I've paid you well.

753
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,610
Why did you steal?

754
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,290
Consort Dowager,

755
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:25,770
it's all about the money.

756
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,870
See?

757
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,920
Now all the testimonies match up,

758
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,500
and the truth is out.

759
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,580
I apologize, everyone.

760
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,360
Today is the Madam Zhao's birthday.

761
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,020
It shouldn't have happened.

762
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:41,420
Mrs. Lian.

763
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,830
What is it now?

764
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:47,110
Shall we leave this thief

765
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,840
and this unobservant shopkeeper

766
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,890
to Lord Lian for judgment?

767
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:53,450
Good.

768
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,450
That would be best.

769
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,290
Princess,

770
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:06,580
you've been wronged.

771
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,810
Do you realize your mistake?

772
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,280
Princess,

773
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,860
what do you mean?

774
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,840
Today, you were the first

775
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,020
to doubt about the hairpin.

776
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,100
Instead of questioning the servants,

777
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,060
you pointed fingers at me,

778
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,110
insisting

779
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,860
there was something suspicious.

780
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,240
Were you trying to make our family
a laughingstock

781
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,440
in front of all these noble guests?

782
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,320
No.

783
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,250
I was just anxious.

784
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,920
The Consort Dowager has always

785
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,300
been careful with her words and actions,

786
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:34,460
prioritizing the honor of the family.

787
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,150
Even I, who only recently came here,

788
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,290
have taken this to heart.

789
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,360
You've been raised here,

790
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,580
yet you don't remember?

791
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:44,670
My apologies.

792
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,880
I was just

793
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,550
eager to find the real hairpin

794
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:49,400
and got carried away.

795
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,290
If you cannot speak properly, just be silent.

796
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,500
We don't need your opinions here.

797
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,380
Mrs. Lian.

798
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:12,150
I have a few private words

799
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,610
to say to Mrs. Lian.

800
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,250
Please wait a moment.

801
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:16,690
Just say it quickly.

802
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:27,870
Madam.

803
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:30,650
Since I've already confessed,

804
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:33,330
I won't implicate anyone else.

805
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,420
Thank you.

806
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,190
I'll ensure that Hanshan shows leniency
in your punishment.

807
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,580
Twenty years ago, when you asked me

808
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,900
whether to marry Lord Cui,

809
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:44,770
if I hadn't

810
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:47,290
critiqued his flirtatious nature

811
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:50,540
and hastily given you advice,

812
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,840
you might not

813
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,330
have exchanged the marriage certificate
with your sister's.

814
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,330
Your life now might

815
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:01,420
be of wealth and luxury,

816
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,330
rather than struggling

817
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:06,170
to maintain what you have.

818
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,690
You're helping me

819
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:12,100
out of guilt.

820
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,900
What I owed you,

821
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,810
I've already

822
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,060
repaid in full.

823
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,420
Farewell.

824
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,580
This mansion

825
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,330
was meant to be mine.

826
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,860
And if not mine,

827
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,130
then Binglan's.

828
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,860
I won't accept this fate.

829
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:01,900
(One day seems longer than months three.
One day seems long as seasons three.)

830
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,080
Madam,

831
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:18,420
the Consort Dowager has been ill for days

832
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,590
due to concerns
over Xingzhou's military matters.

833
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:22,290
Yet, you seem so calm.

834
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,960
Xingzhou is good at using surprise tactics

835
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,740
and always finds a way
out of desperate situations.

836
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,730
There's no need for me to worry.

837
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,500
I mean

838
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,020
you rarely attend to the Consort Dowager
at her sickbed.

839
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,320
I'm afraid

840
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,810
people will talk.

841
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,770
Many visitors have come

842
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,420
to see the ailing Consort Dowager.

843
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:44,860
Mrs. Lian

844
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,990
attends to her

845
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:48,540
even more diligently than I do,

846
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,210
fearing I might show my filial piety

847
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,290
and steal their good reputation.

848
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,290
So, I might as well

849
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:59,380
give the Consort Dowager some peace.

850
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:08,940
After practicing for so long,

851
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:11,290
it finally has some grace as Xingzhou's.

852
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,120
Princess,

853
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,250
the Consort Dowager requests your presence.

854
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,540
Mrs. Lian.

855
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:43,900
The children's marriages

856
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,730
are of utmost importance to me as well.

857
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:49,500
You may all return now.

858
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,730
I will ensure that everyone is satisfied.

859
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,540
Thank you, Consort Dowager.

860
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:09,910
Miantang, you're here.

861
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,590
Consort Dowager, how are you feeling?

862
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:17,650
Much better.

863
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:19,380
I was just feeling bored

864
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:21,210
and wanted someone to talk to.

865
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:22,990
Please sit.

866
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:28,580
I've been resting these past few days.

867
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:30,840
From a quick glimpse of you

868
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,250
in the crowd,

869
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:34,420
I could tell

870
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,070
you were the one

871
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:37,270
most worried about Xingzhou

872
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:38,730
besides me.

873
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,060
It seems

874
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:42,550
like we're the only ones in this house

875
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:43,810
who truly trust him.

876
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:47,540
Consort Dowager, please don't worry too much.

877
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,110
Xingzhou is very capable.

878
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:50,810
He'll surely land on my feet.

879
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,160
Yes.

880
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:54,380
I'm no longer worried.

881
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,540
I just hope he returns soon.

882
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,190
When the men are away,

883
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:01,460
all that's left for the women

884
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:02,940
is waiting.

885
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,730
When Xingzhou's father took concubines,

886
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:10,210
I wasn't exactly happy about it.

887
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,240
After all,

888
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,100
no woman wants to share her husband.

889
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:18,130
But now that he is gone,

890
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:20,990
I've come to appreciate the benefits of that.

891
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:22,510
It left me

892
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:24,150
with sisters to talk to,

893
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,650
so I wouldn't be that lonely.

894
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,690
It's easier when your husband is around,

895
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,770
but once his affection fades

896
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,250
and you're left as a widow,

897
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:35,580
you must learn to stay low-key.

898
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,770
The future of the children

899
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:39,920
depends entirely

900
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,380
on the head lady in the family.

901
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,250
When you become the Princess one day,

902
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:46,590
you'll understand

903
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:48,380
the power that comes with it.

904
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,610
A woman's beauty

905
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,250
doesn't last long.

906
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:55,630
Only virtue endures,

907
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:57,210
commanding respect

908
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:58,980
through the years.

909
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,610
You're right, Consort Dowager.

910
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:01,990
Thus,

911
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:02,880
I've never

912
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,420
pursued power.

913
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:05,960
My heart isn't as broad as yours,

914
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,900
Consort Dowager.

915
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:09,210
I only wish

916
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:11,610
