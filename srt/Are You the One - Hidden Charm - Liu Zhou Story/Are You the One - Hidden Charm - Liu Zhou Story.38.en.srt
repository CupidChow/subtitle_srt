If you like,

I'll introduce you.

17
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,960
Very well.

18
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,870
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

19
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,270
Please.

20
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,030
You must be Princess of Huaiyang.

21
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,120
Greetings, Your Highness.

22
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,270
Aunt.

23
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,150
This is my niece,

24
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,080
Gai Yurao.

25
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,470
Nice to meet you.

26
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,360
If you want to pay your respects,

27
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,710
you should go to the West Courtyard.

28
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,310
It's not appropriate for you

29
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,710
to come here today.

30
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:36,000
Yurao is accompanying me.

31
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,800
Miantang,

32
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,030
you always think of yourself

33
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,360
as a member of the Cui family.

34
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,710
How could you forget

35
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,520
that I'm also the daughter of the Gai family?

36
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,680
Come on.

37
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:51,990
Yurao,

38
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,710
sit here.

39
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,960
Your Highness, please sit.

40
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:57,750
Aunt,

41
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,030
that's Miantang's seat.

42
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,840
No need to be so particular.

43
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,150
We're all family.

44
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,190
It doesn't matter where we sit,

45
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,870
does it?

46
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,800
Indeed.

47
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,960
It's all the same.

48
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:14,870
Very well.

49
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,430
Everyone, take your seats.

50
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,590
Home.

51
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,080
Are you

52
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,240
men of Prince Sui?

53
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,430
Since you know,

54
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,190
you should understand
what he's capable of.

55
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:51,710
Speak.

56
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,960
Tell Prince Sui

57
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:57,080
that if he wants to slander me

58
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,280
as a way to get me to join him.

59
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,430
In two words:

60
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,430
No way.

61
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,910
I'm no chief instructor.

62
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,240
And I'm not going

63
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,840
to be in the company of you punks.

64
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,120
If you want to kill me, go ahead.

65
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,560
You do not fear death,

66
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,920
nor do you fear us killing your son?

67
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,000
You can't do that.

68
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,960
If you want money,

69
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,310
I'll give it to you.

70
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,430
Five thousand taels of gold.

71
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,680
Five thousand taels of gold?

72
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,750
Five thousand taels of gold…

73
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,680
Son,

74
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,870
I'm a man of integrity.

75
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,630
I'm afraid I can't protect you this time.

76
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,800
In the next life,

77
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,000
we'll be father and son again.

78
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,480
- Help!
- Someone's coming! Run! Go!

79
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,920
Help!

80
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,430
Save me!

81
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,680
I'm here.

82
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:27,830
Over here.

83
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,670
Leave it to me.

84
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,830
Go after them.

85
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,670
Aye.

86
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,430
Xingzhou?

87
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,190
- Xingzhou.
- Duke.

88
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,040
Xingzhou has more and more affairs
to manage in the capital.

89
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,520
It seems

90
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,310
we should start preparing a residence.

91
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,510
I've asked around a few places.

92
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,070
It's just that I'm new to the capital

93
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,190
and I can't tell
the difference between locations.

94
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,040
So I would like to ask for your advice.

95
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,870
Which locations have you selected?

96
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,000
Let's hear it.

97
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,830
One is on East 4th Street,

98
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:04,070
one is in Muyuan Garden
in the south of the city,

99
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,950
and the other

100
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,190
is in Bamboo Lane.

101
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,520
Your Highness, that's not a good idea.

102
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,520
I've heard

103
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,040
that the Feng Shui of Bamboo Lane

104
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,360
is not very good

105
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,120
for one's career.

106
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,120
Is that so?

107
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,000
Lady Meng,

108
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,070
you come from a scholarly family

109
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,870
and even understand Feng Shui?

110
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,270
It's just something she heard.

111
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,600
But since choosing a residence
is a significant matter.

112
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,950
It's better to be safe

113
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,510
than sorry.

114
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,160
Madam Meng speaks wisely.

115
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,480
I shall give it more thought.

116
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,080
Your Highness.

117
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,360
You cannot stay here any longer.

118
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:11,790
Take this.

119
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,080
- Don't move.
- Don't move.

120
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,030
What are you doing?

121
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,440
Go.

122
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,270
Go.

123
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,470
Foolish girl.

124
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,750
Bamboo is good

125
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,000
for officials and wealth in Feng Shui.

126
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,240
Why did you bring that up?

127
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:26,270
Aren't you afraid of others

128
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,830
discovering the secrets of Bamboo Lane?

129
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,590
Mother,

130
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:30,950
how did you know

131
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,000
what's going on in Bamboo Lane?

132
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,720
If you don't want others to know,

133
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,120
then don't do it in the first place.

134
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,000
Your father discovered it.

135
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,830
He went to see that performer today.

136
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,430
He's a musician.

137
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,920
Call him what you will.

138
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,310
He's a man who seeks wealth

139
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,360
and will flee far away

140
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,600
once he has the money.

141
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,720
Don't be so obsessed.

142
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:56,950
What are you doing?

143
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,510
Do you not know

144
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,750
what you've done?

145
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,160
That's a good one.

146
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:06,920
This must be a trap

147
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,190
of your own making, Mr. Meng.

148
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,990
Is this the honor of a family
with generations of officials?

149
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,870
If Meng Wan knew that her father was

150
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,390
- trying to separate us this way...
- Silence.

151
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,120
How could Wan fall for someone like you?

152
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,040
Shut up.

153
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,160
I'll have your heads if you don't.

154
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,800
What treachery
did you plot against the Lord

155
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,950
during your secret meeting today?

156
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,000
What?

157
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,240
Chief Instructor,

158
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,920
there's no need

159
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,960
to play dumb before us.

160
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,390
Speak.

161
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,000
Are you men of Prince Sui?

162
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,480
Since you know,

163
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,910
you should understand
what he's capable of.

164
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,200
Speak.

165
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,030
This is outrageous.

166
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,270
I have lived a life of integrity.

167
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,240
I will never collude with traitors.

168
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,840
Do what you must.

169
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,320
Untie them.

170
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,510
The situation is urgent,

171
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,600
and I had no choice
but to take this drastic measure.

172
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,200
Please forgive me.

173
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,080
Xingzhou,

174
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,350
are you

175
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,600
testing me?

176
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,800
I had no intention

177
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,840
of prying into your personal affairs.

178
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,440
I beg for your forgiveness.

179
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,840
The mighty Lord Huaiyang

180
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,000
(Respect and Simplicity)
behaves like a bandit.

181
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,000
Your methods are as direct

182
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,320
as they are shameless.

183
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,720
It's what I've learned

184
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,320
from you.

185
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,510
So, in your opinion,

186
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,630
neither Duke Qing

187
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,750
nor Mr. Meng are suspects?

188
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,790
Mr. Meng

189
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,840
is indeed upright

190
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,390
and has nothing to do with this case.

191
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,630
His wife and daughter

192
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,550
are also beyond suspicion.

193
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,960
As for Duke Qing,

194
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,600
even with his son's life at stake,

195
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,750
we couldn't get anything from him.

196
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,080
As an official of such high rank,

197
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,630
that man seems to be penniless.

198
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,350
Guess he's clean.

199
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,120
Penniless?

200
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,800
Is there something wrong with that?

201
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,840
Today,

202
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,600
I saw the concubine of Guo Yi.

203
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,870
Gai Yurao's clothes are made

204
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,360
of dark-patterned cloud satin,

205
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,550
and her jade bracelet,
though unremarkable at first glance,

206
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,750
is made of extremely rare Tushan jade

207
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,080
from Xijing.

208
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,360
I've only seen it once

209
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,670
while on an escort mission.

210
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,150
There are likely fewer than three pieces

211
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,000
in the capital.

212
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,080
Yurao,

213
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,870
your bracelet

214
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:37,960
is quite fine,

215
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:41,360
but it doesn't seem transparent enough.

216
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,360
I have a few similar ones at home.

217
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,670
If you like,

218
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,960
I'll give one to you another day.

219
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,720
Even if this bracelet

220
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,080
isn't the finest,

221
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,480
it was a gift from Yi,

222
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,390
who put it on me himself.

223
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,280
His affection

224
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,720
outweighs the value.

225
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,790
As long as his feelings for me are sincere,

226
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,670
the quality of the jade

227
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,000
matters not.

228
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,000
My brother-in-law truly knows

229
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,600
how to cherish his woman.

230
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,200
But Gai Yurao doesn't recognize its worth

231
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,030
and merely considers it
an ordinary piece of jade.

232
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,600
If she knew the true value of that bracelet,

233
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,030
she wouldn't dare to flaunt it so boldly.

234
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,840
Honey,

235
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,550
well,

236
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,080
as Duke Qing

237
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,320
is upright,

238
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,480
and Guo Yi has no official position,

239
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,320
where did the money come from?

240
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,910
I didn't

241
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,030
bring my sister

242
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,960
any gifts this time.

243
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,390
It's my fault as a younger brother.

244
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,000
In the next few days, I'm going to ask Guo Yi

245
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,600
what my sister likes

246
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,630
and where I should go to buy it.

247
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,840
I've heard
that before your eldest sister got married,

248
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,960
Nanny Li and Nanny Zhou

249
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,200
were quite close.

250
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,510
Tomorrow,

251
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,240
let's give Nanny Li a half-day off

252
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,600
so she can have a drink

253
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:07,840
and catch up with Nanny Zhou.

254
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,000
My Chamber of Radiant

255
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,360
is the largest cosmetic shop in the capital.

256
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,910
There's a wide range for you

257
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,240
to choose from.

258
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,440
Hello.

259
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,150
Show us all the latest items you've got here.

260
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,160
Certainly.

261
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,750
There are so many varieties of cosmetics

262
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,150
in the capital.

263
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:31,750
Brother,

264
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,280
help me pick something.

265
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,080
You must be well aware

266
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,390
of my sister's preferences.

267
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,750
Then...

268
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,560
This one.

269
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,550
This looks good.

270
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,270
It has a hidden part.

271
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,870
It contains four colors of lip balm

272
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,270
and a powder box in the center.

273
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,720
Fu will love it.

274
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,670
Mr. Guo has good taste.

275
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,750
This Five Blessings is a new product.

276
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,550
Since you're a regular customer,

277
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,870
I'll only charge you five guan.

278
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,720
Five Blessings.

279
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,920
Great.

280
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,120
It has a good meaning as well.

281
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,560
By the way.

282
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,440
Among the cosmetics that Mr. Guo bought

283
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,150
for his wife previously,

284
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,790
are there any of excellent quality?

285
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,270
There are.

286
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,440
But those were for...

287
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,080
Just bring them out

288
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,840
and stop talking nonsense.

289
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,550
He's not very good at talking.

290
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,840
In fact,

291
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,750
these are quite nice too.

292
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,870
You...

293
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,750
Brother,

294
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,790
you do have good taste.

295
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,550
My sister always says

296
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,990
that new things can't compare to the old.

297
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,600
She's a sentimental person.

298
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,550
Instead of giving her

299
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,670
these trendy items,

300
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,670
it's better to gift her

301
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,250
something that brings back fond memories.

302
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,590
Okay.

303
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,800
This is it.

304
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,840
All right.

305
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,920
Mr. Guo,

306
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,960
it's a bit more affordable now.

307
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,150
One guan cheaper.

308
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,240
Now it's just two taels of gold.

309
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,840
Same arrangement as before?

310
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,920
Of course.

311
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,110
Put it all on my tab.

312
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,360
No way. That's inappropriate.

313
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:16,840
I'm buying this gift for my sister.

314
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,210
How could I let you pay for it?

315
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,360
No, no. I insist.

316
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,030
We're family.

317
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,670
No need to be so formal.

318
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,480
Since it's for Fu,

319
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:29,390
it's only right that I cover the cost.

320
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,230
From now on,

321
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,120
if you have anything that catches your eye

322
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,270
in the capital,

323
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,670
just put it on my tab.

324
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,200
You're too generous.

325
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:41,670
Well,

326
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,440
I won't refuse then.

327
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,280
Please

328
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,240
get five boxes in different colors

329
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,320
to make a "Five Blessings" set.

330
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,790
- All right.
- Wrap them up.

331
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,350
These are quite interesting.

332
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,510
Your taste is truly unique.

333
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,840
Truly unique.

334
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,670
What a sin.

335
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,510
When Fu got married,

336
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,600
her dowry

337
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,550
filled two entire boats.

338
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:17,600
But now,

339
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,360
not even half of it remains.

340
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,150
Isn't she in charge of the household?

341
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,000
How could Guo spend her dowry

342
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:25,750
so recklessly?

343
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,630
He has others

344
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,080
bring the bills directly to Fu

345
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,030
and take the money from the household expenses.

346
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,670
Although she manages the household,

347
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,550
the key to the storeroom

348
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,670
is still with the Duke's wife.

349
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,790
In the end, the money spent

350
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,720
can only be covered by her dowry.

351
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,790
Why didn't she tell Duke Qing?

352
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:48,350
Fu knows

353
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,200
the Duke's family is of significance

354
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,030
and doesn't want to escalate the matter,

355
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:54,100
which could affect the relationship
between the two families.

356
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:54,840
So,

357
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,840
she just

358
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,600
holds her tongue.

359
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,630
Have you heard anything else?

360
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,040
That's right.

361
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,080
Nanny Zhou mentioned

362
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,270
that three months ago,

363
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,000
Guo started reducing his expenses

364
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,910
and stopped borrowing money.

365
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,120
It seems he did some business

366
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,360
and earned some money.

367
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,360
Fu even thought

368
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,440
that maybe he'd mend his ways

369
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:22,240
and wouldn't use her dowry anymore.

370
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,200
But after a few days,

371
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,390
he was at it again.

372
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:34,360
The money he's spent on Gai Yurao

373
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,030
is worth over a thousand taels of gold.

374
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,390
What kind of business could he have done

375
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,720
in such a short time

376
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,270
to earn so much

377
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:42,870
that he doesn't even care
about the dowry anymore?

378
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,630
Three months ago,

379
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,630
the unrest in Dongzhou was quelled.

380
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:49,870
And this month,

381
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,440
he started

382
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,910
using her dowry again.

383
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:54,750
Why?

384
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:00,150
His Majesty found out
about the chief instructor,

385
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,200
and Prince Sui

386
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,550
became wary.

387
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,000
So,

388
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,720
Guo Yi's business outside

389
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,030
suddenly came to an abrupt end.

390
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:11,400
(Respect and Simplicity)

391
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,790
If you were Prince Sui,

392
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,750
who would you appoint

393
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,680
as the chief instructor?

394
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:20,350
If I were him,

395
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:24,240
I'd pick a family member of a political rival.

396
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,310
Catch them off guard

397
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:29,960
and cause internal strife.

398
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,480
The so-called traitor

399
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,310
is Duke Qing's negligence

400
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,880
in guarding his own son.

401
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,680
Exactly.

402
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,830
That's a blind spot.

403
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,030
You can't see it coming.

404
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,440
But we don't have concrete evidence yet,

405
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,070
so we must be careful not to alert them.

406
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,280
It doesn't matter.

407
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,070
If there's no evidence,

408
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,790
I'll make them

409
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,590
bring it to me.

410
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,480
I'll break his leg

411
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,960
and see if he'll give it to me.

412
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,960
My eldest sister has endured so much

413
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,720
for me

414
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,650
and the entire family.

415
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,830
She does it for you,

416
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,590
just as you want

417
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,510
to stand up for her.

418
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,510
But if she knew

419
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,880
you were acting so impulsively

420
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,000
for her,

421
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,640
she'd be upset.

422
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,350
Yes.

423
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,630
You're right.

424
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,270
There must be another way.

425
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,110
Of course.

426
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,760
Guo Yi

427
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,880
is your sister's husband.

428
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,240
Whatever his fate,

429
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,590
your sister

430
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,720
naturally has a say in it.

431
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,110
The powder from the Chamber of Radiant.

432
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,480
It is as famous

433
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,830
as the Scent Store in the South.

434
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,590
I've seen this kind before.

435
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:20,680
It's expensive, is it?

436
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,550
Well,

437
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,590
there's money to be spent.

438
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,550
One box would be enough.

439
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,240
Don't be wasteful.

440
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,350
Sister,

441
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,150
it wasn't me.

442
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:38,630
It was my brother-in-law.

443
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,920
At least he's thoughtful.

444
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,830
But let's not give him too much credit.

445
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,310
If you think about it,

446
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,830
it's all your money

447
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:56,790
anyway.

448
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:57,950
You…

449
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,230
Why did you…

450
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,480
Did Liu Miantang

451
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,400
say something to you?

452
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,790
I know all the grievances you've suffered

453
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,200
over the years.

454
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,350
Sister,

455
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,640
Miantang and I have discussed it.

456
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,200
We'll make sure

457
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,000
he slips up.

458
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,960
But in the end, he's still my brother-in-law.

459
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,400
I must hear what you think.

460
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,480
Ever since that Gai Yurao came,

461
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,440
there's been no affection left

462
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,480
between Guo Yi and me.

463
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:47,000
He gave Gai a great deal of favor,

464
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,960
yet in front of others,

465
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,750
he acts like

466
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,160
we're the perfect couple.

467
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,110
The Duke's wife turns a blind eye,

468
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,110
and I can only swallow my bitterness.

469
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:05,150
Xingzhou,

470
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,480
I once thought

471
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,000
patience was my only option,

472
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,160
that I'd have to muddle

473
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,720
through life this way.

474
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:16,150
Thank you for showing me

475
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,790
there's another way.

476
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,960
Don't say that.

477
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,040
As long as I'm here,

478
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,590
everything will get better for you.

479
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,350
How has His Majesty been treating you lately?

480
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,270
The same as usual.

481
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,240
A few days ago, he even had people

482
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,110
prepare for my birthday.

483
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,440
The same as usual?

484
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,680
You're being modest.

485
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,550
From what I see,

486
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,000
he seems to be showering you

487
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,000
with affection.

488
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,680
You were nearly made Empress, weren't you?

489
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:02,070
Your plans are my priority.

490
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,430
I dare not

491
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,480
think of anything else.

492
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:10,030
I know you're filial.

493
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,790
But he's been

494
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,110
pressing me hard,

495
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:18,000
almost accusing me

496
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,480
of insubordination at the Three Bureaus.

497
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,830
I'm here today to remind you

498
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:28,030
not to be lulled into complacency by him.

499
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,830
I understand.

500
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,350
My husband said

501
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,550
that we've been living

502
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:35,880
in the West Courtyard for quite some time

503
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,480
and haven't hosted a banquet yet.

504
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,830
That's inappropriate.

505
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,150
So today,

506
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,070
I brought a small gift

507
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,160
for my eldest sister and Yurao.

508
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:47,070
I hope you can forgive me.

509
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,190
Nanny Li.

510
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,590
Sister.

511
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,520
Yurao.

512
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,030
I'm new to the capital

513
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,790
and don't know what to give.

514
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,440
I had to ask around at other noble families

515
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,750
and chose two hairpins

516
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,990
according to the proper etiquette
for the wife and concubine.

517
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,110
Sister,

518
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,200
this night-glowing pearl is quite a rarity.

519
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:19,440
There shouldn't be more than two

520
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,160
in the entire capital.

521
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,550
Hope you like it.

522
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,720
I do.

523
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,750
Such a dazzling hairpin.

524
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,400
Any woman would love it.

525
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,590
I like it very much.

526
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,030
Yurao,

527
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,960
I'm sure you've never seen

528
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,680
a pearl with such luster, have you?

529
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,240
I...

530
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,110
I don't want it.

531
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,070
It's important to know your own worth.

532
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,480
There's a difference

533
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,750
between what you want but can't have

534
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,720
and what you can have but don't want.

535
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,000
This is the only heirloom

536
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,510
of the Cui family.

537
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,160
You must take great care of it.

538
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,750
I definitely will.

539
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,310
Sister, you must keep this a secret

540
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,310
from the Consort Dowager.

541
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,840
Sorry.

542
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,240
I apologize.

543
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,280
I don't have

544
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,790
any night-glowing pearl hairpins here.

545
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,800
You don't?

546
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:15,110
Isn't it the best jewelry shop in the capital?

547
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,840
- That's right.
- If you don't have it,

548
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,070
where is the other one?

549
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:18,950
Yeah.

550
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,590
Forgive me, madam.

551
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,200
I truly haven't seen it.

552
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:24,950
That's a pity.

553
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:27,030
- Looking for a night-glowing pearl hairpin?
- Well, then, let's...

554
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,110
Who are you?

555
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:31,640
I'm a traveling merchant from Beizhou,

556
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,440
and I happen to have
a night-glowing pearl hairpin.

557
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,830
I wonder if it's what you're looking for.

558
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:42,950
Exactly.

559
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,550
What are you doing?

560
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,590
Since I'm dealing in your shop,

561
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,640
I'll give you a share of the profits.

562
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,080
Please, take a look.

563
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,030
Truly unique.

564
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:06,950
But unfortunately,

565
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,270
it's already been ordered by a lady

566
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,510
for three hundred taels of gold.

567
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,040
Three hundred?

568
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,480
If I offer five hundred taels,

569
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,350
will you sell it to me?

570
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,830
Certainly.

571
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,240
Honey.

572
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:22,390
Am I

573
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,640
being too indulgent?

574
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,240
No.

575
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:29,000
If you like it, you have to pay more

576
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,080
to get it.

577
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,310
However,

578
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,480
five hundred taels of gold

579
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:37,110
isn't a small amount.

580
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,080
That's true.

581
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:39,950
I see.

582
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:42,880
After all, the money is in Fu's hands.

583
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,750
I don't want you

584
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:46,350
to have to ask her for it.

585
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,550
Although she's in charge,

586
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,510
she's using the family money.

587
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:52,880
Why would I need to care about her opinion?

588
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,280
All right.

589
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,480
Get me a brush and paper.

590
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,760
- Sure.
- Wait a minute.

591
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,150
What did you say?

592
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,550
Aren't you paying now?

593
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,160
This is how it's done. Don't worry.

594
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,680
Duke Qing's Mansion always pays.

595
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,960
You can go there tomorrow and find Nanny Zhou.

596
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,960
Very well. Please.

597
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:08,950
This way.

598
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,100
(Contractor: Guo Yi)

599
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,110
I've heard

600
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,240
that your mansion was attacked.

601
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,960
I didn't expect it to be so serious.

602
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,240
The family's coffers

603
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,720
had been completely drained

604
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:07,920
by the two wars.

605
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,590
My mother

606
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:15,160
even had to pawn

607
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,440
her trousseau.

608
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,510
We borrowed a lot of money

609
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,830
from Lord Zhennan

610
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:21,350
just so I could get married.

611
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:22,630
It's so hard

612
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,000
for me to say.

613
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,920
But now the repairs to the mansion

614
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,200
require a lot of money.

615
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:32,030
As the head of the family,

616
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:34,270
it's so hard for me to raise money.

617
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,190
It's truly embarrassing.

618
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:46,550
A man doesn't easily shed tears.

619
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,190
Xingzhou.

620
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:49,910
You truly are

621
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,720
a filial child.

622
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,720
It's not your fault

623
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,750
that you're short of money.

624
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,590
Well...

625
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:05,680
I'll let Fu

626
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,750
do her filial duty

627
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,310
and take her dowry to help her brother.

628
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,160
No, no, no.

629
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,000
That's not right.

630
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,000
Xingzhou, just accept it.

631
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:17,400
We don't covet

632
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:19,720
the daughter-in-law's dowry.

633
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:23,790
Fu's dowry

634
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,440
is hers to manage.

635
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,240
I believe

636
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:31,000
Fu is a sensible person.

637
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,160
She will surely

638
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,590
be willing to help.

639
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,480
Thank you, Duke.

640
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:42,910
But I'm sorry.

641
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:45,750
I need one more favor.

642
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,270
If word of this

643
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,550
gets out,

644
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:53,240
it will damage the reputation of my family.

645
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,480
So, please

646
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,240
keep this matter discreet.

647
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,040
Of course.

648
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,920
I understand.

649
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:09,830
You really went all out

650
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,030
for this act.

651
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:13,670
Let me tell you,

652
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,790
lying with a straight face isn't hard.

653
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,640
The hard part is not laughing

654
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,270
when you see the Duke's serious face.

655
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:23,550
Today, I heard from the eldest sister

656
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:25,200
that the money Guo Yi owes this month

657
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:27,480
is already at this amount.

658
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,400
I was thinking,

659
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,960
why not add fuel to the fire?

660
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,110
Honey.

661
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,760
Honey.

662
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,590
We've been in the capital for so long,

663
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,480
and I haven't taken you out

664
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,590
to show you around.

665
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,040
Where would you like to go?

666
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,270
I'm new to the capital.

667
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:48,070
I'll take your advice.

668
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,080
Good girl.

669
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,350
I'm here.

670
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:58,860
There he is. Go.

671
00:29:58,930 --> 00:29:59,780
That's him.

672
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,670
Get him to pay.

673
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,840
- Give me my money.
- Pay up.

674
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,800
Pay up now.

675
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
- Money. Now.
- What's that for?

676
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,920
Do you know who I am?

677
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,480
A debt must be repaid.

678
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,890
Give me back my five hundred taels of gold.

679
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,110
- And mine.
- When did I owe you money?

680
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,110
- And mine.
- Pay up.

681
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,080
Pay up now.

682
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,190
It's you.

683
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:15,870
Fine.

684
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:16,870
Fine.

685
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,480
- Just you wait.
- Pay up.

686
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,680
I never say I won't.

687
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,560
What?

688
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,790
You gave your entire dowry

689
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,590
to your mother's family?

690
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,430
It's...

691
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,880
The Mansion of Lord Huaiyang was damaged.

692
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,160
My brother couldn't

693
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,110
gather the money for repairs,

694
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,070
so he had to take it from my dowry.

695
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,000
What?

696
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,510
Have you

697
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:38,440
lost your mind?

698
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:40,790
You gave him all the money,

699
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,270
so what about me?

700
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,830
I had no choice.

701
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,350
Father approved it.

702
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:46,580
Father?

703
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:48,550
He came to me in person about it.

704
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,550
I couldn't possibly tell him

705
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,720
that you've been

706
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,070
using my dowry

707
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,160
to cover household expenses.

708
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,110
You...

709
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,110
What should we do now?

710
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,000
The debt collectors

711
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,510
are at the gate.

712
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,510
Look what they did to me.

713
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,070
They beat me up really hard.

714
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,000
I...

715
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,280
Tell me.

716
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,920
What should I do?

717
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,110
Don't worry.

718
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:18,880
I have a plan.

719
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:23,590
You vile woman.

720
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,680
How dare you do this to me?

721
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,350
Insulting the head lady.

722
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:34,590
It's not too much to have you sold off.

723
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,440
Don't you dare.

724
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,640
Guo Yi won't let you off.

725
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,400
Guo Yi is right here.

726
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,000
Yi?

727
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:46,590
Honey.

728
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,350
Gai's profligate spending

729
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:52,270
has caused so much trouble for the family.

730
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,310
If Father finds out,

731
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:55,880
you should know

732
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,790
what will happen to her.

733
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,560
Yi.

734
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,560
Yi.

735
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,550
Say something.

736
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,590
Yi bought

737
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,640
those pieces of jewelry

738
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,680
for me out of affection.

739
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,720
Don't...

740
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:10,590
Yi.

741
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,830
Why are you just standing there?

742
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:13,880
Yi, please.

743
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
- Stop yelling.
- Yi.

744
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,550
What if my father

745
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:18,440
finds out about this?

746
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:24,910
Yurao,

747
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,110
let's just deal

748
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,310
with what we've got here.

749
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,400
Give me that night-glowing pearl hairpin.

750
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,920
Return it and we'll be fine.

751
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,830
Ma'am, I found it.

752
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,640
How did the pearl

753
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,550
get shattered?

754
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:51,160
- No.
- What happened?

755
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:53,040
It wasn't me.

756
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:53,910
No. How...

757
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:55,630
You...

758
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,840
How vicious.

759
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,000
You wretch.

760
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:59,920
You framed me.

761
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,240
It's...

762
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:04,590
You've brought disgrace to the master

763
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,270
and acted recklessly.

764
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,150
How dare you argue?

765
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:08,740
- Nanny Zhou.
- Yes.

766
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,110
Slap her.

767
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,080
Yes, ma'am.

768
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,590
No, don't.

769
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,550
I'll find a way to get the money.

770
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,590
You don't need to worry about it.

771
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,960
I hope

772
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,280
you keep your word.

773
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,840
Nanny Zhou.

774
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,200
- Let's go.
- Yes, ma'am.

775
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,840
Wait.

776
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:44,440
We're closing for the night.

777
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,000
Please come back tomorrow.

778
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,830
It's night already?

779
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,400
Let me light a lantern for you.

780
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,000
I have many kinds of lanterns.

781
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,790
Which kind would you like?

782
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,240
Well,

783
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:01,240
a long-lasting

784
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:02,920
home lantern, then.

785
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,420
(Landownership Papers)

786
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,860
(Draft)

787
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,760
We've already closed.

788
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,600
- Don't move.
- Don't move.

789
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:52,600
What are you doing?

790
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,880
- Don't move.
- Don't move.

791
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:03,800
What do you want?

792
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,640
Shut up.

793
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,300
(Landownership Papers)

794
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,840
That's right. It's the traitor's property.

795
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:14,590
Who was that?

796
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:15,950
What's he got to do with you?

797
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,480
I confess.

798
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:25,710
About three months ago,

799
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,230
he started selling me the deed to the house.

800
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,190
I don't even his name.

801
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,550
I just called him

802
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,030
the chief instructor.

803
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,360
After Guo Yi met the debt collectors,

804
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,480
he didn't go back to his study

805
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,440
or any other suspicious place.

806
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:41,510
Where would he hide the ledger?

807
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,320
Sister, think carefully.

808
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:47,960
Has Guo Yi shown

809
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:49,630
any unusual behavior recently?

810
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,110
I can't think of anything else.

811
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,760
He seldom comes to my room.

812
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,630
(Quiet)
I don't see him often,

813
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,280
so I haven't noticed anything unusual.

814
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,500
(Tolerance)

815
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,030
There is one place

816
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,510
we haven't searched yet.

817
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,710
You mentioned

818
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,880
that my brother-in-law

819
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:14,920
takes me seriously.

820
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,440
He even mounted

821
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,840
my calligraphy works.

822
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,630
The mounting must have

823
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,440
been done by him personally,

824
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,630
right?

825
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,550
Such ironclad evidence

826
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:35,800
is right there

827
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,150
in plain sight every day.

828
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,360
This ledger

829
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,590
implicates seventeen officials,

830
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,960
including Chief of the Court
of Judicial Review,

831
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,400
Minister of Justice,

832
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,280
and Deputy Censor-in-Chief.

833
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:57,150
These are the officials in charge
of the Three Bureaus.

834
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,800
Yes.

835
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,670
Even if we hand

836
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,670
over the evidence

837
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,840
along with Guo Yi,

838
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,320
the officials of the Three Bureaus

839
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:08,230
won't proceed with the trial.

840
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,230
Prince Sui's influence

841
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:12,070
in the court is far greater

842
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,110
than you realize, Your Majesty.

843
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:19,840
They are truly a group

844
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,110
of corrupt bureaucrats.

845
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:23,550
They can't be easily replaced

846
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,960
even we know their doing.

847
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,440
The Three Bureaus are so interconnected

848
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:32,280
that one move affects the whole system.

849
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,920
(Virtuous and Disciplined)
Replacing them won't make a difference.

850
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,070
The leaders are corrupted,

851
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,590
and the situation inside can be imagined.

852
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,480
It has exceeded my expectations.

853
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,630
Let me think about it.

854
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:08,020
(Respect and Simplicity)

855
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,150
His Majesty

856
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,840
can't do anything about Prince Sui now.

857
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:25,590
It's all my fault.

858
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,920
I shouldn't have dragged you into this,

859
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,150
causing you such distress.

860
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:37,960
Don't underestimate me.

861
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:42,020
(Respect and Simplicity)

862
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,480
I didn't realize

863
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:45,710
it was all for naught

864
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:48,110
in the end.

865
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:52,510
I can't even get the case to the Three Bureaus.

866
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:54,960
Had I known it would be like this,

867
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,670
I would've left you

868
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,110
in Zhenzhou.

869
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:04,110
A scolding from you

870
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,360
would have been better
than what's happening now,

871
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,480
where there's not even a way back.

872
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,480
- Look at my lantern.
- It's beautiful.

873
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,360
I like the pink one.

874
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,440
Where did you buy it?

875
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,000
We bought it at that stall around the corner.

876
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,000
Let's go take a look.

877
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,840
- Let's go.
- Come on.

878
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,710
Look how carefree

879
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,110
they are.

880
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,230
Celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival.

881
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,190
I remember back in Mount Yang,

882
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,230
whether it was the Shangsi Festival

883
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,280
or the New Year,

884
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,150
we would always use sky lanterns
to halt the battles.

885
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,190
Once, I caught one of your men,

886
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,070
thinking he was a deserter.

887
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,400
When I checked

888
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,320
his cart,

889
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:58,590
it was full of sky lanterns.

890
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,960
I thought to myself,

891
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,070
even with the battle

892
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,760
so intense,

893
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,190
this Lu Wen

894
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,590
still has the leisure

895
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:10,920
to watch sky lanterns.

896
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,630
Of course.

897
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:13,920
There's more

898
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,760
to life than just

899
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,360
battles and hatred.

900
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:20,360
I fought with you

901
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:22,920
so that those around me

902
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,280
can live a peaceful and stable life,

903
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,360
with feasts during festivals,

904
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:28,840
new clothes to wear,

905
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,920
and the joy of witnessing

906
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,840
grand lantern displays.

907
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,670
I guess.

908
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:46,880
I know you've long been worried

909
00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:50,070
and prepared for battle,

910
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:52,880
but I don't want you to forget

911
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,400
that worry and toil are not what we are after.

912
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,320
We should enjoy our lives.

913
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:00,550
So,

914
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,030
no matter what Prince Sui

915
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,510
or Three Bureaus may do,

916
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,030
spending a happy holiday

917
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,440
with the loved one

918
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:12,800
is what truly matters right now.

919
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,080
- Take a look.
- Buns. Tasty buns.

920
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:24,030
- These are the specialties of Xijing.
- Meat buns.

921
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,280
It's all good stuff.

922
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,000
- It's good for you.
- Fresh steamed buns.

923
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:28,190
I'd like a bag of walnuts.

924
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,320
Okay.

925
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,070
Thank you.

926
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:34,110
- Thank you.
- Okay, take care.

927
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:37,070
- Madam, have one of these.
- Yes, please.

928
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,230
Try this.

929
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,320
Thank you.

930
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,280
- Is that enough?
- Thank you.

931
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:45,510
Honey.

932
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:46,870
Come one.

933
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,630
Excuse me.

934
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:53,880
If you want couplets,

935
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,550
I'll write them for you at home.

936
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,030
This scholar's calligraphy

937
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:59,760
is the finest around.

938
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,840
There's no way

939
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,070
you can compare.

940
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,400
Although it's neat,

941
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,800
it's too uniform.

942
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,670
The horizontal strokes lack arrangement,

943
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:09,990
(All)
and vertical lack hidden strength.

944
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,320
It's far inferior to yours.

945
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,360
With such insight,

946
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:16,510
you must

947
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:17,440
be a good calligrapher.

948
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:19,760
Please enlighten me, madam.

949
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:21,950
What's the matter?

950
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:23,390
Are you afraid?

951
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,280
Enjoying lecturing others?

952
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,440
That's absurd and insulting.

953
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,320
Exactly.

Please.

963
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:51,110
Writing together?

964
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:53,230
Nothing good could come from that.

965
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:55,510
I'm a bit selfish.

966
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:57,960
I can't let other men

967
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,400
