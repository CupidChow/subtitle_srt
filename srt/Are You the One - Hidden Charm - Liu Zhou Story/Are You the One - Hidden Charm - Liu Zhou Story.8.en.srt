14
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,380
Still awake?

15
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,200
What are you doing

16
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,530
with your hands like that?

17
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,340
Honey, look at this fabric.

18
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,410
Isn't it nice?

19
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,530
Why are you dressed like that?

20
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,660
Don't you like it?

21
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:50,620
It's made of watered gauze,

22
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,180
quite expensive.

23
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,660
I want you to see it.

24
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,600
Well,

25
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,810
I can be closer to you.

26
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:41,950
Honey,

27
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,480
you...

28
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,320
Honey,

29
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,480
you...

30
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,800
Fan Hu has been watching
that group of bandits for days.

31
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,160
Everyone of them, including the leader
from Mount Yang who came last time,

32
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,900
takes orders from a young master.

33
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,100
That person

34
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,220
is probably Lu Wen.

35
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,380
Where is he now?

36
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,220
In a residence in Qingzhou.

37
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,270
Qingzhou?

38
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,500
Isn't it under Shi Yikuan's control?

39
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,390
My Lord, Lu Wen

40
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,100
probably figured you wouldn't
make it to Qingzhou

41
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,730
given that you and Shi Yikuan are at odds.

42
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,630
What's wrong, My Lord?

43
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,610
If Shi Yikuan captures the Mount Yang rebels,

44
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,900
it would be a great achievement.

45
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,220
But he went to Zhenzhou.

46
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,290
Two cats are after one mouse.

47
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,290
But he just stays out of it,

48
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,580
trying to test my strength.

49
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,140
Or maybe he's playing dirty behind the scenes,

50
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,850
and Qingzhou hasn't caught on yet.

51
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,580
Since I can know

52
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,550
that he's in Qingzhou,

53
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,580
Shi Yikuan does too.

54
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,220
Ever since he visited Zhenzhou,

55
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,260
I've had

56
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,020
a bad feeling.

57
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,730
There might be more

58
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,530
behind Lu Wen than we know.

59
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:09,550
So,

60
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,900
should we go to Qingzhou?

61
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,040
Yes.

62
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:13,550
We must go.

63
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,370
Besides, we have

64
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,020
one more bargaining chip.

65
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,400
Dear,

66
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,900
you're not eating.

67
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,910
Are you planning to

68
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:32,900
just stare at me?

69
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,050
No.

70
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,430
What were you thinking?

71
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,290
I was thinking...

72
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:43,730
Thinking that

73
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,370
our porcelain shop has been doing well lately.

74
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,000
Some old customers of the He family came

75
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,370
and praised our quality.

76
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,140
That's good.

77
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:57,260
But we're still basking in
the He family's glow.

78
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,760
Those noble patrons

79
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,050
don't know much about Yushao Porcelain Shop.

80
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,160
Honey,

81
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,470
maybe you could check

82
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:05,490
Lord Huaiyang's schedule.

83
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:07,630
Who?

84
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,800
Lord Huaiyang.

85
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,410
I could give His Lordship a gift on his way,

86
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,730
representing the villagers' gratitude,

87
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,610
and offer a precious handmade item
from our shop.

88
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,530
If His Lordship likes it,

89
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,960
next year, we could make

90
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,020
an exclusive plate for the Consort Dowager,

91
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,730
featuring a small portrait of Lord Huaiyang

92
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:26,910
with several small

93
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:27,880
"longevity" characters

94
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,340
subtly embedded in his eyes...

95
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,170
Moru, what's wrong?

96
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,040
Dear,

97
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,640
you're not

98
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,000
some kind of bandit.

99
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,610
How could you intercept a royal carriage?

100
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,930
Not to mention, the plate might
never even be delivered.

101
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,480
What if you are beaten

102
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,830
by them because of it?

103
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:46,730
That would be unacceptable.

104
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,830
People don't hit those who smile,

105
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,390
especially when they're offering gifts.

106
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,970
Alright. About you presenting a gift,

107
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,700
even if His Lordship accepts it,

108
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,850
do you think that proud and aloof

109
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,900
Mr. Chen would accept it?

110
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,730
You're right.

111
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,000
Honey, you're considerate.

112
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,140
I'm too hasty.

113
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:05,870
Dear,

114
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,440
if you're thinking about

115
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,410
making a name for our shop,

116
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,370
I do have a plan.

117
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,400
What is it?

118
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,440
In a few days, Shi Yikuan,
Chief Commander of Qingzhou,

119
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,990
will hold a painting and calligraphy gathering.

120
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,910
He admires skilled calligraphers

121
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,140
and painters the most.

122
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,630
If we could have

123
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,530
Mr. Chen Shi

124
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,170
present the plate

125
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,850
to General Shi,

126
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,410
it would make a name for us.

127
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,960
Dear,

128
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:35,430
let's go to Qingzhou.

129
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,730
I don't think it's a good idea.

130
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,480
Why not?

131
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,320
I've already asked around.

132
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,640
We need influential figures

133
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,270
to get us into that gathering.

134
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,530
How could commoners like us attend?

135
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,370
Besides, I heard

136
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,820
that General Shi

137
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,440
not only loves paintings and calligraphy,

138
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,900
but also women.

139
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,260
He has nine concubines.

140
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:01,170
Instead of seeing him,

141
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,560
we might as well intercept

142
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,900
Lord Huaiyang's carriage.

143
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,320
At least he wouldn't

144
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,780
do anything dishonorable.

145
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,530
I'm afraid you might be overthinking it.

146
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,460
Right now, Qingzhou is bustling

147
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,360
with customers

148
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,290
and collectors.

149
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,790
Even if we can't

150
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,850
get into the gathering,

151
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:26,180
there are still more opportunities there
than in Zhenzhou.

152
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,410
And they will

153
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,700
have a garden fair before the gathering.

154
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,180
I want to take you

155
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,240
there.

156
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,590
Nanny Li.

157
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,670
In the afternoon, let's pick out

158
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,630
some fine porcelain

159
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,470
for the trip.

160
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,920
Okay.

161
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,820
(Qingzhou)

162
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,700
Amazing!

163
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,920
Good luck charms for sale.

164
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,540
The fragrance can travel far and wide.

165
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,060
Miss, do you want one?

166
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,280
Great!

167
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,420
Miss, do you want one?

168
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,070
So beautiful.

169
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,250
Please wrap it up for me.

170
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,240
Yes.

171
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,950
Fabric for sale, come take a look.

172
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,750
Jiu brought us to Qingzhou,

173
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,060
but he hasn't set off yet.

174
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,040
He's tied up with

175
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,010
responsibilities at the Go club.

176
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,370
He'll arrive tomorrow.

177
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,990
(Southern Go Shop)

178
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:35,830
Nanny Li.

179
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,610
Let's go in and have a look.

180
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,200
Roasted nuts!

181
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,200
Come and see.

182
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,280
Smell great and taste amazing!

183
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,300
Welcome.

184
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,550
Please have a look.

185
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,820
Our new stock is over there.

186
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,940
Please have a look.

187
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,920
Go enthusiasts would be hooked

188
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,300
if they saw these.

189
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,650
Shopkeeper, how much is
this white jade Go board?

190
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,580
15 taels of gold.

191
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:14,870
This Go board is reserved

192
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:15,820
and paid for.

193
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,110
Madam, maybe you'd

194
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,370
like to look at other boards.

195
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,610
No, thank you.

196
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,100
Goodbye. See you next time.

197
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,750
Sir, I'll wrap it up for you.

198
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:39,590
No need.

199
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,480
If that lady

200
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,340
comes back,

201
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,970
sell it to her at a discount.

202
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,130
If you want to give it to her,

203
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:47,850
just do it directly.

204
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,060
If she knows it's from me,

205
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,100
she probably won't take it.

206
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,560
But how much should I discount it?

207
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,610
I'll leave that up to you.

208
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:00,550
Yes.

209
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,420
So, they met each other?

210
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,340
They both entered the same shop,

211
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,820
but it was quite crowded.

212
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,630
Ms. Liu left first.

213
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:15,770
Nanny Li followed closely behind.

214
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,800
She said

215
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,010
she hadn't seen any young man.

216
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,940
If it were Lu Wen, he wouldn't just stand by.

217
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,040
Keep a close eye on Liu Miantang

218
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,890
report any developments.

219
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,280
Yes.

220
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:36,620
(Qingzhou Inn)

221
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,010
That white jade Go board is truly beautiful,

222
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,890
but even if

223
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,370
it wasn't reserved,

224
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,770
I still couldn't afford it.

225
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,760
Madam,

226
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,550
you've been talking about
the Go board all night.

227
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,250
Stop thinking about it.

228
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,370
The shopkeeper said

229
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,770
it's already been paid for,

230
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,250
so it belongs to someone else.

231
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,800
Tomorrow,

232
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,320
let's visit the sights and streets

233
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,730
of Qingzhou.

234
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,970
Master said

235
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,110
you should enjoy yourself

236
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,300
and buy whatever

237
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,490
you like.

238
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,320
Wasn't he supposed to

239
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,890
focus on his Go club tasks?

240
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,890
No need to bother him
with my leisure activities.

241
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,370
He's always looking out for me

242
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,460
and supporting me,

243
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,920
yet I can't even afford to buy him

244
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,250
a Go board.

245
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,490
Great! Excellent!

246
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,320
Yes, this one.

247
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,250
Please have a look.

248
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,000
(Never mind.)

249
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,340
(I need to run Yushao Porcelain Shop well)

250
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:39,670
(so that one day)

251
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,490
(I can buy him a fine Go board.)

252
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,320
Madam,

253
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,700
you came here yesterday, didn't you?

254
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,400
Maybe this Go board and I

255
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,770
aren't meant to be.

256
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,040
I can see you really like it.

257
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,880
You're in luck.

258
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,800
The original buyer

259
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,640
was picky

260
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,920
and thought this Go board wasn't exquisite

261
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,850
and had flaws.

262
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,080
He'd rather lose the deposit

263
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,970
than keep it.

264
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,610
Really?

265
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,460
I was just worried about finding a buyer.

266
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,560
If you don't mind,

267
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,010
I can offer it to you at a discount.

268
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,120
Then how much is it?

269
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,760
Five taels of gold.

270
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,440
I'll lower it by one tael.

271
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,230
If you can pay four taels of gold,

272
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,070
it's yours.

273
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,940
Two taels of gold.

274
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,490
I won't pay a single tael more.

275
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,400
Okay. Deal.

276
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,820
I'll wrap it up for you.

277
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,490
Madam, you're impressive.

278
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,110
People say gold and jade shops
make a lot of money,

279
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,420
but I didn't

280
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,630
really believe it until today.

281
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,440
A Go board worth just two taels of gold

282
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,370
can sell for over ten taels.

283
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,640
So

284
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,420
it's not made from high-quality jade.

285
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,200
But I don't know what tricks they used

286
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,700
to make it look so clear and pure.

287
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,110
I suppose the customer who placed the order

288
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,460
realized this at the last minute

289
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,870
and decided to cancel the deal

290
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:07,820
and lose the deposit.

291
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,180
We don't know how much

292
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,630
the customer was ripped off

293
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,580
by the merchant.

294
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:12,920
Yeah.

295
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,000
My Lord.

296
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,300
The fish has taken the bait.

297
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,520
Madam.

298
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,670
Why don't you visit some other shops?

299
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,100
I'll wait here.

300
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:30,550
Okay.

301
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,400
Take the Go board directly

302
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,480
to the inn later.

303
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,560
We don't want it getting damaged

304
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,400
in the crowd.

305
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,240
Yes.

306
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,340
Nanny Li, let's go.

307
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:47,060
(Southern Go Shop)

308
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,820
Take a look at this.

309
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:56,880
Nanny Li?

310
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:02,950
Come back if you liked it.

311
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,700
Nanny Li, what's wrong?

312
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,100
Moru?

313
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,240
Where is Madam?

314
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,560
Madam is with His Lordship.

315
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,400
Don't worry.

316
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,000
Honey.

317
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,440
You came at the perfect time!

318
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,010
Look at this garden fair. It's so lively!

319
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,100
Yes, it is.

320
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:03,020
Great!

321
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,040
Honey, look.

322
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,340
Let's go see over there.

323
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,470
Okay.

324
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,590
Here you are.

325
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,060
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:43,730
It's hot.

327
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,540

- Too sweet. You eat it.

00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,440
- Take it.
- Okay.

Thank you.

Honey,

339
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,850
I thought you didn't have a sweet tooth.

340
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,340
But I love sour food.

not to worry too much.

Too many worries

- Okay. Please go ahead.

382
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:02,110
Thank you.

00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:14,920
Have you played this before?

387
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,760
No.

388
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:16,690
No?

389
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,800
Let me show you.

390
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,680
Look.

391
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:23,890
There are three sticks.

392
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,280
Hold this one

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,480

I'll take you to the next spot.

00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,930

407
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:27,960
Honey, look.

408
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,120
The prize for this game

409
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,850
is a seat at the painting
and calligraphy gathering.

410
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,440
Honey, it's a great chance.

411
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,850
The future of our shop

412
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,020
depends on your today's success.

413
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,540
Too difficult. I can't solve it.

414
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:43,550
True.

415
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:46,200
This game is set up by great scholars.

416
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,500
It must be profound and difficult.

417
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,370
It's no surprise you can't solve it.

418
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,100
We'll figure out another way later.

419
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:55,980
Table B solved it and won the prize.

420
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,230
Congratulations, Young Master.

421
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:04,070
Here's your prize.

422
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,890
Give it to that lady.

423
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,520
What's wrong?

424
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,400
This gentleman wants to
give the prize to the lady.

425
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,240
It's okay.

426
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:21,070
No need.

427
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,890
- It seems this lady really wants the prize.
- Are you sure it's okay?

428
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,170
You can take it, sir.

429
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:33,850
My wife can't accept such a generous gift.

430
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:37,130
Since this gentleman can't solve it

431
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,920
but I can,

432
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,890
it's not a problem.

433
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,260
You must be a Go expert

434
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,580
since you were able to solve it.

435
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,100
May I know your name?

436
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,820
My courtesy name is Ziyu.

437
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,740
And what may I call you?

438
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,580
I'm Cui Jiu.

439
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,500
So, Ziyu,

440
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,340
would you like to play a match with me?

441
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:03,630
Please.

442
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,580
(It's a blitz game.)

443
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,690
(Once a move is made, it's final.)

444
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,200
(If someone isn't highly skilled,)

445
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,980
(they wouldn't dare play like this.)

446
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,500
(This man and Jiu)

447
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,740
(are evenly matched.)

448
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,340
(But why can I keep up with them,)

449
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,980
(especially Ziyu?)

450
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,780
(His every move)

451
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:00,210
(aligns perfectly with my thoughts.)

452
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,060
(It's as if)

453
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,060
(I've played like this before.)

454
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,540
(Why do I feel so uneasy)

455
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,960
(and get a headache)

456
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,130
(when I see him?)

457
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,260
(Have I)

458
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,690
(met him before?)

459
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:15,550
I lost

460
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,260
fair and square.

461
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,820
You are truly skilled, Ziyu.

462
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,740
I hope we can have a game again

463
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,020
in the future.

464
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,520
Certainly.

465
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:46,020
- Madam.
- Dear.

466
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,980
- I'll get you some tea.
- Have a seat and rest for a bit.

467
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,170
Are you feeling dizzy again?

468
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:53,870
Not dizzy.

469
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,130
I have a headache. A terrible one.

470
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,450
Did you remember something?

471
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,410
I'm not sure.

472
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,930
It just hurts for no reason.

473
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,800
Foster Father.

474
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,300
As you predicted,

475
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,210
everything's going just as planned.

476
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:58,300
But there is one thing...

477
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:00,110
What is it?

478
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,780
Liu Miantang is still alive.

479
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:04,780
And Young Master

480
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,500
can't let her go.

481
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,710
As long as she's alive,

482
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,060
she remains a threat.

483
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:12,610
I'm worried

484
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,400
that his attachment to her

485
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,850
might jeopardize our plan.

486
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,610
I know what you're thinking.

487
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,450
In my view,

488
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,780
the biggest threat to the plan

489
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,060
so far is your

490
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,450
useless infatuation with him!

491
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,340
I'm sorry.

492
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,850
I shouldn't have

493
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,740
let my emotions get in the way.

494
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,610
But, Foster Father,

495
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,210
are we really going to let her go?

496
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:46,010
Have you forgotten

497
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,270
that the 300,000 taels of gold

498
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:48,850
missing from Mount Yang's accounts

499
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,780
are still with her?

500
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,540
No, I haven't.

501
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,300
I know what to do.

502
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:13,760
Miantang.

503
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,930
I can explain.

504
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,890
Since you've made your choice,

505
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,100
I have nothing more to say.

506
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,410
After today,

507
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,070
we will sever all ties

508
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,340
and leave our fates to destiny.

509
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,440
No.

510
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,680
Don't go.

511
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,520
Let go of me!

512
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,110
Dear.

513
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,160
It's okay. It's okay.

514
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,000
It's okay.

515
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:33,580
Honey...

516
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,100
How do you feel? Is your head still hurting?

517
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,480
Easy.

518
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,130
I just had

519
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,540
a nightmare.

520
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,850
What did you dream of?

521
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,130
I dreamt

522
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,200
that my husband

523
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,850
was with another woman.

524
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,370
I felt disappointed

525
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:08,450
and very angry.

526
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,750
So you dreamt

527
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,450
that I was with another woman?

528
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:18,370
Let go of me!

529
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,610
Perhaps.

530
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,780
I didn't see it clearly.

531
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,260
It was just a dream.

532
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:31,410
It doesn't count.

533
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:37,450
Do you

534
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,210
remember Ziyu?

535
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:42,870
Honey.

536
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,610
Why are you suddenly asking about this?

537
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,880
You were very emotional

538
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,170
when you saw him today

539
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,540
and said your head was hurting.

540
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,240
So,

541
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:54,340
you're making me overthink things.

542
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:59,740
It's just my old ailment acting up.

543
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:01,500
That man was so forward.

544
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,500
He wanted to give me the prize for no reason,

545
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,500
which made me feel quite embarrassed.

546
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,360
If he gave me

547
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,880
the headache,

548
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,100
it's because he made me angry.

549
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:16,960
Never mind.

550
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,340
I was just joking with you.

551
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,060
(Qingzhou Inn)
See you, gentlemen.

552
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:28,410
Let's stay at this inn.

553
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,020
Are you here to dine or stay?

554
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,150
Stay.

555
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,760
Madam.

556
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,100
This is the medicinal soup

557
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:44,450
Physician Zhao gave you earlier.

558
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,170
Please drink it while it's warm.

559
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,310
Come on.

560
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,690
Nanny Li, please have a seat.

561
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,780
Nanny Li.

562
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,960
Have you heard of

563
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,610
or met Mr. Ziyu, the one

564
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,130
we met at the academy

565
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,300
yesterday?

566
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,880
If she asks

567
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,020
about Lu Wen,

568
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,060
wait for the right moment

569
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,070
to subtly share some information.

570
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,580
See if it triggers her memory.

571
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,130
But don't be too obvious,

572
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,100
or she'll become suspicious.

573
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,610
Just follow her lead

574
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:24,060
and guide the conversation a bit.

575
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:29,170
Yes, I-I have.

576
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,500
So who is he?

577
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,780
And who did you hear that from?

578
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,820
Did I know him before I lost my memory?

579
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,210
From his look yesterday,

580
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:41,060
it felt like we knew each other.

581
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,830
But Jiu seemed

582
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,540
to be meeting him for the first time.

583
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,040
Nanny Li,

584
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,440
is there a connection

585
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,450
between Ziyu and me?

586
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,110
I...

587
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,200
- He...
- Who is he?

588
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,260
Why can't you tell me?

589
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,390
He...

590
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:57,370
He was

591
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,890
your shack job.

592
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,340
What nonsense are you talking about?

593
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:03,310
My Lord,

594
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,130
you've been going up against Lu Wen for years.

595
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,300
Was the man

596
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,440
from yesterday him?

597
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,240
Everyone in Mount Yang

598
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,410
obeys him.

599
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,710
That day,

600
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:14,270
even that woman in charge

601
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,580
followed him.

602
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,960
But Ziyu

603
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,540
seems refined and scholarly,

604
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,540
not ruthless at all,

605
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:26,310
which is quite different

606
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,980
from what I expected.

607
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,750
W-What are you thinking about all the time?

608
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,960
H-How could I possibly

609
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,130
be that kind of woman?

610
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:36,840
How could I betray my husband?

611
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,210
I don't know much either.

612
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,200
But you're smart.

613
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,790
You should know

614
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:43,890
that my words

615
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,780
aren't just empty talk.

616
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:49,890
How about you thinking it over again?

617
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,690
But thinking it over,

618
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:58,820
his demeanor is exceptional.

619
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:01,100
His style and strategy in Go

620
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,990
bear a resemblance

621
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:05,610
to Lu Wen I know.

622
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,380
His style feels so familiar.

623
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:12,170
It's hard to believe

624
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,330
we don't know each other.

625
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,770
And the way he looked at me...

626
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,880
The way he looked at Liu Miantang

627
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,900
was full of admiration,

628
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,420
like a long-awaited reunion,

629
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:25,980
mixed with jealousy towards an old lover

630
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,100
who's now married to someone else.

631
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,760
I've heard that Lu Wen from Mount Yang

632
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,330
deeply cherished his beloved concubine.

633
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,940
Now it seems...

634
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,540
Yesterday, when Jiu played Go with him,

635
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,330
there was a strange tension.

636
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,580
And even when I first woke up,

637
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:47,760
Jiu and I felt so distant,

638
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,060
like we weren't even a couple.

639
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,510
Could it be

640
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,420
because of him?

641
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,980
Ziyu

642
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,290
must be Lu Wen.

643
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,690
Now that his identity is confirmed,

644
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,580
should we

645
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,020
mobilize the troops and capture him?

646
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:09,580
The last leg of a journey is halfway.

647
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:12,280
He's been in Qingzhou for a while

648
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,770
but hasn't made a move.

649
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:16,060
He must have other plans.

650
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,800
Fan Hu.

651
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,130
Have Ying Zai

652
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,280
gather the troops

653
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,130
and move into town in waves,

654
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,170
but don't alert the enemy

655
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,610
before we strike.

656
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,200
Yes.

657
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:31,250
(So Jiu knows everything)

658
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,980
(and keeps it from me,)

659
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,030
(right?)

660
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:36,360
(Master)

661
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,980
(wants to be lenient and understanding with you.)

662
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:40,500
(But, Madam,)

663
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,720
(if you)

664
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,380
(feel unsettled)

665
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,580
(or remember something,)

666
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,060
(perhaps)

667
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,380
(you should speak to Master yourself.)

668
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,860
Honey, you're back.

669
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,540
Here. Have a seat.

670
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,170
You're very attentive today,

671
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,380
my dear.

672
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,100
Isn't this how I always am?

673
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,810
It's true I'm not home often,

674
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,380
so I'm not used to it.

675
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,860
Honey, guess what I bought for you.

676
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:20,100
- A Go board.
- You guessed right.

677
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,500
Here. Take a look.

678
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,760
Why did you want to

679
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,770
get me a gift?

680
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,460
I saw this Go board at the market

681
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,400
and couldn't help imagining you

682
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,150
arranging the pieces

683
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,770
with your long fingers.

684
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,250
I thought it was perfect for you.

685
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,900
This Go board should be yours.

686
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,420
You're so thoughtful, my dear.

687
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,940
I love it.

688
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,610
Now that you have a new board,

689
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,860
let's play a game

690
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,400
and see how the board

691
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,240
and pieces feel.

692
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:50,020
Do you play Go?

693
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,880
I wasn't very good at it before we got married,

694
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,320
but I think I've improved since then.

695
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,460
I'm not sure, though.

696
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:58,990
Then let's play a game.

697
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:00,870
Guessing the first move.

698
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,080
You go first.

699
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,290
Did you see anything interesting

700
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,500
when you went out today?

701
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,610
I just listened to some opera.

702
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,800
What's it about?

703
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,900
Just the usual tales

704
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,290
of lovesick men and women.

705
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,960
Without you being with me,

706
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,030
I got a bit bored

707
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,020
and came back early.

708
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:34,030
I'm sorry

709
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,610
I haven't been around much.

710
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:38,070
But meeting your Go friends in Qingzhou

711
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,250
is a rare opportunity.

712
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:41,250
We'll have plenty of time

713
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,560
to go out

714
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,170
and have fun together.

715
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,730
Playing Go like this

716
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,330
is pretty great.

717
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:17,580
(Her Go style)

718
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:20,210
(is so similar to Ziyu's.)

719
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,100
I lost.

720
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,720
Honey, you won,

721
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,020
but why do you look unhappy?

722
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,630
Did I not play well

723
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,980
and spoil your fun?

724
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,460
No, you played very well.

725
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,240
Dear.

726
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,500
Who taught you?

727
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,580
Since you didn't learn before you got married,

728
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:23,020
you must have had a renowned teacher.

729
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,250
Maybe I learned by reading your manual

730
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,770
or just picked it up by watching you play.

731
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:30,320
Then, my dear,

732
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,940
you're talented.

733
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,630
You play Go so well

734
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:34,500
just from reading,

735
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,610
without actually playing

736
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,460
or practising.

737
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,730
Or maybe

738
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,610
I did learn it before we got married.

739
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,100
I just don't remember.

740
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,060
Do you really not remember?

741
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:52,610
Let me remind you.

742
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,060
Your Go style

743
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,420
is very similar

744
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,330
to Ziyu's.

745
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:01,240
Why don't you think it over...

746
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,250
Stop testing me like this.

747
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:04,610
I'll just tell you.

748
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,200
Good.

749
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:08,580
Finally, you're saying something.

750
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:13,940
Although I don't remember everything clearly,

751
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,900
since Nanny Li mentioned it,

752
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,100
I'm afraid

753
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,900
I learned Go from Ziyu.

754
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,960
But I truly don't

755
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,540
remember anything else.

756
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,760
I don't know why I met him

757
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,940
in Qingzhou.

758
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,600
Honey,

759
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,020
it's clear you don't believe me.

760
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,060
If you don't want me anymore,

761
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,100
just give me a divorce letter.

762
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,610
I'll never trouble you again.

763
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:40,330
But please

764
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,840
don't make it painful

765
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,130
for both of us.

766
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:49,240
W-Why are you saying that?

767
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,380
Goddess of Mercy,

768
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,800
Buddha,

769
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,290
I didn't lie on purpose.

770
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:55,810
I will vow to chant sutras every day

771
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,070
to avoid being sent to

772
00:40:57,070 --> 00:41:00,020
the Hell of Tongue Ripping after I die.

773
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,130
Please.

774
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,940
Nanny Li, what are you mumbling about?

775
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:06,510
Leave me alone.

776
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,120
Fangxie.

777
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:11,030
Let me ask you something.

778
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,690
Did Madam

779
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:14,210
act strangely today?

780
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,060
No.

781
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,070
She just kept talking about

782
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:20,770
Master's preferences on the way back,

783
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:23,210
and gave him the jade Go board

784
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,540
to cheer him up.

785
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:27,100
The jade Go board?

786
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:32,130
What a sin.

787
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,810
What a sin.

788
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:37,290
That's how it is.

789
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,720
But I truly don't remember

790
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,280
any other details.

791
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,540
I have no defense.

792
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,200
Honey,

793
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:46,690
if I've really done something wrong,

794
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,460
then I deserve you to divorce me.

795
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:52,020
But I hope we can be honest with each other.

796
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:54,240
Don't avoid me so much

797
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,770
that you can't come home.

798
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:57,430
Even if...

799
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,380
Even if we end up parting ways,

800
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,330
we should still live with clarity and dignity.

801
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,170
I understand.

802
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,330
Give me a straight answer today.

803
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,460
Actually...

804
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:18,830
I accept it.

805
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,030
Ziyu pursued you

806
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:27,330
several times,

807
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,840
but you rejected him each time

808
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,990
and didn't do anything improper.

809
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,020
Nanny Li only knew

810
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:33,770
part of the story

811
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:34,960
and misunderstood

812
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,770
the situation.

813
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,800
Honey,

814
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,380
are you saying this

815
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,840
just to appease me?

816
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,250
Of course not.

817
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:47,880
If it were true,

818
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,540
would I have put up with you this long?

819
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,080
That's true.

820
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:56,030
But...

821
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,900
But why were you

822
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:02,250
so distant with me back then?

823
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:10,070
You weren't fully recovered

824
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:11,990
back then.

825
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:12,830
How could I

826
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:16,100
take advantage of you in that state?

827
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,020
Master, Madam,

828
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:26,250
dinner is ready.

829
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:27,770
