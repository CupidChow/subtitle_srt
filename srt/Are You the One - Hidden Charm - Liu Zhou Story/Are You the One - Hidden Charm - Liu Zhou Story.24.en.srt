=Episode 24=

14
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,380
Everyone, please take a look.

15
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,120
Today, we present to you

16
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,200
a belt hook carved from rhino horn

17
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,170
inlaid with mutton fat jade.

18
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,450
The headpiece is set with a fire pearl,

19
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,300
which is the national treasure of Mi Kingdom.

20
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,740
We also have thumb rings,

21
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,950
a jade belt, and this…

22
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,610
Xingzhou has always been
in the military camps,

23
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,300
so he doesn't need such fine items.

24
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,920
Lord Huaiyang, do you also
command troops in the capital?

25
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,940
No, I dare not.

26
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,730
There you go.

27
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,960
Pick one

28
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,850
and consider it a gift from Prince Sui.

29
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,010
Your Ladyship, you're too kind.

30
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,410
Why not

31
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,290
let Xingzhou try it on first,

32
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,100
to see if it fits him?

33
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,100
Try this jade belt on Lord Huaiyang.

34
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,150
Yes.

35
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,960
Wait.

36
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,470
How dare you,

37
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,780
a rough man, serve Lord Huaiyang?

38
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,130
Let this girl do it.

39
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,200
Yes.

40
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,990
Your Ladyship, take a look at this.

41
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:47,980
Let me see.

42
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,720
My Lord.

43
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,690
I heard you broke off
your engagement with Ms. Lian.

44
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,130
Honestly,

45
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,970
it's for the best since the Lian family

46
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,180
isn't of high nobility.

47
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,150
General Rongguo's wife

48
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,180
is my cousin.

49
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,180
Her daughter just came of age,

50
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,730
and she's very gentle and sensible.

51
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,360
I've invited her mother
for a pitch-pot game

52
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,410
the day after tomorrow.

53
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,530
You should come and join us.

54
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,120
Your Ladyship,

55
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,530
honestly,

56
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,530
Xingzhou has a loved one

57
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,850
in Zhenzhou.

58
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,000
He even gave her a gift

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,130
intended for me.

60
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,680
It's the face powder from Scent Store,

61
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,220
rare and hard-to-get.

62
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,820
He gifted it to her.

63
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,040
Lord Huaiyang, which noble lady

64
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,140
has caught your eye?

65
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,900
She's not from a noble family,

66
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,970
but she's my equal

67
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,370
in every way.

68
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,270
Due to certain circumstances

69
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,220
and her own

70
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,580
future considerations,

71
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,730
we parted ways.

72
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,390
Did you send her betrothal gifts?

73
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,340
Have you met her parents?

74
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,220
Do you still have feelings for her?

75
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,410
Sorry, My Lord.

76
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,730
Sorry, Your Ladyship.

77
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,660
I dropped this belt

78
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,140
and chipped this corner of the belt.

79
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,920
I wouldn't dare let
His Lordship wear it anymore.

80
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,820
Why not choose your accessories today?

81
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,800
Our shopkeeper will then select

82
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,240
and deliver a replacement for His Lordship

83
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,140
on another day.

84
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:20,220
(Duke Qing's Mansion)

85
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,050
My Lord! My Lord!

86
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,220
Sister, you go in first.

87
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,150
What is it?

88
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,560
Ms. Liu was taken to
the former Crown Prince's residence.

89
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,030
Ms. Liu,

90
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,400
this way, please.

91
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,270
Please come on in.

92
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,240
You've decorated this place

93
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,780
to resemble Mount Yang.

94
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,290
I've added more furnaces,

95
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,610
since you always said
the nights there were chilly.

96
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,370
How have you been lately?

97
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:05,930
Everything is as usual.

98
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,820
So you're still a merchant's wife.

99
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,610
How is your husband?

100
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,580
No different from

101
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,220
that day in Qingzhou.

102
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,030
Miantang,

103
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,780
how long will you keep this from me?

104
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,820
I know all the grievances you've endured.

105
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,190
Cui Xingzhou took advantage
of your amnesia

106
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,630
and used marriage as a trap,

107
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,930
leaving you with no choice.

108
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,660
When I found out,

109
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,800
I stayed awake night after night,

110
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,610
filled with despair,

111
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,970
regretting every moment

112
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,290
and longing for our reunion.

113
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,150
But

114
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,580
I also feared that you might hate me

115
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,410
or think I would control you

116
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,580
with my power,

117
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,530
as he did.

118
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,470
Miantang,

119
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,370
for me,

120
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,290
nothing matters more than your feelings.

121
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,340
Nothing can change

122
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,890
what we once were.

123
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,130
I haven't congratulated you

124
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,100
on achieving your goal, Your Majesty.

125
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,890
In your presence,

126
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,730
I'll always be Ziyu from Mount Yang.

127
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,160
Ziyu.

128
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,340
No matter how detestable

129
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,890
Cui Xingzhou is,

130
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,060
you have no right to blame him.

131
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,490
My leaving Mount Yang that night

132
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,730
has something to do with you.

133
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,060
If not for your indulgence,

134
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,460
Yun'er would never have
pushed me to such despair.

135
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,060
And Prince Sui behind her.

136
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,670
She picked the fight on the night

137
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,220
of the Shangsi Festival

138
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,130
and killed all my friends in Xizhou.

139
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:39,710
I know

140
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,220
you came to the capital

141
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,220
for revenge.

142
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:46,730
Since you know that,

143
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,340
why did you summon Prince Sui
to the palace today?

144
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,060
Did you want to protect him?

145
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,110
Your Majesty,

146
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,820
do you really think I would kill him today?

147
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,840
I know you went there today

148
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,790
just to scout and explore options.

149
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,120
You're thoughtful,

150
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,370
but so is Prince Sui.

151
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,990
Wu's accomplice hasn't been dealt with yet.

152
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,200
Prince Sui hired

153
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,240
all the skilled masters

154
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,490
to keep him protected and secure.

155
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,700
Anyone with bad intentions towards him

156
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,420
should be prepared for the worst.

157
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,580
Therefore, my edict

158
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,180
was not to safeguard him,

159
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,850
but to protect you.

160
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,970
I want to help you.

161
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,490
The court is now in Prince Sui's control.

162
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,370
How can I let someone else

163
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,820
call the shots where I should?

164
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,060
Prince Sui is my enemy too.

165
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:43,890
So, Miantang,

166
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,820
let me help you.

167
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,300
We can still be like

168
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,580
Lu Wen and Ziyu as we once were.

169
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,540
You must have gone to great lengths

170
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,490
to get the crabapple tree

171
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,580
in the backyard.

172
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,230
Yes.

173
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,010
Does it look like the one in Mount Yang?

174
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,220
I always remember

175
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,320
teaching you to play chess

176
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,490
under that tree.

177
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,250
I really miss those days.

178
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:42,750
They're different.

179
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,180
It's cold in the mountains.

180
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,490
The crabapple flowers
won't bloom this early.

181
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,970
If the flowers can't stay the same,

182
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,800
how

183
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,540
can people?

184
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,350
Ziyu,

185
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,770
thanks for talking with me today.

186
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,370
This is

187
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,510
the 300,000 taels of silver

188
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:13,650
you left with me.

189
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,890
I've kept it safe
with Lu Zhong all this time.

190
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,160
And now,

191
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,220
I'm returning it to you untouched.

192
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:21,990
Miantang,

193
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,940
let me

194
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,180
at least be

195
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,010
a part of your current plans.

196
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,640
Your Majesty.

197
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,510
Come in.

198
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,100
Why are you coming here now?

199
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,600
Since ascending the throne,

200
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,720
you've been busy with state affairs,

201
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,770
neglecting sleep and meals.

202
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,150
Grand Empress Dowager
is concerned about your health.

203
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,890
So she sent me with some tonic soup.

204
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,120
Ginseng, deer antler,

205
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,490
gorgon fruit, and lotus seeds.

206
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,250
What a potent brew.

207
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,340
Don't you think that's too much?

208
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,700
I'm not much of a cook.

209
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,180
Please forgive me.

210
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,060
I was just joking.

211
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,130
Don't be punctilious.

212
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,010
Your Majesty, you love
crabapple flowers, right?

213
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,250
You Majesty, you're frugal.

214
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,320
You haven't initiated any construction
since your ascension.

215
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,440
But you've planted many

216
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,940
crabapple trees in the palace.

217
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,510
There must be

218
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,580
a special meaning behind this.

219
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,540
There was a crabapple tree

220
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,650
in Mount Yang.

221
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,220
You're right.

222
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,910
The crabapple tree does hold

223
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,540
some memories for me.

224
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,120
The likes of Prince Lu

225
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,490
take advantage of their seniority.

226
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,340
Your Majesty, you have shown
the highest courtesy

227
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:34,490
by sending officials to greet them.

228
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,960
Exactly.

229
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,610
And as for

230
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,750
those stubborn old men
from Youzhou and Beizhou,

231
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,010
we don't need to beat around
the bush with them.

232
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,970
Why not simply send troops
to intimidate them?

233
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,110
Minister Cui?

234
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,200
Minister Cui?

235
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,700
I said that

236
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,150
if all the lords

237
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,370
were like Minister Cui,

238
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,940
I wouldn't be so troubled.

239
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,940
Zhenzhou

240
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,340
is remote and poor,

241
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,460
especially compared to other fiefs.

242
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,770
Lord Huaiyang,

243
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,300
do you have something

244
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,790
on your mind?

245
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:16,100
You... You seem quite distracted.

246
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:17,330
Exactly.

247
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,650
I was distracted,

248
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,340
thinking about the lunch plan

249
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,700
with my elder sister.

250
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,340
I beg Your Majesty's pardon.

251
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,580
Then I'm afraid Young Lady Guo
will be disappointed.

252
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,610
I'd like you to stay for lunch.

253
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,550
Your Majesty, today Yangzhou

254
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,010
sent a tribute of 20 crabs.

255
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,970
Unlike the usual spring crabs,

256
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,670
these crabs have plumper legs

257
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,580
and are full of roe.

258
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,770
That's quite rare.

259
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:53,970
Marinated raw crabs are fresh,
while sweet crabs are mellow.

260
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,460
Your Majesty, which one do you prefer?

261
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,970
These two dishes are too ordinary.

262
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,130
To truly savor the crab's freshness,

263
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,360
crab roe rice

264
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,850
is the best.

265
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,700
I'm not sure if Minister Cui will like it.

266
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,010
What's so special about crab roe rice?

267
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,300
Your Majesty,

268
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,370
thank you for your kindness.

269
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,420
Crabs are tasty.

270
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,130
But I haven't seen my sister

271
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,610
for a long time.

272
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,130
And we already have a lunch plan.

273
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:30,230
I can't

274
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,940
disappoint Sister.

275
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,270
So I'll have to decline
Your Majesty's offer.

276
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,110
Now,

277
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,540
I'll take my leave.

278
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,940
Cui Xingzhou...

279
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,320
Send these crabs

280
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,420
to the Duke of Qing's Mansion.

281
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,890
Such delicacies should be cherished.

282
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,460
Once the time passes,

283
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,460
they'll be gone.

284
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,850
The security at
Prince Sui's Mansion is tight.

285
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,660
He's escorted by skilled experts
during travel.

286
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:11,930
It won't be easy to make a move.

287
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:17,340
Have some tonic soup

288
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,100
to ward off the cold.

289
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,580
Spring chills can be tricky

290
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,580
and lead to illness easily.

291
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,390
I'll serve myself.

292
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,790
I've heard

293
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,370
there's a royal hunting event in March,

294
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,740
with banners waving
and mountains in view.

295
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:45,480
The royal family and nobles

296
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,320
will all attend.

297
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,850
Is this true?

298
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,260
Yes, the spring hunt

299
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,980
is in three days.

300
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,610
Then,

301
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,210
Prince Sui will leave his mansion

302
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,930
with fewer guards around

303
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,170
in the lush woods.

304
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,540
That might be a good opportunity.

305
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,590
This is my first spring hunt

306
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,610
since ascending the throne.

307
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,170
Grand Empress Dowager will go, too.

308
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,130
So the imperial guards
will be fully deployed.

309
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,720
I'm afraid

310
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,930
it might be hard.

311
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,410
If not the spring hunt,

312
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,060
then when?

313
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:23,070
I thought Grand Empress Dowager's
birthday banquet next month would work.

314
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,540
But I was worried that she wouldn't

315
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,020
be able to handle it at her age.

316
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,590
After all,

317
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,580
she is Prince Sui's birth mother.

318
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,520
Miantang,

319
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,410
don't worry.

320
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,100
We'll make new plans

321
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,690
after the spring hunt.

322
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,410
This moment

323
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,170
brings Mount Yang to my mind.

324
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,060
We used to play the same game

325
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,260
and strategize together.

326
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,190
Miantang,

327
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,540
do you miss those times?

328
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,850
Let's talk about us

329
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,370
when the revenge is over.

330
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,800
Okay.

331
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,690
After I avenge my followers,

332
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,150
I will

333
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,780
have something for you.

334
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,150
Your Majesty.

335
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,100
It's getting late.

336
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,300
Uncle is still waiting for me.

337
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,280
I'll escort you.

338
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,200
Lord Huaiyang didn't return to
the Duke of Qing's Mansion.

339
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,300
He went to the jewelry shop.

340
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,430
It seems that they met each other
the day before.

341
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,080
Miantang.

342
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,030
Does anyone else know
about you posing as

343
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,200
a merchant from Western Regions?

344
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,260
Prince Sui is cunning.

345
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,690
I'm worried he'll find out.

346
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,390
It's fine.

347
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,370
Aren't we going back
to the jewelry shop?

348
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,540
You've been in the capital so long

349
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,060
but haven't visited the night market.

350
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:08,920
I also want to feel

351
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,930
the lively crowd.

352
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,780
In early spring,

353
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,500
women wear flowers in their hair.

354
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,650
Aren't you afraid

355
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,410
someone might recognize you?

356
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:54,540
To common folks, they only
care about the daily lives.

357
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,580
I'm just a stranger to them.

358
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,500
Even if they do recognize me,

359
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,640
they'll be disappointed

360
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,980
to see I'm just a man

361
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,370
with two eyes and a mouth.

362
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,500
The first edict

363
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,480
I issued after ascending

364
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,780
was to lift the curfew.

365
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,590
Those old scholars

366
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,540
tried so hard to dissuade me,

367
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,110
saying the unstable politics

368
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,370
and potential trouble.

369
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,480
But look.

370
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,210
The moon is high,

371
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,990
and the night market
glows like daylight.

372
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,540
It was all worth it.

373
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,310
Your Majesty, you are praising

374
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,300
yourself as a wise ruler.

375
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,370
I just want you to know

376
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,030
that I have never forgotten

377
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,130
and will never break my promise

378
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,890
about the peaceful world

379
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,980
we envisioned.

380
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,240
Ziyu.

381
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,370
You are a good emperor.

382
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,000
If not for the disguised guards

383
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,610
among the crowd,

384
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,590
I would almost believe

385
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:04,980
this is a time of peace

386
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,210
and happiness.

387
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,260
I've just ascended the throne.

388
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,820
Please give me some credit.

389
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:28,910
Missed it.

390
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:30,930
Anyone else want to try?

391
00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:34,870
Sir.

392
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,130
Ten rings, please.

393
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,190
Here you are.

394
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,800
Which one

395
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,060
do you like?

396
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,410
Any of them.

397
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,450
Well...

398
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,900
(Flower hairpin)

399
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,690
How about a flower hairpin?

400
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,540
Now you want to play?

401
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,650
I'm afraid you might lose.

402
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,980
(A flower hairpin)

403
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,920
Congratulations, ma'am.

404
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,390
- You won a flower hairpin.
- Impressive!

405
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,890
A master in the tea house set up
a Go games with isolated positions,

406
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,210
challenging anyone to solve it.

407
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,340
The prize is a famous painting.

408
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,740
Both sides are at a deadlock.

409
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,340
This game is intense!

410
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,790
This is...

411
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:18,980
a quadruple ko?

412
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:21,260
Neither side is willing to give up,

413
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,340
entering the cycle state, a quadruple ko.

414
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,200
Then the game ends

415
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,500
in a meaningless draw.

416
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:36,100
Mr. Ziyu, what's this?

417
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,510
Neither side is willing to give up,

418
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:43,650
entering the cycle state.

419
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,750
Then the game ends

420
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,060
in a meaningless draw.

421
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,690
Interesting.

422
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,260
Miantang, what do you think?

423
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,500
Isn't it cheating?

424
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,580
It's a draw.
What's the point of continuing?

425
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,890
To break this deadlock,

426
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,540
someone has to step back

427
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,370
and give up the double ko.

428
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,480
But that's a loss.

429
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,550
Who does that will lose.

430
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,780
That's worse than a draw.

431
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,370
I don't like draws.

432
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:17,950
I will

433
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:19,110
give up.

434
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,100
Black makes a ko threat.

435
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,170
But even if so,

436
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:29,890
white is still behind by seven points.

437
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,450
The result is set.

438
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,720
There's no turning back.

439
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,610
I agree.

440
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,260
If you don't try,

441
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,850
how will you know the result?

442
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,500
That day in Qingzhou,

443
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,200
I lost to you

444
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,060
because I was distracted.

445
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:04,930
But it's different now.

446
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,170
I want to see

447
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,580
if you can still beat me.

448
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,450
Mr. Cui,

449
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,100
have you heard of "unstoppable force"?

450
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,150
Be careful.

451
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,260
One more wrong move,

452
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,740
and you'll lose everything.

453
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,890
But have you heard of

454
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,020
"born anew

455
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,300
from a hopeless situation"?

456
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,370
White comes alive.

457
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,260
What a brilliant move.

458
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,300
You only know expansion.

459
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,450
But you didn't realize

460
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,300
that your core is empty.

461
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,110
Like me,

462
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,540
you have no retreat.

463
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:26,950
Let's go.

464
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:28,610
Black is doomed to lose.

465
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,190
In this way,

466
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,130
it's a comeback from despair.

467
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,410
Brillant.

468
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,170
Keep quiet while watching the game.

469
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,930
Ganging up on one person

470
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,890
isn't gentlemanly.

471
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,830
This is a game

472
00:27:58,830 --> 00:27:59,850
set up in the tea house.

473
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,450
Anyone can compete for the prize.

474
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,690
Miantang and I have always been a team.

475
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,980
It was the same in Mount Yang,
and it remains so today.

476
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,370
You may solve one game,

477
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,780
but you can't

478
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:14,690
solve the predetermined Go path.

479
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,500
So each move is fraught with danger,

480
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,580
and there is no way out.

481
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:23,830
Predetermined...

482
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:24,670
You lose.

483
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,370
Stop here.

484
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,340
Since our parting in Qingzhou,

485
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,850
Mr. Ziyu's Go style has changed.

486
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,340
In different environments

487
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,610
and roles,

488
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,650
the Go style changes as well.

489
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,890
And what's the current role

490
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,540
of the lady who made that move?

491
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,410
My business

492
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,780
is none of your concern anymore.

493
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:02,630
I've lost.

494
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,440
Miantang, let's...

495
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,580
Uncle is waiting for me.

496
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:16,060
From here on out,

497
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,540

Great-Grandmother.

All my thoughts

533
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,260
are focused on a few specific things.

534
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,650
The political situation is settled.

535
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,850
You choose a date to crown the empress.

536
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:19,510
Then I'll have nothing else

537
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:20,650
to concern myself with.

538
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,370
It concerns the foundation of the kingdom.

539
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:30,500
I'm still discussing it with ministers.

540
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,100
It cannot be rushed.

541
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:37,340
I'm old now.

542
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,210
These days,

543
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,070
Xueji has

544
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,610
helped me a lot.

545
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,820
She has managed

546
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,130
the harem affairs very well.

547
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,060
You flatter me, Grand Empress Dowager.

548
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,850
I'm not that skilled.

549
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,920
I just ran

550
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,170
a few errands.

551
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,930
Since you've signed
the marriage certificate with His Majesty,

552
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,820
by common standards,

553
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,370
you are

554
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:03,100
his legitimate fiancée.

555
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,350
So, I should keep her by my side

556
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:08,100
and guide her well.

557
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,680
However, her current yard

558
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,100
is too remote.

559
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,300
How about this.

560
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,260
Let her move into Chonghua Palace soon.

561
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,980
That way,

562
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:24,370
she'll live much closer to me.

563
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:28,590
Your Majesty,

564
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,020
what do you think?

565
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:35,260
Chonghua Palace is for the Empress.

566
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,410
Since it involves of crowning the Empress,

567
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,210
I'm afraid I can't agree to that right now.

568
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,370
Alright then.

569
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,260
Rest assured, Great-Grandmother.

570
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:47,820
I'll give you an answer

571
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,650
after the spring hunt.

572
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,260
Very well,

573
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:54,450
I'll wait a few more days then.

574
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,170
But there's one more thing

575
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,210
on my mind.

576
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,610
Wuhua has been with me

577
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,780
since she was a kid.

578
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,980
She's received my care.

579
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:12,170
Now that she's of age,

580
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,580
I'm reluctant to part with her,

581
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,330
but I must

582
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:19,770
find her a good match.

583
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:21,810
Wuhua has long come of age.

584
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,020
But since you brought this up,

585
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,770
do you have a prince consort
in mind for her?

586
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,730
You can really read my mind.

587
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,130
Your Majesty,

588
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,060
what do you think of Lord Huaiyang?

589
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,980
I've heard that Lord Huaiyang

590
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:46,150
has distinguished military achievements.

591
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,730
He's a promising young man.

592
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,130
However,

593
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,940
he's spent most of his life
on the battlefield.

594
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,460
If his temperament is a bit rough,

595
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,130
he might not suit Princess Wuhua.

596
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,030
When Lord Huaiyang was young,

597
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,760
he came here a lot.

598
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,940
I've seen him.

599
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,540
He has

600
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,460
a calm disposition,

601
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:07,170
not at all like

602
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:09,330
a rough military man.

603
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,940
Your Majesty,

604
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,420
what do you think?

605
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:19,730
Lord Huaiyang is both
a scholar and a warrior,

606
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,840
and he's of similar age to Wuhua.

607
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,900
They would make a good match.

608
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,770
But it's about her marriage.

609
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,070
Wuhua's opinion

610
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,540
must be considered.

611
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,500
Of course.

612
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,860
The day after tomorrow
is the spring hunt day.

613
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:34,990
Why not

614
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,980
let them meet

615
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,650
each other?

616
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:42,170
Great-Grandmother is getting old,

617
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,980
and has lived through
political upheaval.

618
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,130
These days,

619
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,940
thanks for your attentive care.

620
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,120
Right,

621
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,610
despite this,

622
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,510
Xueji, you are kind

623
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:54,460
and wise,

624
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:57,020
I'll always respect you

625
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:59,020
regardless of your status in the palace.

626
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,280
Your Majesty.

627
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,650
I can see

628
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,760
that Grand Empress Dowager

629
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,020
put you in a difficult position.

630
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:11,020
You have your considerations,

631
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:12,480
and I know

632
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,460
my own position.

633
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,060
Because I know

634
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,030
that the person you love

635
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,170
is neither me

636
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,650
nor Ms. Sun.

637
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:28,380
I have seen loving couples before.

638
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,730
The way they look at each other

639
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,070
is the same as how you

640
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:35,330
gaze at the crabapple tree
in the courtyard.

641
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,000
So,

642
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,650
please don't worry.

643
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,130
Do you really think so?

644
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,670
Your Majesty, you and I

645
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,250
were bound by interests.

646
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,030
I'm well aware

647
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,060
of my position

648
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,730
and dare not harbor any illusions.

649
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:53,610
Your Majesty, perhaps

650
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,400
your proposal

651
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,420
was just an act of generosity.

652
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:58,940
But to me,

653
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,810
you saved me from a tough situation.

654
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,070
I will always remember

655
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,250
your kindness.

656
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,900
You've been cooped up since childhood.

657
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,020
Even now that you're in the capital,

658
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,130
you haven't had a chance
to go out and have fun, right?

659
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:17,650
Your Majesty,

660
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,440
- I...
- Even if you're serving the Emperor,

661
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,290
you don't need to be so formal,

662
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,730
like those old scholars at court.

663
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:28,210
Since you're so considerate,

664
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,730
I'll reciprocate.

665
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:33,550
You'll join me

666
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,330
on the spring hunt

667
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,290
and get to see the outside world.

668
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,980
Thank you, Your Majesty.

669
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:50,220
(Qi'an)

670
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,980
Ms. Sun, are you okay?

671
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,020
I can't bear the wind.

672
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:02,770
Close the curtains

673
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,130
more tightly.

674
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,960
Don't worry, Ms. Sun.

675
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,920
The physician said

676
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,690
your injury is healing well.

677
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,470
Is it?

678
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,590
It seems the scar

679
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:16,020
has faded a lot.

680
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,670
With proper care,

681
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,810
it will fully recover.

682
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,280
Where are we now?

683
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,510
Ms. Sun.

684
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:26,650
We're nearly at the palace.

685
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:28,980
His Majesty will come and pick me up.

686
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,150
I don't want him to see this scar.

687
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,170
It's unsightly.

688
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,920
Go fetch me some powder.

689
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,150
You are not unsighty.

690
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,070
Everything you do

691
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:39,110
is for His Majesty.

692
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,650
He will only feel compassion for you.

693
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,880
Yes, His Majesty has waited so long

694
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,110
just to bring you into the palace

695
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:44,980
to be the Empress.

696
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,210
From now on,

697
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,510
you'll be the most powerful woman.

698
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,320
Yes.

699
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,690
When I become the Empress,

700
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,800
I'll go take revenge

701
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,420
on that Liu wretch.

702
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,200
Open the door.

703
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:10,840
Sister.

704
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,280
Great Uncle.

705
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:20,130
They've visited three families today.

706
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,460
Ms. Liu

707
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:22,690
is a great businesswoman.

708
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:25,770
We'd better wait for a while.

709
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,880
Wuhua is late.

710
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,580
I greet and apologize
to Great-Grandmother.

711
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:50,940
Rise up.

712
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,610
Thank you, Great-Grandmother.

713
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,100
Today,

714
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,250
you should take care of yourself.

715
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:00,550
The mountain air is cold,

716
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:01,940
and riding can make you sweat.

717
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,690
Don't catch a cold.

718
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:04,980
It's okay.

719
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,710
I'll hunt a tigress

720
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:07,980
to honor Great-Grandmother.

721
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,650
What nonsense.

722
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,710
Princess Wuhua has the same spirit

723
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:17,650
as the Grand Empress Dowager in her youth.

724
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,030
We ladies can only

725
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:20,770
watch and admire.

726
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:24,460
Xueji, you are not going?

727
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:27,330
I'm not good at riding and archery.

728
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,860
I can't even draw a bow.

729
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:31,170
I'll stay here and await
the good news from you.

730
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:37,330
Greetings, Your Majesty.

731
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,760
Greetings, Great-Grandmother.

732
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,460
Greetings, Grand Empress Dowager.

733
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,100
You may rise.

734
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:55,920
Today, during the spring hunt,

735
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,540
I hope everyone enjoys themselves
to the fullest.

736
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:03,690
We look forward to
a prosperous new year for all.

737
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:08,170
In high spirits,
I've decided to add a prize.

738
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:18,020
After Emperor Taizu founded the kingdom,

739
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,900
he came across a white deer

740
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:23,020
during the spring hunt,

741
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:25,330
considered it a good omen,

742
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,150
and had this white jade crafted.

743
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,500
He named it

744
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,330
"Deer Calls Pedant".

745
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:33,990
Today,

746
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,770
whoever takes

747
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,290
the top prize

748
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:41,060
will win this

749
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,690
jade pendant.

750
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:47,580
- Thank you, Great-Grandmother.
- Thank you, Grand Empress Dowager.

751
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,330
Everyone,

752
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:54,650
show your best efforts.

753
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,290
We will do our best.

754
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,980
I'll take my leave.

755
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:06,500
We'll take our leave.

756
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:07,980
Go on.

757
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:08,950
Go.

758
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,130
Xingzhou.

759
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:22,020
Do you remember Wuhua?

760
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:26,770
When you were young,

761
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,670
you often came to the palace,

762
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:30,100
met with Wuhua,

763
00:42:30,710 --> 00:42:33,650
and always praised her in front of me.

764
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:36,900
Today is the spring hunt.

765
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:38,980
She is a girl.

766
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:42,210
Riding along mountain paths
can be tough for her.

767
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:43,940
I hope you can accompany her

768
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:45,960
and take care of her

769
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:46,980
along the way.

770
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:55,060
Cui Xingzhou.

771
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:58,940
Have we really met before?

772
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:02,100
I don't remember you at all.

773
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:05,540
Back then, I was just a child,

774
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,540
and you were probably an infant.

775
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,250
Let's be clear.

776
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,900
I want to get that jade pendant.

777
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,690
Don't slow me down.

778
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:21,170
Your Highness.

779
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,500
If you don't fall off your horse,

780
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,250
I'll consider myself very fortunate.

781
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:28,060
Are you underestimating me?

782
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,280
Alright,

783
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,730
