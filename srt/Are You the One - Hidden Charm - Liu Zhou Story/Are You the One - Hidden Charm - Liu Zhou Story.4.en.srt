=Episode 4=

14
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,300
Anyone here?

15
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,810
Are you Mr. Hate Brush?

16
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,020
Mr. Chen Shi?

17
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:09,460
(Throw Away the Ink)

18
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,380
Mr. Hate Brush.

19
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,910
Your title suits you well.

20
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,130
The brush is so hateful.

21
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,870
I wish I could break it

22
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,190
and never paint again.

23
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,240
Fangxie.

24
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,880
I have some thoughts

25
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,160
on this painting.

26
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,000
I wonder if you

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,210
would be willing to hear them.

28
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,260
Please go ahead.

29
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,070
Later, I'll have to chop wood and cook.

30
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,150
In the eyes of this dragonfly,

31
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,220
I see a graceful figure.

32
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,870
A woman holding an umbrella.

33
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,900
You have sharp eyes.

34
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,170
My Lord,

35
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,940
the bandits aren't here.

36
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,260
She came for the painting.

37
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,430
Why is she looking at the painting?

38
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,820
Your brushwork is superb,

39
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,150
but in my opinion,

40
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,430
the most skillful part of the painting

41
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:18,870
is not the dragonfly's eyes.

42
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,870
(Mr. Hate Brush)
It's the seal.

43
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:23,970
I didn't expect you

44
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,870
to be an expert in seal carving too.

45
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,590
My husband deals in porcelain.

46
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,940
You are skilled at carving porcelain seals.

47
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,650
If you could apply this skill

48
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,980
to our porcelain,

49
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,150
you'd make your name in Zhenzhou.

50
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,150
To be honest,

51
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,910
our porcelain shop isn't doing well.

52
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,350
Many stores have already closed.

53
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,090
We came to Lingquan Town

54
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,540
to start anew.

55
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,910
My husband is a kind man.

56
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,220
He wanted to give me peace of mind

57
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:53,470
and clear my name,

58
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:54,910
so he spent

59
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,780
all our remaining money

60
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,150
to host a grand banquet.

61
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,260
He hid this from me

62
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,820
yet gave me the best house

63
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,720
and the most expensive scented powder.

64
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,560
But he has to face the end

65
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,470
of our business alone.

66
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,260
Now, he's even playing Go.

67
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,990
If we can't succeed

68
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,670
in Lingquan Town,

69
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:21,870
I'm afraid my husband

70
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,460
will be tormented inside.

71
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,190
As his wife,

72
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,900
I've drained his fortune.

73
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,380
I have nothing to give him to start anew.

74
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,230
All I have is my sincerity,

75
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:35,820
hoping to move you

76
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,260
to use your godly skills

77
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,430
to help us rebuild our business.

78
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,230
There are many who can carve seals.

79
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,230
Why did you choose me?

80
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,790
Because of the dragonfly in this painting?

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,870
I guess

82
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,820
the graceful woman

83
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,260
is your wife, right?

84
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,580
The dragonfly is near the water,

85
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,110
but its eyes don't see the lotus.

86
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,260
Because when you're in love with someone,

87
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,900
they're the only ones you can see.

88
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,140
Cui Jiu is truly blessed.

89
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:19,160
If you agree,

90
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,260
I will pay you generously.

91
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,140
I don't agree.

92
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:23,730
Sir.

93
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,760
Sir.

94
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:36,490
Sir.

95
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:39,610
Originally,

96
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,500
I could have achieved great things.

97
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,460
But I loved painting.

98
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:49,260
My wife was understanding.

99
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:52,400
At that time, she believed in me,

100
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,670
just like you do now.

101
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,340
As a result,

102
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,670
I painted for ten years

103
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,900
but never succeeded.

104
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,670
We lived in a shabby house,

105
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,340
struggling to make ends meet.

106
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,550
Even when my wife was gravely ill,

107
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,870
I couldn't afford medicine.

108
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,430
My wife, like you,

109
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,500
gave everything

110
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,570
for a worthless man.

111
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,430
In the end,

112
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,360
she was

113
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,140
buried here alone,

114
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,310
left to the wind and rain.

115
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,310
So forgive me.

116
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,700
I can't agree.

117
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:29,850
Sir.

118
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,670
My husband is not a worthless man.

119
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,750
If he wants to rebuild your business,

120
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,790
why didn't he come with you?

121
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,500
Sir, you misunderstand.

122
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,560
My husband, he...

123
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,750
- He just...
- Just arrived late.

124
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,230
I'm Cui Jiu.

125
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,550
I hope you will use your skills

126
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,310
to fulfill my wife's wish.

127
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,000
Ms. Liu, wait.

128
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,940
- What?
- What do you mean?

129
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:10,480
Ms. Liu and I

130
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,190
were appreciating the painting,

131
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:13,900
and you suddenly appeared

132
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,080
and ruined the mood.

133
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,560
Jealous?

134
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,450
I arranged everything.

135
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:22,570
I let her find Lu Wen.

136
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,900
You took her to see the painting.

137
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,990
If I hadn't appeared,

138
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,550
given her temperament,

139
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,260
she would come

140
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:30,500
every day.

141
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,670
How can I catch Lu Wen?

142
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:34,460
That's your problem.

143
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:36,880
It has nothing to do with me.

144
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:40,990
You did it on purpose.

145
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:42,750
I'm a physician.

146
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,700
Physicians are compassionate.

147
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,400
I can't stand seeing my patients

148
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,310
being used

149
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,020
and ending up badly.

150
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,640
Don't do it again.

151
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,820
Why should I listen to you?

152
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,640
I make my own rules.

153
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,240
I'll do it every day

154
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,490
to annoy you.

155
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:09,110
Don't meet Zhao anymore.

156
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,260
We are husband and wife.

157
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,070
He should stay within his bounds.

158
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,840
He even made excuses

159
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,230
to take you to see that painter.

160
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,190
He almost...

161
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:20,870
He almost broke my rules.

162
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,240
You too.

163
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,670
It was my oversight.

164
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,450
I was only thinking about the shop,

165
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:27,380
ignoring your feelings.

166
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,010
Fortunately, you came.

167
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,870
Mr. Hate Brush finally agreed,

168
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,700
charging us the price of one painting.

169
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:37,770
Jealous?

170
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,720
No.

171
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,480
Not at all.

172
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,070
Jiu,

173
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,190
is something troubling you?

174
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:55,030
Why do you ask?

175
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,840
I just feel like your mood

176
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,940
has been up and down lately.

177
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,930
Sometimes you smile; sometimes you frown.

178
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,220
You keep holding back

179
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,640
things you wanna say.

180
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,810
It's like you've been wronged

181
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:07,220
but have no one to talk to.

182
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,100
You're overthinking.

183
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:12,860
I know

184
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,790
you're keeping something from me.

185
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,220
It's fine if you

186
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,790
don't want to tell me.

187
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,670
I just hope that one day,

188
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:23,790
we'll be open with each other.

189
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,980
Jiu, you can trust me.

190
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,910
No matter what challenges we face,

191
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,600
I'll stay by your side

192
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,670
wholeheartedly.

193
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:32,790
As long as we stand together as one,

194
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,430
we'll get through it.

195
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:44,770
Thank you.

196
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:48,890
And

197
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,480
remember to take the medicine

198
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,860
from Physician Zhao on time.

199
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,150
It'll help you recover faster.

200
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,510
Don't mention that Physician Zhao again.

201
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,030
I'm perfectly fine.

202
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,460
(Lingquan Town)

203
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,450
Hurry, hurry.

204
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,390
Get ready to set sail.

205
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:12,810
Coming.

206
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,690
Come on, watch your step.

207
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:18,620
- Thank you.
- Come on.

208
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:19,810
Take it slow.

209
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,340
What are you waiting for? Get on the boat.

210
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,170
Wait a little longer.

211
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,680
General Huang.

212
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,130
How is Liu?

213
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,450
She's been staying in the house.

214
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:38,670
No signs of leaving.

215
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:40,530
What about you?

216
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,600
They're all there.

217
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,340
Waiting for her.

218
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,290
My lord.

219
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,680
Keep watching.

220
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:54,820
- Yes.
- Yes.

221
00:10:58,570 --> 00:10:59,940
If Liu Miantang dares to come,

222
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,150
she won't leave.

223
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,640
By then,

224
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,980
we can either feed her to the fish

225
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:05,310
or bring her to the master.

226
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,790
The decision will be yours.

227
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,700
She still hasn't shown up.

228
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,220
Could it be that she's completely forgotten

229
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,940
the code from Mount Yang?

230
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,580
Young Master...

231
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:21,890
Miss.

232
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,080
Stop waiting.

233
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,290
Let's go.

234
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:43,860
Why are they leaving?

235
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,670
Did they spot us?

236
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:50,100
Hold on.

237
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:51,910
Wait, wait!

238
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,390
Hurry up! Hurry up!

239
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,720
Slow down.

240
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,030
You're wise, My Lord.

241
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,980
Look, My Lord.

242
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,700
The Chief Commander of Qingzhou.

243
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:24,940
Shi Yikuan.

244
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,870
(Cui Mansion)
Chief Commander?

245
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,150
Who is this?

246
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,510
He's Lord Huaiyang in Qingzhou.

247
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,480
Qingzhou is

248
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,880
next to our Zhenzhou.

249
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,270
There were bandit troubles before.

250
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,090
I've heard the Chief Commander
and Lord Huaiyang have been

251
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,390
competing to catch the bandits.

252
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:40,880
If I were them,

253
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,220
why bother with the bandits?

254
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,690
I'd just burn Mount Yang to the ground.

255
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:46,410
- Impressive.
- Look at you!

256
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:47,260
Aren't I clever?

257
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,050
Why are you still sitting here?

258
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,570
The Cui porcelain shop is opening.

259
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:51,760
Why not join the fun?

260
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,640
It's opening?

261
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,720
Let's go check it out.

262
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,560
- Let's go.
- Go.

263
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,720
Where did you hear that?

264
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,910
Everyone's talking about it.

265
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,920
What a lively scene!

266
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,060
(Yushao Porcelain Shop)

267
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,700
Take a look!

268
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,720
Freshly made! Come and see!

269
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,100
Look at all these people.

270
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,680
Let's go.

271
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:34,700
Mrs. Cui, may your business prosper!

272
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:36,690
- Take your time.
- Sure.

273
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,290
Whether it prospers

274
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:39,570
depends on all of you, ladies,

275
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:40,580
to help me out.

276
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,900
Of course.

277
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,240
(Five taels)

278
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,190
Of course.

279
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,390
So expensive!

280
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,600
Jade pillow with curtain.

281
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,790
The coolness seeps through.

282
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,240
This porcelain pillow is as smooth as jade,

283
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,070
with a color slightly lighter than sky blue.

284
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:55,310
A top-quality item.

285
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,030
Mrs. Yin, you have an eye for quality.

286
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:58,530
Of course.

287
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,640
In my porcelain workshop,

288
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,510
each item goes through 72 processes,

289
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,410
all personally overseen by me.

290
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,790
Rest assured and take your pick.

291
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,570
Who would've thought Mrs. Cui,

292
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,910
having been here a short while,

293
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:09,340
has already become an expert?

294
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:13,720
Look. So beautiful.

295
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,220
On such a joyous day,

296
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:17,640
why is your husband absent again?

297
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,070
He's learning Go from a famous master.

298
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,940
He's been busy and couldn't be here.

299
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,670
Let me take you all inside to look.

300
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,190
- Sure!
- Let's go.

301
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,560
My lord.

302
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:45,880
The leader has left.

303
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,910
Will Lu Wen still come?

304
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:48,580
Knowing Lu Wen,

305
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,170
he won't let this

306
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:51,670
end so easily.

307
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,810
Besides, Liu Miantang

308
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,100
reacted to that code.

309
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,220
Let's wait and see.

310
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,150
It's so beautiful.

311
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,670
Indeed, it's quite nice.

312
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,270
I heard the garrison's nephew has gone missing.

313
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,580
That guy is probably

314
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,410
off somewhere causing trouble.

315
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:25,430
It's true.

316
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,340
His family's been searching for days.

317
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,460
I bet

318
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,510
he offended someone.

319
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:35,170
My lord.

320
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,310
Chen Tu is missing.

321
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,620
Didn't you say to leave him alone?

322
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:45,620
So what?

323
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,100
What does it have to do with me?

324
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,170
Young man.

325
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:01,810
You've eaten three buns

326
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:03,120
at my door.

327
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,220
Do you want to come inside?

328
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,690
- I...
- We've just opened.

329
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:07,530
Come in and look.

330
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,010
Please.

331
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:16,810
My lord.

332
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,580
She invited our shadow guard inside.

333
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,080
This...

334
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,190
Do you like this design?

335
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,640
This is a special design

336
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,340
we made for the grand opening.

337
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,940
This design...

338
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,480
To be honest,

339
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,430
I got the inspiration from a night lamp.

340
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:38,670
It looks very festive at home, too.

341
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,480
Just printed it on the porcelain?

342
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,790
Yes, isn't it beautiful?

343
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:46,790
Liu Miantang

344
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,430
sure knows how to do business.

345
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,330
It seems she really can't recall

346
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:56,340
those codes.

347
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:21,420
I'm sorry.

348
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:23,750
It's okay if it breaks.

349
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:26,180
We only sold one set today.

350
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,820
If we lose one,

351
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:29,340
we'll consider it sold out.

352
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:40,490
Madam.

353
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:41,620
It's time.

354
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:42,860
Shall we close up?

355
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,710
Get ready to close up.

356
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,950
Would you like to take a look at the porcelain?

357
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,410
This piece

358
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,820
is quite unique.

359
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:01,810
How many are there?

360
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,320
You have a good eye.

361
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,080
This design is exclusive to our shop.

362
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,070
Ten sets in total.

363
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,250
I'll take them all.

364
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,450
Alright, please wait a moment.

365
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,340
I'll wrap them in gold foil for you.

366
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,800
Today, we had a great opening.

367
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,900
I asked Nanny Li to buy bones for soup.

368
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,320
Jiu,

369
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,340
you won't believe it.

370
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,930
The set of porcelain I made on a whim

371
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:30,040
was a best-seller.

372
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,230
They all sold out.

373
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,130
Even the sample we used

374
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:34,070
is gone.

375
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:36,210
Please.

376
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:37,730
Jiu,

377
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,800
when it comes to porcelain designs

378
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,930
and customer preferences,

379
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,340
you'll need to put in more effort.

380
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:46,820
But it's okay.

381
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,050
I'm here.

382
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:49,130
Once Mr. Hate Brush's

383
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:51,240
carved series is released,

384
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,180
our business will keep getting better.

385
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,820
We'll be able to eat meat every day.

386
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,340
You're indeed

387
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,230
good at business.

388
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,030
So why don't I make

389
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,710
another set of printed porcelain

390
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,530
as our shop's signature item?

391
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,660
- Are you alright?
- Liu, come out!

392
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,880
Come out now!

393
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:16,820
- Madam!
- Madam!

394
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:21,210
Who is it?

395
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,560
Madam!

396
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,320
It's that Chen Tu
who caused a scene at the banquet.

397
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,790
His uncle brought people here.

398
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,240
Open the door.

399
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,320
I'll handle it.

400
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,170
- Madam!
- He's after me.

401
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,010
I'll deal with him.

402
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,560
Open the door! Open up!

403
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,420
- Open it!
- Open it!

404
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,190
- Open up!
- Open up!

405
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,360
Hurry! Open the door!

406
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,340
- Quick, open it!
- Open the door!

407
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,620
Garrison Chen, is it?

408
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,510
Turns out you're a lowly seductress.

409
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,240
Where did you hide my nephew?

410
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,080
Hand him over.

411
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,230
What a joke.

412
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,000
Your nephew has legs of his own.

413
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,140
I didn't tie him up.

414
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,070
Why are you asking me?

415
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,510
You know better than I do

416
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,180
about his immoral behavior.

417
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,650
He probably did something shameful

418
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:09,900
and ran off in fear

419
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,890
of being caught by the authorities.

420
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:13,030
How dare you!

421
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,620
Do you even know who I am?

422
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:17,860
Let me tell you.

423
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,470
In this territory,

424
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,800
there's nothing I, Chen Zhongyuan,

425
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:21,820
can't control.

426
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,370
Even Lord Huaiyang

427
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,900
is a sworn brother of mine.

428
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,360
Today,

429
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,510
if you don't hand over my nephew,

430
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,100
I'll have you

431
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,000
thrown into prison

432
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,690
and subjected to all kinds of torture.

433
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:36,200
Let's see if you're still so bold.

434
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,070
- You're so bold.
- Give it to me.

435
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,860
What are you planning to do?

436
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:42,280
Lord Huaiyang?

437
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,130
Though Lord Huaiyang has some ties with you,

438
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:44,970
he won't show you

439
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,950
any favoritism in this matter.

440
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,320
Don't you know

441
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,620
what your nephew did?

442
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:53,210
Breaking into homes and assaulting women.

443
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,170
According to the law,

444
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,550
100 lashes and 3 years of labor.

445
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,100
Such lawlessness

446
00:20:58,450 --> 00:20:59,550
cannot be tolerated.

447
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:01,930
Though I am just a commoner,

448
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:02,770
I will pursue

449
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,750
this matter with you to the end.

450
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:06,710
I'll report it and ask

451
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,310
Lord Huaiyang to intervene.

452
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:11,000
I was just trying

453
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,610
to scare the woman.

454
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:13,900
I had no other malicious intent.

455
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,510
You didn't scare me.

456
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,130
It's the constant noise

457
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,340
that's been bothering me.

458
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:24,450
Let's go.

459
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,580
- Wise decision.
- Wise.

460
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,510
Garrison Chen

461
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:41,880
backing down

462
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:43,510
indicates that if this matter

463
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,410
were to reach Lord Huaiyang,

464
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:46,250
he couldn't face

465
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:47,450
the consequences.

466
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,750
This shows

467
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:51,620
that Lord Huaiyang is just

468
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:52,810
and impartial.

469
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:54,610
He openly

470
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:56,650
harassed innocent commoners

471
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,140
and claimed to be on intimate terms
with the Lord.

472
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:00,950
Being friends with someone like him

473
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,270
shows that the Lord must

474
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,860
turn a blind eye frequently

475
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,380
so he can do this.

476
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,140
"A crooked beam will lead to a crooked roof."

477
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,930
If even a garrison is like this,

478
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:15,230
can Lord Huaiyang be trusted?

479
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,860
Enough about him.

480
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,210
Come back and eat.

481
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:20,050
The food's cold.

482
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:22,880
Close the door.

483
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,840
My Lord,

484
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,520
this morning, Shi Yikuan stayed

485
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,420
at the official mansion

486
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,710
and sent you a visiting card

487
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,990
(Visiting Card)
for your mother's birthday.

488
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,960
(Shi Yikuan has come to congratulate.)
Shi Yikuan has never praised you in court.

489
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,660
Why is he being so attentive this time?

490
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,660
That's just an excuse.

491
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:06,710
He's here to reprimand me.

492
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,340
These bandits leaving Zhenzhou

493
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:11,970
must be planning something

494
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:12,890
even more important

495
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:14,140
than finding Liu Miantang.

496
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:18,580
(Yushao Porcelain Shop)

497
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:25,660
(Game Record)

498
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:00,970
Madam.

499
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:02,690
Master.

500
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,080
I've prepared some food.

501
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,230
Please have some.

502
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:14,730
Take it away.

503
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,840
Madam.

504
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,710
How was business today?

505
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:28,510
Nanny Li,

506
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,210
you are the third person

507
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,660
to come through this door today.

508
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:36,310
It's normal for a new shop

509
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:39,100
to have slow business.

510
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,620
Yesterday,

511
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:43,620
the entire set on that table sold out.

512
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:45,790
I thought today would be even better.

513
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:49,520
A customer who can buy ten sets at once

514
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,820
is not an everyday occurrence.

515
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,310
I just said that sales were good yesterday

516
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,140
but never mentioned that it

517
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,950
was bought by one person.

518
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,620
How did you know?

519
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,080
I...

520
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,750
I heard it from someone.

521
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,840
Fangxie?

522
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,920
Yes.

523
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,640
Fangxie.

524
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,710
But after the shop closed yesterday,

525
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,470
Fangxie went back to her hometown.

526
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,170
Where did you

527
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:17,010
see her?

528
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:26,880
Jiu,

529
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:28,950
do you know

530
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,790
that customer?

531
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,840
Jiu?

532
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,710
What? No.

533
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:43,290
Moru?

534
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:47,920
Madam.

535
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:49,100
You were with the master

536
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:50,610
all day yesterday, weren't you?

537
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,660
Yes, I didn't leave his side for a moment.

538
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:58,900
I had a friend buy them.

539
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,270
I thought

540
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:05,340
my sales were good.

541
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,010
Well.

542
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,120
Madam,

543
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,280
the master did it

544
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,750
because he cares about you.

545
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,700
Well.

546
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,300
He was worried about your business,

547
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,690
so he found someone to support it.

548
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:20,450
He did it

549
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:21,650
because he loves you.

550
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:22,490
Yes, yes.

551
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:23,690
The master

552
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:25,230
was worried all day yesterday,

553
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:26,860
so he found someone.

554
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,030
I didn't

555
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:36,030
want you to worry.

556
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:41,750
No matter the intention,

557
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,140
it's a fact that our goods can't be sold.

558
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:47,510
Finding someone to pretend and deceive me.

559
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:51,030
It was all a false show.

560
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,310
You...

561
00:26:58,850 --> 00:26:59,900
Don't like it?

562
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:01,950
Who likes being deceived,

563
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:04,620
especially by someone they live with every day?

564
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,840
Jiu,

565
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,180
don't deceive me in the future,

566
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:19,600
okay?

567
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:26,470
The master would never deceive you.

568
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:28,530
Yes.

569
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,950
The master isn't a liar.

570
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,240
As long as we work together

571
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,370
and run the business well,

572
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:35,100
things will get better and better.

573
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:45,340
Lord Huaiyang's residence

574
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:47,660
hasn't been this lively for a long time.

575
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,860
It's all because of your deep family ties.

576
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,890
As the old saying goes,

577
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:54,790
"When celebrating a birthday,"

578
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,620
"deep family ties bring lasting fortune."

579
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:58,320
My fortune

580
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,470
lies with you.

581
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:01,240
Mother, don't worry.

582
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,420
I will manage the residence

583
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:05,170
very well.

584
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:06,280
I trust you

585
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,710
to manage the residence.

586
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,950
I'm saying

587
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,140
that after Binglan marries you,

588
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:13,140
you two should live harmoniously

589
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,900
and have a son or daughter.

590
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:17,030
Then I'll truly be at ease.

591
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,860
She's scheming

592
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,550
and can surely maintain her position.

593
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,550
You always

594
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:28,850
think others

595
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,340
are scheming.

596
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,340
Binglan is just a simple girl.

597
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,080
Alright, alright.

598
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,160
Madam.

599
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,220
Xingzhou.

600
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,100
The guests shouldn't be

601
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,460
kept waiting on such an occasion.

602
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,700
Madam.

603
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,420
I want to see the birthday gift

604
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,860
that my brother prepared for you.

605
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,580
I heard he put a lot of effort into it.

606
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:55,820
Mother.

607
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,060
Please.

608
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:12,420
(Longevity)

609
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:13,980
Thank you.

610
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:14,820
Xingzhou.

611
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,620
Orchids bring spring to the room.

612
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,700
Pines and cypresses bring longevity.

613
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,620
Consort Dowager is a pine.

614
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,900
The Lord is like a cypress.

615
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,180
May you have a long life

616
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,500
and remain evergreen.

617
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,870
Good.

618
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:45,500
Yes.

619
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:47,140
Like the pine and cypress,

620
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,380
towering and proud,

621
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,900
watching over our Zhenzhou people.

622
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,340
Let's raise a glass

623
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:54,620
to the Consort Dowager and the Lord.

624
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:55,620
- Sure.
- Sure.

625
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,660
Sure. Come on.

626
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,660
To the Consort Dowager.

627
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,160
To the Lord.

628
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,780
Look at these people.

629
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,500
It sounds like
they're celebrating your birthday.

630
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,060
Compared to previous years,

631
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,580
the guests this year

632
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,140
are indeed fewer.

633
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:17,420
Don't worry.

634
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,380
A guest hasn't arrived yet.

635
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,460
Consort Dowager.

636
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,660
My Lord.

637
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,540
General Shi.

638
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:34,020
I wish you longevity and radiance

639
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,620
like the sun and moon.

640
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,740
May I have a cup of longevity wine?

641
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,420
General Shi.

642
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,420
Of course.

643
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,940
We've been waiting for you.

644
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,300
Alright.

645
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,060
I'm late and is willing

646
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,180
to self-punish.

647
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,100
Please, sit down.

648
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,180
Good, good.

649
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,020
General Shi.

650
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,700
Good, good.

651
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,540
Good.

652
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,860
Peony wine.

653
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,460
Good wine indeed.

654
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:08,500
Peonies signify wealth and honor.

655
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,580
I hope the Lord will

656
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,260
amass great wealth

657
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,500
with singers and dancers

658
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:20,060
and live a carefree life of luxury.

659
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,740
A carefree life of luxury?

660
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,580
Is he here to force you to disband your troops?

661
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:35,380
General Shi, you've long
been stationed in Qingzhou.

662
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,820
You've traveled a long way

663
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,180
to celebrate this birthday.

664
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,380
This makes me

665
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:41,980
uneasy.

666
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,940
There's no need to be uneasy.

667
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,020
I'm just an ordinary person

668
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,420
who enjoys leisure.

669
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:51,180
Unlike you,

670
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,660
who have a stern face

671
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,420
and worries day and night

672
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,340
about bandits.

673
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,060
Until the Mount Yang bandits are cleared,

674
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:02,900
I dare

675
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:05,420
not relax.

676
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,420
That rat Lu Wen

677
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,700
has been squeezed away by us.

678
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,380
I don't know where he's run off to.

679
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,220
In the future,

680
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,300
My Lord,

681
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,820
you should take it easier.

682
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,100
The Emperor often says

683
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:25,380
that the people are the foundation
of the country.

684
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,500
We serve the court,

685
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,660
so we should

686
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,900
take it upon ourselves

687
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,660
to benefit the people.

688
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,420
Since everyone knows that,

689
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,140
hurry up and persuade our Lord.

690
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,380
The bandit threat

691
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,700
has diminished.

692
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,700
Keeping so many soldiers

693
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,100
is useless

694
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,220
and a waste of resources.

695
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,660
Besides,

696
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,420
the Emperor and the Empress Dowager

697
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,060
also feel

698
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,100
that the Lord

699
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,460
is acting improperly.

700
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:17,260
Today is my mother's birthday.

701
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:20,420
Unexpectedly, General Shi

702
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,380
still reprimands me.

703
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:27,980
Someone.

704
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:38,660
Moyao.

705
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,540
Cui Xingzhou.

706
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,220
What are you doing?

707
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,700
(Zhenzhou Map)

708
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,460
Mother,

709
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,820
I'm unfilial.

710
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,940
The birthday gifts were prepared hastily.

711
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,340
I hope you won't blame me.

712
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,740
When the late lord was alive,

713
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,260
he instructed me

714
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,500
to take the welfare

715
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:19,180
of the Zhenzhou people as my duty.

716
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:20,920
Lingquan Town,

717
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,860
located in the south of Zhenzhou,

718
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,820
suffers from annual flooding.

719
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,100
Whenever it rains, it floods.

720
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,820
Today is Mother's birthday,

721
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,100
so I'm determined

722
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,680
to invest manpower and funds

723
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:34,180
to manage the river and expand the waterways

724
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,980
to benefit the people

725
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:40,180
and repay my parents' teachings.

726
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,380
Good, good.

727
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,860
How commendable.

728
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,460
Loving the people so much.

729
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,300
Indeed.

730
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:49,980
Take it for Mother.

731
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,140
Repairing the waterways

732
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,780
can benefit agriculture,

733
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:55,740
water conservancy,

734
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:56,780
trade, and transportation

735
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:57,860
in Zhenzhou.

736
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,860
Taxes can also increase.

737
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,280
If that's the case,

738
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,600
Qingzhou under General Shi will also benefit.

739
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,090
A good thing indeed.

740
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,500
Since it's such a good thing,

741
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,260
let's get it done.

742
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,500
I wonder what General Shi

743
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,660
thinks about it.

744
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,580
I'm here to offer birthday greetings.

745
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,460
I talked out of whim.

746
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:24,100
It seems unnecessary.

747
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,300
It seems

748
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,220
the Lord has already considered this.

749
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,940
In a peaceful age,

750
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,980
even the Emperor is reluctant to waste

751
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,100
resources on soldiers.

752
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,540
How could I be any different?

753
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,060
It's a good opportunity

754
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,380
to use these soldiers for labor,

755
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,340
relieving the Emperor's worries

756
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,140
and addressing Zhenzhou's shortcomings.

757
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,660
What's not to like?

758
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,660
Troops for labor

759
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,100
is a way to reduce troops.

760
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,660
For the benefit of the people,

761
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,460
I've made up my mind

762
00:35:58,900 --> 00:35:59,900
and am willing to do so.

763
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,140
Good.

764
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:14,180
Since it's beneficial,

765
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,460
I'd like to stay

766
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:17,660
for a few more days

767
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:21,220
to see the river project begin.

768
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,380
This way, I can report your merit

769
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,860
to the court.

770
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,500
Very well.

771
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,900
You are most welcome.

772
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,340
Let's all raise our glasses.

773
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:39,740
Come on.

774
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,100
- Come on.
- Sure!

775
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,260
Good.

776
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,060
Xingzhou.

777
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,300
- Binglan.
- Xingzhou.

778
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,780
You just had some wine.

779
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,380
The wind will give you a headache.

780
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,780
I've made a hangover soup myself.

781
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,340
Thank you.

782
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:37,700
Put it down.

783
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,340
Sit down.

784
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,660
Earlier,

785
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,900
I saw that rude man

786
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,180
bothering you.

787
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,460
I was quite distressed.

788
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,180
Those drinking guests

789
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,980
are just flatterers

790
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,420
and don't know

791
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,540
the difficulties you face.

792
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,060
So,

793
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,860
you understand?

794
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,820
Of course.

795
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,860
Though I'm a woman,

796
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,900
I'll try my best to help you.

797
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,740
Father has some connections
in the Ministry of War

798
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,020
and can speak before the Empress Dowager.

799
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:45,940
If they make a plea

800
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,740
on your behalf,

801
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,900
you will...

802
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:50,620
No need.

803
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,580
Thank you.

804
00:38:58,740 --> 00:38:59,620
It's not hot anymore.

805
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,140
Binglan.

806
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:16,260
Someone told me a while ago

807
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,180
the servant behind you

808
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,500
went to Lingquan Town.

809
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,580
I'm sure it's because you

810
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,780
wanted to buy porcelain.

811
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:23,740
Did you find something you like?

812
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:24,740
If not,

813
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,060
I can help you choose.

814
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,140
It's fine.

815
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:29,140
I've already bought it.

816
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:30,510
Good.

817
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,500
That's good.

818
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:34,070
Binglan.

819
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,380
If there's anything you need

820
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,460
in the future,

821
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,060
just let me know.

822
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,220
Got it.

823
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:43,580
Alright.

824
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,460
I'll go back now.

825
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:07,780
My Lord.

826
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:11,740
My Lord.

827
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,100
These are invitations from the guests.

828
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,540
Everyone wants to invite you.

829
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,580
Aunt Lian wants to seek

830
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:28,020
(To Lord)
a post for two cousins.

831
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,620
Consort Dowager hopes for closer ties

832
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,340
and requests your care.

833
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:43,820
What else?

834
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,180
Mr. Lian is drunk.

835
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,020
I won't see him.

836
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,070
Yes.

837
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:51,020
What are you staring at?

838
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,260
I'm your Lord's uncle

839
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,380
and future father-in-law.

840
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,180
Go and report it quickly.

841
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,500
Hurry!

842
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,100
The Lord is resting now.

843
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:05,620
Please go back.

844
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,340
If today is not convenient,

845
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,860
then I'll come tomorrow.

846
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,300
My Lord,

847
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,180
rest early.

848
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,460
I'll come again tomorrow.

849
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,540
Like father, like son.

850
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,700
The old lord had the same demeanor.

851
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:28,540
Binglan,

852
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,780
you're the future princess.

853
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:32,500
You must know all the women

854
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,980
around the Lord.

855
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,980
It's best if you can hold their contracts.

856
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:37,380
If not,

857
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,980
like that mistress from Lingquan Town,

858
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,580
don't let your guard down.

859
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:46,340
My sister failed to manage things well.

860
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,020
She ended up poorly.

861
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,180
You've seen that.

862
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,500
Shumo said

863
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:53,020
that the little woman

864
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:55,420
was a bandit's captured merchant

865
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:59,220
who relied on her beauty to amuse men.

866
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,180
No matter how favored,

867
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,220
she's not worth mentioning.

868
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:06,700
I don't want to disturb Xingzhou

869
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:08,260
or upset him.

870
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:09,820
Binglan,

871
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:12,020
you're the future Princess of Huaiyang.

872
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,100
Before the marriage,

873
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,820
a nameless woman is taking up

874
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:16,980
your husband's attention.

875
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,100
Can you really swallow this anger?

876
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,540
It's my fault

877
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:26,980
for being confused.

878
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:29,340
I was afraid the old lord was a player

879
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,140
and exchanged my marriage with my sister.

880
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,380
Now,

881
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:35,900
with your father's

882
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,500
ineffective position,

883
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:40,500
my sister has taken the name

884
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,140
that should have been mine,

885
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,420
enjoying a grand birthday celebration.

886
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:45,940
Otherwise,

887
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,420
today's celebration

888
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:49,860
would have been mine.

889
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:51,220
Mother,

890
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,500
Aunt is my only support.

891
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,060
Don't let her hear this.

892
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,020
Mother,

893
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:15,820
I won't repeat your mistakes.

894
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,860
As long as I can become the princess,

895
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:22,860
nothing else

896
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,540
