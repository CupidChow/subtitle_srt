(Yushao Porcelain Shop Ledger)

15
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,120
Xingzhou.

16
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,060
How's it going?

17
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,750
As you wanted,

18
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,730
I've returned to Beizhou for the proposal.

19
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,180
But this has been postponed.

20
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,940
I discovered the identity

21
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,250
of the person in the portrait.

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,970
His real name is Qiao Xian,

23
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,970
the eldest son of the Qiao family.

24
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,530
He is also Liu Miantang's uncle.

25
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,310
Besides,

26
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,810
Liu Miantang's grandfather, Qiao Wu,

27
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,810
ranks sixth in his family.

28
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,010
I delved into the escort agency

29
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,780
and learned that he had an alias in business.

30
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,220
Luwu.

31
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,620
Luwu?

32
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,500
Lu Wen.

33
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,940
Is he really you?

34
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,620
Madam, you can start cooking now.

35
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,680
When it comes to the rice balls,

36
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,850
leave it to me.

37
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,380
When cooking,

38
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,060
add a bit of coarse salt to the water.

39
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,680
This will prevent the rice balls

40
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,620
from sticking together.

41
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,900
It's my first time hearing this.

42
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,870
But won't adding salt

43
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,290
to a sweet dish make it salty?

44
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:07,100
Salty water makes the rice balls sweeter.

45
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,270
Try it and see.

46
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,730
How else will we know if we don't try?

47
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,900
Alright, I'll try it.

48
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,930
Madam bought many medicines today.

49
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,000
She said they are folk remedies

50
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,220
for your injuries.

51
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,050
These medicines are quite potent.

52
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,220
Honey, why do you keep staring at me?

53
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,220
"You were once kind."

54
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,260
I've heard the second half of that saying.

55
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,370
"Why become a villain?"

56
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,100
I am willing to be that villain.

57
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,540
It allows me to steal a moment of leisure,

58
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,290
so I can spend

59
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,290
every year with you.

60
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,050
Just like today.

61
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,200
Honey,

62
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,700
today is the Little New Year.

63
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:58,930
I made rice balls.

64
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,960
Try them quickly.

65
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,900
They are really well-made.

66
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,200
Really?

67
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,580
I added something inside.

68
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,530
You got it at the first bite.

69
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,220
It's for good fortune next year.

70
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,100
Dear, you are thoughtful.

71
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,370
I also prepared a gift for you.

72
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,410
Thank you, honey.

73
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,610
Is there lime powder

74
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,970
on your nails?

75
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,800
I see the wall peeling a bit.

76
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,780
I planned to fix it.

77
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,730
Dear, be careful.

78
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,340
Some medicinal powders

79
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,100
can be harmless,

80
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,970
but when mixed with lime powder,

81
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,260
their potency increases.

82
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,700
If inhaled or ingested,

83
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,460
it can cause dizziness

84
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,930
and make your eyes unable to open.

85
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,850
How do you know this so well?

86
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,370
Have you fallen for this trick?

87
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,640
Not really.

88
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,170
Better to be cautious.

89
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,020
After all, the villain

90
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,700
has not been caught yet.

91
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,360
Isn't Lord Huaiyang

92
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,260
the best at catching bandits?

93
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,950
How can a small villain

94
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,340
make it so hard for him?

95
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,730
It's just some small tricks.

96
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,260
The villain

97
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,370
will eventually fall into his hands.

98
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,490
If that's the case,

99
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,780
why does he make you work every day?

100
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,290
Since you joined the army,

101
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,930
you haven't been home.

102
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,270
All you talk about is villains.

103
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,290
The food is getting cold.

104
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:04,560
Sometimes,

105
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,480
I would rather

106
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,610
be that villain,

107
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,780
so you could catch me.

108
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,820
That way, we could be together every day.

109
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,020
It's all my fault.

110
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,530
I almost ruined your meal.

111
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,360
Come on, honey.

112
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,200
I'll fill your cup.

113
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,580
I still have injuries.

114
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,110
Is it still hurting?

115
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,970
This is a medicinal wine

116
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,540
with blood-stirring herbs.

117
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,850
If you don't want it,

118
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,340
don't force yourself.

119
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,420
I'll look for another remedy.

120
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,540
Come and chase me!

121
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,100
(Cui Mansion)
Wait for me!

122
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,460
I didn't expect the night

123
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,770
to be so lively.

124
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,320
Ordinary people aren't

125
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,700
wealthy or powerful.

126
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,130
They ask for less,

127
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,540
so their joy is greater.

128
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,100
The lighting means a truce.

129
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,130
Lord Huaiyang keeps his word.

130
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,260
You have fought for so long

131
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,700
to have some tacit understanding.

132
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,780
What's it called?

133
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,300
Something fortunate?

134
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,020
How fortunate

135
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,820
to meet a worthy opponent.

136
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,620
Something's wrong!

137
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,340
Lord Huaiyang is attacking.

138
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,860
Do you like watching the sky lanterns?

139
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,500
Whenever the sky lantern rises,

140
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,340
I always tell myself

141
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,500
that tonight, we share this moment.

142
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,340
My Lord.

143
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,180
My Lord.

144
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,180
Your mother hasn't gone to bed.

145
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,780
She hopes you'll return to celebrate.

146
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,180
My Lord, go see the Consort Dowager.

147
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,260
She said she is old

148
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,220
and can't oppose you.

149
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,420
If you are truly set

150
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,940

151
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,260

00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,420
It's nothing.

190
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,500
My mother

191
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,140
has agreed to our matter.

192
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,260
Really?

193
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,980
That's good news.

194
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,260
Does the Consort Dowager know
about her background?

195
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,420
Her background,

196
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,820
what she did,

197
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,820
and who she is.

198
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,020
None of that matters.

199
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,260
I like her.

200
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,260
That won't change.

201
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,580
I'm asking about your mother.

202
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,620
Why are you showing me your heart?

203
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,260
Now it's fine.

204
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,980
You can also come clean with her.

205
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,410
At your wedding,

206
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,620
you can't accept my gift money.

207
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,620
I've been busy helping you cover this.

208
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,420
By the way,

209
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,460
I'm going to the capital.

210
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,300
Why?

211
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,140
I'm leaving tomorrow.

212
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,060
Are you crazy?

213
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:04,980
Going without a decree?

214
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,300
Do you know the consequences?

215
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,940
You just survived the war.

216
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,580
Prince Sui's actions,

217
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,500
in coordination with Ziyu,

218
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,460
make

219
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:13,900
the capital unstable.

220
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,340
Prince Sui's ambition

221
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,140
isn't recent.

222
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,740
Even if he wants to change,

223
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,500
he lacks a valid excuse.

224
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,940
What if he had a valid excuse?

225
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,340
Ziyu

226
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,020
is not Lu Wen.

227
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,500
He has many secrets.

228
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,500
I need to go to the capital

229
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,740
to investigate them.

230
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,740
No, wait.

231
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,140
Ziyu is not Lu Wen.

232
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,780
So who is Lu Wen?

233
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:37,980
Why worry so much?

234
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,540
Keep burning. Finish it all at once.

235
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,740
You revealed all the secrets.

236
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,020
Tell me.

237
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:44,860
You told me half.

238
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,260
It's hard for me to bear.

239
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:49,820
(Mansion of Duke Wu)

240
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,500
- Yes.
- That's true.

241
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,980
The Duke has arrived.

242
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,740
My Lord.

243
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,860
I'm late.

244
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,620
Come on. Sit.

245
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,460
Good.

246
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,620
- Come.
- The wine.

247
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,460
Serve the wine.

248
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,020
Minister Shi.

249
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:18,620
Is this the new Secretary
of the Ministry of War?

250
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,140
Yes.

251
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,420
Congratulations on having a precious daughter.

252
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,580
A pearl in hand.

253
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:27,900
It's a pity

254
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,380
she's not a son.

255
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:33,580
In my view,

256
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,700
a daughter is even better.

257
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:39,980
"A family with a daughter is sought after
by a hundred families."

258
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,860
- Isn't that right?
- Yes.

259
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,820
In the future,

260
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,300
she must marry a worthy husband

261
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,380
like your daughter did,

262
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:51,100
or today's fine wine will be in vain.

263
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,820
Yes, yes, yes.

264
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,460
Thank you for your favor.

265
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,340
A toast to you first.

266
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,860
Good. Let's drink.

267
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:00,820
Come.

268
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,780
Let's drink.

269
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,910
Let's drink together.

270
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,600
Let's drink.

271
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,460
Really good wine.

272
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,660
Good wine.

273
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,700
- Cheers.
- Good wine.

274
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,860
I'll toast another glass to you.

275
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,820
Good. Let's drink.

276
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,420
- Come on.
- Cheers.

277
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,020
This wine is nice.

278
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,660
Everyone,

279
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,220
I'll change clothes first.

280
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,140
Feel free. Enjoy.

281
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,500
Good.

282
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,100
Ziyu.

283
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,180
Cheers.

284
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,660
Cheers.

285
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,620
Are you sure?

286
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,060
He didn't stay in the capital long.

287
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,780
Only I served him closely.

288
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,980
After so many years,

289
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,820
his appearance has changed a bit.

290
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,100
But I'm sure

291
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,460
he is the son of the late Crown Prince.

292
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,620
Absolute true.

293
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,980
Ziyu

294
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,580
and Shi Yikuan.

295
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,820
Please calm down.

296
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,420
You did well.

297
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,260
When this young prince

298
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,380
left the Palace for travel,

299
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,860
he was only twelve years old.

300
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,340
I protected him

301
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,700
when he left the capital.

302
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,180
The other day, I saw him in the Palace briefly.

303
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,700
I only thought he looked familiar.

304
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,580
My Lord, your connections are amazing.

305
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,380
You even found such an old acquaintance.

306
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,700
I've sent someone

307
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,740
to the Palace

308
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,540
to inform my sister.

309
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,100
Everything is under your

310
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,380
and Empress Dowager's control.

311
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,260
But there are many people outside.

312
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,500
Ziyu's identity shouldn't be publicized.

313
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,420
It's not easy to act on it right now.

314
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,540
If they

315
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,540
can't hold their liquor

316
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,180
and stay here...

317
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,020
Come on.

318
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,500
Good wine. Really good.

319
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,020
Come on, let's drink.

320
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,070
I toast to you.

321
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,580
Cheers.

322
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,060
Cheers, Minister Shi.

323
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,520
Let's drink together.

324
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,740
Come on, please. Let's drink.

325
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,300
Minister Shi.

326
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,820
Let's continue.

327
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,660
Minister Shi?

328
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,860
Miss, it's so cold outside.

329
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:20,260
Why are you out here alone?

330
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,340
Mother is helping Sister with matchmaking.

331
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,820
I'd be in the way,

332
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,180
so I left to get fresh air.

333
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,300
Isn't that Zhou Cuo,

334
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,820
the young master's servant?

335
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,100
Miss Shi.

336
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,780
Why the rush?

337
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:37,780
Is something wrong?

338
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,980
Don't worry, Miss.

339
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,380
Minister Shi got drunk.

340
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,940
The young master asked me

341
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,980
to help him to rest.

342
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,620
My father is drunk?

343
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,460
Yes.

344
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,820
I toast to you.

345
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:52,980
Come.

346
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,020
Good.

347
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,260
Come on.

348
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,380
Good, good.

349
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,060
Secretary,

350
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,300
you're not eating

351
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,540
or drinking.

352
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,740
Is there something wrong

353
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,020
with the food and wine here?

354
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:12,860
Not at all.

355
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,140
You're quite handsome,

356
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:20,580
though your health is a bit frail.

357
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,500
I have poor luck,

358
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,260
having been injured as a child,

359
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,540
leaving me weak now.

360
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,380
Surviving great hardship

361
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,260
must mean future blessings.

362
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:33,940
Secretary,

363
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,020
you will surely

364
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,580
enjoy a long

365
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,580
and prosperous life.

366
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,780
Young Master.

367
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,660
Miss Shi asked if you could
visit the Zhuxuan Tavern

368
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,860
at Shili Village tomorrow.

369
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,060
Did you hear that?

370
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,220
The Shi family's daughter

371
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,660
is very open-hearted.

372
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,140
She's inviting

373
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,100
her future husband.

374
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,260
Good.

375
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:22,380
(Mansion of Duke Wu)

376
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,180
Mrs. Shi.

377
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,300
Mrs. Shi.

378
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:37,780
Mrs. Shi.

379
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,500
Minister Shi was kept

380
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,420
by Duke Wu for a chat.

381
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,620
You should return home.

382
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,260
Understood.

383
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:51,940
Xueji.

384
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,580
What are you doing?

385
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,020
Mother.

386
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,060
Where did they go?

387
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,540
They were here just now.

388
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,340
(Miss Shi asked)

389
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,260
(if you could go to the Zhuxuan Tavern tomorrow.)

390
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,420
I'll tell Minister Shi and take you

391
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,900
to Zhuxuan Tavern in Shili Village.

392
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,140
They have a famous green wine,

393
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,500
clear

394
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,620
and fragrant.

395
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,540
To avoid the wine.

396
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,140
My Lord.

397
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,220
It's not good.

398
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,660
The messenger disappeared.

399
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,620
Go to the Palace.

400
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,820
According to the ancestral law,

401
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:15,420
vassal lords cannot enter the capital
without a decree.

402
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:16,860
How can you?

403
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,260
How is this possible?

404
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,740
Can't be here without a decree?

405
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,740
If no one sees me,

406
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,100
there's no problem, right?

407
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,540
Who is it?

408
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:44,780
My Lord?

409
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,540
Minister Shi.

410
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,700
Since you got close to the Empress Dowager,

411
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,500
you no longer consider me important.

412
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,500
Now, meeting you

413
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,020
takes some effort.

414
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,220
You...

415
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,460
How did you get here?

416
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,820
What is this place?

417
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,780
The late Crown Prince's mansion.

418
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,620
How did you get into the capital?

419
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,780
Who would have thought

420
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,860
that this dilapidated
late Crown Prince's mansion

421
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,860
would hide a secret passage?

422
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,700
Liu Pei.

423
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,820
You...

424
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:48,900
You're going to...

425
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:54,100
It's us.

426
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,020
We?

427
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,060
Are you drunk?

428
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,540
Don't speak carelessly.

429
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:04,620
Minister Shi,

430
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,540
how can you be so distant

431
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,900
when we're in the same boat?

432
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:15,340
Your status will be incredibly high.

433
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,300
I'll still rely on you to support me.

434
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,620
What's the matter?

435
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,900
Didn't your son-in-law

436
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,380
tell you the truth?

437
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,420
Didn't he reveal his true identity?

438
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,300
He?

439
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,460
What is his identity?

440
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,510
Shh.

441
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:45,100
(Rooted and Prosperous)

442
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,500
Young Master.

443
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,100
How did you know?

444
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,300
Father has a strong tolerance for alcohol.

445
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:20,540
He wouldn't easily get drunk.

446
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,180
So you came to warn me,

447
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,260
even at the cost of your reputation.

448
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,060
I'm slow-witted.

449
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,300
I couldn't think of another way.

450
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,060
I could only give a roundabout warning.

451
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,060
Such indirect hints

452
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,580
are hard for ordinary people to understand.

453
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,580
You're no ordinary person.

454
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,420
I've thought about it.

455
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,220
Who from humble origins

456
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,540
has such demeanor

457
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,820
and knows the capital so well?

458
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,220
And which ordinary man

459
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,740
would be targeted by a noble

460
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,780
like Duke Wu?

461
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,060
Your identity

462
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,700
must be more extraordinary

463
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,100
than I thought.

464
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,140
I came to tell you

465
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,740
your father has returned.

466
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,380
He is safe now.

467
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:21,900
Go and see him.

468
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:41,940
Wrong.

469
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,060
I've made a wrong decision.

470
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:47,900
Father.

471
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,740
Do you know who he is?

472
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:59,100
The son of the late Crown Prince.

473
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,340
It's already past midnight.

474
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,140
How long will you keep wallowing, Father?

475
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,460
What do you understand?

476
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,820
What should I do now?

477
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,620
I only know

478
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,100
that there's no turning back.

479
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,260
If we abandon ourselves,

480
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,380
our family's fate will become

481
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,180
like meat on a chopping board

482
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,820
for anyone to cut.

483
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,460
Father.

484
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,020
We have no way out now.

485
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,100
We can only move forward.

486
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:42,700
Xueji.

487
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,260
You...

488
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,220
Are you still the Xueji

489
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,620
that I used to know?

490
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,340
From now on,

491
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,220
the safety of our family

492
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,620
will depend on you

493
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,780
and me.

494
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,260
He's dead?

495
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,220
Last night, Duke Wu and Commander Mo

496
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,300
drank half the night with me.

497
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,420
They were in high spirits.

498
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,820
Commander Mo suggested

499
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,380
a horse race.

500
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,820
Duke Wu agreed.

501
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,820
I couldn't stop them.

502
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,820
Unexpectedly,

503
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,980
Commander Mo fell into the river

504
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,460
and drowned.

505
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,420
Duke Wu

506
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,980
also injured his leg.

507
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,260
Tell me honestly.

508
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,060
Did you deceive me?

509
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,220
Well...

510
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,940
My brother

511
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,420
is the most competitive.

512
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,060
He must have proposed the race.

513
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:47,900
Right?

514
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,540
How perceptive of you.

515
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,900
Let him recuperate in the outskirts.

516
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,300
It will temper his arrogance.

517
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:00,940
Shi Yikuan.

518
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,660
I trust you the most now.

519
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,550
Do you have any candidates

520
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,450
for the Commander?

521
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,300
I think General Tong Wei,

522
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,540
the former commander of Dongyang Gate,

523
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:20,700
is loyal to His Majesty
and the Empress Dowager.

524
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,540
He can handle this important post.

525
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,700
I thought you would recommend

526
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,220
your old subordinates from Qingzhou.

527
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:32,020
The officers from Qingzhou

528
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,380
are from the countryside.

529
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,060
They are not familiar

530
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,260
with the arrangements inside
and outside the Palace

531
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:40,500
or the etiquette

532
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,780
and rules of the capital.

533
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,700
They are not suited for this post.

534
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,260
It's better to select the most loyal officer

535
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:50,060
from among the capital's officers.

536
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,220
How about

537
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,500
that Mount Yang bandit?

538
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,900
Though he's my

539
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,460
future son-in-law,

540
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,140
he comes from humble beginnings

541
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,260
and can't be trusted.

542
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,860
Let him go guard Zhangbei.

543
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,340
This way, you will have

544
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,300
one less worry.

545
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,620
Be careful.

546
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,620
Carry them inside.

547
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:17,620
Where is Zhen?

548
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,180
My son-in-law is almost here.

549
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,140
Go and find her!

550
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,500
Go and find her!

551
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,340
Yes.

552
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,460
Hurry!

553
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,300
My Lord.

554
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:30,980
Mr. He.

555
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,020
Are you satisfied

556
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,020
with the gifts?

557
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,180
Your sincerity

558
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,540
is greatly appreciated.

559
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:38,820
No need for formalities.

560
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,540
From now on,

561
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,780
we're family.

562
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,180
The gifts are here.

563
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,380
I'll be leaving now.

564
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,260
You're leaving so soon?

565
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,620
Zhen hasn't come out yet.

566
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,460
Yes.

567
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,820
My daughter is rarely so shy.

568
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,180
She's missing.

569
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,300
What's missing?

570
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,260
Miss He is missing.

571
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,300
Zhen is missing.

572
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,740
What's this fuss about?

573
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,040
(To Father: If a woman's life
is like a puppet,)

574
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,060
(she might as well leave and make her own way.)

575
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:19,500
(Your daughter)

576
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,180
Father, Father.

577
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,020
- Mr. He.
- Master.

578
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,740
Help him inside to rest.

579
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,260
My Lord, sorry.

580
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,100
Go.

581
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:28,820
Be careful.

582
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,820
(If a woman's life is like a puppet,)

583
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:42,380
(she might as well leave.)

584
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,740
Boss, take a look at the new base.

585
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,820
How is it?

586
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:00,830
See if it's acceptable.

587
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,180
Don't move.

588
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,860
Sir, be careful.

589
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:06,860
Don't injure our boss.

590
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:07,820
Everyone, squat down.

591
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:10,860
Squat down.

592
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,620
- Squat down.
- Help!

593
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:13,530
- Quickly.
- Help!

594
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,740
Be careful.

595
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:17,860
Don't move.

596
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,860
Help!

597
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,020
Boss!

598
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,420
Madam!

599
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,300
Madam?

600
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,420
She's a Mrs. Lu.

601
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,940
So, she'll come with me.

602
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:31,980
Step aside.

603
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,100
Madam!

604
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,620
Go!

605
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,300
Let's go.

606
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,260
They might catch up.

607
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,500
We need to finish quickly.

608
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:44,660
(Zhenzhou)

609
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:52,940
My Lord.

610
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,700
In the capital's outskirts,

611
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,020
without my order,

612
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,260
you are to stay put.

613
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,340
Also,

614
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,060
keep an eye on her.

615
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,180
Don't let her leave Zhenzhou.

616
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,020
My Lord.

617
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,620
Something happened.

618
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,100
Liu was taken by bandits.

619
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,340
Where?

620
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,620
The man claims to be Lu Wen.

621
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,780
Fan Hu is in pursuit.

622
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,460
The direction is possibly Mount Yang.

623
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:17,900
Go.

624
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,420
The clay from the kiln.

625
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,180
This is a mark left by Ms. Liu.

626
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,220
My Lord, just in case,

627
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,620
I'll send men to scout ahead.

628
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,700
- How's it?
- It worked.

629
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:01,620
Everything is ready.

630
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,500
We'll go through the west cave.

631
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,780
You all wait outside.

632
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,860
Sister, beware of that vicious woman.

633
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:18,740
Lu Zhong?

634
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:21,820
Lu Zhong?

635
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,100
Ms. Liu.

636
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,700
Long time no see.

637
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,540
Sun Yun'er?

638
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:34,460
You really remember me?

639
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,740
When did you get your memory?

640
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:49,980
Sending messages under the watch
of Lord Huaiyang.

641
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,820
Good for you.

642
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,540
It's a pity

643
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:56,620
that you are no longer the Lu Wen of the past.

644
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,460
Your former subordinates

645
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,820
have also left Mount Yang.

646
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,860
Who gave you the guts to harm me?

647
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:07,980
Harm you?

648
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,540
You misunderstand.

649
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,460
I'm here to save you.

650
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,460
When I lost my memory,

651
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,620
you made things so difficult for me.

652
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,540
Do you think I would trust you?

653
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,780
After the Shangsi battle,

654
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,940
the young master was injured.

655
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,060
You suddenly disappeared

656
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,340
and then appeared beside Lord Huaiyang.

657
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,460
How am I to view you?

658
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,820
And how should I treat you?

659
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,580
If not for my various probes,

660
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,500
how would I know that you lost your memory

661
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,580
and are being controlled?

662
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,100
Miantang,

663
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,100
you should be grateful to me.

664
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,460
I persuaded the young master

665
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,380
not to misunderstand you.

666
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,180
Ziyu, he...

667
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,580
You were so heartless in Qingzhou.

668
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:05,460
The young master

669
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:06,980
was deeply hurt.

670
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,140
At that time, I remembered nothing.

671
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,780
Where is Ziyu? I want to find him.

672
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,140
Don't worry, Miantang.

673
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:15,300
The young master sent me to fetch you.

674
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,260
He's already in the capital.

675
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,220
Leave some men here to guard.

676
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,620
The rest, come with me.

677
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:26,740
Yes.

678
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,140
I know

679
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,420
that there are

680
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,620
some misunderstandings between us,

681
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,140
but we are both from Mount Yang

682
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,620
and working for the young master.

683
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,740
If you don't trust me,

684
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:54,340
would you rather trust Lord Huaiyang?

685
00:42:58,980 --> 00:42:59,820
Alright.

686
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:01,300
I'll go with you.

687
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:08,980
By the way,

688
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:11,820
I have another task from Mr. Ziyu.

689
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:13,380
Everything in the capital

690
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:14,620
needs money.

691
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:17,380
Since you've recovered your memory,

692
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:19,820
do you still remember

693
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:21,260
where the 30,0000 taels of silver

694
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:22,260
are hidden?

695
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:24,700
It

696
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:27,060
should be in this cave.

697
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:32,260
So,

698
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:35,180
Ziyu didn't send you here at all.

699
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:37,720
You're here to find that money.
