14
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,910
Oh, no.

15
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:54,940
Something's wrong.

16
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,690
Mrs. Zhao.

17
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,800
Mrs. Zhao, what's wrong?

18
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,970
There's a fierce battle today.

19
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,100
When the patrol squad

20
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,780
returned from scouting the enemy,

21
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,780
they were ambushed by Tribe One.

22
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,190
After getting the news,

23
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,570
the Lord led a team to rescue them,

24
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,660
but several men were still injured or killed.

25
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,100
The patrol squad?

26
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:18,940
Did anything happen to Wen?

27
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,970
Mrs. Zhao.

28
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,460
Please come out.

29
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,800
Coming.

30
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,660
I'm Lord Huaiyang's

31
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,010
patrol guard.

32
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,180
We are a confidential unit

33
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,290
responsible for intelligence gathering.

34
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,700
Are you hurt?

35
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,850
Where are you injured?

36
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,110
I'm fine.

37
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,460
Everything will be okay.

38
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,170
I'll make sure to bring you home safely.

39
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,100
A royal decree has arrived!

40
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,140
A royal decree has arrived!

41
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,930
Cui Xingzhou.

42
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,660
Urgent message from afar.

43
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,020
What's the court's decree?

44
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,730
They ordered me not to fear

45
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:17,990
and to attack

46
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:19,340
within ten days.

47
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,340
Isn't this forcing you to die?

48
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,280
Defending

49
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:26,490
is possible,

50
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,970
but to fight now would

51
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,660
mean almost certain defeat.

52
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,730
I know we can't gamble the entire Zhenzhou

53
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,260
on a slim chance of victory.

54
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,140
But we can't keep stalling either.

55
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,520
But if they didn't attack,

56
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,140
you have no opportunity to exploit.

57
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:53,100
(Relatives' Village, Xizhou,
Feitang Valley, Jinjia Pass)

58
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,260
(Western Tribes)

59
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,850
There's a battle opportunity.

60
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,050
What opportunity?

61
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,520
You.

62
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:05,960
Me?

63
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,140
The grain just arrived.

64
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,460
If I strike immediately,

65
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,020
what would A Gushan think?

66
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,140
He would naturally think

67
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,530
that you couldn't hold back.

68
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,820
Our army is well-stocked,

69
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,930
strong and well-equipped.

70
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,590
Since he's good at using troops,

71
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,730
if I use the provisions as bait

72
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,850
and find a narrow and enclosed terrain

73
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,760
to launch a proactive flanking attack,

74
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,600
the chance of victory

75
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,850
could increase by at least

76
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,400
thirty percent,

77
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,530
To a tie.

78
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,960
Barbarian.

79
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,020
Come here.

80
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,230
What did you do to my goats?

81
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,460
What did you do to them?

82
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,260
They were fine.

83
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,530
Why are they like this?

84
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,200
They can't even stand up.

85
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,680
For these few thin-legged goats,

86
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,170
I could kick them to death.

87
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,460
I don't have time to poison them.

88
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,370
My goats had always been fine

89
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:11,970
until you came.

90
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:13,900
If it's not you, then who?

91
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,150
Let go of me.

92
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,830
You owe me for the goats.

93
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,930
She didn't poison them.

94
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,340
Look at what's in the bucket.

95
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,580
It's just some grassroots.

96
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,260
It fell in when I fetched water.

97
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,970
This is ghost root.

98
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,270
I heard from the locals

99
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,580
when I was collecting medicine.

100
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:39,440
Ghost root

101
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,320
grows in dark and damp places.

102
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,370
Its roots are medicinal.

103
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,440
It can cause numbness, weakness, and fatigue

104
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,340
after soaking in water.

105
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,120
The goats might eat hay

106
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,320
soaked in ghost root water,

107
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,970
which caused it to become like this.

108
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:12,750
That's it.

109
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,170
Finally found it.

110
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,610
Same with the ones in the bucket.

111
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,700
Nanny Li, this is ghost root.

112
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,870
Go over there and see

113
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:36,850
if there's more.

114
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,880
I'll check now.

115
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:24,950
Honey.

116
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,770
How are you feeling now?

117
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,070
It's alright.

118
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,540
When you were unconscious,

119
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,610
you occasionally cried out in pain.

120
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,490
Is there any discomfort?

121
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,300
I had a very frightening dream.

122
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,100
I dreamed of being taken
into the deep mountains.

123
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,220
I struggled desperately

124
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,460
but my tendons were still cut,

125
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,540
and I was thrown off a waterfall.

126
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,060
What else did you dream about?

127
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,760
The villain

128
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,420
had his face covered,

129
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,220
so I couldn't see his face.

130
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,580
Forget it.

131
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,420
In the coming days,

132
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:34,300
let's focus on getting better.

133
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,610
Drink your medicine first.

134
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:41,950
Miss.

135
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,200
The pork knuckle

136
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,460
is a specialty of my restaurant,

137
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,770
but it's a bit unsightly to eat.

138
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:50,040
Cockles are more suitable for ladies.

139
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,730
Would you like to try it?

140
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,650
Cockles are indeed elegant.

141
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,300
I'll have the pork knuckle.

142
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,160
Alright.

143
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,590
Miss.

144
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,940
Let's first go buy some jewelry.

145
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,370
If the madam finds out...

146
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,650
It's just a meal.

147
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,100
No need to feel guilty.

148
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:14,890
Miss Shi.

149
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,460
Mr. Ziyu.

150
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,850
Miss Shi and I seem to be fated.

151
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,580
Miss Shi.

152
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,850
Are you out alone?

153
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,320
My mother allowed me to look at some jewelry.

154
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,510
Hearing this place is good,

155
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,820
I came in to have a seat.

156
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:40,100
The cockles here are indeed excellent.

157
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,490
Which table ordered the pork knuckle?

158
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,060
Sir, was it you?

159
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,120
No, no.

160
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,400
I'm having some light tea and meals.

161
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,850
I won't keep you any longer.

162
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,490
Where are you sending it?

163
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,340
It was this lady who ordered it.

164
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,320
This lady is clearly

165
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,250
a foodie who appreciates fine food.

166
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,960
She didn't even look

167
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,180
at other dishes

168
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,700
and only had eyes for the pork knuckle.

169
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,650
Please enjoy.

170
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,180
I've heard

171
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,630
that the pork knuckle here

172
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,370
is seared over a flame to lock in the flavor

173
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:32,370
and soaked in boiling water.

174
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,800
After being cooked, it's left
to rest for a day and night

175
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,130
before being served.

176
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,200
The meat must be tender on the inside

177
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,390
and crispy on the outside.

178
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,650
- You all go out.
- Alright.

179
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,120
Yes.

180
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,540
You're a foodie,

181
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,340
but you're not so lucky.

182
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,940
But don't worry.

183
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,160
With me here,

184
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,130
even if General Shi were here,

185
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,540
he wouldn't say anything.

186
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,220
Miss Shi,

187
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,130
please feel free to eat.

188
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,970
Enjoy.

189
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:38,890
Mr. Ziyu.

190
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,700
I used to eat meat

191
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:47,160
and drink wine heartily

192
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,100
at Mount Yang.

193
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,610
I might've startled you.

194
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,040
Is it delicious?

195
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,540
Thank you for accommodating me

196
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,220
as a rude man.

197
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,730
You are quite considerate.

198
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:16,920
I heard from my father

199
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,350
that you've read many books

200
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,060
and are skilled at Go.

201
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,850
My birth mother passed away early.

202
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,940
No one ever taught me the Eight Arts.

203
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,630
I wonder

204
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,610
if you would be willing to teach me Go.

205
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,010
On the Go board, these nine points

206
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,180
are called stars.

207
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,400
The center point is called

208
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,710
the Tianyuan.

209
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,340
I'll start by occupying the Tianyuan.

210
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,060
As a beginner, you should

211
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,460
start by occupying the corners, then the sides,

212
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,250
so as not to be caught off guard.

213
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,200
If you start with Tianyuan,

214
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,250
you'll have a weak start,

215
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,820
vulnerable to later control.

216
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,320
It's like giving

217
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,940
the first move to your opponent.

218
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,420
The moves represent the player.

219
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,010
The person teaching you Go

220
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,870
is showing you

221
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,700
their temperament completely.

222
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,340
Please cherish it.

223
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,490
If I win your game,

224
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,400
doesn't that mean

225
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,460
I surpass you in character?

226
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:23,710
Sorry.

227
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,730
I only know how to play Go,

228
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,650
not to teach it.

229
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,180
Sorry for asking this.

230
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,060
Come on. Careful.

231
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,310
Honey.

232
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,060
Why are you out of bed?

233
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,440
I've been lying down enough.

234
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,420
I wanted to come out and stretch my legs.

235
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:55,540
What delicious food did you bring me?

236
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,820
Wild fruits from the mountains.

237
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,280
It's chilly here.

238
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,100
Nanny Li, warm them up.

239
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,770
- Yes.
- Please sit down.

240
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,210
There's military duty,

241
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,370
so I can't stay for too long.

242
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:10,400
You've been commuting because of me.

243
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,210
At least sit, have some hot tea,

244
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,580
and rest for a while.

245
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:16,870
Honey,

246
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,820
the medicine shop has been lively these days.

247
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,030
First, Ms. Lin came,

248
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,470
then Mrs. Wang.

249
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,310
Do you know?

250
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,020
Mrs. Wang's goat

251
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,070
suddenly collapsed

252
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,020
and couldn't get up.

253
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,130
When I went to check, I found

254
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,210
ghost roots soaked in her bucket.

255
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:32,780
Ghost roots? And then?

256
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,920
Ghost root is a local term

257
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,210
not commonly seen elsewhere.

258
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,840
Though ghost root

259
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,780
looks unremarkable,

260
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,060
if it's soaked in hay feed,

261
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,340
its effect is very strong.

262
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:47,210
It's a pity for those few goats.

263
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,510
They probably

264
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,690
haven't recovered yet.

265
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,070
Honey.

266
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,980
If ghost roots

267
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,780
can make goats collapse,

268
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,260
what about war horses?

269
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,580
What do you mean, dear?

270
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,890
The western tribes use cavalry.

271
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,650
What I mean is

272
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,960
if there's a way

273
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,820
to make their war horses eat feed

274
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,070
soaked with the medicine,

275
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:18,930
they'd become weak,

276
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,130
which would greatly reduce their combat power.

277
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,610
That's a good idea.

278
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:28,890
But how do we deliver

279
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,340
the feed?

280
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,440
We can collect

281
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,210
ghost root roots, soak them in water,

282
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,710
mix them with hay,

283
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:37,650
and dry them.

284
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,340
This way, it will be undetectable.

285
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,930
If they let the horses taste it,

286
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,960
the horses

287
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,300
are much larger than goats.

288
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,060
The effects won't show immediately.

289
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,170
As for how to get it to the enemy...

290
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,450
If you come up with this strategy,

291
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,030
the brave and smart Lord Huaiyang

292
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:58,020
will figure out how to proceed.

293
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,300
I'll report it to the Lord.

294
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,030
But finding

295
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,610
so many ghost roots at once

296
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,370
is not an easy task.

297
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,470
Don't worry.

298
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,780
Nanny Li has already searched.

299
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,070
The ghost root nearby

300
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,130
must be enough.

301
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,210
You're very thoughtful, dear.

302
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,850
Cui Xingzhou.

303
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:30,870
How about

304
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,500
I lead the team as bait?

305
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,930
You're the commander.

306
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,110
We can't risk your life.

307
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,210
It's also important for you
to pretend to be me.

308
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:41,980
They need to think

309
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,610
I'm looking for their main force
for a decisive battle.

310
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,400
But what if

311
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,260
you're surrounded?

312
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,120
Then it means

313
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,650
our strategy has worked.

314
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,980
Even if I die, it's worth it.

315
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,450
No.

316
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,450
You can't die.

317
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,370
Besides,

318
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,150
you need

319
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,100
to personally explain this to Liu Miantang.

320
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,850
I won't handle the mess for you.

321
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,370
Hit him!

322
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:20,550
Hit him!

323
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,060
Hit him! Hit him!

324
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,440
Wolf Lord, the enemy is attacking,

325
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,840
but the rear supply troops

326
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,020
seem to have lost their way.

327
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:38,300
Heaven is aiding us!

328
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,060
Heaven is aiding us!

329
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:47,020
Heaven is aiding us!

330
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:14,580
Stop!

331
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:16,170
Stop!

332
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,930
Soldiers,

333
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,850
prepare for battle!

334
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:30,300
Charge!

335
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,740
The final battle is tonight.

336
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,720
The families of soldiers will

337
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,540
pray all night for their safety.

338
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:10,630
Madam.

339
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,610
Aren't we going?

340
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,300
Prayers are useless.

341
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,170
Man can conquer nature.

342
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,170
Mrs. Cui,

343
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:30,030
go quickly check on my madam.

344
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,060
She's in labor.

345
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,800
Siyue.

346
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:37,910
Come on. Deep breath.

347
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,510
Nanny Li, go up the mountain

348
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,350
and bring some women

349
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,300
who have given birth.

350
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,310
You go get three buckets of water.

351
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,150
Sure.

352
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,170
Hold on, hold on.

353
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,370
It'll be over soon.

354
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,060
Withdraw!

355
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,680
Drop!

356
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,920
- Hold on, hold on.
- How's it going?

357
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,400
Push, push.

358
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,280
- How's it?
- Push.

359
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:15,840
- How's it?
- It won't come out.

360
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,880
- Push.
- Deep breath.

361
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,170
I can't do it anymore.

362
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,260
Cut open my belly.

363
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:22,930
No, no.

364
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:25,410
Madam, you must hold on.

365
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,170
Don't give up.

366
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,980
Madam, you can speak their language?

367
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,510
Hold on, it's alright.

368
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,300
We will ensure the safety of both of you.

369
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:35,310
Nanny Li.

370
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,500
Fetch the book and silver needles.

371
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,060
- Mrs. Zhao.
- Hold on.

372
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,310
- Get some mugwort.
- Hold on.

373
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,180
Push.

374
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:43,610
Hold on, Siyue.

375
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,160
Check if these grains are poisoned.

376
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,000
Yes.

377
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:08,300
Breathe in through your nose.
Exhale through your mouth.

378
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,310
Quickly.

379
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,820
Deep breath.

380
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,960
- Go to the cabinet.
- Deep breath.

381
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,820
Let her hold thin ginseng in her mouth.

382
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:15,960
Alright.

383
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,690
- Quickly. Almost done.
- Madam.

384
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,840
Deep breath, deep breath, Ms. Lin.

385
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,450
Push. You can do it. It's alright.

386
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,500
It's moving. It seems to be moving.

387
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,480
It's working.

388
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,230
They'll be safe this way.

389
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,500
Ms. Lin, put in more effort.

390
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:01,120
Soldiers,

391
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,370
support the commander.

392
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:07,150
Charge!

393
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:19,410
My Lord, the ghost root is taking effect.

394
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,740
All soldiers.

395
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:22,960
Yes.

396
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,400
Follow me to fight the enemy!

397
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,240
Yes.

398
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:35,980
The horses are poisoned.

399
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,450
Charge with me.

400
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,690
I heard you were looking for me.

401
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,980
Cui Xingzhou.

402
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,540
- It's alright now.
- Congratulations. You're both safe.

403
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,040
Good.

404
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,370
So cute.

405
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,920
- This is for you.
- We won the battle!

406
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,160
We won the battle!

407
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,200
We won!

408
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,310
We won the battle!

409
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,410
We won!

410
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,260
We won the battle!

411
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:48,920
Go tell everyone.

412
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,170
We won the battle!

413
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,450
We won the battle!

414
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:35,130
Physician Zhao, how is my husband?

415
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,690
He's just

416
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:41,210
overexerted himself,

417
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,780
and some old injuries have flared up.

418
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,260
So he fainted.

419
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,440
With some high-quality tonics

420
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,260
and a period of rest, he'll be fine.

421
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:55,100
(Shi Mansion)

422
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,370
Congratulations, General.

423
00:30:57,510 --> 00:31:00,260
You should now be addressed as Minister Shi.

424
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,440
I should've hoped

425
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,340
for continuous promotion in the capital.

426
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,750
But you're already the top military general.

427
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,850
There's no higher position,

428
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,130
making it hard for me to wish more.

429
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,650
It's not about promotions and rewards.

430
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,370
It's about being loyal to the Emperor.

431
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:22,260
I was short-sighted.

432
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,820
Miss Shi.

433
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,540
Father.

434
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:36,170
Mr. Ziyu.

435
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,740
This is...?

436
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,980
Ms. Sun.

437
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:44,340
She is the daughter
of Ziyu's former subordinate

438
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,640
and has been

439
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,210
following him for years.

440
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,060
As expected of the Minister's daughter,

441
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,540
you're truly gentle

442
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,690
and graceful.

443
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,280
Ziyu,

444
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:05,890
this trip

445
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:08,580
isn't just about the promotions and reports.

446
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:11,450
The Empress Dowager wants to see you.

447
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,710
Rest assured. It's just to set an example

448
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:15,930
of the submission.

449
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:19,300
The Empress Dowager
will also take care of Mount Yang.

450
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,370
However,

451
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,580
to win the favor of the Emperor,

452
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,370
you still need

453
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,370
to be cautious in every way.

454
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,650
Prepare well.

455
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,340
Thank you for your concern.

456
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,990
I've prepared

457
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:34,500
jade from the North Sea.

458
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,650
You'll set off tomorrow.

459
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,450
Rest early.

460
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,820
I'll take my leave.

461
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,760
Alright.

462
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,110
Xueji.

463
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,040
Come here.

464
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,890
Do you know why I called you?

465
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,610
Mr. Ziyu still needs to be cautious
in every way,

466
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,690
let alone your daughter.

467
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,710
I represent

468
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,450
your reputation in every action.

469
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,610
You're his future wife.

470
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,160
You must not neglect Mr. Ziyu

471
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,370
and Ms. Sun.

472
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,230
He's a man.

473
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:40,450
It's common for him to have concubines.

474
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,520
Moreover,

475
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:43,740
they have had many years of affection.

476
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:47,470
Anyway, it'll not affect

477
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:49,020
your position.

478
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,930
You're right.

479
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,610
Ms. Sun, what I can do for you?

480
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,250
I have a request.

481
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,460
Young Master will leave tomorrow,

482
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,800
but I have many matters here.

483
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,210
I'm truly unable to leave.

484
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,150
After much consideration,

485
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,860
I have to trouble you

486
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:20,770
to accompany him to the capital.

487
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:22,760
I wonder if you're willing

488
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,250
to help me share the burden.

489
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,460
This is what I should do.

490
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,130
Young Master's diet and daily routines

491
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,420
must be carefully attended to.

492
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:35,810
He was injured as a child,

493
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,650
making him more susceptible to cold.

494
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,190
Even in summer,

495
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,690
he should not wear too little.

496
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:42,540
When the dog days come,

497
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:44,130
Young Master's appetite will decline.

498
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,280
He'll need

499
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,900
dried fruits from Zhenzhou

500
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,610
and Yuqian Longjing tea.

501
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,650
This was originally my responsibility.

502
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,580
I truly feel sorry

503
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,540
to trouble you.

504
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,880
Once I finish my current matters,

505
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,380
I will join you.

506
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,290
At that time...

507
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,280
You've shared glory and hardship

508
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,650
with Mr. Ziyu for many years.

509
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,500
I believe

510
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:10,690
that such affection

511
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,650
cannot be altered by any external factors.

512
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,290
Since you're so perceptive,

513
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,730
there's no need for me to say more.

514
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:36,940
(Jinchen Tea)

515
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:44,980
Before marriage,

516
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,730
why is Mr. Ziyu...

517
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,190
I was always happy

518
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,380
for you.

519
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,460
Don't say more.

520
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,290
Ms. Sun is an old acquaintance.

521
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,290
Now the General is giving her face.

522
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:56,980
What can our lady do?

523
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,860
I'm allowed to be angry, aren't I?

524
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,540
She's so proud,

525
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:01,650
just because she thinks

526
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,800
she is cherished

527
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,380
by Mr. Ziyu.

528
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,610
If that were truly the case,

529
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,900
she wouldn't have rushed to flaunt it to me.

530
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,320
In the past, Sixth Sister

531
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,590
always liked to flaunt

532
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,130
how she was favored by Father.

533
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,030
But Fourth Sister, the legitimate daughter,

534
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,060
despised such comparisons.

535
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,130
But look.

536
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:26,630
Who ended up being treated

537
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:27,630
as a pawn

538
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:28,650
and married off casually?

539
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:31,960
It's evident

540
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,770
that what a person often speaks of

541
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,940
might not be what they already possess.

542
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:38,900
It could also be what they lack most

543
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,980
and fear losing.

544
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:44,730
Do you mean

545
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,170
Mr. Ziyu

546
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,730
doesn't like Ms. Sun?

547
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,290
I don't know,

548
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,000
but it's probably not as good

549
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,860
as Ms. Sun claims.

550
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,100
So,

551
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:59,580
you still have a chance

552
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,980
to beat her?

553
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,110
In this world,

554
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,280
a woman can only live

555
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,580
by relying on others.

556
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,380
What's the point

557
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:11,020
of winning that?

558
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,210
But Mr. Ziyu clearly treats you very kindly.

559
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,690
It means he values you.

560
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,640
Kindness

561
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,130
doesn't mean affection.

562
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:23,760
He's kind

563
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,330
because his nature is as gentle as jade.

564
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,770
It's also because Miss Sun and I

565
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,420
are useful.

566
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,030
If Mr. Ziyu likes Ms. Sun,

567
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,730
why would he want to marry me?

568
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,330
If Mr. Ziyu likes me,

569
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:50,380
why would he let you

570
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,150
wrinkle your brow

571
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,420
like old ladies?

572
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,690
How can you still be in the mood

573
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,420
to joke around at a time like this?

574
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,440
Yes, and even find time

575
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,380
to eat here.

576
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,940
Why not?

577
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:10,400
I have never had any other

578
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,860
expectations of Mr. Ziyu.

579
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,510
Now I've managed to escape

580
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:16,400
the fate of marrying Lord Anle,

581
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,810
I'm actually quite pleased.

582
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,500
Why add more distress to myself

583
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,690
by being hungry?

584
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,540
What did I say before?

585
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,190
The wedding date is still early.

586
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:27,500
Many changes can happen.

587
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,250
You just didn't believe it.

588
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,810
This place is better.

589
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,380
It's cold and damp here all year round.

590
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,460
I'm afraid that Miantang's hand injury

591
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,610
will be hard to endure.

592
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:50,100
Don't worry.

593
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,610
I've checked for you.

594
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:54,290
She's had the medicine patch on for so long

595
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:55,980
that her hand injury has healed a lot.

596
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,210
Will it fully recover?

597
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,030
It's a torn tendon,

598
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:02,250
not just a scrape.

599
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:04,290
It's not that easy to fully recover.

600
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,250
Unless

601
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:08,760
we can find the rare

602
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,100
eagle flower for medicine.

603
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:13,710
Then go find it.

604
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,060
Tell me how much money you need.

605
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,580
Fine, I'll help you find it.

606
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,920
For now, there's another method that can be

607
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,170
used as a substitute.

608
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,160
What method?

609
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,330
I've found

610
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:29,060
a hot spring nearby.

611
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,590
Using it for the tendon

612
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:32,670
and blood

613
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:33,650
is the best remedy.

614
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:44,210
Here we are.

615
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,030
I didn't expect there to be

616
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:52,460
a good hot spring in the northwest.

617
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,960
The Lord instructed us

618
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,810
to survey nearby.

619
00:39:55,150 --> 00:39:56,190
When we found this spring,

620
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,330
he rewarded us with it,

621
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,020
allowing soldiers with merits to use it.

622
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:01,760
Dear,

623
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,420
you can go to the small tent

624
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,540
and change your clothes.

625
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:07,690
This place is wonderful.

626
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,510
The Lord does care for his subordinates.

627
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:10,900
He even prepared a small tent.

628
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,980
- I'll go change then.
- Go ahead.

629
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,200
Moru,

630
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:21,900
prepare the blanket

631
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,330
and wait at the bottom.

632
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,080
Yes.

633
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,860
Dear, don't just stand there.

634
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,980
It's windy. Take care not to catch a cold.

635
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,330
Hurry and get in.

636
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:24,860
The hot spring water is so warm.

637
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,170
It will help with the tendon and blood.

638
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,630
Honey, come down quickly.

639
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:29,470
Alright.

640
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,610
What's the matter?

641
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,960
This hot spring

642
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,130
was set up by the Lord for the soldiers.

643
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:45,290
I was only able to get this opportunity for you

644
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:47,730
because the general showed mercy.

645
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,900
The other military families did not come.

646
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:52,980
If I were to join you in the bath,

647
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:54,650
the comrades

648
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:55,830
would laugh at me.

649
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,420
You may get cold leaving the water.

650
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:00,900
I've prepared a hot drink for you.

651
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,580
I thought of that too,

652
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,330
so I also brought some medicinal wine.

653
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,280
Don't come up.

654
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:09,380
You might catch a cold like this.

655
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:10,650
Where is it? I'll get it.

656
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:11,860
It's in the basket.

657
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:19,060
The medicinal wine is effective
against the cold.

658
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:21,440
I didn't know

659
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,650
you could make medicinal wine.

660
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,150
Can it be drunk?

661
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:28,250
Of course.

662
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:29,920
I got this nourishing recipe

663
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,330
from Physician Zhao.

664
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:32,760
I searched the shop to gather

665
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,630
all the ingredients.

666
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:35,290
It's been soaking for a whole night.

667
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,400
It's perfect for you

668
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,580
since you have an injury.

669
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:44,990
It's bitter.

670
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:46,390
Really?

671
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:48,610
Then next time I'll add some rock candy.

672
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:49,990
It's alright.

673
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:51,420
I can drink

674
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,770
