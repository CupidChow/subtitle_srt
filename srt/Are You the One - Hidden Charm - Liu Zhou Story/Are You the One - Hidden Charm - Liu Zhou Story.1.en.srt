16
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,320
Move. The carriage is coming.

17
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,090
Little trinkets.

18
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,540
You two stay here, okay?

19
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,760
- Don't run off.
- Okay.

20
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,340
Today's vegetables

21
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,260
are not good at all.

22
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,860
Not fresh anymore.

23
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,460
The good ones have...

24
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,850
New people are arriving.

25
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,780
How rare to see newcomers here.

26
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,780
Madam, slow down.

27
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,500
Goodness.

28
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,300
Here comes trouble.

29
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,620
What does this family's gentleman do

30
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,300
to have the ability to marry such a beauty?

31
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,780
I heard

32
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,300
he's an outsider who sells porcelain.

33
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,180
They just moved here.

34
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,220
If he goes out to trade,

35
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,700
leaving such a beauty alone at home,

36
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,100
(Cui Mansion)

37
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,540
it won't last long.

38
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,740
Exactly.

39
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,760
You dropped something.

40
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,760
Thank you.

41
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,140
Thank you.

42
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,640
Madam.

43
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,460
It's all your fault for being so loud.

44
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,300
It's just you.

45
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,100
Madam.

46
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,320
Do not engage with those gossiping women.

47
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,280
If you talk more,

48
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,940
they might pry out all

49
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,040
the master's secrets.

50
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,720
You're overthinking it.

51
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,560
I already don't remember much.

52
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,100
Because of that,

53
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,960
you need more peace and quiet.

54
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,360
Physician Zhao said

55
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,540
you have a cranial blockage,

56
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,520
causing your memory loss.

57
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,280
What a sin.

58
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,660
Three years of loving marriage.

59
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,320
You only remember

60
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,760
the day you got married.

61
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,420
This gentleman named Cui Jiu

62
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,180
is wealthy,

63
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,500
and I heard

64
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,500
he's a gentle, elegant,

65
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,940
and handsome

66
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,280
young man.

67
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,300
The master gave up half

68
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,840
of his family fortune

69
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,940
to save you

70
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:01,800
from death.

71
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,040
He even sold his business in the capital

72
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,440
to come to this small Lingquan Town,

73
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,800
saying he wanted to start anew.

74
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,620
It was just to find a perfect place

75
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,880
for your peace and quiet.

76
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,360
All of this

77
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,440
is for you, Madam.

78
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,800
You must never

79
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,320
let him down in the future.

80
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,840
- Greetings.
- Greetings.

81
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,220
I'm Fangxie.

82
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,440
She's my younger sister Bicao.

83
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,980
We're both from this town

84
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,760
and will serve the madam diligently.

85
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,740
I heard Madam was injured before.

86
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,940
How did you get hurt?

87
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,440
Where are your manners?

88
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,640
How can you ask

89
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,000
upon meeting Madam?

90
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,140
Are my husband's things here?

91
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,040
Yes, they're all here.

92
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,220
Then why do I only see my clothes,

93
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,060
not his?

94
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,240
Doesn't he live here?

95
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,820
Aren't you

96
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,160
overthinking?

97
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,540
Yes.

98
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,820
It's natural to have doubts

99
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,140
since you don't

100
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,480
see the master often,

101
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,960
but since you've married here,

102
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,040
you must follow our rules.

103
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,460
A woman's words

104
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,360
should not be sharp.

105
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,180
Speak less, act more. Quiet and chaste.

106
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,740
This is how you should...

107
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:25,940
I understand.

108
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,040
I wish to rest for a while.

109
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,500
Nanny Li,

110
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,120
please take this painting to the study.

111
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,340
Yes.

112
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,340
My wrists were injured before.

113
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,440
My husband felt sorry

114
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,480
for me, but I'm much better now.

115
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,920
Nanny Li, just do your job.

116
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,590
Yes.

117
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,480
Madam, you rest first.

118
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,920
I'll go prepare some food.

119
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,740
By the way,

120
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,020
the master

121
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,240
will return tonight.

122
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,600
(Cui Jiu.)

123
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,600
Cui Jiu.

124
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,000
Why are you so late?

125
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,360
How is she?

126
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,400
Her tendons are reconnected,

127
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,920
but the damage is severe.

128
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,640
It's hard for her to fully recover.

129
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,640
She has blood clots in her brain.

130
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,880
She seems awake,

131
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,760
but is in a daze,

132
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,160
half-conscious.

133
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,520
Use whatever means necessary

134
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,320
to cure her.

135
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,340
I'll do my best.

136
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,160
Honey.

137
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,320
What did you call me?

138
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,320
Honey.

139
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,340
Dear.

140
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,840
As expected,

141
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,800
Lu Wen has mobilized half of Mount Yang

142
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,640
to search for Liu Miantang.

143
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,560
He really took the bait.

144
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,240
Everyone in Mount Yang knows

145
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,020
Liu Miantang

146
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,680
is Lu Wen's beloved concubine.

147
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,660
Since she went missing

148
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,920
at the water dock nearby,

149
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,060
Lu Wen

150
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,800
will surely take notice.

151
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,820
Six months ago,

152
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,100
I crippled Lu Wen's foundation,

153
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,320
forcing him to lay low.

154
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,700
But after dealing with him for three years,

155
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,560
I know well

156
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,020
that Lu Wen

157
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,380
is a bandit leader,

158
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,580
but he's a man of pride

159
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,920
and loyalty.

160
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,100
Using Liu Miantang

161
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,420
as the right bait,

162
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,260
he will

163
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,120
definitely show up.

164
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,100
We've been battling for three years.

165
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,460
It's a life-and-death struggle.

166
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,240
He is indeed

167
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,200
a rare formidable enemy.

168
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,920
But for the peace of Zhenzhou,

169
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:51,720
I must clear Mount Yang of bandits,
so the officials criticizing my garrisoning

170
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,600
have no grounds to speak.

171
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,360
It's a pity for Liu Miantang though,

172
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,120
calling you honey.

173
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,160
You're actually her enemy.

174
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,480
Even her crucial dowry is a deception,

175
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,280
a cover-up

176
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,160
by her caring husband.

177
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,800
Shouldn't you reflect on this?

178
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,460
If you hadn't called me Cui Jiu,

179
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,960
would I be in this situation?

180
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,840
Your surname is Cui,

181
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,240
and you rank ninth.

182
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,520
Should I call you Zhang San?

183
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,200
Come on.

184
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,720
But isn't it a coincidence

185
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,780
her memory cut off

186
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:41,200
just before going to Mount Yang?

187
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,460
She only remembers

188
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,040
marrying Cui Jiu from the capital.

189
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,440
It's even stranger than fiction.

190
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,880
Everything fell into place

191
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:48,940
so smoothly.

192
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:49,840
Fine, fine.

193
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,060
If you

194
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:52,780
have nothing else,

195
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,080
stay away from Lingquan Town.

196
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:55,620
Why?

197
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,000
Your mom's birthday's coming.

198
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,240
I'm buying some porcelain for her,

199
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,020
and I

200
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,400
can check on the beautiful lady's

201
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,160
pulse.

202
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,260
You,

203
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,920
don't get involved with Liu Miantang.

204
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:16,180
Fine.

205
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,660
Master.

206
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:55,940
Dear.

207
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,220
I'm back.

208
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,100
Honey.

209
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,560
How do you like the new house?

210
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:20,860
It's nice.

211
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,300
That's good.

212
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:33,900
Have a seat.

213
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,780
I wanted

214
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,660
to travel with you,

215
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,300
but there were some issues

216
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,280
with business,

217
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,480
so I left early.

218
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,040
You've worked hard

219
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,320
for the business.

220
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,040
I'm fine.

221
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,080
You're still recovering.

222
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,760
Traveling must be

223
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,360
tiring for you.

224
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,440
The tea isn't good,

225
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,620
but do have some

226
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,600
to soothe your throat.

227
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:58,860
Alright.

228
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,140
Zhang.

229
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,220
You keep telling me we're a loving couple.

230
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,740
What loving couple talks like this,

231
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,700
so politely?

232
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,060
Is something going on with you lately?

233
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,180
No, dear.

234
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,680
What could I possibly be hiding from you?

235
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,420
We are a loving couple.

236
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,500
Stop with that.

237
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,860
Well.

238
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,820
Listen to me.

239
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,800
Well. Explain yourself.

240
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,240
Nanny Li said

241
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,320
the backyard walls are connected.

242
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,040
It's indeed noisy.

243
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:26,820
Yes.

244
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,980
Tomorrow, find a craftsman

245
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,380
to build a partition.

246
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,660
It'll be fine.

247
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,660
Is your hand better?

248
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,460
Much better.

249
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,260
I take the medicine

250
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,380
from the physician every day.

251
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,380
That's good.

252
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,820
Have you remembered anything?

253
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,020
No worries.

254
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,140
Rest for a few more days.

255
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,420
Then you can go out

256
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,500
and take a walk

257
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:09,860
to see if there's

258
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,340
anything we need.

259
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,420
You can buy anything

260
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:13,740
as you please.

261
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,060
What's this?

262
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,340
My dowry.

263
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,340
You spent all your fortune

264
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,420
to cure me.

265
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:33,860
Now,

266
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,780
I can't even remember our past.

267
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,300
My clumsiness is clear to you.

268
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,580
I feel guilty

269
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,340
and grateful.

270
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,820
We are

271
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,500
husband and wife.

272
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,110
No need for this.

273
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,580
As long as it helps you,

274
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,220
I'm full

275
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,780
of joy.

276
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,780
You used to hug me after every argument.

277
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,700
Now,

278
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,900
you don't even bother.

279
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,540
Dear, don't cry. Come here.

280
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,820
Let me hug my dear wife.

281
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,860
Thank you, dear.

282
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,820
Master.

283
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,980
Shall we dine now?

284
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,260
- Sure.
- Sure.

285
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,780
Yes.

286
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,740
I'm starving

287
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,860
after traveling all day.

288
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,700
Pardon me.

289
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,060
It's fine.

290
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,140
You've improved my appetite.

291
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,500
I mean your behavior.

292
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,420
It's indeed more tasty this way.

293
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,460
The new goods at the dock

294
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,220
need checking and transporting.

295
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,220
I won't be back for a few days.

296
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,260
I've been

297
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,500
embroidering the cloak for days.

298
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,100
Lingquan Town may be in Jiangnan,

299
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,460
but it gets chilly at night.

300
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,540
Take it with you.

301
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,380
Merchants shouldn't wear

302
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,780
crane patterns.

303
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,260
They're eagles.

304
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,220
It feels warm.

305
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,700
Put it on for me.

306
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,540
Alright.

307
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,860
It's not well-embroidered.

308
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,340
You make it look good.

309
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,140
Dear,

310
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,460
are you trying to strangle me?

311
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,300
Physician Zhao said I'm much better,

312
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,300
but my hands are still weak.

313
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,620
It's pretty good.

314
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,220
Glad you remember

315
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,460
your family's martial arts from escorting.

316
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,460
What's the use of remembering

317
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,620
if I can't practice?

318
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,380
If nothing had happened,

319
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,860
I could help

320
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,940
with your business.

321
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,340
But now, the escort agency

322
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,380
has declined,

323
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,060
and I'm useless.

324
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,020
Dear,

325
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,780
I'll...

326
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,380
What's this?

327
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,740
Jiangnan's Scent Store's scented powder.

328
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,620
For me?

329
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,940
Of course.

330
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,660
Use it tomorrow

331
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,260
when you dress up.

332
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,500
Don't be sad.

333
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,380
Don't you like it?

334
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,740
I do.

335
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,140
But we need

336
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,700
to save money.

337
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,500
This powder box,

338
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,460
decorated with raden and pearls,

339
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,860
looks expensive.

340
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,020
And this house.

341
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:32,020
It's hard to go from luxury to thrift. Right?

342
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,100
Dear,

343
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:37,980
I must go.

344
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,460
Honey,

345
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:43,020
I heard there are bandits
around the city outskirts.

346
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,060
Be careful.

347
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:45,660
Alright.

348
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,340
How much is this dangling hairpin?

349
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,740
One guan.

350
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,820
The jade on it is real,

351
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,660
right?

352
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,560
Only one guan?

353
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,060
I misspoke.

354
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,500
One tael of gold.

355
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,300
We're short on money.

356
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,540
Better not to spend recklessly.

357
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,060
Thank you.

358
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:47,360
You take this.

359
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,850
Okay. It's definitely sweet.

360
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,870
That one is nice too.

361
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,190
I want one like that.

362
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,660
- Is it right to shop like this?
- Why leave?

363
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,060
I mean.

364
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,020
Didn't my husband open a new shop?

365
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,540
I should visit there first.

366
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,220
Nanny Li, where is the shop?

367
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,460
Well,

368
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,940
the master has taken care of everything.

369
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,020
Madam,

370
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,700
don't worry about it.

371
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:19,980
I'm not worried.

372
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,340
I just want to see the shop

373
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,940
my husband chose.

374
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,340
It's renovating.

375
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,820
All the more reason to go.

376
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,220
I'll give some money,

377
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,420
so the workers will be more diligent.

378
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,300
If they slack off,

379
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,820
I'll scold them for my husband.

380
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,460
The yin-yang balance is off.

381
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,840
- What's wrong?
- Too much yang.

382
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:38,780
Nanny Li,

383
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,660
why do you look so troubled?

384
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,220
Nothing.

385
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,140
It's...

386
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,940
Is something wrong with the shop?

387
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,780
No!

388
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:49,780
No.

389
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:52,820
Then was someone injured?

390
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,260
We don't have a shop.

391
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,300
Didn't you just say it was under construction?

392
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,900
What a sin.

393
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,100
What's going on?

394
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,460
What's wrong with the shop?

395
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,140
The master hasn't

396
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,900
secured the shop yet.

397
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,220
Madam, don't ask anymore.

398
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,500
The master

399
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:17,340
didn't want you to know,

400
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,300
to avoid worrying you.

401
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,060
My husband has been here so long

402
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,420
and still hasn't secured the shop.

403
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,100
How will the business run?

404
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,620
What a sin.

405
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,660
- Look at you all.
- I…

406
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,020
Madam.

407
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,180
My brothers didn't bring money.

408
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,340
The gentleman in the carriage, please

409
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,260
give us some.

410
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:13,900
(Cui Mansion)
Does Lord Huaiyang have such a big belly?

411
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,260
Zhenzhou County is the richest.

412
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,100
With daily feasts of meat and wine,

413
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,860
of course, his belly's big.

414
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:22,100
Nonsense. Our Lord Huaiyang in Zhenzhou

415
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,700
is from a family of military generals.

416
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,220
He trains hard daily.

417
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,540
He must be strong.

418
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,700
My nanny is great at roasting chestnuts.

419
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,540
Do you want to try some?

420
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,060
Take them all up the mountain!

421
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:37,500
- Okay.
- Let's go.

422
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,340
Back to the mountain.

423
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,180
- Let's go.
- Go.

424
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,140
Lord Huaiyang.

425
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:54,180
By the way, Mrs. Cui,

426
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,380
we haven't seen your husband.

427
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,220
Yes.

428
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:58,940
What

429
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,580
is he like?

430
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,730
My husband

431
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,860
is a simple merchant from the capital.

432
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,500
Don't come closer!

433
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,820
I'll kill him if you do.

434
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:10,900
Don't come closer!

435
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,660
I'm Huang Gui.

436
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,660
Greetings, Lord Huaiyang.

437
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,580
Please spare my life.

438
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,700
My nanny always says

439
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,340
my husband is honest

440
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,500
and a bit shy

441
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,460
but very kind

442
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,380
and compassionate.

443
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,220
Down.

444
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:35,700
Up.

445
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,060
Down.

446
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,140
Up.

447
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:48,900
- Down.
- I'll speak.

448
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:49,820
I'll speak.

449
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,660
I'll tell you.

450
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,420
My teams

451
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,900
left Mount Yang

452
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,380
and went to the markets
in Qingzhou and Zhenzhou.

453
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,220
What for?

454
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,220
To find someone.

455
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,860
He treats me sincerely.

456
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,900
He didn't leave me

457
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,860
during my hardest times.

458
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,100
He won't deceive me.

459
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,500
My husband loves and respects me.

460
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,620
In short, he's a reliable man.

461
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,020
These are

462
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,620
what your nanny told you?

463
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:31,940
What do you think?

464
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,500
I?

465
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,870
- Have you heard?
- Pretty.

466
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,500
- Lord Huaiyang set up another ambush.
- Yes.

467
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,260
Caught a few people from Mount Yang.

468
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,700
Did they catch the one named Lu?

469
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,940
Lu is clever.

470
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,260
Not so easy to catch.

471
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,420
I heard Lu robs the rich

472
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,420
to help the poor.

473
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,980
He's helped many unfortunate people.

474
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,380
Really? Is that true?

475
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,220
What are you doing?

476
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,620
- Sorry, Miss.
- It's fine.

477
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,500
Nanny Li.

478
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,860
Give me a pack of this.

479
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,740
This one? Okay.

480
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,020
I made her show herself

481
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,140
- to lure the enemy out.
- Come again.

482
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,620
Anyone around her could be

483
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,660
Lu Wen's informant.

484
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,540
She's such a good woman,

485
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,260
but her hand tendons were cut.

486
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,420
I had to lie that she was hurt by bandits.

487
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,300
Who has such a grudge?

488
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,180
It's too cruel.

489
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:35,980
Good thing you saved her.

490
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:40,260
I saved and treated her

491
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,100
to get equal value in return.

492
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,540
Submitting to bandits,

493
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,620
she doesn't deserve these benefits.

494
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,220
Didn't you investigate her?

495
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,300
Her background is clean.

496
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,020
Three years ago, on her wedding day,

497
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,100
she was kidnapped.

498
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,700
She stayed at Mount Yang for three years.

499
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,340
She is

500
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,980
no ordinary woman.

501
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,220
She

502
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,100
is Lu Wen's concubine.

503
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,620
You can believe she lost her memory,

504
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,140
but you can't guarantee

505
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,100
she won't remember something

506
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,620
due to a trigger.

507
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,940
(Wanted)

508
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:29,300
(Zhang Xi fled to Zhenzhou with a reward
of 30 taels of gold for his capture.)

509
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,460
Nanny Li.

510
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,660
Yes.

511
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,860
This street is bustling.

512
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,540
It's a good place to set up shop.

513
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,140
There's an agency at the corner.

514
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,820
Could you ask about it?

515
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:44,660
And check the prices

516
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,820
of the shops.

517
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,100
But

518
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,300
you're still injured.

519
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,900
Is it safe alone?

520
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,140
I won't go far.

521
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,140
I'll just be around here.

522
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,700
Yes, it's not very peaceful.

523
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:56,940
Yes.

524
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,740
(Wanted)

525
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,100
Tan.

526
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,140
My Lady.

527
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,540
I finally found you.

528
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:15,740
Please sit.

529
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,900
When I heard you were injured,

530
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,220
I rushed here

531
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,100
immediately.

532
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,100
(Miantang's Journal)

533
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,420
(The lady is at the Cui Mansion?)

534
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:28,460
Wasn't she...?

535
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,620
Not what?

536
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,220
I only know

537
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,420
three years ago,

538
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,980
on her wedding day,

539
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,140
she was kidnapped.

540
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:38,860
By bandits?

541
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,040
My Lady,

542
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:43,860
do you

543
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,380
really not remember anything?

544
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,100
I have only

545
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,220
vague impressions about you.

546
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,780
How old am I?

547
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,340
What kind of person am I?

548
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:59,420
What have I done in my life?

549
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,900
It's all fragmented.

550
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,140
Tan,

551
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,540
where have you been all these years?

552
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:07,980
Remember.

553
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,180
Two years ago,

554
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,380
you left Cui Mansion in the capital

555
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,300
and married to Dongzhou.

556
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,380
After you married into the Cui family,

557
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,260
a year later,

558
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,660
you arranged my marriage

559
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,060
to your cousin in Dongzhou.

560
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,660
On my wedding day,

561
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,300
my maidservant

562
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,660
was named Tan.

563
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,460
Where is she?

564
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,580
She reached marriageable age,

565
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,300
so you found her a match.

566
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,660
She married

567
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,060
in Dongzhou.

568
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,340
You're twenty-two this year

569
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,700
and grew up in the yard

570
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,700
of Beizhou Escort Agency.

571
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,300
You knew in martial arts,

572
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,820
but you've always been

573
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,740
gentle, kind, well-mannered,

574
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,940
and sensible to me.

575
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,020
Really?

576
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,060
Really.

577
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,500
But later,

578
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,860
your father, Magistrate Liu,

579
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,220
was forced into a political dispute

580
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,460
and died unjustly in prison.

581
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,260
Your mother's health also deteriorated.

582
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,060
Master Qiao feared you'd be implicated,

583
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,620
so he arranged the marriage

584
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,700
with the Cui family.

585
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,780
I was sent to serve you.

586
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:15,380
On the way to the wedding,

587
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,540
were we attacked by bandits?

588
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,380
Tan, what's wrong?

589
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,220
Bandits.

590
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,860
Today, I'm just

591
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:23,820
after money.

592
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,660
Let the cops know.

593
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,020
Tell the master

594
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,740
the bride was kidnapped.

595
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:29,180
Miss, you must be mistaken.

596
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,140
The wedding procession

597
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,620
went smoothly.

598
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,940
There were no bandits.

599
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,100
So I just

600
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,980
smoothly married Cui Jiu?

601
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,060
At first, you feared

602
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,740
you were marrying the wrong person,

603
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,100
and didn't speak much on the way.

604
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,020
But after you married Mr. Cui,

605
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,020
you found

606
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,740
Mr. Cui to be honorable.

607
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:52,140
He never questioned your background

608
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:53,460
and was always ambitious.

609
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,300
Most importantly,

610
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,820
he treated you well.

611
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,420
In your letters, you said

612
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,300
he moved

613
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,700
to Lingquan Town for you.

614
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,140
I wasn't surprised.

615
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,100
Then I must have remembered wrong.

616
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,820
Such a loss.

617
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,660
What a sin.

618
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:39,820
Madam.

619
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,420
How did it go?

620
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,900
I asked almost the entire street.

621
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,100
None

622
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,420
meet your price.

623
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,780
How about the one by the river?

624
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,340
We can negotiate.

625
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:53,940
That one?

626
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,140
They saw you lingering before,

627
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,300
so they're holding out

628
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,180
for a higher price.

629
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,260
If I may speak frankly,

630
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,700
Madam,

631
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:08,020
this isn't something you should worry about.

632
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,980
Since I invested my dowry,

633
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,300
my husband's business

634
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,340
is also my business.

635
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:16,140
The Cui family spent so much money on me.

636
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,020
I should repay the favor

637
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,060
and earn it back.

638
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,180
Madam, you have a kind heart.

639
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,620
Li, you jerk.

640
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,140
Stealing my business again?

641
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,580
- You shameless fool.
- Don't shout.

642
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,780
I've given you so many chances.

643
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:29,140
- How many chances?
- I tell you.

644
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,700
You're utterly shameless now.

645
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:31,540
You know that?

646
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:33,580
- Madam.
- I'll beat you.

647
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,220
Be careful. Let's avoid trouble.

648
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,340
Let's go back.

649
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,140
Let the villagers

650
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,180
speak about it.

651
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,020
Nanny Li,

652
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,500
do we have any old, coarse

653
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,580
cloth clothes at home?

654
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,580
Of course not.

655
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,860
Madam, what do you want to do?

656
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:56,540
(Lord Huaiyang Mansion)

657
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,380
Manager Li.

658
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:05,940
(Sunshine and Blessings)

659
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,860
My Lord, you're meticulous.

660
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,340
The deployment in Lingquan Town

661
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,630
is flawless.

662
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,740
Even the locals

663
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,260
won't find our men

664
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,580
suspicious.

665
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,300
What about her?

666
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,700
In my opinion,

667
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,100
Madam...

668
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:25,820
Liu shows

669
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,380
no signs of recovering her memory

670
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,140
and won't get suspicious at all.

671
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:33,980
What does she do

672
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,140
when I'm not around?

673
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,140
She seems

674
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,980
to have fully accepted her new identity,

675
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,660
keeping herself very busy,

676
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,620
determined to help you...

677
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,460
her husband, Cui Jiu,

678
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,660
to find a thriving shop

679
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,660
to revive the family business.

680
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,220
I put her on the street.

681
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,290
Instead of colluding with the enemy,

682
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:01,580
she's helping me in business.

683
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,900
What would you like to eat?

684
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,700
We're not here to buy buns.

685
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:07,980
We're here to talk business.

686
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,100
Talk business?

687
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,540
What business?

688
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:11,780
Shopkeeper,

689
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,460
I want to buy your shop.

690
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,900
You want to buy my shop.

691
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,980
For what business?

692
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:29,020
We deal in funeral goods.

693
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,460
Our house is nearby,

694
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:31,980
so we want

695
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,260
a shop on this street.

696
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,540
We'll hang two elegy characters on both sides

697
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,980
and place a painting
of "Riding Crane to Heaven" in the center,

698
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,180
with paper boys on horses

699
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,220
to attract neighbors.

700
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,460
Isn't that bad luck for the street?

701
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,700
I don't have much capital,

702
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,500
so your small, used shop

703
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,620
is suitable.

704
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,980
If you offer a sincere price,

705
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:55,860
I'll decide for my husband today

706
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,740
to buy the shop.

707
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,980
After signing the contract,

708
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,060
it'll be done.

709
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,060
(Funeral)

710
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,020
Turning a bun shop into a funeral shop

711
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:04,860
is really unlucky.

712
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:05,820
Indeed.

713
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,500
(Sun's Fried Cakes)

714
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,940
Sir, have a bite.

715
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:09,940
Have a bite.

716
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:10,860
No, no.

717
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,340
Miss.

718
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,740
Have a fried cake.

719
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,060
Li,

720
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,540
you sold your shop to a funeral business.

721
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,380
It scared away

722
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,260
my customers.

723
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,460
I'm sincerely wanting

724
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,420
to buy your shop.

725
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,020
The feng shui master said

726
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,540
this corner is lucky for my husband.

727
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:33,900
Sincere?

728
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,660
Your price

729
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,100
sounds like a joke.

730
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,660
Right.

731
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,300
A shop next to a funeral store

732
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,260
is unlucky.

733
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,100
You may struggle

734
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,380
to sell it

735
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:47,980
in the future.

736
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:56,220
My Lord, 70 taels.

737
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,840
Seventy taels for two shops.

738
00:39:58,850 --> 00:39:59,700
Alright, alright.

739
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,420
- Please sit down.
- The lowest price.

740
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,100
No need, My Lord.

741
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,140
Got a new kiln at a low price.

742
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,140
Hired some experienced craftsmen

743
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,420
from porcelain factories.

744
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:09,940
She stayed at the kiln

745
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,580
asking for everything.

746
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,140
She's fully committed.

747
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:14,940
So,

748
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,740
she seems gentle,

749
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,100
but her actions

750
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,460
are decisive,

751
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:21,860
and she handles

752
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:24,340
social matters very well.

753
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:26,660
Indeed.

754
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,380
Lu Wen is

755
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,060
a meticulous person.

756
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,300
His concubine

757
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,900
wouldn't be ordinary either.

758
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,820
In my opinion,

759
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:37,940
Liu

760
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,780
is very capable.

761
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,340
Let her manage

762
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,300
these shops,

763
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,020
so she can

764
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,900
show herself publicly.

765
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,300
Yes.

766
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,140
Also,

767
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,220
give her more money.

768
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:55,220
I don't want to hear in the future

769
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,220
that she has to bow and scrape

770
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,580
for business

771
00:40:58,900 --> 00:40:59,860
or for anyone.

772
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,460
My Lord,

773
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:04,020
do you have sympathy?

774
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,660
Young lady,

775
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,100
where are you going?

776
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,580
I haven't...

777
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,740
Oh, my.

778
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,700
Did she just glare at me?

779
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,500
My master

780
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,740
is Chen Tu, the nephew

781
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,620
of the garrison here.

782
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,780
If you follow him,

783
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:43,340
you'll live a good life.

784
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,420
You're being rude.

785
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:46,820
Young lady.

786
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,860
This little lady

787
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,540
has quite a spirit.

788
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,620
- Where's it?
- The sedan chair?

789
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,100
It's in the alley.

790
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:00,940
Fangxie.

791
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:02,460
Wait for me here.

792
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:03,940
Madam.

793
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,580
Wait here for me.

794
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,060
Alright.

795
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,660
Young lady.

796
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:16,140
Young lady.

797
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,300
You remind me

798
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,100
of a saying,

799
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:22,940
"Meeting as if old friends."

800
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,540
How warm.

801
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:30,020
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

802
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:36,460
Sir, sir.

803
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:37,820
Over there.

804
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,980
Watch this. Don't come over.

805
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,100
Now, this hairpin

806
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,060
is piercing his neck

807
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:43,940
at a vital point.

808
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,420
A bit deeper,

809
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,180
and it will kill him.

810
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:49,420
Shrew!

811
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,500
Let our master go.

812
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,540
No one in this town

813
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,780
or all of Zhenzhou dares to touch our master.

814
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,460
I'm new here,

815
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:57,820
but I've heard

816
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,260
Lord Huaiyang is strict and fair,

817
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:01,220
correcting official misconduct

818
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:02,220
in his jurisdiction.

819
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:03,540
What?

820
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:05,380
Even he can't control your master?

821
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:07,100
My Lord,

822
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:08,660
a shadow guard reports

823
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:10,300
Liu just was forced to show martial arts

824
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:12,180
and fended off three thugs alone,

825
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,620
using quite vicious methods.

826
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:17,900
Isn't her hand still injured? Could it be...

827
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,660
Has she contacted anyone

828
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:20,740
or exchanged glances

829
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:21,620
with someone?

830
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,700
When Liu walks down the street,

831
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,020
every man is giving her looks.

832
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:27,300
Even women glance at her twice.

833
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:28,460
Why?

834
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,460
Is she very beautiful?
