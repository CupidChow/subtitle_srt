(Cui Mansion)

19
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,560
Jiu.

20
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:20,170
Mrs. Cui.

21
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,870
You're so drunk.

22
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,260
Here, have some water.

23
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,240
Leave me alone.

24
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:23,590
Let me help you change.

25
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,220
Don't touch me.

26
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,070
I know you're not feeling well.

27
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,840
The wine in the jar

28
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,980
smells sweet.

29
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,820
But it's in your stomach,

30
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,330
in four or six hours,

31
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,660
it will smell terrible.

32
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,910
The bed linens

33
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,280
are new

34
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,260
and still damp.

35
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,910
You'll get them smelly.

36
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,260
Get out.

37
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,750
Who knows what's in the wine they're selling?

38
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,630
It's strong and harmful.

39
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,350
Next time, if you want to drink,

40
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,650
I'll have Nanny Li

41
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,310
get some fresh Xinfeng wine

42
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,780
and warm it up for you.

43
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,630
A warm drink

44
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,550
and a comfortable bed

45
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,260
is better than wandering the streets

46
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,500
and braving the cold.

47
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,630
Why don't you ask me

48
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,940
why I drank?

49
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,700
People say

50
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,630
getting drunk eases sorrow.

51
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,340
Who doesn't have tough times?

52
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,340
Even the emperor

53
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,430
isn't always happy.

54
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,670
Though our house isn't
as grand as in the capital,

55
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,940
we're doing fine,
with everything we need covered.

56
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:49,700
I've thought about it.

57
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,110
Once the shop is running well

58
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,790
and covering our expenses,

59
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,490
maybe we can enjoy meat sometimes.

60
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,340
Then, Jiu,

61
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,040
you can go out,

62
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,990
play Go and visit friends.

63
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,550
Why does every worry

64
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:18,430
in the world

65
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,500
seem trivial to you?

66
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,790
Since we are married,

67
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,790
we've never been afraid of

68
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,190
troubling each other.

69
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:33,810
Jiu,

70
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,750
don't act tough with me.

71
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,430
If you ever feel tired,

72
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,430
just let go and rest.

73
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,870
I'll take care of everything.

74
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,870
Why are you looking at me?

75
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,940
I was just thinking.

76
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:12,990
In this world,

77
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,900
no one ever told me

78
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,940
I could

79
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,560
have a rest

80
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,700

81
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,790
except you.

82
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,500
Being born and living

83
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,990
in an ordinary family has its advantages.

84
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:37,690
Alright,

85
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:39,500
stop with the drunk talk.

86
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,070
Let me help you

87
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,230
get comfortable and rest, okay?

Jiu.

102
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,700
Mrs. Cui, are you alright?

103
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,050
It's okay.

104
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,290
You've seemed unwell since yesterday.

105
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,860
Should we have Physician Zhao take a look?

106
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,130
No need.

107
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,980
I'm just a bit tired.

108
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,390
Don't worry.

109
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,200
Since you're tired,

110
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:08,650
have some rest.

111
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,740
I need to go to the porcelain shop.

112
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:11,930
Remember?

113
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,390
I'll take care of everything.

114
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,510
Just kidding.

115
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,670
Mrs. Cui is serious.

116
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,330
Up before dawn,

117
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,600
she started working on porcelain,

118
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,860
looking worn out.

119
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,570
Don't listen to her.

120
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,670
I just didn't sleep well.

121
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:29,650
Miantang,

122
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,600
thank you.

123
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,600
Jiu.

124
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,210
You don't need to worry about money.

125
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,360
As long as I win at Go,

126
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,670
I'll give the money to you.

127
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,620
Is... Is it...

128
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:02,860
Is it too less?

129
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,690
Then I will

130
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,030
win more from now on.

131
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:44,840
Liu Miantang wants to

132
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,860
handle everything for you?

133
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,360
She probably thinks

134
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,570
I'm a useless

135
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:51,310
good-for-nothing.

136
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,740
What did you say?

137
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:55,410
What could I say?

138
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:56,740
There's nothing to argue about.

139
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,310
She's a bit high-maintenance

140
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,330
but still organized.

141
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,190
I'll let her be.

142
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,670
You don't care to argue with her?

143
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,970
I think you enjoy this, don't you?

144
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,860
Cui Xingzhou, listen up.

145
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,120
No one in this world

146
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,460
truly shares

147
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,820
your worries except me.

148
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,340
Enemies like wolves from afar,

149
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:28,030
women like foxes close by.

150
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,700
You've living in constant vigilance.

151
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,600
Now,

152
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,510
a beautiful girl appears.

153
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,790
She asks for nothing

154
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,600
and wants nothing,

155
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,550
but trusts you completely

156
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:44,550
and loves and cares for you the most.

157
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,150
If it were me,

158
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,550
I'd rather be a good-for-nothing too,

159
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,860
even though I'm already one.

160
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,820
Didn't realize

161
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,910
you had a flair for drama.

162
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,910
Could you really kill

163
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,460
such a good woman?

164
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,330
Honestly,

165
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:14,910
a woman like her

166
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,410
escaping from that den of thieves

167
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,070
has it hard.

168
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,100
Lu Wen has many enemies.

169
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,270
She was left alone and had her tendons cut.

170
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,050
Maybe I should let her go.

171
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:28,940
Exactly.

172
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,510
The Liu family committed crimes,

173
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,620
so she's homeless.

174
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,580
She's also tainted

175
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,460
and shunned by society.

176
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,150
I should pity

177
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:47,340
for her innocent suffering.

178
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,310
What if

179
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,330
she helps me catch the thief...

180
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:53,510
What will you do?

181
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,670
I'll give her some money,

182
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,720
send her to a temple,

183
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,760
and let her live peacefully.

184
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,600
And you!

185
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,190
Don't go see her,

186
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,460
or rumors will spread.

187
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,600
Did you hear me?

188
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,980
(Rice)

189
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,200
Mrs. Cui.

190
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,100
Peers can be tough on each other.

191
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,940
We'd better not go.

192
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,760
Why don't we sit here

193
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,600
and have some tea?

194
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,680
Shopkeeper,

195
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:34,890
tea, please.

196
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:36,050
Coming.

197
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,420
(He's Porcelain Shop)

198
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,290
Watch the steps.

199
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,190
Easy, sir.

200
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:44,250
Nanny Li,

201
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,580
look at those two.

202
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,450
They're tanned,

203
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:49,930
and their waist pouches full.

204
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,220
They came in our shop

205
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,310
and found the best items right away,

206
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,980
which shows they're regular porcelain traders.

207
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,790
But they don't buy anything here.

208
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,790
I want to see

209
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,860
what experts

210
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:05,150
consider valuable.

211
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,410
- How about this one?
- Not bad.

212
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,330
Next time you get new stock, let me know.

213
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,720
I'll notify you immediately.

214
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,560
See you, sir.

215
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,940
Ma'am, come on in.

216
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:16,520
We have

217
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,940
the finest porcelain.

218
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,570
Take a look and see if you like any.

219
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:20,620
I'll introduce them to you.

220
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:31,880
You have a good eye, ma'am.

221
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,930
This piece is made by our

222
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:33,940
most experienced craftsman.

223
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,080
Really?

224
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,810
But I've seen this kiln technique

225
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,480
in other shops.

226
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,510
It's nothing special.

227
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,600
Well...

228
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,580
How about you check out some others?

229
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,170
Ma.

230
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,310
Ma'am, you can check inside.

231
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,860
These are all fine pieces.

232
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:02,940
Look.

233
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,270
How about this set?

234
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,790
It's delicate.

235
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,980
What's this seal?

236
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:12,530
Give it to me.

237
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,080
Ma'am.

238
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,980
You can look, but please don't touch.

239
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,790
This seal

240
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,460
means it's from an official kiln,

241
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,220
made for the royal family.

242
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,030
If it weren't for a flaw,

243
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,620
you wouldn't

244
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,070
be seeing it today.

245
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,930
Other shops are empty,

246
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,340
but yours is bustling

247
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:32,100
because of these royal items.

248
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:33,910
We are not the only ones selling these.

249
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:36,640
Ma'am, you must be new here

250
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,460
and unfamiliar with the market.

251
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,210
So,

252
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,100
just as a reminder,

253
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:44,820
you buy from shops with trade guild plaques.

254
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,410
Trade guild?

255
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,320
Yes.

256
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,060
There are 12 members in town,

257
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,020
(Porcelain)

258
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,860
with established brands,

259
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,330
mutually guaranteed,

260
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,390
and well-known.

261
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,210
(Porcelain)
As for small,

262
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,310
unregistered trade guild workshops,

263
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,290
I advise you

264
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,910
to avoid them.

265
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,340
In Lingquan Town,

266
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,970
newcomers

267
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:09,100
who don't know this

268
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,430
won't succeed in their business.

269
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:14,360
Since that's the case,

270
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,720
I'll buy this bowl.

271
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,620
- Okay.
- How much is it?

272
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:18,010
One tael of gold.

273
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:19,250
One tael of gold?

274
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,840
I don't have

275
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,150
that much.

276
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,640
Could you please

277
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,480
lower the price?

278
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:28,330
He's Porcelain

279
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,150
is top-notch and worth the price.

280
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:31,550
I can't decide.

281
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,620
Miss He is right there.

282
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,840
Just be kind to her,

283
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,940
and then you can decide.

284
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:39,760
How do you know

285
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,700
who I am?

286
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,640
When I entered,

287
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,640
the shopkeeper was focused
on the accounts,

288
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,000
glancing at you

289
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,480
rather than the customers.

290
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,210
Clearly, you're here to oversee the books.

291
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:54,330
The shopkeeper couldn't tend to the customers,

292
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,620
so he had to focus on the accounts.

293
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:00,100
But I could also be a manager.

294
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,390
How did you know I'm Miss He?

295
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,850
When I said your porcelain

296
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:06,660
was nothing special on purpose,

297
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:08,970
you signaled the shopkeeper

298
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,380
to handle it.

299
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,610
Your concern for the reputation

300
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:15,990
shows you must have authority.

301
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,030
Family business isn't run by outsiders.

302
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,970
Daughters-in-law

303
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,760
are not permitted to run the business.

304
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,660
So I guess you're Miss He.

305
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,030
I'm He Zhen, the third lady

306
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,120
of the He family.

307
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,320
Mrs. Cui, you're smart.

308
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,160
I admire that.

309
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,130
But

310
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,550
you don't need to pretend to be a customer.

311
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:35,380
I knew who you were

312
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,100
since you entered.

313
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,650
Lingquan Town isn't a big place.

314
00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,420
A new Yushao Porcelain Shop

315
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,070
and a beautiful lady taking charge

316
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:47,490
really stand out and are hard to miss.

317
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,660
Since that's clear,

318
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,070
I'll be straight with you.

319
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,560
I'd like

320
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,650
my shop to succeed here.

321
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:55,850
Miss He, I'd appreciate

322
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:56,690
any advice you can offer.

323
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,320
We're both in business.

324
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,420
That's too much credit.

325
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,360
Actually,

326
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:04,990
I want to join the trade guild.

327
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,410
Since I came here to see you,

328
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:13,850
it's because I'm determined

329
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,080
to make Yushao Porcelain Shop

330
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,310
thrive in Lingquan Town.

331
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:18,240
Since

332
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,340
Miss He

333
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:22,230
had your shopkeeper

334
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:25,480
pointed out my business flaws,

335
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,750
I suppose you could give me some advice.

336
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,140
Mrs. Cui, you're frank.

337
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,510
Honestly,

338
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:34,990
I admire you.

339
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,010
But

340
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:38,860
joining the trade guild is a strict process.

341
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,580
If you really want to join,

342
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,900
have your husband handle it for you.

343
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:47,860
Frankly,

344
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,710
my husband doesn't know much about business.

345
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,580
I handle our business.

346
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,070
Then you'd better give up.

347
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:56,530
The trade guild

348
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,140
doesn't accept female members.

349
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,640
Jiu.

350
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,100
How was business today?

351
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,860
Not bad.

352
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:51,660
Nanny Li told you everything?

353
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,990
Don't worry.
I'll find a way into the trade guild.

354
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,380
That's not necessary.

355
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,320
Why?

356
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,820
The trade guild

357
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:03,920
is all men,

358
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,140
not suitable for you.

359
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,710
I'll join in and handle that.

360
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,400
You?

361
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:11,730
But

362
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:12,770
do you now

363
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,140
how to fire porcelain?

364
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:16,760
How much clay is needed?

365
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,040
How many craftsmen are required?

366
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,240
How many finished pieces

367
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,510
are needed for profit?

368
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,520
What about the workers' wages?

369
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,580
Do you know all of this?

370
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:28,130
So,

371
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,480
you just play Go.

372
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,710
I'll take care of it.

373
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:34,450
Miantang,

374
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,450
our business

375
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:37,610
has just started,

376
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:38,660
so take it step by step.

377
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,510
Don't rush.

378
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:42,470
You don't understand.

379
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,410
If we don't get into

380
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,520
the trade guild,

381
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,100
we'll never succeed.

382
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,360
Those shops have been established

383
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:50,370
for years

384
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:51,890
with deep connections.

385
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:54,210
It's not easy to join them.

386
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,050
In my view,

387
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,370
if we can't continue

388
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:58,450
this business,

389
00:20:58,450 --> 00:20:59,890
we should close the shop and find

390
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,170
another way to make a living.

391
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:02,230
You really don't have to

392
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,690
worry about the money.

393
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:04,860
I'll give you the money.

394
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,850
Even if you stay home

395
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:07,930
and don't work,

396
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,180
I can support us.

397
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,790
I told you,

398
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:14,100
just play Go

399
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:15,890
and I'll take care of everything.

400
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:17,130
You really don't have to do this.

401
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,080
You don't need to

402
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,030
go through this.

403
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:22,000
I've tried joining the trade guild.

404
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,840
It's complicated.

405
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,380
No need to waste

406
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,560
your effort on this.

407
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,170
At least let me give it a try...

408
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,010
Enough.

409
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:31,780
That's the last word on it.

410
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,890
I need to go to the Go Club.

411
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:34,750
Get some rest.

412
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,080
Jiu.

413
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,620
My Lord, Ms. Liu seems to be upset.

414
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,410
She's making a fuss over nothing

415
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,550
and acting presumptuous.

416
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,620
Do you want me to join her?

417
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:20,880
Mrs. Cui,

418
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:23,790
you should rest early tonight.

419
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:29,050
Nanny Li.

420
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,950
What was

421
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:33,710
Jiu like before?

422
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,180
Well,

423
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:39,140
he was about the same as he is now.

424
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,140
That's why he's always been this fickle

425
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:52,530
and domineering?

426
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,900
No, no, no.

427
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:56,310
That's not what I mean.

428
00:22:58,450 --> 00:22:59,310
So,

429
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,990
did we often quarrel like this?

430
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,640
Well,

431
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,860
this is your private matter.

432
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,900
I don't know about that.

433
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:11,810
I don't know.

434
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:24,060
(Clear Winds and Auspicious Aura)

435
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:24,920
My Lord.

436
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,400
My Lord.

437
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,360
Mr. He.

438
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:30,950
On behalf of

439
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,710
the 12 members of Lingquan Trade Guild,

440
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,340
I greet Your Lordship.

441
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,180
What are you doing, Mr. He?

442
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,100
Please rise.

443
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:43,050
My Lord.

444
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:46,230
We merchants have no land or power.

445
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:51,210
We rely solely on our trades and crafts.

446
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:52,270
Yet, we still have to

447
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:55,230
pay 12 different types of big taxes.

448
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:57,820
And Zhenzhou is a military town.

449
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,990
The military funds come from the taxes
we merchants pay.

450
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:09,270
We really can't bear the burden anymore.

451
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:11,520
Mr. He,

452
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,760
you came to see me overnight

453
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,230
and even knelt down,

454
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,420
just to ask me

455
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,310
to reduce your taxes?

456
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,060
If we could

457
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,070
gain your support,

458
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,510
the trade guild would certainly unite

459
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,820
to support the court

460
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,580
and ease your concerns.

461
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,080
Okay.

462
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:33,920
I will

463
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,560
consider it.

464
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:36,970
Also,

465
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,280
tomorrow's river restoration opening

466
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,420
is a major event for Lingquan Town.

467
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:43,900
I will allow the trade guild members

468
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,400
to participate.

469
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,790
Thank you, My Lord.

470
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:52,820
(Lingquan Town Porcelain Trade Guild)

471
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:53,920
Father

472
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,270
visited Lord Huaiyang last night

473
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:58,620
and caught a cold on the way back.

474
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:01,140
Today, I'll preside over

475
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:03,310
the tribute matters.

476
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:05,250
Okay.

477
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,560
Young Mr. He.

478
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:08,240
What do we each

479
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,450
need to do this year?

480
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:10,520
Yes. Right.

481
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,240
How should we distribute it?

482
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,130
How should we do it?

483
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:14,510
What would be fair?

484
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,640
Right.

485
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:19,230
We're in charge of fine porcelain painting.

486
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,520
Other members were assigned

487
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,030
their tasks according to the old rules.

488
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,820
Please complete it on time.

489
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:27,510
The He family is always considerate.

490
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,720
This way,

491
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,320
everyone can at least get a share.

492
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,130
Yes. We all have a share.

493
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:33,230
That's very kind of them.

494
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:34,280
Exactly.

495
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,720
We're not the only ones

496
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,900
making porcelain.

497
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,900
If we don't unite,

498
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,690
we'll be overrun by

499
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:41,790
out-of-town merchants.

500
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,750
- Yes.
- That makes sense.

501
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:45,810
Yes,

502
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,180
I was just about to say that.

503
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,140
Well, Zhen,

504
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:52,860
you should leave now.

505
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,230
Business matters

506
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:57,710
are not for women to meddle in.

507
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,600
Have some tea.

508
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:02,070
Have some tea.

509
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:03,970
Good tea.

510
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:05,230
It's fragrant.

511
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,070
Refreshing and tasty.

512
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,270
- Here. Here.
- True.

513
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:16,530
Young Mr. He,

514
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:17,850
someone outside claims to be

515
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,410
the owner of Yushao Porcelain Shop

516
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:20,250
and wants to see you.

517
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,760
This lowly merchant

518
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,560
finally knows to pay respect.

519
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,400
Yes.

520
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:27,810
Alright.

521
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,070
Since they're here,

522
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:30,210
let's

523
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:31,770
meet them.

524
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:32,730
Yes.

525
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:33,850
Let's meet them.

526
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:35,230
Yes, we should meet them.

527
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:36,850
Yes, we should.

528
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:37,690
Exactly.

529
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,140
A woman?

530
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,580
Why is it a woman?

531
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:57,410
We've never had a female member.

532
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:59,130
You must be Young Mr. He.

533
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,180
Sorry for the interruption.

534
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:04,510
You did interrupt us.

535
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,860
Yushao Porcelain Shop is Cui's business, right?

536
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,720
Mr. Cui didn't come himself.

537
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,030
Did he get upset

538
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:13,270
because we didn't send him

539
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:15,140
an invitation?

540
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:17,000
She came without an invitation.

541
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,320
(Integrity is the key to wealth.)
You see?

542
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,850
(Honesty is the best policy.)
She wasn't invited.

543
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:21,420
Why isn't Mrs. Cui saying anything?

544
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,380
Are you deaf?

545
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:25,350
- Say something.
- She's deaf.

546
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:27,320
Hearing Young Mr. He's words,

547
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,480
I realize it was

548
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,420
my fault

549
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,900
for disrespecting everyone here.

550
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,660
So I checked

551
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,610
if there were any rules against women entering

552
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,420
so I wouldn't break any rules.

553
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,230
Even though there's no rule against it,

554
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:42,790
you are

555
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,620
the only woman here,

556
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:46,100
which might be inconvenient.

557
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:47,800
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

558
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,860
I thought coming in person showed sincerity.

559
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:51,610
Had I known

560
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:53,710
you were uncomfortable talking to a woman,

561
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:54,970
I would have sent

562
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,180
a servant instead.

563
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,930
What did you say?

564
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:59,310
That's not appropriate.

565
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,800
Sending a woman to the trade guild

566
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,860
and speaking recklessly,

567
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,550
your husband

568
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:09,000
must be quite useless.

569
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,270
- Exactly.
- Really?

570
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,480
But why does Miss He

571
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,970
go manage the shop

572
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:14,990
even though you're here.

573
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:18,310
Since Young Mr. He holds that position,

574
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:20,270
you must be capable.

575
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,030
Your family must be sensible

576
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:27,650
and clearly believes that a capable woman

577
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:28,860
can handle business.

578
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,100
What? Am I wrong?

579
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,370
Is Young Mr. He incapable,

580
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:38,270
or is your family just not very sensible?

581
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:40,520
Young Mr. He, she's sharp-tongued.

582
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,900
Don't waste your breath on her.

583
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:49,380
Do you really want to join the trade guild?

584
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,820
I have confidence in Yushao Porcelain Shop.

585
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,270
I seek to rise with the guild's support.

586
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:56,130
A new member also benefits

587
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,310
the guild in the long run.

588
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,860
It's a win-win situation.

589
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,000
Young Mr. He,

590
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,320
please tell your family

591
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,370
and consider it.

592
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:04,210
Okay.

593
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,230
Since that's the case,

594
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:07,790
I have one condition.

595
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:10,760
If Yushao Porcelain

596
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,230
can secure sales to the royals,

597
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:14,510
I'll make sure

598
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,070
you join the trade guild.

599
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,420
Gentlemen, what do you think?

600
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,240
Makes sense.

601
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,210
Well said.

602
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:23,070
That's a deal.

603
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,310
You're deliberately
making it difficult for her.

604
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:27,410
Since Mrs. Cui is so confident

605
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:28,560
in her porcelain,

606
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,470
it shouldn't

607
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,820
be a problem, right?

608
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:33,050
Yes.

609
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,000
That's right.

610
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,520
- I'll be waiting for your good news.
- That's right.

611
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,470
Yes.

612
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:38,920
See you.

613
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,760
- Go.
- Just leave. Get out.

614
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,340
Let's see if you are capable.

615
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,560
Go.

616
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:47,210
Look at her.

617
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:52,750
Mr. Cui is indeed insightful.

618
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,310
Joining the guild

619
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,950
is extremely hard.

620
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,900
But Mr. Cui is surely experienced

621
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,860
and capable.

622
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,600
Mrs. Cui,

623
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:05,860
why don't you

624
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:07,470
talk with him...

625
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:11,170
Contribute to and work towards river restoration

626
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,340
for the benefit of the people.

627
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,450
Oh, my.

628
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:14,610
What a great deed.

629
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:16,650
I've heard that Lord Huaiyang

630
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,720
will personally preside over the opening.

631
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,930
(Notice)
Lord Huaiyang will come?

632
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:21,650
(Reforming the river)
Yes, it's wonderful.

633
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,690
This is a huge blessing!

634
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,710
We won't fear floods anymore.

635
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:26,760
Yes.

636
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,600
Mrs. Cui!

637
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:36,880
Bicao.

638
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:39,450
Mrs. Cui.

639
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,000
Go to the kiln and find Mr. Chen.

640
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,250
Have him bring the tank he fired

641
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,320
a few days ago to the riverbank.

642
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,160
Yes.

643
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:54,010
Mrs. Cui,

644
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:55,990
you were so fast.

645
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,080
Nanny Li,

646
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,560
don't you always say,

647
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,790
"what a sin"?

648
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,840
Yes.

649
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,010
Yes.

650
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,520
Send someone to catch

651
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,210
all the koi in this yard.

652
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:07,140
Then go to the market

653
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,100
and buy all the koi you can find.

654
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:10,880
Mrs. Cui,

655
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,840
why...

656
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:14,230
Why are you doing this?

657
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,140
Koi are very expensive,

658
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:17,930
and buying them all

659
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:19,660
will cost a fortune.

660
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,520
Doing good deeds to atone for sins,

661
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,380
why be stingy?

662
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,160
You...

663
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:27,920
I...

664
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:42,510
Excuse me.

665
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,640
Please move aside.

666
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:45,710
Could you move aside a bit? Thank you.

667
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,480
Mr. He, look,

668
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,310
Lord Huaiyang is truly efficient.

669
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,130
Look at how fast they are.

670
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,650
30,000 soldiers are working on it.

671
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:02,610
The river restoration

672
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:04,790
will be completed soon.

673
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,650
Now, you use it as an excuse.

674
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:09,490
What about the future?

675
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,410
Are you going to renovate

676
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:12,930
Zhenzhou entirely?

677
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,790
We still have Qingzhou.

678
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:16,820
As long as you, General, give the order,

679
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:19,030
I'll mobilize the men at any time.

680
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:34,890
The first shovel

681
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:36,820
symbolizes good luck and smooth progress.

682
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:38,550
General Shi,

683
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,100
you are our honored guest.

684
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:44,210
Okay.

685
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,180
- Great!
- Great!

686
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,040
May the work be completed soon,

687
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,720
bringing peace and prosperity to Zhenzhou!

688
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,030
- Great!
- Well said!

689
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,320
Our Lingquan Trade Guild

690
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,710
prepared a gift.

691
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:15,520
We hope General Shi

692
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,380
will accept it.

693
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,210
Lord Huaiyang

694
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:22,140
has thought of everything thoroughly.

695
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,360
Did you see him?

696
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:28,310
Too far,

697
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,270
too many people. I can't see.

698
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:32,180
Is that man Lord Huaiyang?

699
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:34,560
Yes.

700
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,400
What time is it now?

701
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:36,880
It's the Wu hour.

702
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,130
I've given my birthday congratulations

703
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:46,560
and done the first shovel.

704
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,950
Now, it's time to return to Qingzhou.

705
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,790
Wait, wait.

706
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:51,470
General,

707
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:54,990
are you going to report to the court?

708
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:57,530
I can do that.

709
00:33:57,970 --> 00:33:59,380
Please wait.

710
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:04,820
General Shi, thank you in advance.

711
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:07,560
However, restoring the river

712
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,070
is not my sole achievement.

713
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,330
Clearing the river

714
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:14,180
will produce a lot of silt.

715
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,000
We must thank the merchants

716
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,810
who lend their ships

717
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:20,030
for transporting it.

718
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:22,410
General Shi,

719
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:24,560
please speak highly of them too.

720
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,450
My Lord, we...

721
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:26,290
Mr. He,

722
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:28,220
your actions serve the court

723
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:29,990
and ease my burden.

724
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:33,870
Okay.

725
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:36,220
Koi!

726
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,660
Look! Koi!

727
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:42,160
There are koi.

728
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,120
It's truly a sign of good fortune.

729
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,680
Heaven blesses Zhenzhou!

730
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,030
- Yes.
- Exactly.

731
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:48,650
My Lord.

732
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:51,250
You really went to great lengths

733
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,910
for this memorial.

734
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,950
Since the koi are an auspicious sign,

735
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:56,450
let's catch them.

736
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:57,290
Okay, okay.

737
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,480
Go catch them.

738
00:34:59,040 --> 00:34:59,880
Yes.

739
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:10,030
Excuse us. Please make way.

740
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:17,660
What are you doing?

741
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:18,990
Soldiers,

742
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,620
it's your time to shine.

743
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:24,610
Be careful.

744
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:25,910
General, we've caught the fish.

745
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,990
- Go get a bucket.
- Look at it.

746
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,040
General, a woman from the crowd

747
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:34,890
brought a porcelain tank,

748
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:35,950
claiming it matches the koi.

749
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:37,470
- Bring it here.
- Yes.

750
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,360
Great.

751
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,830
Congratulations to Your Lordship and General

752
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,780
for the auspicious sign.

753
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,030
General Shi,

754
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,870
you are truly a blessing to me.

755
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:00,910
What a great omen.

756
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,420
(Yushao Porcelain Shop)

757
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:09,770
My Lord.

758
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:11,690
My Lord.

759
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,600
The woman who brought the porcelain tank

760
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,640
is still outside

761
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,300
and wants to request a reward.

762
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:21,740
- Go give it to her.
- My Lord,

763
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:25,930
since she brought the auspicious sign
in person,

764
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:28,620
we should reward her in person as well.

765
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,780
Go. Bring her here.

766
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,840
Yes.

767
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,700
Ma'am, please come with me.

768
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,440
Surely she will be rewarded.

769
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:52,950
She's just a common merchant,

770
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,330
nothing special to see,

771
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:55,170
right?

772
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,040
My Lord,

773
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:58,130
this auspicious sign

774
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:00,220
is a rare good omen.

775
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,810
It's quite fortunate

776
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:04,350
for a common merchant to have such luck.

777
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,890
Let's take it as a good sign

778
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:11,520
- for the river restoration.
- Very good.

779
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,000
We should give her a good reward.

780
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,030
Of course.

781
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:16,960
Good.

782
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,330
I felt too happy this morning

783
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:25,580
and now I'm a bit dizzy.

784
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:27,910
I'll go take a break.

785
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,030
Alright.

786
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,700
Don't look back.

787
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,140
General, she's here.

788
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,300
- You may leave.
- Yes.

789
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:52,740
I'm Liu, owner of Yushao Porcelain Shop.

790
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:54,450
The auspicious sign is rare.

791
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:55,520
I would like to ask His Lordship

792
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,470
for a small reward

793
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:57,650
for good luck.

794
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:02,810
Take it.

795
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:04,660
(Xuanwen Zhongbao cash coin)
It's from His Lordship.

796
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:07,130
Thank you.

797
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,700
Thanks, Your Lordship.

798
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:13,690
Let's go.

799
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,730
I told you to watch her,

800
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:40,510
not let her make a scene.

801
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:45,990
I kept her here to catch Lu Wen.

802
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,480
Should I give up

803
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,390
being a prince

804
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,430
and just play house with her?

805
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:52,410
Forgive me, My Lord.

806
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:54,100
Come on. Don't do that.

807
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,560
I...

808
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,330
I thought Ms. Liu

809
00:38:58,330 --> 00:38:59,370
was releasing the koi

810
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:01,250
to remove sins.

811
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:02,090
She also said

812
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:03,580
that the Wu hour was a perfect time.

813
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,510
I thought

814
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:07,160
she'd release koi upstream,

815
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,100
so you wouldn't

816
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:09,990
be seen downstream.

817
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:12,160
She said releasing fish would remove sins,

818
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,910
so you just believed that?

819
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:15,810
Well...

820
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:18,030
There are so many sins committed.

821
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:22,220
I mean, I apologize for my mistake.

822
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:24,040
But no matter how much

823
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,250
I tried to pull or persuade her,

824
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:27,560
Ms. Liu wouldn't relent

825
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,140
and insisted on joining the trade guild.

826
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:32,740
Actually,

827
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,600
Ms. Liu has done everything

828
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,350
for you...

829
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,890
for Cui Jiu,

830
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:42,180
to manage the household.

831
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,770
You should talk to her

832
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:46,610
and make things better.

833
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:49,140
That would be better than anything I could do.

834
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:56,950
Where is she?

835
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:58,220
(Xuanwen Zhongbao cash coin)

836
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,330
The transaction is complete.

837
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,770
This coin was earned

838
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:02,620
by Mrs. Cui from Lord Huaiyang.

839
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,040
Young Mr. He,

840
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,950
your family should honor your promise.

841
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:09,260
When did we

842
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
give you a promise?

843
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,430
- Mr. He.
- Father.

844
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,520
Mr. He.

845
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,990
Your son once said that

846
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:18,580
if Yushao Porcelain

847
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:20,260
could be sold to the royals,

848
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,740
we could join the trade guild.

849
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,140
But that was just a joke.

850
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,660
She took it seriously.

851
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,260
He gave you a way out,

852
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,680
so everyone could

853
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,100
leave peacefully.

854
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:38,390
Mrs. Cui,

855
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,620
did you take it seriously?

856
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:42,880
Please leave.

857
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:46,140
We're very busy these days.

858
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:47,970
Go. Go.

859
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:48,850
Now I've seen

860
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:49,830
what the trade guild is like.

861
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,090
Let's go.

862
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,450
Go. Get out.

863
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,430
Mr. He, see?

864
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,840
What a stubborn woman.

865
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,000
Jiu.

866
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,040
Miantang.

867
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,870
Today, you received

868
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:33,000
a reward from Lord Huaiyang.

869
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,520
Nanny Li told you that?

870
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,360
Yes.

871
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:37,870
She also said

872
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:40,070
you met Lord Huaiyang in person.

873
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,470
With his potbelly,

874
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:45,480
he seems pretty straightforward.

875
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,150
When I asked him for a reward,
he just gave it to me.

876
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:50,210
Miantang,

877
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,100
you went to such lengths

878
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:55,030
just to join the trade guild?

879
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,070
You know what.

880
00:41:57,410 --> 00:41:58,370
A large trade guild

881
00:41:58,370 --> 00:41:59,290
can be quite capricious.

882
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:00,130
Alright, alright.

883
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:01,880
I understand.

884
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:04,120
You didn't take any

885
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,030
of my words to heart.

886
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:10,650
Miantang,

887
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,350
staying in this house

888
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,520
should be good enough,

889
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,830
shouldn't it?

890
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,970
Don't think about

891
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:21,080
doing business

892
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,740
or even joining the trade guild,

893
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:24,250
okay?

894
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:25,170
Why?

895
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:27,330
You supported me

896
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:28,370
in business before.

897
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:29,370
Why does the trade guild

898
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:31,180
seem to hit a nerve with you?

899
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:33,700
Cui Jiu, what are you afraid of?

900
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:36,610
I...

901
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:40,910
Or were your encouraging words
just to placate me?

902
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,870
Now that I often go out for work,

903
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,910
does it make you uncomfortable?

904
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:48,250
If that's what you think,

905
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:49,510
I have nothing to say.

906
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:51,260
Cui Jiu,

907
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,120
I've never blamed you for being lazy.

908
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,290
I willingly stand in front

909
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:56,220
to shield you.

910
00:42:57,330 --> 00:42:59,260
But I don't want to see you so cowardly.

911
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,080
You want to achieve something

912
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,390
but fear the trade guild,

913
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:05,100
so you just hide in your shell.

914
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,450
Likewise,

915
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:07,410
you sweet-talk me without

916
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:08,300
putting in the hard work,

917
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:09,290
and at critical moments,

918
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:11,070
you don't want me to make a public appearance.

919
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,040
My husband can't be like that.

920
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:13,880
I can be,

921
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:15,690
