14
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,310
How dare Cui Xingzhou

15
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,520
treat our Lian family with such disrespect?

16
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,610
Back in the day...

17
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,780
Mother!

18
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,240
- You!
- The Lian family has

19
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,740
been known for integrity for generations.

20
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,600
You tarnished

21
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,550
the reputation we've upheld for so long!

22
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,150
Father, please.

23
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,560
Silence!

24
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,580
And you!

25
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,470
Just as the banquet ended,

26
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:04,810
Cui Xingzhou spoke with me in private.

27
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,830
As his uncle-in-law,

28
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,520
I was harshly reprimanded.

29
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,730
Why?

30
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,410
Isn't it because you two dared

31
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,530
to send those three women

32
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,690
to his mansion to cause trouble?

33
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,590
- Cause trouble?
- Mother.

34
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,530
That vixen was just a mistress.

35
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,550
Do you dare admit to the Consort Dowager

36
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,340
that you arranged it?

37
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,010
The joke's on you.

38
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,460
Let alone you're just a relative.

39
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,570
Even if you were the goddess,

40
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,320
it's not your place to meddle

41
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,010
in the affairs of the Princess of Huaiyang.

42
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,730
The princess should have been Binglan.

43
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,410
The Cui family owes us.

44
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,850
Heavens.

45
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,670
Over the years,

46
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,830
I've shamelessly gone there

47
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,320
to ask for favors

48
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,040
and handed over recommendation letters.

49
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,290
And you say the Cui family owes us?

50
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,360
I can't even bring myself

51
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,670
to say that word.

52
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,590
How did you

53
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,360
get the nerve to say it?

54
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,530
Lian Hanshan,

55
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,990
you usually keep it to yourself.

56
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:11,990
What's gotten into you today?

57
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,040
Are you drunk?

58
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,320
Whose side are you even on?

59
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,340
- I...
- Enough, stop arguing.

60
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,760
Father,

61
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,920
instead of venting your anger,

62
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,150
why don't you tell us

63
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,080
what my cousin

64
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,620
said to you?

65
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,410
Xingzhou said

66
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,340
that since there is no engagement,

67
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,290
we should not

68
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,500
visit their home uninvited

69
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,460
as the futures of our younger generation

70
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,360
are in his hands.

71
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,410
He wouldn't dare.

72
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,110
I'm going to see my sister and reason with her.

73
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,460
He also said

74
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,660
that if the younger generation isn't enough,

75
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,340
he'll add mine to the mix

76
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:05,060
and drive the Lian family
out of Zhenzhou entirely.

77
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,670
Mother.

78
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,970
From the Beizhou Escort Agency

79
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,730
to the Lingquan Town's Yushao Porcelain Shop,

80
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,880
and now to the Mansion of Lord Huaiyang,

81
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,170
within just a few months,

82
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,580
you have accomplished

83
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,880
what others couldn't

84
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,100
in a lifetime.

85
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,520
I don't know

86
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,820
whether to say you've had it tough

87
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,580
or that you are

88
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:37,930
truly remarkable.

89
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,370
Regardless of what you think,

90
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,140
you spared me from embarrassment

91
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,490
in the front hall.

92
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,100
Thank you for your kindness.

93
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,100
What else could I do?

94
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,910
You're the one Xingzhou has chosen.

95
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,000
Even if not for you,

96
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,850
I must consider the family's reputation.

97
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,780
Today, I finally understand

98
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,460
that his words

99
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,340
were to silence me.

100
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,780
But should you truly become the Princess,

101
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:07,790
things won't be as simple

102
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,100
as you imagine.

103
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,490
Greetings, Consort Dowager.

104
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,730
I pay my respects to the Princess.

105
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,440
Now that you're here,

106
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,100
you should stay in the mansion.

107
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,680
Since you're marrying into our family,

108
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,140
staying in Lingquan Town

109
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:34,140
would bring disgrace to us.

110
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,390
This is Madam Wang,

111
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:38,820
experienced from the palace

112
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,100
who has trained many noble ladies.

113
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,820
She was granted permission
to leave the palace this year,

114
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,170
and I have specially invited her for you

115
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,410
to learn from her.

116
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:52,220
Xingzhou has done so much for you.

117
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,140
You must do your best

118
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:55,850
to live up to him

119
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,410
and this family.

120
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,530
Thank you, Consort Dowager.

121
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,370
Just as I expected,

122
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,780
once you come here, there's no going back.

123
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,140
Had I known this,

124
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,850
I would have stayed in Lingquan.

125
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,230
Before we get married,

126
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,780
we should keep a distance.

127
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,490
There are many in the mansion who gossip.

128
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,830
Even if you don't care,

129
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,730
I must

130
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,660
protect my reputation.

131
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,170
You've learned quickly,

132
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,780
picking up things as you go.

133
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,050
Why do I feel like I'm marrying Madam Wang?

134
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,900
If that's the case,

135
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,220
remember this lesson well.

136
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,970
Don't disappoint Mother or me.

137
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,020
Cui Xingzhou,

138
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,340
are you out of your mind?

139
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,530
How did I do today?

140
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,470
Does it deserve a commendation

141
00:06:58,470 --> 00:06:59,310
from the Princess?

142
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,960
My Lord.

143
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,070
Mother.

144
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,070
Xingzhou,

145
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,270
what urgent matter

146
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,410
brings you here at this late hour?

147
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,660
There's something

148
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,370
I must report to Mother.

149
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,800
Mother.

150
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:23,870
Xingzhou.

151
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,640
Are you also getting married?

152
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,900
I called Xingdi here.

153
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,730
Prince Lu has rebelled.

154
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:30,700
The Emperor has ordered me

155
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,360
to march east immediately
to quell the uprising.

156
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,110
Xingzhou,

157
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,100
you can't go.

158
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,400
Just say

159
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,490
you're ill.

160
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,660
Why should you get involved

161
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,390
in the Liu family's dispute?

162
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,230
Mother,

163
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,140
I must go quell the uprising.

164
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,220
If not, other vassal lords will rise up,

165
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,930
and the court will be thrown into chaos.

166
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,220
If I disobey the order,

167
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,730
I'll be guilty of the same crime as Prince Lu.

168
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,110
Mother,

169
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,610
please have some rest.

170
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,490
I need to speak with Xingdi.

171
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,100
I'll explain everything to you later.

172
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,970
Don't go risk your life, Xingzhou.

173
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,000
I won't.

174
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,840
Ma'am,

175
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,260
please send my mother back.

176
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,100
All right. Let's go, Consort Dowager.

177
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,140
- Let's go.
- Worry not, Mother.

178
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,280
Let's go.

179
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:24,630
Xingzhou,

180
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,530
why did you want me here?

181
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,730
What do you need me to do?

182
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,850
I want to entrust

183
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,770
the Mansion of Lord Huaiyang to you.

184
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,060
This battle is more dangerous than any before.

185
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,540
If I fall in battle,

186
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,580
you shall become Lord Huaiyang.

187
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,460
Why me, a cripple?

188
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,970
Even though you're constrained,

189
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,350
you are fair

190
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,300
and generous.

191
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,580
I trust only you.

192
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,470
Fine.

193
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,730
I shall guard the mansion for you.

194
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,580
But you must promise me

195
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,970
you'll return safe.

196
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:02,490
I'm looking forward to your wedding.

197
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,490
Great Deities,

198
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,420
protect my son Xingzhou.

199
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,130
May he return safely

200
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,940
and cause little bloodshed.

201
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,250
If he returns to Zhenzhou unharmed,

202
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,510
I shall offer

203
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,540
daily incense and prayers,

204
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,220
devoutly serving the Dao.

205
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,180
Guilty.

206
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,100
Guilty.

207
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,010
Greetings, Mother.

208
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,890
You're leaving tomorrow,

209
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:54,540
so don't linger here.

210
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,250
Go spend more time with her.

211
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,080
I can't help

212
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,610
but worry about you, Mother.

213
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,850
That's why I've come to pay my respects.

214
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,040
You've never

215
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,060
said such things to me before.

216
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,040
Did she teach you this?

217
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,250
Of course not.

218
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,220
I feel guilty.

219
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,870
I rarely have time

220
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,370
to be with you, Mother.

221
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,580
I even missed your birthday

222
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,610
while I was in Beizhou.

223
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,630
Now, when Lord Zhennan's family

224
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,010
is celebrating,

225
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:33,010
I'm too busy

226
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,340
with military duties

227
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,890
to join you.

228
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,220
If you truly feel this way,

229
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,370
then fine.

230
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,350
But recently,

231
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,890
you've been extra attentive,

232
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,750
serving me and bringing me tea

233
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,820
like a child.

234
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,150
Are you not afraid

235
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,160
that I might spit out
the tea you serve me?

236
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,000
You won't.

237
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,750
Are you so uneasy

238
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,010
about Liu Miantang?

239
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,320
If she knows her place,

240
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,340
I'll naturally care for her

241
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,610
as my daughter-in-law.

242
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,280
Could you care for her

243
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,580
just a bit more, Mother?

244
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:10,970
What do you mean?

245
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,550
I mean,

246
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,820
could you care for her

247
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,220
just a bit more?

248
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,610
Don't even think about it.

249
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,220
This is a family heirloom.

250
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:27,720
But it's also the heirloom

251
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,560
for the future princesses, isn't it?

252
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,580
We've already signed the marriage certificate.

253
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,580
Once the six rites are completed,

254
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,490
I shall give it to her.

255
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,870
Mother.

256
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,180
There's no need to say more.

257
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,520
Back then,

258
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,710
your grandmother

259
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,700
didn't give me the token

260
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,890
until I entered the bridal chamber.

261
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,280
I was

262
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,890
the legitimate daughter of the Count,

263
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,490
yet she is only a princess.

264
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:57,940
How could she break the rules?

265
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,060
In that case,

266
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,370
I'll just have to stay a few more days

267
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,220
and complete the marriage ceremony.

268
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,850
What did you say?

269
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,480
Mother, you need

270
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,130
to follow the rules, then.

271
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,300
I understand

272
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,420
that it's not your fault.

273
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,870
I can only blame myself

274
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:14,720
for being so suspicious.

275
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,870
I must see her having this token

276
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:16,850
before I can set my mind at ease

277
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,250
and go to battle.

278
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,970
If I don't,

279
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,350
I'll be guilty

280
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,190
of delaying

281
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,770
military orders.

282
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:25,940
So I'll bear that responsibility.

283
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,890
Where are you going?

284
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,520
I'm going to issue an order

285
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,470
to delay my departure.

286
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,470
No, you're not.

287
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,310
I shall

288
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,220
give it to her.

289
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:47,550
Thank you,

290
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,820
Mother.

291
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,060
And thanks to the Great Deities

292
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,730
for their blessing.

293
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,280
Mother,

294
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,730
I am determined

295
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,940
to return safely.

296
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,610
I just sent Madam Wang away.

297
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,340
Mother has brought you an instructor,

298
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,970
so I had to come and check on you.

299
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,250
But you look good.

300
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,250
It doesn't seem like you had a hard time.

301
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,920
It's only been a day and a night.

302
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,060
What are you talking about?

303
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:48,970
Move aside. I need to study.

304
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,730
Study what?

305
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,720
Madam Wang's lessons are just about scaring you

306
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,220
with the power of those noble families.

307
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,060
There's no harm in learning.

308
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,300
At the very least, I won't call someone
by the wrong name and offend them.

309
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:00,750
Do you know

310
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:03,100
how many cousins you have in Zhenzhou,

311
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,730
according to these family relations?

312
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,680
One hundred and forty-seven.

313
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,130
No. They're all distant relatives.

314
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,220
But they're sure to mention it.

315
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,670
What will you do

316
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,220
if a cousin comes to greet you happily,

317
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,220
and you can't remember his name?

318
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,490
I'd just ask his name directly.

319
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,340
Then I'd follow up by saying,

320
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,770
"Of course, I know your name.

321
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,700
I'm asking

322
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,970
to make it seem more intimate."

323
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,100
Cunning.

324
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,890
That's called wisdom.

325
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,510
As long as I don't

326
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,420
have over a hundred female cousins.

327
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,890
I want to discuss something with you.

328
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,100
This battle

329
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,720
will be far more treacherous

330
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,560
than the letters suggest.

331
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,040
There will be many undercurrents.

332
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,960
- So?
- So this time,

333
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,840
my military dispensary

334
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,130
will be larger than last time.

335
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:55,230
I'll organize a women's battalion

336
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,540
to follow the vanguard.

337
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:57,920
If we win, we'll cook soup.

338
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,010
If we lose, we'll go back to the front.

339
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,560
We can sing

340
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,850
The Magpie Bridge Immortal
on the battlefield.

341
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,750
"If love between both lasts for aye..."

342
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,940
Liu Miantang.

343
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,730
These are things you don't want,

344
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,770
and neither do I.

345
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,460
I will stay in Zhenzhou.

346
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:19,890
I know

347
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,940
what you are about to say.

348
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,890
The uprising in Dongzhou
happened swiftly

349
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,650
and is near Huizhou.

350
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,580
You're not wrong, honey.

351
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,250
With the Lord of Zhenzhou
leading the troops away,

352
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:34,460
villains will take the chance to cause trouble.

353
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:36,680
I am your Princess of Huaiyang.

354
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,010
I will stay here

355
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,490
and defend Zhenzhou in your stead.

356
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,580
I know that your informants

357
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,080
are everywhere

358
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,890
in the six surrounding counties,

359
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,510
and nothing

360
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,220
escapes your notice.

361
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,130
- You flatter me.
- But,

362
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,370
no matter how far your eyes can see,

363
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,580
when watching over Zhenzhou,

364
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,730
you must also take care of yourself.

365
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,940
Come home safe.

366
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,000
I will.

367
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:45,340
(Zhenzhou)

368
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,070
My Lord,

369
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,060
the troops are ready,

370
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,130
awaiting your command.

371
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,310
Soldiers, heed my command.

372
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,210
At your service.

373
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,060
- March.
- Aye.

374
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:35,660
(Zhenzhou)

375
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,150
Lord Zhao,

376
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,340
Prince Lu has rebelled.

377
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,790
My Lord has been ordered

378
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,100
to suppress the rebellion

379
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,690
and sent me to inform you.

380
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:57,680
Very well.

381
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,740
Is there any news from Zhenzhou?

382
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,450
Prince Lu has rebelled,

383
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,580
and Lord Huaiyang has
been ordered to lead the troops.

384
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,130
What are you worrying about?

385
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,850
I'm worried that the string might go loose,

386
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,200
and the porcelain will shatter.

387
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,100
Don't worry.

388
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:28,310
With me, the hereditary
Grain Supervisor of Zhenzhou,

389
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,150
nothing will break.

390
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,690
Are you going to war?

391
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:38,630
Finally,

392
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:41,300
you're saying something sweet to me.

393
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,850
So,

394
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:48,370
are you going?

395
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,390
No.

396
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,210
Besides,

397
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,960
if I did go,

398
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,020
and the porcelain broke,

399
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,710
wouldn't I be extorted

400
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:59,990
by a certain long-faced shopkeeper?

401
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,600
Stop joking.

402
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,690
Who would hold you responsible?

403
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,060
Wait.

404
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,260
What do you mean

405
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,960
- by long-faced?
- I can find you a mirror

406
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,060
so you can see for yourself.

407
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:15,900
(Ceremonial Rites)

408
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:26,550
Consort Dowager.

409
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,150
On your knees.

410
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,850
Aren't you going to ask

411
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,210
why I'm making you kneel?

412
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,850
You are my future mother-in-law.

413
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,370
It is only right

414
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:56,880
that a mother teaches her children the rules.

415
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,210
I accept with sincerity.

416
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,680
From now on,

417
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,210
you are a part of the mansion.

418
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,690
So remark my words today.

419
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,120
This is the heirloom

420
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,540
of the Mansion of Lord Huaiyang.

421
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,300
Every Princess of Huaiyang has worn it.

422
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,840
Many noble ladies

423
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,930
have longed for it in vain.

424
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:31,630
Today,

425
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,370
I am passing it to you.

426
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,150
Mother.

427
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,300
It's too early to call me that.

428
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,020
Thank you, Consort Dowager.

429
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,500
Since you are about
to marry into the Cui family,

430
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,340
you should broaden your horizons.

431
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:49,890
Open it and have a look.

432
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,340
But don't be too surprised.

433
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,520
How is it?

434
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,850
This hairpin may look

435
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,850
simple.

436
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,540
It's an ancient piece of jewelry.

437
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,260
Your vision

438
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,340
is still too narrow.

439
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,210
Moyao,

440
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:19,930
close the door

441
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,450
and put out the candles.

442
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,480
Yes, ma'am.

443
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,230
Now you understand

444
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:42,170
what it means to be an heirloom, don't you?

445
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,740
A night-glowing pearl hairpin?

446
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,130
I didn't expect

447
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,650
the Consort Dowager

448
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,850
to give it away so easily.

449
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,130
I told you we should go today,

450
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,120
but you insisted on taking things slowly.

451
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,300
What were you thinking?

452
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,760
No.

453
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,650
It must have been my cousin

454
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,500
who pressured Aunt to give it to her.

455
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,020
I rarely

456
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,300
get to see that hairpin.

457
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,780
That little wretch got it for nothing.

458
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:18,780
Could it be that I was too greedy?

459
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,240
Binglan,

460
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:25,260
all of this should have been yours.

461
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,550
I've worked hard

462
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,890
to raise you,

463
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,720
teaching you

464
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,840
and instructing you

465
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,740
as befits a Princess.

466
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,310
Why should a mistress come in

467
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,980
and take away your future?

468
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,650
But now that things are set,

469
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,890
what could I do?

470
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,820
Weren't you going to discuss war strategies?

471
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,340
Why did you bring me here?

472
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:58,850
I heard from the Empress

473
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:00,710
that His Majesty has lost his appetite

474
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,580
due to the rebellion of Prince Lu in Dongzhou.

475
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:05,170
As your father-in-law,

476
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,980
I am deeply concerned.

477
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,230
So...

478
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,300
So

479
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,610
you took me here for a walk.

480
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,720
No.

481
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,500
How could I dare

482
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,260
waste Your Majesty's time?

483
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,890
Where is that music coming from?

484
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:47,980
(Tranquil Flow)

485
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,740
This... this girl...

486
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,450
Your Majesty, please don't be angry.

487
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,100
This is my fourth daughter, Xuelu.

488
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,170
I apologize

489
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,340
for disturbing you, Your Majesty.

490
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,930
Be careful with that.

491
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,300
Lift it higher.

492
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,980
Your Highness,

493
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,060
everything has been moved in.

494
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,260
Xuelu greets the Empress.

495
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,060
You sure have a taste for delicacies.

496
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,880
The Deer Calls cakes we used to make at home

497
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,170
never made it to your courtyard.

498
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,500
If you miss that taste,

499
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,930
I shall often make them for you from now on.

500
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,170
How long do you plan

501
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,540
to stay in the palace with me?

502
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,060
Let me make arrangements.

503
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:55,240
I only know that both His Majesty

504
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,310
and Father were very happy today.

505
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:57,840
I mentioned that I missed my sister

506
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,060
and wanted to visit the Imperial Garden
and Baojun Garden,

507
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,750
and His Majesty agreed.

508
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,820
There's no set time limit.

509
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,230
Father said

510
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,750
that since I'm visiting my sister,

511
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,890
I can stay as long as I want.

512
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,100
Actually,

513
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,210
there's no need to go out.

514
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:19,100
This Chonghua Palace

515
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,540
was very quiet before.

516
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,340
With my help,

517
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,070
His Majesty will visit more often,

518
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:27,300
and it will be livelier.

519
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,780
How is it?

520
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,540
It truly is a rare treasure.

521
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,340
But there's a hint of an herbal scent.

522
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,980
An herbal scent?

523
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,070
If I'm not mistaken,

524
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,240
you rushed back

525
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,130
this time

526
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,880
to bring your new porcelain

527
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,820
to participate in the imperial selection,
didn't you?

528
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,990
This year is unlike any other.

529
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:03,340
Thing are different.

530
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,920
The porcelain merchants in Lingquan Town

531
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,340
are all preparing urgently.

532
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,710
I'm not intended

533
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:10,740
to compete with them.

534
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,450
I'm participating in the selection

535
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,820
just to earn my father's recognition.

536
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,590
If I can gain his approval

537
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:17,980
from the bottom of his heart,

538
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:20,340
it will all be worth it.

539
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,690
What if I told you

540
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,410
that the He family is sure to lose this time?

541
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,410
I know that His Majesty dislikes

542
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,880
the intricate and elaborate designs

543
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,060
of Lingquan's celadon.

544
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,920
The replacement of imperial tribute items

545
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,260
is only a matter of time.

546
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,280
Moreover,

547
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,720
officials from the Ministry of Revenue have

548
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,070
already arrived in Lingquan Town,

549
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,500
which is quite telling.

550
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,200
If Lingquan's celadon

551
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,780
loses its status as an imperial tribute,

552
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,820
the He family's generational foundation

553
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,410
as royal merchants will be shaken.

554
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,200
Fortunately,

555
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,640
I have

556
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,880
some black-bodied celadon
that can be presented for selection.

557
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:03,170
These are the fruits of your hard work.

558
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:04,850
Are you willing

559
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,300
to give them up so easily?

560
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,260
I'm part of the He family anyway.

561
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,710
I can't compete with them

562
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:12,650
during such a critical time,

563
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,460
especially when the trade guild is in crisis.

564
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,990
Your willingness to put aside past grievances

565
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:18,200
and help your father and brothers

566
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,850
out of loyalty is truly touching,

567
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:21,650
even to an outsider like me.

568
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,840
But do you think they will

569
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,890
appreciate your kindness?

570
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,680
In the past,

571
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,100
they took your efforts for granted,

572
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,850
belittling you because you're a woman.

573
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,820
If this time brings about a change,

574
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:41,370
it might not be a bad thing.

575
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:45,400
But if they remain unrepentant

576
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,690
and even become more excessive,

577
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,720
I hope

578
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,020
you'll think more about yourself.

579
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,980
As a woman,

580
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:53,980
it's crucial to rely

581
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,890
on what you own

582
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,500
for your well-being.

583
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,020
Lord Jiang,

584
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:08,610
you've traveled a long way

585
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,410
on behalf of the Ministry of Revenue

586
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,170
to oversee the imperial tribute selection.

587
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:16,370
It must have been quite exhausting.

588
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,270
Allow me to offer you a toast.

589
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,840
Come, let's toast to Lord Jiang.

590
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,840
A toast to Lord Jiang.

591
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,060
- Lord Jiang.
- Mr. He.

592
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:23,070
Drink up.

593
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,760
I know

594
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,170
what you're going to ask.

595
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,690
It's just

596
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:33,680
I feel sorry

597
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,520
for Lingquan's celadon.

598
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,980
I'm afraid there's no hope

599
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,020
for it being selected

600
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,580
as the imperial tribute this year.

601
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,750
Without being selected,

602
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,780
business will be tough in the future.

603
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:47,960
Lord Jiang,

604
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,230
what do you mean?

605
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,220
The He's porcelain has always

606
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:54,170
been the first choice for imperial tribute.

607
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,980
Times have changed.

608
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,210
His Majesty now favors simplicity

609
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,210
and detests ornate celadon.

610
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,760
He has grown to despise

611
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,990
anything that's overly luxurious
or ostentatious.

612
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,410
The pieces in the palace

613
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,210
have already been put away.

614
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,390
That…

615
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,820
that can't be right.

616
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,680
Then,

617
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:19,060
what kind of things does His Majesty prefer?

618
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:23,340
He prefers items that are simple and serene.

619
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,070
However,

620
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,210
the items used in the palace

621
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,270
must still possess

622
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,300
an elegant and dignified charm.

623
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:33,060
It's quite a dilemma for me as well.

624
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,120
This year's porcelain selection

625
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,580
is likely to be a difficult one.

626
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,060
Not just for your kilns,

627
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,750
but for those

628
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:42,580
from other regions as well.

629
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,200
Well,

630
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,590
it's...

631
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,760
This is...

632
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,710
What are we going to do?

633
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:50,710
This shall be a big problem.

634
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:52,130
Lord Jiang, it's been a long time.

635
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,470
He Zhen

636
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:54,650
greets you.

637
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,060
Greetings, Miss He.

638
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:58,350
Zhen,

639
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,690
why are you here?

640
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,440
You…

641
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,820
I just returned from the kiln.

642
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,720
The black-bodied celadon from the new kiln

643
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,650
is finished.

644
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,990
I hurried back to town

645
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:10,370
to show it to Lord Jiang.

646
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:13,170
Black-bodied celadon.

647
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,820
Wonderful.

648
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,500
Absolutely wonderful.

649
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,440
Great.

650
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,500
There's hope now.

651
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,370
Indeed.

652
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:49,860
(Mansion of Lord Zhennan)

653
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,240
My Lord.

654
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,480
My Lord,

655
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:57,820
you've finally returned.

656
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,360
I've just returned to Zhenzhou

657
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,200
and must see my mother.

658
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,060
I'm not seeing guests.

659
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:02,350
My Lord,

660
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,300
are you still angry?

661
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:08,890
Angry? About what?

662
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,160
My worthless sister,

663
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,340
that runaway bride He Zhen,

664
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:13,680
has returned

665
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,650
as if nothing happened.

666
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,500
It's utterly disgraceful.

667
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:17,590
She's back?

668
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:19,590
Where is she?

669
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:20,650
At home.

670
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,060
It was entirely her idea
to run away from the marriage.

671
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,550
Now that she's back,

672
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,130
she must be punished properly.

673
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:30,350
Lead the way.

674
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:39,500
The ash glaze has a warm luster.

675
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,130
It gives

676
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:44,020
a rustic elegance.

677
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,120
Each piece here

678
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,450
represents the He family's
finest craftsmanship.

679
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,350
Zhen.

680
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,200
Father.

681
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,100
I shall forgive you

682
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,580
for leaving without a word this time.

683
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:59,780
Though it was a minor matter,

684
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:02,580
how could the Lord tolerate such insolence

685
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,740
as fleeing from a marriage?

686
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,850
- My Lord.
- My Lord.

687
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,340
Your brother

688
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,340
was shouting outside my residence,

689
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,640
so I had no choice but to come.

690
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:28,840
You don't blame me, do you?

691
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,680
Mr. He,

692
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,450
about the engagement your son mentioned,

693
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:38,060
you should be well aware

694
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,300
of how disgraceful that was.

695
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:42,410
Miss He

696
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,340
is as pure

697
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:46,820
as these porcelain pieces

698
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,260
she crafts,

699
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,360
genuine and sincere.

700
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:53,980
Let me tell you both.

701
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:55,690
Among these porcelains,

702
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,820
some were shaped by my own hands.

703
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,930
Miss He is the shopkeeper,

704
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,680
and I have witnessed

705
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,980
her dedication to the craft.

706
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:06,690
I respect her deeply.

707
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:08,980
Now, as for your He family,

708
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,310
you take her porcelain

709
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:12,600
to compete for imperial selection

710
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,100
while looking down on her.

711
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,980
You even use the engagement

712
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:20,370
as a bargaining chip against her.

713
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,580
Your family

714
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,690
owes her an apology.

715
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:31,070
This...

716
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,150
This...

717
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,680
- I'm going to faint again.
- Father, father.

718
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,690
Not again.

719
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,450
Wasn't I impressive?

720
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,510
Your worker can not only labor

721
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,580
but also protect you.

722
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,300
What are you thinking?

723
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,020
None of these pieces

724
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,890
were shaped by you.

725
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:52,160
Well, even without the credit,

726
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,060
I've at least put in the effort.

727
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:57,370
I've been by your side all along.

728
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:06,820
(He Mansion)

729
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:17,210
If your father and brothers
cause any more trouble,

730
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,210
I'll come back tomorrow

731
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:20,770
and give them another lesson.

732
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,060
You should head back now.

733
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,430
Good day.

734
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,760
All right.

735
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:31,990
Quan.

736
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:33,940
Mother?

737
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,460
I was just about to go find...

738
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:38,110
- You rascal.
- Ouch.

739
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,500
I heard you went to Beizhou,

740
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,400
but when you returned,
you came straight to Lingquan Town.

741
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,380
There's someone here.

742
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,940
And this is...?

743
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,580
Greetings, Madam.

744
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,100
I'm He Zhen,

745
00:34:55,990 --> 00:34:57,460
and I admire your son greatly.

746
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,420
(Tavern in the West of the City)

747
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,500
(Draft)

748
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:20,980
You should understand

749
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,810
what this means.

750
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,170
Madam, you misunderstand.

751
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,420
Rest assured,

752
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,060
the Lord and I

753
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,580
haven't reached that point yet.

754
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,690
Then hurry up and get to that point.

755
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,330
Don't hesitate any longer.

756
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,990
Take the money and prepare your dowry.

757
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,380
If it's not enough,

758
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,980
come to me for more.

759
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,860
But I have brought shame

760
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,980
to you

761
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:46,020
and your family before.

762
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,770
Quan has told me

763
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,330
about the He family's situation

764
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,330
and your experiences in recent years.

765
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,860
How could such a good young lady

766
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:05,210
be mistreated at home?

767
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:08,100
I must say, running away
from that marriage was the right decision.

768
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,210
Furthermore,

769
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,330
as for the imperial selection,

770
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,420
if you need any help,

771
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,060
just let me know.

772
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,770
Our family will support you.

773
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,170
Madam, I deeply appreciate

774
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:25,860
your kindness.

775
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:28,690
However,

776
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,580
a woman must learn

777
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,610
to stand on her own in this world

778
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,860
and handle matters herself.

779
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,940
Good girl.

780
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,460
As you wish.

781
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:03,540
Mother said

782
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:05,500
that after the selection is over,

783
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,060
she will come to your home to propose.

784
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,540
Did I agree to that?

785
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,580
You must agree.

786
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,330
- Or I'll...
- Or you'll

787
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:17,980
follow Lord Huaiyang's example
and go off to war

788
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,130
and call it off, right?

789
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,170
How do you know
what I'm about to say?

790
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,190
You're just planning

791
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,400
to pack up and leave,

792
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,500
determined to cling to me, right?

793
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,940
I didn't pay you wages,

794
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,170
so now you want me to marry you in return?

795
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,460
I hadn't thought of that.

796
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:36,860
That's a good idea.

797
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,130
You're truly a brilliant shopkeeper.

798
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,600
Excellent.

799
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,960
My lord, as you instructed,

800
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,230
I've sent all three ballista blueprints

801
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:54,990
to the Western Camp.

802
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:55,830
Good.

803
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,640
And the rest?

804
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,360
The rest?

805
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,060
The family letters I gave you

806
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,120
earlier today.

807
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:06,980
Earlier?

808
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,600
Yes.

809
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,720
Yesterday's and the day before's letters

810
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,210
were all sent back by the Shadow Guards.

811
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,610
The family letter

812
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,650
I gave you

813
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,130
earlier today.

814
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,800
I...

815
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,440
I didn't know there was a family letter in it.

816
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,860
I sent it to the military camp.

817
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:28,770
This ballista has 36 intricate mechanisms.

818
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:30,020
Do you remember them all?

819
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,600
Yes.

820
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:33,470
Good.

821
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:34,540
Let's look at the next one.

822
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:38,580
(From Xingzhou)

823
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,770
Lord Huaiyang used his name on this.

824
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,330
It must be extremely confidential.

825
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:53,420
To my beloved wife...

826
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,760
Huang Gui.

827
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,330
- My Lord.
- Yes, my Lord.

828
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:59,170
You were loud.

829
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,810
I could hear everything from outside.

830
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:03,580
My apologies.

831
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:05,730
You're meticulous, my Lord.

832
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:07,170
I admire your foresight.

833
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,960
But what is this

834
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,540
ingenious strategy in your letter?

835
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:12,420
Forget about strategies for now.

836
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:17,130
In such a setting,

837
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:20,170
you opened this secret letter

838
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,550
like that in public.

839
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:23,390
Was that appropriate?

840
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,650
It was not.

841
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,290
All warfare is based on deception.

842
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,730
This was a test for you.

843
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:33,110
Do you really think it's inappropriate?

844
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:34,280
With such a mindset,

845
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,860
how will you lead troops into battle?

846
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:37,470
You're too careless.

847
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,100
It's...

848
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,420
Were we loud?

849
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,770
Not really.

850
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,310
No.

851
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,580
To my beloved wife.

852
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,580
One day seems longer than months three.

853
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:58,900
One day seems long as seasons three.

854
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:01,980
One day seems longer than years three.

855
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:05,020
Such affected writing.

856
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,210
Since I didn't leave you
a calligraphy sample,

857
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:11,420
let this letter serve as one.

858
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:16,580
Please copy this To Gather Vine poem

859
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,380
ten times.

860
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,770
I will check upon my return.

861
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,460
This Cui Xingzhou...

862
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:25,390
Madam,

863
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,200
Madam.

864
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,370
The Consort Dowager has arrived.

865
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:29,430
All right.

866
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,280
Consort Dowager.

867
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:43,900
This is...

868
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,110
The birthday of Lord Zhennan's mother
is coming,

869
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:48,720
and they invited the noble ladies of Zhenzhou

870
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,500
to a banquet.

871
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,280
The head seamstress at our mansion

872
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,810
made a few new styles.

873
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:55,460
I brought them for you to try on.

874
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,800
Thank you for your kindness, Consort Dowager.

875
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,370
His Lordship just sent me many clothes,

876
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:00,960
and I haven't had the chance to wear them yet.

877
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,240
What would

878
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,130
a man know?

879
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:05,070
We noblewomen

880
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:06,770
don't compete in clothing

881
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,380
but in dignity.

882
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:13,020
Please rest assured.

883
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:14,540
At the Mansion of Lord Zhennan,

884
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:15,590
I won't let you

885
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:17,290
lose face or dignity.

886
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,610
Why are you all standing there?

887
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,730
Hurry and help the Princess change.

888
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,230
Now?

889
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:25,070
Please, my lady.

890
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:26,430
Fangxie.

891
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:45,100
Does this need to come off too?

892
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,920
Loosen the waist a bit.

893
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:49,880
More.

894
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,210

I loved this color.
