14
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,660
Fresh crabs for sale.

15
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,350
We've almost finished shopping.

16
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,500
Big crabs, freshly caught.

17
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,020
- Take a look.
- Wait a moment.

18
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,580
Big crabs.

19
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,240
The autumn crabs

20
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,780
are quite plump now.

21
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,310
Sir, Madam,

22
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,890
do you want fish or crabs?

23
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,890
You must be craving my crab roe rice.

24
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,380
I'll cook tomorrow.

25
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,040
Honey, you're trying hard

26
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,180
to make me happy,

27
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,970
so I must

28
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,130
return the favor.

29
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,460
- I'd like a basket of crabs.
- All right.

30
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,220
These crabs were just caught.

31
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,200
I want that one, the big one.

32
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,040
Sure.

33
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,240
- And this one too.
- Freshly caught.

34
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,780
- See how lively they are.
- Thank you.

35
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,010
Prince Sui's Sanjin Camp is moving.

36
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,550
They'll reach Qingfeng Town

37
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,100
by the Mid-Autumn Festival.

38
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,620
Troops are relaxed during the festival.

39
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,620
If Qingfeng Town is attacked,

40
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,290
the capital will lose its buffer zone.

41
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,220
It might fall completely.

42
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,520
Prince Sui has finally made his move,

43
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,900
starting a rebellion.

44
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,870
I suspect he's planned this

45
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,290
since we went to the capital

46
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,780
to investigate the chief instructor.

47
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,180
Mid-Autumn Festival...

48
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,940
Prince Sui is such a nuisance.

49
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,460
Can't he let us enjoy the festival in peace?

50
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,470
I rushed here from miles away,

51
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,430
and you're hiding here

52
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,460
whispering?

53
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,530
Zhen, what brings you here?

54
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,520
We wanted to celebrate

55
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,980
the Mid-Autumn Festival with you, Miantang.

56
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,320
You came at the perfect time.

57
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,530
It wouldn't be lively without you.

58
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,710
Delicious food.

59
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,500
Let's have a drink together.

60
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,520
The capital's roast duck

61
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,660
truly is the best.

62
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,360
Someone

63
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,130
promised to cook today,

64
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,480
but as soon as friends arrived,

65
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,530
he abandoned his post.

66
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,840
Maybe he's afraid

67
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,010
his cooking skills aren't up to par?

68
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,130
He was going to cook?

69
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,730
Lord Huaiyang,

70
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,940
aiming to be a kept husband?

71
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,390
Why aren't you home celebrating

72
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,430
with your mother?

73
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,100
Why come here to join the fun

74
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,410
and make me cook?

75
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,290
Our Zhen's Porcelain

76
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,880
is now the imperial kiln,

77
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,020
chosen by the court.

78
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,340
We must seize this opportunity.

79
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:21,000
We've contacted the capital's

80
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,350
largest porcelain shop

81
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,230
and brought in

82
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,730
new designs.

83
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,340
We're waiting for the Mid-Autumn Festival

84
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,900
to make our mark.

85
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,110
Look,

86
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,320
it's Mid-Autumn Festival again.

87
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,290
We can't miss this chance.

88
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,800
During the Mid-Autumn Festival,

89
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,390
the more people, the livelier the market.

90
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,260
It's good for business.

91
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,660
You seem to forget,

92
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,240
my husband used to run

93
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,230
a failing porcelain business.

94
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,900
He knows nothing about business.

95
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,270
I forgot.

96
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,900
My poor memories.

97
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,900
What's this, honey?

98
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,410
We have friends visiting from afar.

99
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,530
Tonight, we should relax

100
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,140
and forget about the troubling court affairs.

101
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,230
It's in.

102
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:13,800
I got it in.

103
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,640
It went in.

104
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:20,900
Go.

105
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,780
- Lord Huaiyang is good.
- Not bad.

106
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,970
Aim.

107
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,290
A steady mind leads to a straight shot.

108
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,960
So close.

109
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,080
Aim for the mouth of the pot.

110
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,120
Easy, easy.

111
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,020
Get ready.

112
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:38,990
Go.

113
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,640
Not bad.

114
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,480
Your turn.

115
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:45,750
Go.

116
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,900
Hey, no cheating.

117
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,680
I'm not playing with them anymore.

118
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,800
Then teach me the correct posture.

119
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,570
- Honey.
- Let me show you.

120
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,710
- Like this.
- Do you know

121
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,050
what our opponent fears most now?

122
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,700
What do they fear?

123
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,850
Unexpected complications.

124
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,260
He seems

125
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,610
to have everything going his way,

126
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,780
but if he makes one wrong move

127
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,730
at a crucial moment,

128
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,020
the next steps won't follow,

129
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,410
the rhythm and arrangement

130
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,820
will be disrupted,

131
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,340
and all his efforts will be wasted.

132
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,780
He won't get what he wants.

133
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,850
Who are you referring to

134
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,700
when you say "unexpected complications,"

135
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,410
honey?

136
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,370
The situation is worsening.

137
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,970
There are few capable officials in the court.

138
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,200
Even the Three Bureaus

139
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,100
can no longer keep Prince Sui in check.

140
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,290
If it comes to it,

141
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,930
I'm willing to risk my life.

142
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,580
But the Empress cannot be put in danger.

143
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,370
What are your plans then,

144
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,580
Your Majesty?

145
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,930
In two days,

146
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,350
I'll send the Empress

147
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,100
to Yiqing Temple for prayers and meditation.

148
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:03,820
I want you

149
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,050
to take my letter

150
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,020
and escort her safely

151
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,840
to Xizhou...

152
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:18,430
Your Majesty,

153
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,170
a message from Chonghua Palace.

154
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,100
I don't have time to go there.

155
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:23,850
It's not to the palace.

156
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,120
The Empress wants to have a drink with you

157
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,220
in the Imperial Garden.

158
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,850
Is Your Majesty's bold move

159
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,930
meant to exclude me?

160
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,970
It seems so.

161
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:58,340
You've been avoiding me lately,

162
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,880
yet you sent Eunuch Fu to tell me

163
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,410
I'm going to Yiqing Temple for prayers.

164
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,490
Do you think

165
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,900
I'm afraid of death,

166
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,930
after all we've been through together?

167
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,780
- Xueji...
- I'm willing to cooperate.

168
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:21,580
Just like when you helped me,

169
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,680
rescuing me from the Shi family.

170
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,530
You've had too much to drink.

171
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,280
Indeed.

172
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,490
The Empress and I are merely using each other.

173
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,580
There's no need to go this far.

174
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,420
- My Lord...
- I am the Emperor.

175
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,010
I chose you as Empress

176
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:49,180
only because you obey me without question.

177
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:57,010
I have no feelings for you.

178
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,220
I don't need you

179
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,250
to display any deep affection here.

180
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,300
Your only duty

181
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,080
is to fulfill your role as Empress

182
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,370
and obey my orders.

183
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:14,700
Don't make me repeat myself.

184
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,300
My Lord.

185
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,160
We received some fresh fruit,

186
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,000
and I remembered

187
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,610
your favorite drink.

188
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,130
I followed the recipe

189
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:42,820
and prepared some fruit-infused beverages.

190
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,240
And everyone in the mansion

191
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,220
came asking for some.

192
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,730
You are so thoughtful.

193
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,100
Your Highness.

194
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,430
Princess of Huaiyang.

195
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,360
Isn't this the birthday gift

196
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,850
Your Highness gave to Consort Xian?

197
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,460
Why is it back?

198
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,230
Consort Xian is grateful for the gift,

199
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,800
but she finds the fragrance of the incense

200
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,400
to be headache-inducing.

201
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,850
She's unable to enjoy it,

202
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,080
so she sent me

203
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,770
to return it to Your Highness.

204
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,760
Fine.

205
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,920
If Consort Xian didn't like it,

206
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,180
I can't impose on her.

207
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,340
I wonder what gift

208
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,010
would delight her.

209
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,840
Consort Xian has recently taken a liking

210
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,220
to various types of hairpins.

211
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,320
If Your Highness could bestow upon her

212
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,580
a set of red hairpins,

213
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:30,200
Consort Xian would be deeply grateful.

214
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,040
How dare you.

215
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,970
Those red hairpins are extremely valuable.

216
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,890
There's only one set in the palace.

217
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,040
How dare you, a mere maid,

218
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,540
speak so boldly?

219
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,000
I am simply conveying

220
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,320
Consort Xian's preferences.

221
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,400
Whether Your Highness chooses

222
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,130
to bestow the gift is entirely up to you.

223
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,580
Your Highness,

224
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,490
a gift must touch the heart
to be truly appreciated.

225
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,830
Why not grant

226
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,460
Consort Xian her wish?

227
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:10,940
(Virtuous and Disciplined)

228
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,800
Your Majesty.

229
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,800
Didn't I send someone to tell you?

230
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,080
I'm swamped

231
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,200
with memorials today,

232
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,220
no time to accompany you.

233
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,650
It's my birthday.

234
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,340
Even if you're busy with state affairs

235
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,700
and can't come to Jingyang Palace,

236
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,420
now that I'm here,

237
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,710
can't you just spare a glance

238
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:40,610
at me?

239
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:45,670
Your Majesty,

240
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,120
please dine with me

241
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,490
before attending to the affairs.

242
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,610
I haven't even had my birthday noodles yet.

243
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:52,850
Can you dress up like this

244
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,120
just because

245
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,580
it's your birthday?

246
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,490
I recall you praising

247
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,010
my elaborate hairstyle and hairpins,

248
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,350
so...

249
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,460
Is the golden hairpin set

250
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,510
something you're allowed to wear

251
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,420
with your rank?

252
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,510
The Empress

253
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,840
bestowed them upon me.

254
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,010
The Empress gave them to you,

255
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,590
so you can wear them every day

256
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,370
and flaunt your status in the palace?

257
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,350
Fu Yushen.

258
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,060
Consort Xian,

259
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,420
please remove them.

260
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,940
It's my birthday today.

261
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,610
No matter the occasion,

262
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,120
you cannot overstep

263
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,370
the Empress's protocol.

264
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,230
After all,

265
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,850
Qi has only one Empress.

266
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,220
Is that so?

267
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,440
Then what about

268
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,440
all the affection

269
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,490
you showed me before?

270
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,820
Take them off.

271
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,160
Your Highness.

272
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,610
News from the palace,

273
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,730
Consort Xian has fallen out of favor.

274
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,540
She's completely heartbroken now.

275
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,220
Why not seize this opportunity

276
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:14,600
to ask her

277
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,060
to help us?

278
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:18,180
It would increase our chances of success.

279
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,010
Yun'er is blinded by love,

280
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,540
repeatedly acting recklessly.

281
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,460
There's no telling what she might do.

282
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,420
She's no longer of use.

283
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,820
I only hope she can behave herself

284
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:34,420
and not ruin my plans.

285
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,160
Yes, Your Highness.

286
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,060
You have beautiful skin.

287
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,960
It makes this hairpin

288
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,370
shine even brighter.

289
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,000
Your Highness.

290
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,200
Madam,

291
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,800
please take your time.

292
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,280
I'll leave you be.

293
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,890
Excuse me.

294
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,100
All right.

295
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,260
Your Highness, Consort Xian
was turned away by His Lordship.

296
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:32,740
(Prince Sui's Mansion)

297
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,400
- Take care.
- Thank you.

298
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,820
Is Consort Xian allowed to enter?

299
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,070
Please return. His Highness said

300
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,450
today isn't a day for family visits.

301
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,690
Consort Xian is...

302
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,450
Young lady.

303
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,890
Are you the shopkeeper

304
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:58,980
of Treasure as Desired?

305
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,550
I'd like to have a word,

306
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,740
please.

307
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,590
Your Highness.

308
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,780
Am I allowed to come home?

309
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,040
No.

310
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,550
But I just met the shopkeeper
of Treasure as Desired.

311
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,780
He gave me this box

312
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,200
and said Princess of Sui

313
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,780
chose the jewelry for you

314
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,930
and you should open it yourself.

315
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,740
It seems the Princess still cares for you.

316
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,660
(Great Fortune)

317
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,650
To witness the dragon fall from the sky...

318
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,540
Where is the shopkeeper?

319
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,820
He left.

320
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,100
If you wish to witness the dragon's fall

321
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,540
and the changing of the world,

322
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,450
you must

323
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,500
take action yourself.

324
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,600
Back to the palace.

325
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,440
Yes, Your Highness.

326
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,550
Consort Xian,

327
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,610
Empress of the kingdom.

328
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,840
- Concubine Yan sent it a few days ago.
- Consort Xian, Empress of the kingdom.

329
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,130
I'll take it away immediately.

330
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,240
- Wait.
- Consort Xian,

331
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,500
Empress of the kingdom.

332
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,410
I really

333
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:27,210
like this melody.

334
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,960
The Empress meticulously selected

335
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,960
both the music and the dishes

336
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,370
for this banquet.

337
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,720
I wouldn't dare

338
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,580
to steal the credit.

339
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:39,340
I'm grateful for Your Majesty's kindness.

340
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,450
I will diligently fulfill my duties.

341
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,260
It was no trouble at all.

342
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:46,910
Very well.

343
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:49,690
His Late Majesty often said

344
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,400
that a harmonious marriage

345
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,740
is a rare and precious gift.

346
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:57,130
Dear relatives,

347
00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:00,370
you are the important figures of Qi.

348
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:03,210
As we gather for the Mid-Autumn Festival,

349
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,120
I wish you all

350
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,500
abundance, peace,

351
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:11,020
and happy families.

352
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:21,640
Thank you, Your Highness.

353
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,500
All right.

354
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,020
Please

355
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,260
be seated.

356
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,130
The Grand Empress Dowager is right.

357
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,440
A harmonious marriage

358
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:37,730
is a precious gift.

359
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:39,980
I'm not good with words,

360
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,300
but my heartfelt wishes

361
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:44,230
are in this toast.

362
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,300
Your Majesty,

363
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,210
I wish you

364
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,690
a long

365
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,100
and peaceful reign.

366
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,450
Thank you, Consort Xian.

367
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:12,980
Empress,

368
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,610
there's no need for a grand celebration

369
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,780
for my birthday this year.

370
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,400
I will go to Yiqing Temple

371
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,500
to offer incense and pray for blessings.

372
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,930
Princess of Huaiyang,
why are you staring at me?

373
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,960
I find your elaborate accessories

374
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,600
and makeup today

375
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,930
quite appealing.

376
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:48,020
Seeing you so happy

377
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,130
makes me happy

378
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,340
genuinely.

379
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,200
Your Majesty!

380
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,510
- What's wrong?
- Brother!

381
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,030
- Your Majesty!
- Brother!

382
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:05,340
Summon the physician!

383
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,930
Quickly, summon the physician!

384
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,710
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

385
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,300
- Your Highness!
- Summon the physician!

386
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:11,740
Summon the physician now!

387
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,160
Someone, help.

388
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,060
Silence!

389
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,540
No one who attended the banquet

390
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:24,360
may leave today.

391
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,550
I've tested all the food

392
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:26,960
with silver needles,

393
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,980
and there's no reaction.

394
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,540
As you instructed,

395
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,750
I brought back the utensils

396
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,510
used by His Majesty

397
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,780
and the Empress.

398
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,820
Your Highness,

399
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,340
may I examine them?

400
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,800
Permission granted.

401
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,260
Colored lacquer?

402
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,690
What is that?

403
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,640
Your Highness,

404
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,300
there's colored lacquer in the pot.

405
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,540
Colored lacquer flakes off when heated.

406
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,100
If the poison

407
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:11,300
was sealed within the lacquer,

408
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,850
it wouldn't be detected
during the initial inspection.

409
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,980
But once the liquor is warmed,

410
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,790
the poison would be released invisibly

411
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:21,980
in front of everyone.

412
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:24,890
I don't know.

413
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,410
I don't know.

414
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,210
You warmed and poured the liquor.

415
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,820
How dare you deny it?

416
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,710
Mercy, Your Highness.

417
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:35,160
Mercy, Your Highness.

418
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,840
Who arranged

419
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,270
today's banquet?

420
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,820
Your Highness,

421
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,030
the Empress personally supervised

422
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,340
all arrangements

423
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:45,650
for the palace banquet.

424
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:49,060
She likely appointed Head Chef Qiu

425
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,020
from the Imperial Kitchen as well.

426
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,260
The Empress herself is poisoned

427
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,600
and in danger now.

428
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,060
How could she possibly harm His Majesty?

429
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,690
You're right.

430
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,030
But this servant

431
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,500
wouldn't dare commit

432
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:04,960
such treason

433
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,740
without someone's orders.

434
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,200
Speak.

435
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:15,210
I'll confess.

436
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,410
I will.

437
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,760
I was indeed

438
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,930
instructed by someone.

439
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,370
Is that person

440
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:25,450
present now?

441
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,060
Your Highness,

442
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,930
I can't hide it any longer.

443
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,780
Years ago,

444
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:39,060
you had an affair with His Majesty

445
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,370
but failed to become Empress.

446
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,610
Driven by jealousy,

447
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,130
you sought revenge.

448
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,890
She is skilled in porcelain-making

449
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,100
and has secretly crafted a pot

450
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,980
coated with colored lacquer
containing poison.

451
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,450
Are you accusing

452
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,540
Princess of Huaiyang?

453
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,110
How dare a servant like you

454
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:05,340
frame Princess of Huaiyang?

455
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,060
Do you have any evidence?

456
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:09,410
Your Highness,

457
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,610
I know

458
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,170
I shouldn't expose you,

459
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:16,210
but poisoning His Majesty

460
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:19,410
is an unforgivable crime.

461
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,300
I can only...

462
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,820
I can only...

463
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:29,550
It's...

464
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,410
Guards.

465
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:39,780
Arrest the treacherous Liu Miantang.

466
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:40,870
Hold.

467
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,100
Princess of Huaiyang,

468
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:47,650
did you do this?

469
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,820
Your Highness,

470
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:51,650
I did not.

471
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,100
That's strange.

472
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,650
If she hadn't orchestrated this,

473
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,260
how could this servant

474
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,440
have risked her life

475
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,650
to frame her?

476
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,160
Does Consort Xian mean

477
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,160
that whoever commits suicide

478
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,540
is telling the truth?

479
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,310
Then what's the point of Qi's laws,

480
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:11,340
the Ministry of Justice,
and the Court of Judicial Review?

481
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,130
Wouldn't all those
wrongly accused prisoners

482
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,820
just need to line up

483
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,820
and jump off Xuande Gate

484
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,780
to prove their innocence?

485
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,030
Death for truth.

486
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,780
Is that how it works?

487
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,500
My point is,

488
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,500
there's no witness left to testify.

489
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,500
Physician Song has returned.

490
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,920
Your Highness.

491
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,850
Well?

492
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,990
His Majesty and the Empress

493
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:42,450
have indeed been poisoned.

494
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,340
They were likely poisoned with aconite.

495
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,550
It's a potent poison

496
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,130
that destroys the internal organs.

497
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,260
We've done everything we can,

498
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,690
but His Majesty and the Empress

499
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,070
haven't shown

500
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:57,450
any signs of improvement.

501
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,230
Now,

502
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,070
all we can do

503
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,690
is wait.

504
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,610
Physician Song,

505
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,710
the servant who poisoned them
has committed suicide.

506
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:09,590
Please examine her.

507
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:10,780
Is there any chance she's still alive?

508
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,370
Allow me to check.

509
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,850
Your Highness,

510
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,310
this criminal only fainted

511
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,750
from external injuries.

512
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:32,590
The wound

513
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,020
isn't fatal.

514
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:38,550
She confessed

515
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:40,510
that Princess of Huaiyang was behind this.

516
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,480
Testimony alone isn't enough

517
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,060
to prove the guilt.

518
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,450
Your Highness,

519
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,360
may I examine the liquor pot?

520
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,200
Permission granted.

521
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,820
It's wolf's-bane.

522
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,130
Your Highness,

523
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,890
the residue in this pot is indeed

524
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,440
the poison that afflicted

525
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,440
His Majesty and the Empress:

526
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,340
wolf's-bane.

527
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,110
Commander Zhou.

528
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,070
Please.

529
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,160
Get me some bowls of potash water.

530
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,000
Yes, sir.

531
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:18,480
The toxic powder

532
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,640
of wolf's-bane

533
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,600
is extremely fine, light,

534
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,340
and easily transferred.

535
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:24,720
Ordinary soap and water

536
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,030
can't remove it completely.

537
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:27,960
But potash water,

538
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,240
as I mentioned,

539
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,230
counteracts wolf's-bane.

540
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,470
When they react,

541
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:35,820
it will present a turmeric color.

542
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,030
This way,

543
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,310
we can easily determine

544
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:41,200
who else here

545
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,540
has touched the poison.

546
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:47,910
All right.

547
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:51,450
Everyone present today,

548
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,070
dip your hands

549
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:55,340
in the potash water.

550
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:57,200
If your fingers turn yellow,

551
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,340
you are suspected of assassinating His Majesty.

552
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,200
I'll go first.

553
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,300
Look,

554
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,820
Princess of Huaiyang is innocent.

555
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:34,890
Your Highness,

556
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:37,260
this criminal's fingers turned yellow.

557
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,650
Go on.

558
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,350
Your Highness,

559
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,980
I am innocent.

560
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,610
What are you waiting for, Consort Xian?

561
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,020
Your Highness,

562
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:15,070
this method can't prove

563
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,580
her innocence.

564
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,070
What if the mastermind

565
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,360
didn't touch the powder?

566
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,540
We're dealing with attempted regicide.

567
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:23,500
We must explore every possibility.

568
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,510
Consort Xian,

569
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,510
if you have the time

570
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,450
to cast suspicions,

571
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,450
why don't you

572
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,120
dip your hand in the water

573
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,410
and see?

574
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,820
Or

575
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,610
are you afraid?

576
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,210
Consort Xian,

577
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,690
your hands.

578
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,580
Show them.

579
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,650
Your Highness,

580
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:56,780
her fingers turned yellow.

581
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,880
Arrest her.

582
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,720
Aye.

583
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,760
It was her.

584
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,840
Arrest everyone from Jingyang Palace

585
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,690
and take them to the dungeons.

586
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:08,690
Take her to the Cold Palace.

587
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,780
His Majesty shall interrogate her personally

588
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,580
after he awakens.

589
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,800
She will be executed

590
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,020
afterward.

591
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,000
Aye.

592
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,270
Your Highness,

593
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:18,880
the Empress was too deeply poisoned

594
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,880
to recover.

595
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,720
A moment ago,

596
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,820
she passed away.

597
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:27,850
Shi Xueji is dead?

598
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,820
She's dead.

599
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,960
Take her away.

600
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,690
Shi Xueji is dead.

601
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,850
She's dead.

602
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:45,170
Shi Xueji is dead.

603
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:48,130
Shi Xueji is dead.

604
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,740
She's dead.

605
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,450
Your Majesty.

606
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,060
Your Majesty.

607
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,070
Your Majesty.

608
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:01,070
I used a golden elixir

609
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,820
to stabilize His Majesty's meridians.

610
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:05,500
But the poison has seeped deep down.

611
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,440
Whether he can pull through

612
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,980
depends on God's mercy.

613
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:13,540
Your Majesty.

614
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,080
Mother.

615
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,350
Mother.

616
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,980
What happened to His Majesty?

617
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,250
Mother.

618
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:36,580
How dare you ask?

619
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:40,860
It's all thanks to your adopted daughter.

620
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,240
Don't be angry, Mother.

621
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,960
Don't be angry, Mother.

622
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,900
Mother.

623
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:52,060
Don't be angry, Mother.

624
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,730
Don't be angry, Mother.

625
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:05,580
Your Majesty.

626
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,170
Your Majesty.

627
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:19,610
Our kingdom needs a ruler.

628
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,610
Your Majesty.

629
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:31,940
(Landownership Papers)

630
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,980
I've searched the entire capital,

631
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:38,460
only to discover the traitor is my son.

632
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,420
What a disgrace to our family.

633
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,810
How shameful.

634
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,460
Duke, where are you going?

635
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,810
I'm going to tie him up.

636
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,610
And then what?

637
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,980
Report it to the court?

638
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:09,360
My brother-in-law will be executed

639
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,190
and the Guo family be destroyed?

640
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:12,800
The reputation of your family

641
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,250
will be ruined in an instant?

642
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,440
My brother-in-law is your only son,

643
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,100
and he has no offspring.

644
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,110
Even I, as his in-law,

645
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,610
can't bear the thought.

646
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,580
Without a witness,

647
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,630
how can we expose

648
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:31,320
Prince Sui's heinous crimes

649
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,290
and restore peace to the court?

650
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:35,900
Duke,

651
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,100
His Majesty is ill
and unable to hold court today.

652
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,280
This is unprecedented.

653
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,400
I'm afraid

654
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,840
the palace is in turmoil.

655
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,320
If Prince Sui seizes this opportunity

656
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,670
to strike,

657
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:51,940
we'll have no chance

658
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:56,420
to take him down.

659
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,600
Father.

660
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,030
Father.

661
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,390
Kneel.

662
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,130
Kneel.

663
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,810
Your Highness,

664
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,190
our scouts have news.

665
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:01,510
The Sanjin Camp has reached Mount Wuling.

666
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,610
But a landslide occurred,

667
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,290
and they had to detour through Feihu Pass.

668
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:07,240
They won't reach the capital within ten days.

669
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,130
It doesn't matter.

670
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,610
Sit.

671
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,290
Thank you, Your Highness.

672
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,380
Liu Yu has been poisoned.

673
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:18,130
The Imperial Medical Institute predicts
he won't survive five days.

674
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:22,330
Regardless of Yun'er's motive
for poisoning him,

675
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,210
she...

676
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,130
she's done me

677
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:31,540
a favor anyway.

678
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,980
With Liu Yu gone,

679
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:36,130
who in Qi

680
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,240
is more qualified

681
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,730
to claim the throne than me?

682
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:50,940
What's wrong?

683
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,250
Don't you like it anymore?

684
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,460
I do.

685
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,420
I just don't know

686
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,060
when I'll get to eat it again.

687
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,810
Xingzhou,

688
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,690
I'll be with you.

689
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,290
Whether

690
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,650
we succeed or fail,

691
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,100
I'm prepared.

692
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,130
Even if

693
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,460
it's a narrow escape

694
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,650
or we'll face death,

695
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,130
as long as you want

696
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,610
the food I cook,

697
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:36,060
I'll cook for you

698
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,810
no matter what.

699
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,900
Eat up.

700
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,500
Is this how you comfort someone?

701
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:53,540
Now I lost my appetite.

702
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,540
The Cold Palace is heavily guarded.

703
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,770
But Consort Xian
had been laughing maniacally,

704
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:09,500
it's impossible to meet her privately
without attracting attention.

705
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:12,540
I thought I wouldn't be able to get any info,

706
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:13,580
but then

707
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,940
Consort Xian jumped into a well.

708
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:18,130
Is it suicide or execution?

709
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:20,280
The official story is

710
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,940
that she committed suicide out of guilt.

711
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,330
But Yanchi said

712
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:25,610
Zhou Cuo's man pushed her.

713
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:28,860
The well has been sealed off now.

714
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:30,880
So her body won't be seen in a while.

715
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,810
What a pity.

716
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,320
I initially wanted

717
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,940
to spare her life.

718
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:37,650
After Liu Yu's death,

719
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,810
she'd be posthumously honored.

720
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:39,880
She would

721
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,860
have died with dignity.

722
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,770
With this turn of events,

723
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,500
Cui Xingzhou

724
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:48,650
will sure to make a move.

725
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,580
Anything new about him?

726
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,240
He must

727
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,580
have heard some news.

728
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:55,210
Our scouts reported

729
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,810
that his aide has rushed to Zhenzhou overnight.

730
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,980
All bark and no bite.

731
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,360
With his biggest supporter gone,

732
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,860
he's at his wit's end

733
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,770
and can only go to Zhenzhou

734
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,420
for reinforcements.

735
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:15,960
- Duke Qing.
- Duke Qing.

736
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:16,800
Your Highness.

737
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,130
- You...
- Duke Qing.

738
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,640
Your Highness,

739
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:25,470
I know I've chosen
a different path than you,

740
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:26,440
but this time,

741
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,580
I'm truly desperate.

742
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,690
Please, Your Highness,

743
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,770
save my son.

744
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,580
How is His Majesty?

745
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,100
Still consciousness.

746
00:41:58,550 --> 00:41:59,890
What do the imperial physicians say?

747
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:01,770
They're tight-lipped.

748
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,380
The Grand Empress Dowager
stayed up all night

749
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,060
and isn't feeling well.

750
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,420
She's returned to Yongshou Palace.

751
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,760
I need

752
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,810
to stay by His Majesty's side.

753
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,070
If you're exhausted,

754
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:15,020
you may leave first.

755
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:30,770
Fellow officials,

756
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:33,980
it's been quite eventful lately.

757
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:36,860
The Grand Empress Dowager

758
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,650
has personally appointed me as regent.

759
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,680
Therefore,

760
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:44,420
I shall

761
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:47,250
remain here and attend to His Majesty.

762
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:51,020
For all military and state affairs,

763
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:53,210
submit them to me

764
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,650
and I shall present them
to the Grand Empress Dowager.

765
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,420
I have a memorial.

766
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,760
It concerns the foundation of our country.

767
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,070
