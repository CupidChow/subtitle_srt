14
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,630
It sounds so sorrowful.

15
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,430
Are you missing Ms. Liu?

16
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,820
Any news about Miantang?

17
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:19,380
Rest assured.

18
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,630
Our people have gone deep into Zhenzhou.

19
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,630
We'll have news soon.

20
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,500
(Leaves flourish in summer.)

21
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,350
(But this crabapple tree has withered.)

22
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,820
Whether she returns or not,

23
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,090
I will

24
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,700
stay with you.

25
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,370
Young Master, we found her.

26
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,750
We found Ms. Liu.

27
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,430
I'm not going.

28
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,970
You're going to the Go Club.

29
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:06,490
Let's deliver this Invitation together.

30
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:07,560
Wouldn't that be better?

31
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,940
Why are you making excuses?

32
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,310
We just play Go sometimes.

33
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,970
Inviting them to a meal

34
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:13,810
is too much.

35
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:14,810
I'm not going.

36
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,240
It's for them to decide whether to come.

37
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,940
But inviting them is our courtesy.

38
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:20,770
Even if the guests don't come,

39
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,340
we must not be negligent.

40
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,530
About what you said yesterday,

41
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,630
I've thought about it.

42
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:28,410
You said

43
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,870
the banquet is to clear my name.

44
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:33,690
Then delivering this invitation together

45
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,230
would be the best opportunity.

46
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,290
Nanny Li.

47
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,340
Is the carriage ready?

48
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,120
Yes.

49
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:47,930
Fine.

50
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,870
I haven't even spoken,

51
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,550
and the carriage is ready.

52
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:52,730
Let's go.

53
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:00,940
Honey,

54
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,210
why do you look

55
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,190
so unwell?

56
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,080
I'm not.

57
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:08,380
Have a look.

58
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,750
Have a look.

59
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,980
(Lingquan Go Club)

60
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,260
Please come inside.

61
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:43,550
Mr. Jiujiu.

62
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:46,930
Greetings, everyone.

63
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:49,930
Sit, sit, sit.

64
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,020
Continue, continue.

65
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,070
- Mr. Jiujiu.
- Jiujiu.

66
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,080
Jiujiu is here.

67
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,410
Perfect timing.

68
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,110
I've been wanting to challenge you.

69
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,640
Mr. Jiujiu.

70
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,040
Why not today?

71
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,600
- How about...?
- Rain check.

72
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,990
Today, I'm just showing my wife around.

73
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,810
- Please continue.
- Alright.

74
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,010
Are you on good terms with them?

75
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,690
Of course.

76
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:26,990
Then the Invitation...?

77
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,580
Give them over there.

78
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,140
Mr. Jiujiu.

79
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:38,490
Continue.

80
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:40,730
Mr. Jiujiu.

81
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,260
- Go on.
- Mr. Jiujiu.

82
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:45,610
Mr. Jiujiu.

83
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,130
We practice here daily.

84
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,870
We're on very good terms.

85
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,200
I can see that.

86
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,310
- Mr. Jiujiu.
- Mr. Jiujiu.

87
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,820
Jiujiu, you're a bit late today.

88
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:04,970
Yes, yes.

89
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:05,990
And who is this?

90
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,290
My humble wife.

91
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,140
- Madam Jiu.
- Madam Jiu.

92
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,750
Nice to meet you.

93
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,040
I decided at the last minute,

94
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,340
hence the delay.

95
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,690
We are new to Lingquan Town.

96
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,570
We plan to host a banquet in two days.

97
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,260
Hope you can honor us with your presence.

98
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,480
If you're hosting,

99
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,570
we'll definitely come.

100
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,410
Alright.

101
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,900
(Invitation)
Alright.

102
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,020
You're quite lucky, aren't you?

103
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,720
Yes, yes.

104
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,340
(Their skills are no better than children's.)

105
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,230
- After you.
- (Jiu can't even beat them?)

106
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,330
I didn't expect you

107
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,090
to be so well-liked here.

108
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:49,500
Of course.

109
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:52,800
Everyone here practices daily.

110
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,580
We're on very good terms.

111
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:58,870
Mr. Jiujiu.

112
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,010
Mr. Jiujiu.

113
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,380
- Mr. Jiujiu.
- Greetings, everyone.

114
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,380
Jiujiu.

115
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:08,930
Madam.

116
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,020
Sir, we meet again.

117
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,530
So, your husband

118
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,900
is Jiujiu.

119
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:15,970
Yes.

120
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,010
We plan to host

121
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:18,580
a banquet in two days.

122
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:19,900
You must come.

123
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,580
(Invitation)

124
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,990
My husband's skills are not very good.

125
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,480
We hope you can guide him

126
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,430
in the future.

127
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:27,790
The Lord's chess...

128
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:30,990
The Lord?

129
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:32,410
Who?

130
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,360
What Lord?

131
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,790
Lord Huaiyang?

132
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,880
The Lord said

133
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,620
Jiujiu's skill is quite good.

134
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:42,880
Have you played with Lord Huaiyang?

135
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,170
No.

136
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:45,480
The Lord once

137
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,930
passed by our club

138
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,910
and saw from afar.

139
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,310
Exactly.

140
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,790
(If my husband's skills can be praised,)

141
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,930
(Lord Huaiyang's skills must be average.)

142
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,780
(Zhendong Villa)

143
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:15,380
(Cui's Banquet)

144
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:16,880
I know a shop

145
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,050
not far ahead.

146
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,020
- Follow me.
- Really?

147
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,220
- Let's go check.
- Look.

148
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,980
Isn't that Mrs. Cui's carriage?

149
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,940
Look at the Cui family showing off.

150
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:28,930
I heard

151
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:32,100
Mrs. Cui went to Mount Lang
early this morning

152
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,860
to offer the first incense
at Tianning Temple for Cui.

153
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:37,840
You know.

154
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,170
They just came here, doing business.

155
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,070
Why show off,

156
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,600
renting such a big villa and making it

157
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,860
known to the whole town?

158
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,430
Too flashy.

159
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,410
It's to shut you

160
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,670
gossiping women up.

161
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,440
You...

162
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,670
Who is he?

163
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:55,880
So nosy.

164
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,980
What kind of person is this?

165
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,340
- Let's go.
- Disgusting. Let's go.

166
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,030
Master Cui is hosting a grand banquet.

167
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,030
But only Mrs. Cui took it seriously,

168
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,910
offering the first incense for you.

169
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,310
Very interesting.

170
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:26,530
Mr. Cui.

171
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,820
You're already engaged.

172
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:32,340
How would Cousin Lian feel

173
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,510
seeing this?

174
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,100
It's just a show

175
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,460
for business.

176
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,480
In two months,

177
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,340
when Mrs. Cui is pregnant,

178
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,430
will you still say

179
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:44,860
it's just business?

180
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,030
It's uncertain if the carriage

181
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:48,550
will reach Zhendong.

182
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,910
Miss, take a look.

183
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,660
(Wine)

184
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,700
You're too harsh on ladies.

185
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,200
Madam.

186
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,740
Madam, are you alright?

187
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,130
I'm fine.

188
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,620
Madam, the carriage has fallen apart.

189
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,220
Is there a saddle on board?

190
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,790
- Yes.
- Put it on.

191
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,100
- Yes.
- Madam, you...

192
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,460
Is it him?

193
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,510
Madam, it's ready.

194
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,600
Your hand injury hasn't healed.

195
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,790
How can you ride?

196
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,170
The banquet is for me.

197
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,090
If I delay,

198
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,390
it would be disrespectful.

199
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,960
Madam.

200
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,860
Liu Miantang

201
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,430
is unique.

202
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:13,130
So?

203
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:14,720
Should we continue

204
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,790
with this business?

205
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,170
She's in the show,

206
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:18,860
so some people

207
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:20,820
will join the game.

208
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,770
Five aces, seven horses.

209
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,030
Drink, drink.

210
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,000
Let go.

211
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,150
I'm not drunk.

212
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,150
Cui, get out here.

213
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,240
Not here for a toast.

214
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,080
Where is he?

215
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:54,930
Young lady.

216
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,340
Come out here.

217
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:01,930
Madam.

218
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:03,130
Have you seen him?

219
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:04,690
Master is being persuaded

220
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:06,050
to drink by his club friends.

221
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:06,890
He's very drunk

222
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,580
and resting in the tea pavilion.

223
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,320
I'll go see him.

224
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,390
Madam Jiu.

225
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,600
Thank you for the hospitality.

226
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,440
Right now,

227
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,690
Jiu

228
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:22,190
is very drunk.

229
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,560
He...

230
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:25,810
Madam.

231
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:29,000
There are still many guests.

232
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,100
You're the hostess.

233
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,030
Go greet them first.

234
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,090
I have to entertain the ladies in the backyard.

235
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,460
How can I manage the front yard?

236
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,050
But the master won't

237
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,070
wake up anytime soon.

238
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,720
These neighbors

239
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,700
and friends

240
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,520
are easy to handle.

241
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,640
But those merchants are

242
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,270
crucial to the master's future.

243
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,510
We can't ignore them.

244
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,510
It all depends on you.

245
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,240
Thanks for attending our small banquet.

246
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,520
I am Liu, Cui's wife.

247
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,360
Greetings, everyone.

248
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,880
It's our first time here.

249
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,450
We don't know the customs here.

250
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,580
We have been negligent.

251
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,740
I'll drink as a forfeit.

252
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,810
If you have any special requests,

253
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:20,930
please let me know.

254
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,240
Later, my husband and I

255
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,150
will toast again.

256
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,480
Alright, alright.

257
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,280
Much appreciated.

258
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,190
My Lord, everything has been checked.

259
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:34,760
Most guests are innocent locals

260
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,740
from Lingquan Town.

261
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:37,120
But there are a few

262
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,330
who are not from our town.

263
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:39,170
Which ones?

264
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:41,410
Enjoy your food.

265
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:42,450
The one in front of Liu

266
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,510
is one of them.

267
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,690
We're running out

268
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:46,530
of wine here.

269
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:47,930
I'm sorry.

270
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,810
Bicao, get more wine.

271
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:50,650
Yes, Madam.

272
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:52,810
No problem.

273
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,000
My buddies

274
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,050
are idle.

275
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,050
Let them come along.

276
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:56,890
Yes.

277
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,740
I can go with you.

278
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:08,890
Madam,

279
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,460
please show me the way.

280
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:13,930
Please wait a moment.

281
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:14,940
I'll get more wine.

282
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,560
Alright.

283
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:29,670
Keep an eye on things.

284
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,320
Yes.

285
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,360
What now?

286
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:43,820
The fish took the bait?

287
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,320
Well.

288
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,570
Which one is Lu Wen?

289
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,100
None of them is Lu Wen.

290
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,410
At first, I wondered

291
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:57,190
if he would come.

292
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,940
But now I'm sure

293
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,150
he won't.

294
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:04,850
Have you met Lu Wen?

295
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:05,690
No.

296
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,850
Then how do you know

297
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:08,690
the scholar she just spoke with
isn't Lu Wen?

298
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,040
That scholar

299
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,230
is definitely not.

300
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,320
Bicao,

301
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,690
is there enough wine?

302
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:15,650
Madam, the wine in the front yard is finished.

303
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:16,850
I've sent them to get more.

304
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:17,690
Go ahead.

305
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,710
Did you notice?

306
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:24,100
That man, talking to Liu Miantang,

307
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,320
keeps glancing

308
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,470
to his side.

309
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,030
The maid beside him

310
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,410
is the real leader.

311
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,270
- How's it?
- Madam.

312
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,360
Going well, Madam.

313
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,310
- Thanks.
- Thanks, Madam.

314
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,790
If I were Lu Wen,

315
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,040
I would send someone close

316
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,030
to check the situation.

317
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:47,950
Then decide

318
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,660
whether to take Liu Miantang back.

319
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:52,710
The real Lu Wen

320
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,420
would be even more cautious.

321
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,140
(Liu Miantang.)

322
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,690
It's been so long.

323
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:26,340
Where is Mrs. Cui?

324
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,480
Making us wait.

325
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,340
Yes.

326
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,210
Mrs. Cui.

327
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,340
We're looking for you.

328
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:33,000
We're waiting for you

329
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,610
to start the drinking game.

330
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:35,450
And you

331
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:36,370
are here hiding.

332
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:37,690
- Right.
- Apologies.

333
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,000
I was focused on the front yard.

334
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,240
I forgot the back.

335
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,890
Punish yourself with three drinks.

336
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,510
Or we won't agree.

337
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,860
Right.

338
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,450
You there, maid.

339
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:48,620
Get a jug of wine.

340
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:54,850
Mrs. Cui,

341
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:58,480
are you staying here tonight
or returning to the North Street house?

342
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,320
Settle the house?

343
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,030
The banquet is to settle the house.

344
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:04,760
To settle the house,

345
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,710
it must be done by the couple together.

346
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,620
In Zhenzhou, this banquet

347
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:09,930
is also called

348
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:12,550
"Sweet Night".

349
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:14,320
It lasts all night.

350
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,370
- Right?
- This villa is good for guests.

351
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,280
To settle the house,

352
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,240
it must be

353
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,270
in the main house.

354
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,850
Or it's bad luck.

355
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,140
Not good for the house.

356
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:23,450
Right.

357
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,560
Madam,

358
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,410
the master asked me to tell you

359
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,790
he'd return soon

360
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,580
and asked you to wait in the room.

361
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,450
Ladies,

362
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:35,450
please take your seats.

363
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,660
I'll join you shortly.

364
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,900
- OK.
- Hurry.

365
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,840
Look.

366
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,210
The shadow guards have surrounded the villa.

367
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,000
Why not just

368
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,890
capture them all?

369
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:54,730
Capture?

370
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,580
I'm after Lu Wen.

371
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,520
Aren't you afraid that Liu Miantang

372
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,690
will join forces with him

373
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:03,760
and escape?

374
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,270
That would be best.

375
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,750
You can't let the bait rot in your hand.

376
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:10,410
I need to feed her

377
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,310
to the enemy.

378
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:13,790
That's the fun part.

379
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:30,690
Madam,

380
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,070
where are you going?

381
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,080
What's wrong with my husband?

382
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,030
I must find him.

383
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:38,750
The master's chess teacher arrived.

384
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,170
He wants to see

385
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,990
if the master's skills have improved.

386
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,660
The master couldn't refuse,

387
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:45,310
so he couldn't be here.

388
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,370
At this time,

389
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:48,560
he still plays Go?

390
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,210
The master knows he's wrong.

391
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:52,650
He said it's right for you to be angry.

392
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:53,720
So, he asked you

393
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,340
to rest

394
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,070
and he'd come

395
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,620
to apologize soon.

396
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:01,660
If you go now recklessly,

397
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,320
won't it

398
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,040
disgrace him

399
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,340
before his teacher?

400
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,160
Inform the Lord.

401
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,720
The fish took the bait.

402
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,560
Yes.

403
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,210
My Lord, a suspicious man, possibly Lu Wen,

404
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,380
went to meet Liu.

405
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,050
Fangxie.

406
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:34,800
- Madam.
- Call for help.

407
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,930
There's a villain in my room.

408
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:37,230
- Villain?
- Quiet.

409
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,000
Don't alarm the guests.

410
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,180
- Hurry.
- Yes.

411
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,360
Do you think

412
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,580
it's those suspicious people?

413
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,100
We'll know soon.

414
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,400
What's wrong?

415
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:19,420
Sorry, did I burn you?

416
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,610
- Liu...
- I'm in a hurry.

417
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:22,450
If I burned you,

418
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:23,550
I'll apologize later.

419
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,340
Don't you remember me?

420
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,420
I'm Yun.

421
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:30,730
Yun?

422
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:33,580
Yunniang.

423
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,710
I'm Sun Yunniang. Don't you remember?

424
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,480
Sorry, I'm new to Lingquan Town.

425
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,550
I've forgotten many people.

426
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,710
I'll remember you.

427
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:42,340
There's a villain here.

428
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,140
It's unsafe for a lady.

429
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,950
Follow this road to go back.

430
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,310
Sweetheart.

431
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:57,660
I'm here.

432
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:06,990
Sweetheart.

433
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:08,930
Do you remember

434
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:10,790
the last time you stabbed me with a hairpin?

435
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,470
You didn't stab my neck

436
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,030
but my heart.

437
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,070
Let me tell you.

438
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:20,030
I like your fierceness.

439
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:21,470
It's thrilling.

440
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:26,550
Where is she?

441
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:28,550
The drug isn't strong enough?

442
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,380
You like to play hide and seek?

443
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,280
Then hide well.

444
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,720
If I catch you,

445
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,760
I'll show you

446
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,620
my skills.

447
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,660
Sweetheart.

448
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:50,710
I saw you.

449
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:52,420
Stop hiding.

450
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,130
Look at me,

451
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,240
handsome

452
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,240
and charming.

453
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,750
So lovable.

454
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:03,770
Come here.

455
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,710
Let me hug you.

456
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:10,530
Let me go.

457
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,560
It's burning.

458
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,070
So hot.

459
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:22,510
Jiu?

460
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:25,040
How dare he come

461
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,100
after I stabbed him?

462
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:30,930
He ruined

463
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,950
our carefully arranged banquet.

464
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,550
Luckily, you came.

465
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,620
If you were late,

466
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:38,990
I would

467
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:41,520
have fought him

468
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,660
to death.

469
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:44,950
It's a pity.

470
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:47,040
You wanted to make friends,

471
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,070
yet you're still alone here.

472
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,660
Madam,

473
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,270
you're too modest.

474
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,340
With your skills,

475
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,420
no need to worry.

476
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,030
Jiu,

477
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:05,170
are you blaming me for being reckless

478
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:06,230
and hurting you?

479
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:11,710
It's my fault.

480
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:18,950
This small injury isn't your fault.

481
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,380
Lies.

482
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:25,380
I said it's nothing.

483
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,990
(Does she truly know nothing,)

484
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,950
(or is she just playing with me?)

485
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:35,100
Better now?

486
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:38,720
Your ears

487
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,760
are red.

488
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,750
Burned too?

489
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,640
No.

490
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,840
Nanny Li.

491
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,690
Change the water.

492
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:46,710
Mr. and Mrs. Cui.

493
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:47,990
The water is ready.

494
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:57,070
Mr. and Mrs. Cui.

495
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,900
This lamp has a unique design,

496
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,210
so

497
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:03,230
I brought it over.

498
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:17,550
Why are you staring at me?

499
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,210
I think today,

500
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,550
though the ending

501
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:23,930
was a bit rushed,

502
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:24,850
the effort

503
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:26,310
was not in vain.

504
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,080
Such an elaborate feast

505
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,000
for everyone

506
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,230
would not be in vain.

507
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:40,270
The pattern on this lamp

508
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:42,900
is quite unique.

509
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:48,210
Miantang,

510
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:51,030
are you remembering something?

511
00:27:58,890 --> 00:27:59,730
Miantang?

512
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:02,990
I don't know.

513
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,660
Just a slight headache.

514
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,550
Should I call Physician Zhao over?

515
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,100
It's not a big deal.

516
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:18,450
What's the matter?

517
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:20,080
I suddenly remembered something.

518
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:20,920
What is it?

519
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,160
Jiu.

520
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,890
Today,

521
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:28,270
in front of everyone,

522
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:29,560
you should've

523
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,710
called my name.

524
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:34,210
That's it?

525
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,890
Even if not in front of others,

526
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:37,820
I want to hear it.

527
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:47,970
Miantang.

528
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:50,690
Jiu.

529
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,470
Feeling better?

530
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,410
If you don't touch it,

531
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,250
it's fine.

532
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,270
Why do you keep looking at me?

533
00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:28,720
I was thinking.

534
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,180
You worked hard today,

535
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:31,750
entertaining guests.

536
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,240
Not as hard as you,

537
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,990
who worked behind the scenes.

538
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:37,250
Let's go.

539
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:57,410
The young master

540
00:29:57,410 --> 00:29:58,380
doesn't know we're here.

541
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,240
Not a word

542
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,240
about today's events.

543
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,080
Understood.

544
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:04,750
Have we heard the name Cui Jiu

545
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,470
somewhere before?

546
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,230
Jiu,

547
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,180
it's almost dawn.

548
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:51,310
Shouldn't we extinguish the light and rest?

549
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,420
No rush.

550
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:01,900
Does it still hurt?

551
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:06,050
No.

552
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,230
Zhao Quan handled it well.

553
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:11,420
Thanks to Physician Zhao.

554
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,400
What about you?

555
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:16,790
Does your head still hurt?

556
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,600
No.

557
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:23,210
Did you recall anything

558
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:24,230
after that?

559
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,040
Should I have remembered something?

560
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,580
Of course, it's related

561
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,470
to what you saw today.

562
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,030
The banquet is to settle the house.

563
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:38,720
To settle the house,

564
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,580
it must be done by the couple together.

565
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,710
In Zhenzhou, this banquet

566
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:46,660
is also called "Sweet Night".

567
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,160
Remember now?

568
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,660
Actually,

569
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:02,320
it's not important.

570
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,160
It is important.

571
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,640
But

572
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,860
I'm not ready yet.

573
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,420
What do you need to prepare?

574
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,140
We are husband and wife.

575
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,340
You should trust me.

576
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:25,730
Miantang,

577
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,100
what you think

578
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,720
is extremely important

579
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,750
to me.

580
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,660
What are you doing?

581
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,140
Taking off my clothes.

582
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:50,510
No, no. Don't.

583
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:55,820
Actually,

584
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,660
I wanted to take it slow

585
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:00,230
with you.

586
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,400
But

587
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,800
after hearing from Mrs. Yin today,

588
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,860
I realized

589
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:10,230
this kind of banquet also

590
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:13,270
includes the tradition of consummation.

591
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,860
You worked hard to prepare the banquet for me.

592
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,000
I can't pretend

593
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,510
not to know your intentions.

594
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,380
Moreover,

595
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:27,620
you stood up for me today
and taught that scoundrel a lesson.

596
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,800
I didn't

597
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,000
mean it that way.

598
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,840
No.

599
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:35,770
You're right.

600
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:38,070
We are husband and wife.

601
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:39,380
I should trust you.

602
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,360
Miantang,

603
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:49,790
I think you're right.

604
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:51,860
Let's take it slow.

605
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:57,450
Really?

606
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,420
I can wait.

607
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,900
I am happy to wait.

608
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,100
Actually,

609
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,100
he

610
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:08,050
is sick.

611
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,910
What kind of sickness?

612
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,180
An unspeakable one.

613
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:18,170
For any man,

614
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,780
it's something

615
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:22,910
to be ashamed of.

616
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,470
It might hurt their pride,

617
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:26,700
especially in front of their wife.

618
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,920
So,

619
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,990
he can only beat around the bush,

620
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:33,780
hiding his own

621
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:37,770
weakness.

622
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:39,690
So,

623
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:42,070
what do you mean?

624
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,470
A prodigy cursed by fate.

625
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:59,730
Stop it. What are you doing?

626
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:00,850
What are you doing?

627
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:02,290
Don't protect your mouth!

628
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:04,070
What else can I do?

629
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:05,290
I can't let her

630
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:06,220
investigate you.

631
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:10,260
Don't be angry.

632
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:24,220
Don't be so angry.

633
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:26,430
Rest assured.

634
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:28,660
I didn't make any final statements.

635
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:31,890
I said with careful treatment,

636
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:33,180
you could still

637
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:35,910
recover.

638
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:52,350
Liu Miantang's been causing trouble
repeatedly for me.

639
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:56,990
You're really angry at her.

640
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:59,510
You do look unwell.

641
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,480
What are you doing?

642
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,990
Let me check your pulse.

643
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,180
You're not noble,

644
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,330
pretending to be her husband,

645
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:19,390
taking advantage.

646
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,390
But you're also not flirty,

647
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:25,300
burning with inner fire.

648
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:26,690
Why bother?

649
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,390
After all,

650
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:34,780
Liu Miantang is also a pitiful person.

651
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:36,770
Why keep this with her?

652
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:37,660
Keep what?

653
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:39,620
I won't stoop to her level.

654
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,300
Anyway, this will all end soon.

655
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,250
Last night,

656
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:47,220
they didn't act.

657
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:49,430
So, they will

658
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:51,300
definitely take action next.

659
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:53,620
Lu Wen

660
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,350
might show up soon.

661
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,910
If we catch Lu Wen,

662
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,140
will you deal with Liu Miantang?

663
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,520
Of course.

664
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:16,950
What are you doing?

665
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:21,690
Moru.

666
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:25,200
I've prepared two more dishes for Jiu.

667
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,350
Take them to the Go Club.

668
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:28,290
Yes.

669
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,120
Make sure he eats on time,

670
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,390
not just play Go.

671
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:33,070
Now that the weather is cooling,

672
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:34,180
he needs

673
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:36,100
to take care of his health.

674
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,400
Yes.

675
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,090
By the way,

676
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,260
about that scoundrel,

677
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,300
go inquire about the official's news.

678
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,000
About this,

679
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,680
the official saw Chen Tu was scalded badly

680
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,580
and allowed him to go home to rest.

681
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:51,450
He dared to openly harass

682
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:52,660
a respectable lady.

683
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:53,770
Even if he's injured,

684
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:54,780
it's his own fault.

685
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:56,600
How can the officials

686
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,780
let him off?

687
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:00,070
Just because he's the garrison's nephew?

688
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,660
The master

689
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:04,970
is just an ordinary merchant.

690
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:07,070
He can't comment on official matters.

691
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:08,690
Well.

692
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,830
I'm not blaming him.

693
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,550
I'm blaming Lord Huaiyang.

694
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:16,260
He received the indictment but didn't respond.

695
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,000
Now he lets his subordinates

696
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,990
bend the law.

697
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:20,730
He doesn't love the people at all.

698
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:21,990
He's just seeking fame.

699
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:26,290
What's wrong?

700
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,470
Shouldn't I have said it?

701
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,220
No, no.

702
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,740
Madam, you're right.

703
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,360
Really.

704
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:35,810
Jiu.

705
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:41,140
Officials have their own way

706
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:43,740
of handling cases.

707
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,160
Besides, that person

708
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,890
is seriously injured.

709
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:48,810
Letting him get treated
is understandable.

710
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:49,780
It's reasonable.

711
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:51,620
Jiu, don't worry.

712
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,700
No matter how serious his injury,

713
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,620
it's his own fault.

714
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,160
Even if Lord Huaiyang

715
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,290
wants to protect him,

716
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:00,740
he can't turn the tables on us.

717
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:05,890
I've made some tonic dishes

718
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:06,780
for you.

719
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:08,570
Moru.

720
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,390
Make sure you eat them.

721
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,430
Thanks, Miantang.

722
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:29,060
Handmade trinkets. Come take a look.

723
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:29,920
My Lord,

724
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,160
should we inform the Prefect

725
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,430
to deal with Chen Tu?

726
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:36,180
Is she really my wife?

727
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,090
To the camp.

728
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,360
Yes.

729
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,100
I've made some tonic dishes for you.

730
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:56,570
Ms. Liu.

731
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,260
Physician, why are you here?

732
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:00,730
I suddenly remembered

733
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:01,810
I hadn't given you a gift

734
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:03,450
for the banquet.

735
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:04,660
Physician, you're too kind.

736
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,580
(Mr. Hate Brush)

737
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:18,210
My Lord,

738
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,030
the captured bandit from Mount Yang confessed.

739
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,950
This is indeed their secret code.

740
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,400
Tomorrow, one person, at 17:00, at the dock.

741
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:37,090
My Lord.

742
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,320
Liu

743
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,870
left by carriage.

744
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,480
My Lord,

745
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,030
there's a fork here.

746
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,400
My Lord,

747
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:01,930
Liu's carriage

748
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:02,910
went that way.

749
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:05,430
Is she leaving Zhenzhou?

750
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:07,810
My Lord,

751
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:09,000
should we go to the dock

752
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,430
or continue following Liu?

753
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,260
- Follow her.
- Go.

754
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:36,260
The code said the dock,

755
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:38,100
but she came here.

756
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:40,140
She almost fooled us.

757
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:42,220
A sly rabbit has three burrows.

758
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:44,740
This woman is truly unfathomable.

759
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:49,770
She's here.

760
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:53,880
Mrs. Liu, sorry

761
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:54,960
to keep you waiting.

762
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:56,730
Used the bathroom halfway.

763
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:57,660
Lord Zhao?

764
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,140
The coachman used it.

765
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:01,390
It's okay. I just arrived.

766
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:02,930
Let's go inside.

767
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:03,910
- Alright.
- Let's go.

768
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:09,700
The environment here is quite nice.

769
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,350
Nice, right?

770
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,990
