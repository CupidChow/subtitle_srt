=Episode 36=

14
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,870
In this world, many parents

15
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:49,710
seem to always consider
and plan for their children.

16
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,920
But in fact,

17
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,590
they do not really care
about their children's feelings.

18
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,790
They can even sacrifice their children's

19
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,480
reputation and dignity

20
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,070
for their own interests.

21
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,230
Most of the time,

22
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,070
the children are also helpless.

23
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,240
As a woman,

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,560
I understand well how much discipline

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,910
Cousin Lian has endured since childhood.

26
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,310
If I had such a mother,

27
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,590
I wouldn't do better than her.

28
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,030
I understand what you mean.

29
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,840
I will go talk to her and make it clear.

30
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,990
Sister,

31
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,150
I have treated you well

32
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,000
over the years,

33
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,960
yet today you still came
to the mansion to force me.

34
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,520
Do you really think

35
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,840
I'm that foolish?

36
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,630
Sister, you hold a high position
in the Lord's Mansion.

37
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,000
I deserve to be

38
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,190
treated well by you.

39
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,680
Have you forgotten

40
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,680
that the Consort Dowager

41
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,240
should not have been you?

42
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,560
If I didn't give

43
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,030
the marriage opportunity to you

44
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,630
and married into the Lian family,

45
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,960
it would have been you,

46
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,310
living under others' thumb

47
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,430
for so many years.

48
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,150
The title of Consort Dowager.

49
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,590
The glory and wealth.

50
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,310
Those are what you owe me.

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,710
You must compensate me for a lifetime!

52
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,590
Xingzhou says I shows partiality to you.

53
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,590
He doesn't know

54
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,800
that my greatest partiality

55
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,910
is always treating you sincerely,

56
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,520
even when I know that you are insincere,

57
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,470
everytime you call me sister.

58
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,240
Listen to me carefully.

59
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,030
My title

60
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,030
was not given by you.

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,080
It was you who made the wrong choice
and regretted it.

62
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,520
My family

63
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,750
never owed you anything.

64
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,030
Sister.

65
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,430
Sister, sister, sister.

66
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,680
I'm begging you.

67
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,430
Help me one last time.

68
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:08,270
Her...

69
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,680
Her reputation is all ruined.

70
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,870
No one wants her now.

71
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,680
Right.

72
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,880
Right.

73
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:17,830
I will beg Princess Huaisang.

74
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,920
I will apologize to her.

75
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,360
If she is really willing-

76
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,800
- I will-
- I won't agree either.

77
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,830
My daughter-in-law

78
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:25,800
is a one-in-a-million good girl.

79
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,560
Let me make it clear.

80
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,080
From now on,

81
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,720
if anyone dares

82
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,000
to force my son to have any concubines

83
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,270
and upset my daughter-in-law,

84
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,000
I will be the first to make them pay.

85
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,510
Sister.

86
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,390
Sister.

87
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,720
Sister, sister!

88
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,040
Please help me one last time!

89
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,160
Please help Binglan one last time!

90
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,720
I'm begging you.

91
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,350
Binglan.

92
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,400
Look.

93
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,830
The lights of the mansion
are so beautiful.

94
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,630
Since I was a kid,

95
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,120
in my heart,

96
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,750
nothing outside

97
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,630
can compare to what this mansion has.

98
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,600
And no one...

99
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,430
And no one

100
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,000
can compare to you.

101
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,800
I have always

102
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,390
owed you an apology.

103
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,000
At the beginning,

104
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,120
when I didn't even understand
what marriage meant,

105
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,160
I let Mother

106
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,360
arrange this marriage.

107
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,640
For you,

108
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,830
it was indeed a great injustice.

109
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,750
I was also at fault.

110
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,430
I have long known

111
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,270
that you had

112
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,430
no feelings for me.

113
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:32,310
I had already given up
on winning your love.

114
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,190
But all these years,

115
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,000
I kept telling myself

116
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,800
that love is useless

117
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,310
and as long I became Princess Huaiyang,

118
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,270
I could get everything I ever dreamed of.

119
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,560
But today,

120
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,600
when you stood up

121
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,040
in front of Princess Huaisang,
I finally realized

122
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,430
that all these years, I didn't get

123
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,360
what I fought so hard for.
Instead, I lost it all.

124
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,800
I lost you.

125
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,800
I lost my dignity

126
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,270
and my grace.

127
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,600
I even lost myself.

128
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,360
It's okay.

129
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,390
I'm fine now.

130
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,800
It's cold late at night.

131
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,510
Cousin, please go back.

132
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,520
Binglan.

133
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,000
There's still time.

134
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,590
I believe in you.

135
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,000
Binglan, Binglan. Wait!

136
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,030
Binglan!

137
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,480
If it weren't for your incompetence,

138
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,630
I would have helped you
to be the concubine.

139
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,680
I don't want to be a concubine anymore.

140
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,320
Mother,

141
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,950
have you ever thought about it?

142
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,360
The Lord Huaiyang doesn't love me.

143
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,720
Even if I marry into the family,

144
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,270
what kind of life will I live?

145
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,600
Are you foolish?

146
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,270
Once you marry him,

147
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,270
none of this will matter.

148
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,870
Have you forgotten what I planned

149
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,790
and everything I did for you

150
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:40,960
all these years?

151
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,630
Is it for me,

152
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,240
or for yourself?

153
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,870
From now on,

154
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,870
I will no longer live

155
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,440
for your illusory dreams.

156
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,120
My marriage

157
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,630
and my life

158
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,750
will be decided by myself.

159
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,320
Binglan.

160
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,750
Binglan.

161
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,870
Binglan.

162
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,320
Now,

163
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,670
we have no more worries.

164
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,150
Are you happy?

165
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,630
You have prepared everything,

166
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,720
so I don't have to worry at all.

167
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,550
There were some surprises,

168
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,000
but there was also joy.

169
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,870
Sounds like you have some complaints?

170
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,510
Yes.

171
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,630
We have gone through so many
twists and turns,

172
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,870
before today.

173
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,510
Perhaps,

174
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,790
if we had a deeper connection of fate,

175
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:04,870
and met earlier,

176
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,630
our path would have been easier.

177
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,350
In the past,

178
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,600
I did have such complaints.

179
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,870
And now?

180
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,960
Now, I am very grateful for all of this.

181
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,030
It is hard-earned,

182
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:19,960
so

183
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,510
I will cherish it even more.

184
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,080
I have

185
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,150
proposed to you many times,

186
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,120
but I felt it wasn't enough.

187
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,840
Today,

188
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,510
I sincerely ask again

189
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,550
to take you as my wife.

190
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,030
From now on,

191
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,670
we'll care for each other,

192
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,200
and live in harmony.

193
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,790
Will you marry me?

194
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,600
Yes, with all my heart.

195
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,630
Since you said yes,

196
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,270
let me tell you another secret.

197
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,320
On the 9th,

198
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,360
we will have our wedding.

199
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,960
The 9th?

200
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,960
It's just a few days away.

201
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,960
Will we make it?

202
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,200
All the friends and family

203
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,870
have already been notified.

204
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,720
Even if we hold it tomorrow,

205
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,840
we'll make it.

206
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,200
You are in such a hurry.

207
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,270
You fear I'll run away?

208
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,110
Yes.

209
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,150
During this journey,

210
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,270
we've wandered around and come this far.

211
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,790
It hasn't been easy.

212
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,320
We've weathered many storms.

213
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,000
I can't wait any longer.

214
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:44,870
In the future,

215
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,510
no matter how hard it gets,

216
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,750
I will protect you from any harm.

217
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,960
I only wish to

218
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,750
hold your hand,

219
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,480
and grow old together.

220
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:10,010
(Fanglan Pavilion)

221
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:10,850
- Okay.
- It's good?

222
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,480
It's fine. It's fine.

223
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,790
Take it slow.

224
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,230
Dear,

225
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,590
pass it to me again.

226
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,600
Take it slow.

227
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,040
Look.

228
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,750
So majestic!

229
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:30,710
Wow.

230
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,240
Princess Huaisang has this much dowry?

231
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,390
It's really a lot.

232
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,350
Miantang.

233
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,080
Miantang.

234
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,480
- Darling.
- Grandfather.

235
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,200
Grandfather.

236
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:54,990
Uncle.

237
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,960
Miantang.

238
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:57,750
Miantang.

239
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:00,670
Let me see.

240
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,390
Lord Cui

241
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,840
has made you so thin!

242
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,840
Really?

243
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,840
Yes.

244
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,720
I heard this place
has been chaotic lately.

245
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,910
Are you alright?

246
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,720
Right, is there anyone

247
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,080
bullying you in the mansion?

248
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,720
You keep asking questions.

249
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,030
I don't know how to answer.

250
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,390
My tongue is feeling numb.

251
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,040
Grandfather,

252
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,480
please go inside and have some tea.

253
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,000
I'll take you to the mansion to meet

254
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,320
the Lord and his mother later.

255
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,270
No, that's not allowed.

256
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,510
It's not allowed.

257
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:27,750
An unmarried girl cannot

258
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,030
meet her future husband.

259
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,200
It's against the rules.

260
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,200
Let's go. Let's go.

261
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,270
- You're getting more lovely.
- Please.

262
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:47,870
Father.

263
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,440
Brother.

264
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:53,990
Father.

265
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:56,960
Here.

266
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,600
Father, take a look.

267
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,790
Any other suggestions?

268
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,900
(Joy)

269
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,670
Be careful not to tilt it.

270
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,960
Align both sides.

271
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,240
Don't scratch it.

272
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,790
It was just pasted on.

273
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,440
Let me see.

274
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,630
Isn't it pretty?

275
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,600
Not luxurious enough.

276
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:28,870
Try this one.

277
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,510
The pearl hairpin.

278
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,630
Let me see.

279
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,960
- It's nice.
- Looks pretty.

280
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,510
No,

281
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:40,790
I'm not satisfied.

282
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,630
Take it down. Let's try the next set.

283
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:56,660
(Joy)

284
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,720
If the work is done, you can

285
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:11,710
leave for a rest.

286
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,280
It's strange.

287
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,550
You are the one having the wedding.

288
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,270
Why am I so nervous?

289
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,240
Aren't you nervous at all?

290
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,560
Not at all.

291
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,270
Why should I be?

292
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:40,750
I admire you now more

293
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,120
than when you fought in the army.

294
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,550
Since ancient times,

295
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,200
how many grooms have been

296
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,510
too nervous to sleep?

297
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,440
How come

298
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,000
you're so calm?

299
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,440
We are together all the time

300
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,360
and already familiar with each other.

301
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,270
So the excitement fades?

302
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,230
It's not that.

303
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,150
Our experiences together

304
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,630
have already taught us

305
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,080
what it means to be a couple.

306
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,560
In my heart,

307
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,990
Miantang

308
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,080
is already

309
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,120
my lawful wife.

310
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,720
For this wedding,

311
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
we have already

312
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,840
experienced it thousands of times
in our hearts.

313
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,350
So,

314
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,910
why would I be nervous

315
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,960
about getting married

316
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,360
like ordinary grooms?

317
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,560
What?

318
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,080
Is that a wedge dowel?

319
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,710
Yes,

320
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,080
what's wrong?

321
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,360
What if it pricks Miantang?

322
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,960
Exactly.

323
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,080
A bit higher.

324
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,040
Come back. Come back.

325
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:13,160
Quick. Get up on me.

326
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,480
- Is it okay?
- Yes, come on.

327
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:25,510
- I'm standing up.
- Go ahead.

328
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,430
Here.

329
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,840
Cui Xingzhou.

330
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,310
Neck, neck, neck.

331
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,110
Can you reach it?

332
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:38,430
I can reach it.

333
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,080
Cui Xingzhou.

334
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,040
It's so high.

335
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,160
Will it prick Miantang?

336
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,720
Yes, if she is on the threshold.

337
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,040
No, no, no.

338
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,070
Even so, she can't reach it.

339
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,880
Won't she have a crown?

340
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,790
Even if her height doubles,

341
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:58,830
she can't reach it.

342
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,040
Are we

343
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,160
too nervous?

344
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,960
You're making me nervous.

345
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,520
I'm not.

346
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,720
It's okay.

347
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,440
Miantang must be even
more nervous.

348
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,440
Big! I'm the biggest.

349
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:48,960
- I won, I won.
- Another win?

350
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:53,880
Another round.

351
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,270
Still small. I bet on small.

352
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,510
Tomorrow is your wedding.

353
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,750
You still have the energy

354
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,110
to play dice?

355
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,110
Is everything ready?

356
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,110
Yes, it's ready.

357
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,310
But I still feel-

358
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,110
Sit down and play a few rounds with us.

359
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,350
- Hurry, Nanny Li.
- No, no, I can't.

360
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,270
Come on, Nanny Li.

361
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,880
- No, no, I can't.
- Hurry, Nanny Li.

362
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Nanny Li, join us.

363
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,870
Alright, I bet on big.

364
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,350
Come on, another round.

365
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,280
Another round.

366
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:42,900
(Joy)

367
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,880
As the old saying goes,

368
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,110
A man can fall in love
and leave without consequences,

369
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,880
but a woman can never just leave.

370
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,920
The years are long.

371
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,790
There is bound to be
a time when passion fades.

372
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,160
Have you ever thought

373
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,350
how you will

374
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,830
treat her then?

375
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,680
So, in your heart,

376
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,160
am I just

377
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,110
a heartless and fickle person?

378
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,640
That's not what I mean.

379
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,110
I'm just curious.

380
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,880
Being a couple and being married

381
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,640
must be different, right?

382
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,030
If we become husband and wife,

383
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,200
then her joy will be my joy,

384
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,240
and her burdens

385
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,200
will also be my burdens.

386
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,110
Miantang is like that.

387
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,880
She always stands

388
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,310
by my side firmly,

389
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:44,000
sharing the responsibility with me.

390
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,880
That's who she is.

391
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,840
She can be tough.

392
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,590
She can be vulnerable.

393
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,350
And she has a pure heart.

394
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,240
I'll make sure

395
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,350
she stays that way.

396
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:01,880
If there is any change,

397
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:05,310
it is that we no longer want the other
to change.

398
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,680
I only wish that in our years together,

399
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,200
she can always be herself.

400
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:32,420
(Cui Mansion)

401
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,200
Before,

402
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,830
the clouds always covered the moon.

403
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:39,030
I haven't seen such bright moonlight
in a long time.

404
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,400
The Princess still cares

405
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:42,480
about the moonlight?

406
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,350
From now on,

407
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,720
the Lord will pick

408
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,200
anything for you, even the moon.

409
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,880
He won't.

410
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:51,870
Why?

411
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:54,680
Because he knows

412
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,200
that, if I want it,

413
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,920
I will climb the ladder myself

414
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,000
to pick the moon.

415
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:00,910
So,

416
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,790
he will always be

417
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:03,750
the reliable man

418
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:04,960
who stands on the ground

419
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,550
and holds the ladder steady.

420
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,390
And I will

421
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,350
completely trust him.

422
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,240
Tonight, the moon is so bright.

423
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,800
It will surely

424
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,750
be a lovely day tomorrow.

425
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,400

aren't you anxious at all?

Congratulations, congratulations.

00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,500

445
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,380

00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:20,740
Come, come, come.

454
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:26,500
The beauty dresses at the mirror stand.

455
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:29,860
Please quickly lift the curtain
and come out-

456
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,420
My Lord, please.

457
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,300
So easy?

458
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,180
I haven't even finished the poem.

459
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,620
Please.

460
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,580
Everyone.

461
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,500
This way, please.

462
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,980
- Follow me.
- This way, please.

463
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:50,980
Father.

464
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:51,900
We should go.

465
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,060
We'll greet the guests.

466
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,740
If the Lord wants his bride,

467
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,140
just use a red silk rope

468
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,180
to pull her out.

469
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:12,620
However,

470
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,060
there are five red silk ropes,

471
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,700
each linked to a different lady.

472
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,180
Only one of them is held by the bride.

473
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,540
You must choose carefully.

474
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,140
What if he chooses wrong?

475
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,380
Naturally, you will marry

476
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,500
the lady you pull out.

477
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,580
The wrong one will be

478
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,940
sent into the bridal sedan.

479
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,340
Xingzhou, don't panic.

480
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,140
I don't believe

481
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,220
the bride would watch you
marry another lady.

482
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,620
Are all the five ropes

483
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,340
held by one person?

484
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,900
My Lord, don't be so narrow-minded.

485
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,460
Bride.

486
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,700
Are all the five ropes

487
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,660
in your hands?

488
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:54,780
Oh no.

489
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,100
Amitabha, Amitabha.

490
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,420
My Lord, you have to choose
the right person.

491
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,940
Not the first one.

492
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,780
Which one it is?

493
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,700
I agree with you.

494
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,740
Pull the second one.

495
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,460
Which one is it exactly?

496
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,460
His Lordship will succeed.

497
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,660
Which one is it?

498
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,020
This one looks like it.

499
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,620
None of the first few is right.

500
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,980
Definitely not this one.

501
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:16,900
Not this one.

502
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:25,940
Any idea?

503
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,300
My Lord, if you don't dare,

504
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,540
how about

505
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,940
I cut one rope that is not

506
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,300
the bride's one, okay?

507
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,860
Okay, okay, okay.

508
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,140
- Okay.
- What's the condition?

509
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,540
I heard you values
your reputation the most.

510
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,500
Today, in front of so many people,

511
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,660
can you say

512
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,380
some sweet words

513
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,780
to the bride inside?

514
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,580
This sounds good.

515
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,620
Miss He

516
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,700
is really naughty.

517
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,780
He gets shy so easily.

518
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,220
Making him say such words

519
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,780
is worse than killing him.

520
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:01,660
Nanny Li.

521
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,820
Stop laughing.

522
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,260
Be careful.

523
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,700
His Lordship might actually

524
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:06,580
pull you out.

525
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,900
Which one will he pull?

526
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:37,860
Remember.

527
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,860
I'll say the sweet words

528
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,020
to you only.

529
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,700
Also,

530
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,340
you played the tricks

531
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,580
on me today.

532
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:48,820
Tonight,

533
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,500
you will repay me.

534
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,620
The groom pulls the red silk rope.

535
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,100
- Open the door and welcome the bride.
- He's right.

536
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,780
Nice, nice.

537
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:14,940
- Great.
- Nice.

00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,620
How did you know it was me?

539
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,940
The ropes of the other four people

540
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,460
were pulled so tightly.

541
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:40,740
They didn't want to be
the Princess Huaiyang.

542
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:41,940
But your rope

543
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:42,980
moved with just one pull.

544
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,540
If not you, who else is it?

545
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,700
Good, good, good.

546
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:50,980

His Lordship is not drunk, is he?

586
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,700
Go check on him.

587
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,700
- Go quickly.
- I'm not going.

588
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,220
If I go, they will

589
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,100
ask me to drink.

590
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,060
If everyone gets drunk,
who will guard here?

591
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,500
You-

592
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,540
Don't worry.

593
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,420
He can drink a lot.

594
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,940
I've never seen him get drunk.

595
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,420
Oh, you.

596
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,020
He's really drunk?

597
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,460
Look at him.

598
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,440
What did I say?

599
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,580
He's really drunk.

600
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,380
That means he is truly happy.

601
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:05,740
Moru.

602
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,020
My Lord-

603
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,620
Tell them.

604
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:16,180
They can earn a tael of gold
for each cup of wine.

605
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:21,460
Yes, My Lord.

606
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,340
When did you come in?

607
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,660
Why didn't you wake me up?

608
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,780
You were so lovely when sleeping.

609
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,140
I surely want to watch you a bit longer.

610
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,740
This is too improper of me.

611
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:57,780
Get up.

612
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,340
No need to wear these.

613
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,340
You are so beautiful

614
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,540
right now.

615
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,980
Why didn't you drink more with the guests?

616
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,260
Why getting back so early?

617
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,460
Why should I drink with them?

618
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,740
If they want to drink,

619
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:27,620
they can drink by themselves.

620
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,700
A moment of spring night
is worth its length of gold.

621
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:40,260
I must come back here

622
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:43,220
to accompany my wife.

623
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,420
This is too improper.

624
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:46,820
Others will think

625
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,180
that I called you back.

626
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,900
They will accuse me of being

627
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,140
arrogant due to favoritism.

628
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,300
Then all my effort I made

629
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,820
to learn the rules these days

630
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,060
would be in vain.

631
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,180
Stand here.

632
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,140
You should discard

633
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,260
all these formalities.

634
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:07,980
Besides,

635
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,020
since when did you care about the rules?

636
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,340
Here.

637
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,540
Here.

638
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,580
Sit down, sit down.

639
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:25,820
Sit down.

640
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:32,340
My Lord, you always obey the rules.

641
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,900
Where are your manners now?

642
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,180
Miantang,

643
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,100
I'm warning you.

644
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:46,980
Now you keep calling me Lord.

645
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,060
You only call me Lord.

646
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,060
You don't even call me honey anymore.

647
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,500
No, I won't.

648
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:00,860
Will you say it?

649
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,580
No.

650
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,500
I'll give you one more chance.

651
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:07,620
Will you say it?

652
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,180
No, I won't.

653
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,340
Okay, okay, okay.

654
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,820
I'll say it. I'll say it!

655
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:19,840
Honey.

656
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:29,620
Dear.

657
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:43,780
(Joy)

658
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,820
Lord Huaiyang

659
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,500
has quelled the rebellion
and achieved great merit.

660
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:05,700
He brought back the captives,
further demonstrating his loyalty.

661
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,300
He is hereby promoted
to be the Minister of Works,

662
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,620
and Deputy Minister of War.

663
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,700
He shall assist Minister Shi

664
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,860
to oversee all military affairs
of the nation.

665
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,740
This decree is to be implemented.

666
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,420
Thank you, Your Majesty.

667
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:28,860
Your Lordship.

668
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,560
Your Majesty has asked me
to convey a message.

669
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,780
Military affairs are the foundation
of the nation.

670
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,300
Your Majesty requests you
to set off immediately

671
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,060
and go to the capital to meet the Emperor.

672
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,860
I, Cui Xingzhou,

673
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:39,860
accept the decree.

674
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,740
Since Prince Lu was executed,

675
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:50,060
his illegal properties should have been
confiscated by the nation.

676
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,260
How did they end up in your hands?

677
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,260
It...

678
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,620
It was a moment of weakness.

679
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,580
A moment of weakness?

680
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,500
Lift your head up. Look at me.

681
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,140
Lord Wen, you work

682
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,700
in the Ministry of Revenue.

683
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,740
You're well aware of the Kingdom's laws.

684
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,140
Knowing breaking the law

685
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,140
is an unforgivable crime.

686
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,860
I, I know I was wrong.

687
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,180
Duke Qing, spare my life.

688
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,580
Duke Qing, spare my life, please.

689
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,740
It, it, it...

690
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,020
It was Prince Sui.

691
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:26,700
You know implicating

692
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,300
an imperial official

693
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:29,620
and royal relative

694
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,380
is a very serious crime, right?

695
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,300
I swear I am not lying.

696
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,660
Otherwise, let my entire clan suffer.

697
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,100
Please hear me out.

698
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,620
After Prince Lu was executed,

699
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,540
Prince Sui embezzled many properties

700
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,460
so he needed the Ministry of Revenue

701
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:46,700
to help changing

702
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,020
the names on property deeds

703
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:50,500
to deceive people.

704
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:51,940
Yes,

705
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:53,820
that estate

706
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,700
was used to bribe me.

707
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,460
Private exchange?

708
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,620
It was personally handled by Prince Sui?

709
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,820
Prince Sui never showed himself.

710
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,300
It was all handled by someone

711
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:08,700
known as the Great Master.

712
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:09,620
He sold them off,

713
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,540
turning them into untraceable clean money.

714
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,540
It was also the Great Master

715
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,660
who bribed me.

716
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,340
Who is

717
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:25,460
the Great Master?

718
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,100
I do not know.

719
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,700
He never shows his face.

720
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,740
No one knows his real name.

721
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:40,780
Last night, I searched the residence
of Wen Tinghe and the records

722
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:41,860
of the Ministry of Revenue.

723
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,420
Among the recorded illegal properties
of Prince Lu

724
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,020
with no property deeds,

725
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,020
there are dozens of shops and residences

726
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:51,380
in the capital alone.

727
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,900
Prince Sui has ignored the laws,

728
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,140
allowing his subordinates to bribe people,

729
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,260
and embezzle illegal properties.

730
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:59,980
This is an unforgivable major crime.

731
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,740
I earnestly request Your Majesty

732
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,540
to order a joint trial
by three judicial offices

733
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,500
to thoroughly investigate
the case of Prince Sui's

734
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:07,500
embezzlement.

735
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:08,580
I

736
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:09,700
second this motion.

737
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,060
We already have a witness.

738
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:13,860
As long as we follow the clues,

739
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,060
and find more evidence,

740
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,900
we can confirm the charges
and bring down Prince Sui.

741
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,580
Your Majesty, do you have a good plan?

742
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,460
The most urgent thing now

743
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:24,860
is to find more evidence

744
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,460
of Prince Sui's corruption.

745
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,020
The Great Master

746
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:29,980
mentioned by Wen Tinghe,

747
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:33,060
is very likely a close confidant
of Prince Sui.

748
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,380
At present,

749
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,860
we can only start with Wen Tinghe.

750
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:54,500
My Lord.

751
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:56,780
Why have you come in person?

752
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:58,940
What happened?

753
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,260
Wen Tinghe

754
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:01,580
has been exposed.

755
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:03,500
How come?

756
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,780
He was at the Ministry
of Revenue today.

757
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,780
Our people haven't received any news.

758
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,220
I'm afraid His Majesty used him as bait

759
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:14,260
by letting him return there

760
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:17,500
to lure out the mastermind
behind all of it.

761
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:23,580
They are quite capable now.

762
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,420
They even traced it back to Wen Tinghe.

763
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:34,780
We must act cautiously
in the coming days.

764
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,260
Without my orders,

765
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:37,820
do not act rashly.

766
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:40,500
Never reveal your identity.

767
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:42,420
Understood.

768
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:43,620
Go.

769
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:51,060
My Lord.

770
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:52,900
I'm afraid we have to come up with a way

771
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:54,220
to shut Wen Tinghe

772
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:55,460
up forever.
