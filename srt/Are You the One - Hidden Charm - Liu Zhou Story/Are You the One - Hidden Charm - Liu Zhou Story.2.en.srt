=Episode 2=

14
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,860
Is she very beautiful?

15
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:47,890
She...

16
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,580
This woman

17
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,630
occasionally shows

18
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:57,250
a bit

19
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,300
of something.

20
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,190
Even the most charming bandit's concubine

21
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,100
is just a common beauty,

22
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,980
unworthy of your attention.

23
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,840
Fan Hu said several men

24
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,900
followed Liu today.

25
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,940
A beggar almost followed her home

26
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,350
but did nothing.

27
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,260
Maybe he had ill intentions,

28
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,380
or he could be a spy from Mount Yang.

29
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:37,020
(Cui Mansion)

30
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,470
Is Liu acting with you?

31
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,870
Regardless,

32
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,500
I will interrogate her.

33
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,050
No one can keep secrets

34
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:56,890
from me.

35
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,800
But she seems like a weak woman to me.

36
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,780
Womanly compassion.

37
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:41,910
Honey?

38
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,260
I didn't know you'd return tonight,

39
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,260
so Nanny Li didn't prepare your food.

40
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:19,570
Dear,

41
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,110
did you enjoy your outing today?

42
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,010
Honey,

43
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,490
I bought two shops for you

44
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,550
and set up a new kiln.

45
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,640
And?

46
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:44,450
You...

47
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,110
You know everything?

48
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,960
Today,

49
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,670
I disciplined some rogues in the street.

50
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,800
Upon reflection,

51
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,750
I realized

52
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,310
I was too harsh

53
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,080
and troubled you.

54
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,580
Please forgive me.

55
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,040
If I hadn't mentioned it,

56
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,460
would you have

57
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,260
kept it from me?

58
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,960
What's wrong?

59
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,080
Honey, wait a moment.

60
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,580
This is an indictment I wrote.

61
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,340
Please review it for me.

62
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,040
An indictment?

63
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,860
(Indictment)

64
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,750
(What poor handwriting.)

65
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,730
(It's rare to see such)

66
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,140
(sloppy writing.)

67
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,880
(Was Lu Wen)

68
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,230
(I'm Liu Miantang.)
(just into her looks?)

69
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,700
To Lord Huaiyang?

70
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,930
He's the garrison's nephew.

71
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:53,630
We can only submit it to Zhenzhou County

72
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,760
to ask Lord Huaiyang to uphold justice.

73
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,070
But

74
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,500
my writing is not neat.

75
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,630
Please rewrite it neatly for me.

76
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,820
Chen Tu was injured by you.

77
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:11,260
If we investigate thoroughly,

78
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,670
you'll have to pay for his medicine.

79
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:15,780
Right.

80
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,730
I didn't think clearly.

81
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:19,630
That won't do.

82
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,560
If he blackmails us,

83
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,410
it'd be terrible.

84
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,070
But I'm glad

85
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:30,990
you remembered the martial arts

86
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,230
from the escort agency.

87
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,190
But they don't teach acupuncture

88
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:39,670
with silver needles, right?

89
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,010
Who taught you?

90
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,900
Honey, wait.

91
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,550
When I was recovering,

92
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,240
Physician Zhao gave me

93
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,580
a book on acupressure.

94
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,580
It marks the points clearly.

95
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,310
I was lucky to hit the vital point

96
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,660
(Pulses and Acupoints)
today.

97
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,820
Otherwise, I would have lost my honor.

98
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,630
This isn't a medical book.

99
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,110
It's clearly an assassination manual.

100
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,020
The markings are

101
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:16,790
so gory and explicit.

102
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,380
You shouldn't learn this.

103
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:27,810
Let me.

104
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,080
What's going on?

105
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,100
Shh.

106
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,900
The Lord is interrogating Liu.

107
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,360
Prisoners interrogated

108
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,290
by the Lord

109
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,380
eventually

110
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,360
can't withstand it and end up

111
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,310
confessing everything.

112
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,550
But Liu...

113
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,920
Whatever secrets

114
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,460
she hides

115
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:05,580
will be uncovered by the Lord.

116
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,630
But she

117
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,140
is just a weak woman.

118
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:11,430
Womanly compassion.

119
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,020
(Deed)
These are the deeds for our shop.

120
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,340
The two shops will be combined.

121
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,900
This is the application
for the Commercial Tax Bureau.

122
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,320
(File)
The tax depends

123
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,580
(Applicant)
on the area.

124
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,290
You have the most experience.

125
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,130
Tell me.

126
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:26,800
Which is better, a big one

127
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,750
or two small ones?

128
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,430
Two small ones.

129
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,980
A big one will be larger.

130
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,370
Really?

131
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,820
My family in the capital has managed

132
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,170
properties for years.

133
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:46,210
These matters are handled by the elders.

134
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,070
I only oversee

135
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:48,730
porcelain making.

136
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,430
That's good. I asked the right person.

137
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,220
Today, I also met the porcelain craftsmen.

138
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,960
This is local white porcelain.

139
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,510
See if there are any issues.

140
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,100
The sides

141
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,980
are not very symmetrical.

142
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,440
What else?

143
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:34,650
Using local clay for white porcelain

144
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:35,800
makes it white but not fine,

145
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,640
with many pores.

146
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,190
The bottom

147
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,820
easily forms bumps.

148
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,700
White porcelain isn't suitable here.

149
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:44,650
It cannot be made in Lingquan Town

150
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:45,970
like in the capital.

151
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,910
You've made porcelain for years.

152
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,190
How can you not see it?

153
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:52,050
Bumps and pores.

154
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,240
I thought

155
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,600
they were local features.

156
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,270
So, I didn't point them out.

157
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,340
But I forgot

158
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,040
this one

159
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,700
seemed to be from the capital.

160
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,910
Have you managed everything

161
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:15,220
just to test me now?

162
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,150
I just found it strange.

163
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,190
You don't seem

164
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,100
like a porcelain merchant.

165
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,210
Well.

166
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,270
Nothing escapes your eyes.

167
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,550
I am just a useless dandy.

168
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:53,890
I admit it.

169
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,980
I am a useless dandy.

170
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:01,770
Nanny Li.

171
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:06,550
- Coming.
- Hurry.

172
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,100
- Go, go.
- Coming.

173
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,080
(Contract)

174
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,800
This is the master's only land deed

175
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,220
left in the capital.

176
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,930
It's officially approved.

177
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,160
Also,

178
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,620
the documents for the workers.

179
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,390
You've handled these.

180
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,440
Madam.

181
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,580
Look.

182
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:26,450
Is this your private seal?

183
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,190
I guess.

184
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:30,550
It seems so.

185
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,270
Since you joined the family,

186
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,640
all major

187
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,030
and minor affairs

188
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,100
have been left to you.

189
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,580
Only then can I

190
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,070
focus on chess,

191
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,320
and occasionally

192
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,940
accompany shipments.

193
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,620
But in the end,

194
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,860
I am not as good as you.

195
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,960
Why didn't you

196
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,270
tell me earlier?

197
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,270
I wanted to change

198
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,460
and take responsibility as the master.

199
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,670
But alas...

200
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:11,910
Alas,

201
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,840
he's incompetent,

202
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,100
relying on you.

203
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,440
Nanny Li,

204
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,280
you can leave now.

205
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,150
I can't believe I'm good at business.

206
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:29,980
But why

207
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:31,910
do I have no memory of it?

208
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:34,610
Dear,

209
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,940
don't blame yourself too much.

210
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,340
Forgetting such skills

211
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,670
is not your fault.

212
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,580
Everything will get better.

213
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,550
You're uneasy because you haven't

214
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,270
regained your memory.

215
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,670
It's normal.

216
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,940
I may be

217
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,980
a dandy,

218
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,190
but please don't doubt

219
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,460
our relationship.

220
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,460
Sorry.

221
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:24,790
No need to say that.

222
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:26,910
Then I'll

223
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,460
put the documents away.

224
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:31,150
Go make the bed.

225
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:34,610
I'll sleep

226
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,580
in the room tonight.

227
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,670
Why aren't you asleep?

228
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,040
Not yet.

229
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,580
Honey, you want...

230
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,510
To sleep.

231
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:46,370
Alright.

232
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:04,790
(Did I use)

233
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,310
(to sleep with him like this?)

234
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,700
Can't sleep?

235
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:18,370
No.

236
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,510
I'm thinking about us.

237
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,280
What is it?

238
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,550
We've been married for three years.

239
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,590
Why haven't you taken

240
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,620
any concubines

241
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:31,190
or secondary wives?

242
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:41,770
Dear,

243
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,460
having you alone

244
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,800
is enough.

245
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,640
Alright.

246
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,340
I have no more questions.

247
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,270
(She's starting to suspect me.)

248
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,070
(If she regains her memory,)

249
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:01,620
(she might not confront me directly.)

250
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:04,510
(Rather, she might continue to pretend.)

251
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,790
(But if she doesn't regain her memory,)

252
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,570
(how could a bandit's concubine)

253
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,220
(be so observant?)

254
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,030
(What is Liu Miantang)

255
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,980
(really thinking?)

256
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,450
(It's our first time.)

257
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:28,220
(I shouldn't have drunk so much water.)

258
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,310
(I really need to go.)

259
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,040
What's wrong?

260
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,230
I feel short of breath

261
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:10,750
and my leg is numb.

262
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:20,450
Honey,

263
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,550
why is there a wound on your hand?

264
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,270
Let's sleep.

265
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,510
(I will definitely catch you,)

266
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,320
(Lu Wen.)

267
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,380
(Indictment)

268
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:56,970
Wait a minute.

269
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,410
What is it, dear?

270
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,270
I have a chess game.

271
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,200
The shop is under repair,

272
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,270
so I need you

273
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,410
to go to Zhenzhou County

274
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,420
and submit this indictment to Lord Huaiyang.

275
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,120
That might not be appropriate.

276
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:15,860
Honey, don't be afraid to see officials.

277
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,130
I'm not afraid at all.

278
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,340
What is there to be afraid of?

279
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,640
Fear is natural,

280
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,270
but I've thought about it.

281
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:25,000
Even if he's the garrison's nephew,

282
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,310
he threatened us first.

283
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,420
We're on the right side.

284
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,420
Lord Huaiyang governs Zhenzhou.

285
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,440
It's right for us to seek justice from him,

286
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,410
and it's right for him

287
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:33,310
to be fair.

288
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,100
I agree with you, dear,

289
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,650
but Lord Huaiyang is very busy.

290
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,550
He might not have time for this.

291
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,900
How do you know?

292
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,900
Just a hunch.

293
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:47,750
Even if we submit it,

294
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:49,070
it might not work.

295
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,790
Will Lord Huaiyang overlook
the garrison's fault?

296
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,330
Or is he pretending to be just

297
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,850
but is in fact corrupt?

298
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:58,070
Officials protect each other.

299
00:19:58,410 --> 00:19:59,370
Is the Lord like that?

300
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,420
Of course not.

301
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,310
Why are you upset?

302
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:10,270
I'm angry at that scoundrel.

303
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,310
I know you care for me,

304
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,500
and I believe

305
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,980
you're not one

306
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,140
to fear authority.

307
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:27,820
What a sin.

308
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:51,550
Poor thing.

309
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,570
How can they leave all the hard work

310
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:54,750
to Mrs. Cui?

311
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,540
I heard

312
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,650
Mr. Cui

313
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,380
comes home late and leaves early,

314
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:00,920
never to be seen.

315
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:02,140
So suspicious.

316
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,790
I hope Liu isn't a mistress.

317
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,170
That's right.

318
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,090
It better not be like the Zhang family,

319
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:10,710
causing trouble in the town.

320
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,040
Mrs. Zhao.

321
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,990
Mrs. Yin.

322
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:21,820
This connected shop is grand.

323
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,950
Mrs. Cui, you've worked hard.

324
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,960
I just helped a bit.

325
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,420
My husband works the hardest.

326
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,130
He runs the business every day,

327
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,570
with serious things to do.

328
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:31,410
He's always not home.

329
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:32,510
I feel sorry for him

330
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,990
but don't know whom to tell.

331
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:36,230
I worry that idlers will

332
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:38,000
gossip

333
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,270
about newcomers.

334
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,990
But as a woman, I can't control it.

335
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:44,370
Of course not.

336
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,180
No need to worry.

337
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,140
I'm just venting.

338
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,090
Everyone back home knows

339
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:51,520
I'm a fierce woman.

340
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,200
I'll fight anyone

341
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,550
who slanders my family.

342
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,330
I'll smash their belongings,

343
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:58,680
chop their tongues

344
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,900
and file a complaint.

345
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,680
The western tribes invaded Qizhou's land.

346
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,140
- We had locusts.
- Your Majesty.

347
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,650
- People are starving.
- Eat.

348
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,370
- Go away.
- They are eating wild herbs.

349
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,550
- Calm down.
- His Majesty is having a meal.

350
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,510
Don't mention such bad news.

351
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,480
But...

352
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,720
It missed.

353
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,810
Did Your Majesty win?

354
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,070
I lost.

355
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:22,210
Punish me.

356
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,290
Why are you kneeling?

357
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,810
I'm asking you to flick here.

358
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,800
Hurry up.

359
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,190
Your Majesty,

360
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,340
you're the emperor.

361
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,930
You shouldn't harm yourself.

362
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,790
Come eat.

363
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,620
Empress Dowager,

364
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,440
here are the military reduction plans

365
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,720
from Lord Lin'an of Yuezhou

366
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,710
and Lord Pingdong.

367
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,940
Now,

368
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,660
only Lord Huaiyang of Zhenzhou

369
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,180
hasn't moved his troops.

370
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,140
How dare he?

371
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,790
Garrisoning there.

372
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,380
Does he plan to rebel?

373
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,260
I'm the emperor.

374
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,020
Who dares to anger Mother?

375
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,460
I'll execute them.

376
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,220
Your Majesty.

377
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,940
I'm hungry.

378
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,500
- Someone.
- Yes.

379
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,820
Cook another fish.

380
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,220
Yes.

381
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:37,180
Right and wrong are never clear,

382
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:43,340
like peach blossoms floating in the river.

383
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,740
What did your mentor's letter say?

384
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,940
Why read and burn it?

385
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,820
Same old advice.

386
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,460
The Ministry of War

387
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,140
reviewed my Zhenzhou military records

388
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,100
to supervise the troop reduction.

389
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,620
You command a large army,

390
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,380
making the Empress Dowager uneasy.

391
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,860
She will act against you

392
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,020
sooner or later.

393
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,300
Let's wait it out.

394
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,900
I'm not interested

395
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,620
in this matter right now.

396
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,380
Before the main event,

397
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,500
do you want to watch a show with me?

398
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,780
Come on, why aren't you excited?

399
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,620
Wang?

400
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,300
My Lord.

401
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,540
My Lord.

402
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,860
Why are you detaining my gatekeeper?

403
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,180
Don't worry.

404
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,820
These men

405
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,980
are spies planted in Zhenzhou

406
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,700
by General Shi Yikuan of Qingzhou.

407
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,740
He competes with me

408
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,820
over bandit suppression,

409
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,340
opposing me at every turn in the court.

410
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:55,180
He's been placing men here
for a couple of years.

411
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,700
I caught them all today.

412
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,940
Wang has been

413
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,140
spying on your mansion.

414
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,380
Shi Yikuan might know better

415
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,740
than you

416
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,700
when your mother leaves

417
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,340
and returns home.

418
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,580
I treated you with respect.

419
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,140
Any other lords would've

420
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,500
gouged out your eyes

421
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,100
and cut your tongue.

422
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,060
Please spare us.

423
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,540
Please spare us, My Lord.

424
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,860
Spare us.

425
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,420
Why are you so frightened?

426
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,500
I didn't tell you earlier

427
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,780
to avoid alarming the enemy.

428
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,860
I know Zhenzhou

429
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,460
inside out.

430
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,300
These foreign troublemakers

431
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,580
can't stir up trouble.

432
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,340
Wang,

433
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,900
if you and your family

434
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,060
want to live,

435
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,020
relay a message

436
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,020
to Shi Yikuan as I said.

437
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,060
Understand?

438
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:03,120
Yes, yes. I understand.

439
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,300
Good.

440
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,700
Planting spies around me

441
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,100
is too much.

442
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:23,620
Alright then.

443
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,460
Qingzhou mustn't find out

444
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,900
what I'm doing

445
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,460
because

446
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,750
the fish

447
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,700
has bitten the bait.

448
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,780
Based on this drawing, you

449
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:44,900
conclude that Mount Yang

450
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,300
has found Liu Miantang?

451
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,900
You often go

452
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,060
to Qi's Cloth Shop, right?

453
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,180
Their shop was robbed by Mount Yang.

454
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,460
Next time you visit,

455
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,540
search their shop carefully.

456
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,900
You'll find this mark.

457
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,980
After dealing with him

458
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,700
for three years,

459
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,460
I know the enemy well.

460
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,580
Lu Wen is meticulous.

461
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:09,860
He won't show himself

462
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,620
unless necessary.

463
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,100
I'm just afraid Liu

464
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,980
is pretending to have amnesia

465
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,100
(Cui Mansion)
and stalling.

466
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,780
But that's not important.

467
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,580
Lu Wen wants to see Liu Miantang.

468
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,620
Fine.

469
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,860
As he wishes,

470
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,460
I'll set up

471
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,460
a grand,

472
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,180
reasonable scene

473
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:32,020
so everyone in Lingquan Town

474
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,620
can meet Liu Miantang.

475
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,460
Madam.

476
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,420
Where's the master?

477
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:23,260
(Cui Mansion)

478
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,700
Honey, you're back.

479
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,180
Zhang!

480
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,220
I've found out

481
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,460
you've been deceiving me.

482
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,620
You've been acting all along.

483
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:42,140
Dear, I can't act.

484
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,460
I wouldn't deceive you.

485
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,420
Straw mats are

486
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,200
- indeed ineffective.
- You're lying again.

487
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,140
We'll make more partitions tomorrow.

488
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,900
Mrs. Zhang couldn't help herself

489
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,020
and lost control.

490
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,940
Please understand

491
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,260
this poor woman.

492
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,460
What's wrong?

493
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,900
She thought her husband

494
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,180
was devoted,

495
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,700
but he only wanted

496
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,060
something from her.

497
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,740
He was muddling along.

498
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,380
Every word

499
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,620
was a lie.

500
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,220
How do you know these things?

501
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,420
Only from deep pain would one

502
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,580
feel such sorrow.

503
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,620
What's her plan?

504
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,980
Mrs. Zhang is easily swayed

505
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,420
and manipulated by her husband.

506
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,340
I advised her

507
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,260
to have her brothers

508
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,860
take over the shop,

509
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,060
cutting off Zhang's livelihood.

510
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,700
This way,

511
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,980
he won't have time

512
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,180
for other women

513
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,300
or things

514
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,260
unknown

515
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,380
to Mrs. Zhang.

516
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,420
How miserable and unpredictable.

517
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,180
Every family has its troubles.

518
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,380
Dear,

519
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:50,060
don't get involved in these matters.

520
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,980
What if it's all a lie?

521
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:56,180
They will be exposed someday.

522
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,060
Cui Jiu,

523
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,100
am I really your wife?

524
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,020
Why are you doubting that?

525
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,700
You treat me well,

526
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,220
but you're

527
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,940
distant and aloof.

528
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,220
We don't seem like a normal couple.

529
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,020
I'm not eloquent

530
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,860
or romantic,

531
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,500
so you might

532
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,500
find me cold.

533
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,540
At first, I thought it was

534
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,660
because of your upbringing.

535
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,020
But even when that rogue

536
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,260
insulted me yesterday,

537
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,580
you didn't comfort me
like an ordinary husband would.

538
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,420
Instead, you questioned me all night.

539
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,060
What did you want to know?

540
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,660
You've held a grudge?

541
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,220
I suppose you didn't submit the indictment?

542
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,460
I did.

543
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:05,180
What does Lord Huaiyang's mansion look like?

544
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:10,260
The main gate is red-lacquered
with copper nails

545
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,220
and adorned with eaves lanterns,

546
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,540
two stone lions, and two stone lamps.

547
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,460
The east has a bell tower,

548
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,780
and the west has a yamen.

549
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:20,820
Is that

550
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,300
consistent with what you heard?

551
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,740
I understand your suspicions.

552
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,100
We've been married for three years.

553
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,060
I know you

554
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,740
very well.

555
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,740
You're strong-willed.

556
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,380
You can't tolerate any loss.

557
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,540
If that rogue tried

558
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,060
to extort money,

559
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:40,220
you'd feel guilty all night.

560
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,460
But I only criticized you slightly.

561
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,100
Why are you taking it seriously?

562
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,140
Actually,

563
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,500
you questioning me repeatedly

564
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,500
makes me feel distant.

565
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,060
- I...
- My fault?

566
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,940
Blaming me?

567
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,220
Is it because of you?

568
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,940
I wouldn't blame you for no reason.

569
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,260
You can't brush this off.

570
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,780
Explain it to me.

571
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,700
Why do you leave under the pretext

572
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,540
of playing chess

573
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,540
and have nights out?

574
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,300
I've checked.

575
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,380
You didn't go to the club.

576
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,740
The owner said no one named Cui ever came.

577
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,440
What's your husband's name?

578
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,380
Cui Jiu.

579
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,220
There's no one named Cui here.

580
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,340
Never heard of him.

581
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,380
Cui Jiu,

582
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,580
who am I to you?

583
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,900
I'm not good at chess

584
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,540
but I care about my reputation.

585
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,820
So I used an alias.

586
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:38,860
An alias?

587
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,460
What is it?

588
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:44,900
Jiu...

589
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,180
Jiu...

590
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,340
Jiujiu?

591
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:52,860
Your alias is Jiujiu?

592
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,220
I couldn't beat them,

593
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,140
so I stopped going

594
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,100
and found a teacher.

595
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,780
Really?

596
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:10,980
Yes.

597
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:14,860
Jiujiu.

598
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,780
Dear, stop laughing.

599
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,300
How embarrassing.

600
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,300
Don't let this spread.

601
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,220
Liu,

602
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,540
come out!

603
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,260
Hurry!

604
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,100
Come out now!

605
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,380
I can't see you.

606
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,500
Let me see you.

607
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,820
I need to settle this.

608
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,500
I'm so mad.

609
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,580
Liu!

610
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,860
- It's the neighbor.
- You interfered in my marriage,

611
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:39,420
encouraged my wife to return home,

612
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,460
and ruined my business.

613
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,540
Everyone knows

614
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,180
you're a mistress.

615
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,580
- Mistress!
- Shameless.

616
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:46,500
- Rude!
- Mistress.

617
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,000
- It's his fault.
- You meddler.

618
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:48,860
I'll go scold him.

619
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,440
- No manners.
- Shut up.

620
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,860
The master hasn't spoken yet.

621
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,380
Don't disgrace us.

622
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,480
He likes to scold from the wall.

623
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,330
Go home.

624
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,620
The hot water in the side room

625
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,220
- is still warm.
- Humiliating.

626
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,800
Wait.

627
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,380
Nanny Li,

628
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,500
why did he call my wife a mistress?

629
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,740
The master leaves early and returns late,

630
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,540
while the madam shows herself often.

631
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,820
The neighbors

632
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,620
love gossiping.

633
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,100
Mr. and Mrs. Cui,

634
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,340
don't take it to heart.

635
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:30,940
Rumors are vicious here.

636
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,420
Sorry about this.

637
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:35,820
Nanny Li,

638
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,260
how do we

639
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,940
clear her name?

640
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:41,620
Well.

641
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,460
Master, maybe take her out

642
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,140
more often.

643
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,140
Just taking a walk?

644
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,580
A walk

645
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,960
won't stop them.

646
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,660
They'll still spread rumors.

647
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,100
We need a bold move

648
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,500
to silence the rumors.

649
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,700
Master, you must make good connections.

650
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,460
Connections?

651
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,260
According to Zhenzhou customs,

652
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,540
choose an auspicious day

653
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,940
to invite the local gentry

654
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:13,860
and neighbors

655
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,900
to a banquet.

656
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,060
Traditionally,

657
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,940
the hostess manages it.

658
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,220
When the madam

659
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,620
shows up at the banquet,

660
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,340
it'll naturally prove her status.

661
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:30,620
It also leaves a good impression

662
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,900
among neighbors,

663
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,940
aiding our business.

664
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,540
How convenient.

665
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,540
Alright.

666
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,940
The banquet must have

667
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,540
fine food and wine.

668
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:46,140
Is that necessary?

669
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,100
Yes.

670
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,300
Master, since you've settled here,

671
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,380
a banquet is due

672
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,220
for neighbors here.

673
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,420
Consider it a housewarming.

674
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,460
To ease my worries?

675
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,180
Do you know how much it costs

676
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,580
to hold a banquet?

677
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,130
As long as you're at ease,

678
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,080
spending any amount is worth it.

679
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,420
Honey,

680
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,500
why make such a fuss

681
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,300
over something so insignificant?

682
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,780
How is this insignificant?

683
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,460
Your reputation is

684
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,140
the most important thing in our home.

685
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,380
Yes, yes.

686
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,380
The master

687
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,820
never counts

688
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,420
the cost for the madam.

689
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,340
If you want to make

690
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:28,980
a grand display here,

691
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,420
money can't be saved.

692
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,900
There's a summer villa east of the town,

693
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,060
spacious and ideal.

694
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,140
If you doubt

695
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,700
whether I'm a merchant

696
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,820
or if we are

697
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,140
a married couple,

698
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,500
it's ultimately my fault

699
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:43,820
as a husband.

700
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,260
So, let's

701
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,100
make a grand show

702
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,420
and let others witness it.

703
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:49,620
There will be

704
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:50,980
no more doubts.

705
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,060
Madam.

706
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,180
You know he spent all his money.

707
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,580
Why did you encourage him to hold a banquet?

708
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,980
I'm also worried about the master.

709
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,420
It was the master's idea.

710
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,420
Then why go along with him?

711
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,940
You should be discerning

712
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,020
in managing the household,

713
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,260
knowing what's appropriate

714
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,420
and what's excessive.

715
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,180
How can you be so reckless?

716
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,460
Is it how you do things?

717
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,500
Madam.

718
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:00,100
Think about it.

719
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,300
In this family,

720
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,540
are you the only one

721
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:07,060
who values money?

722
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,020
He's a merchant.

723
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,420
He naturally values money.

724
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,740
Then why did he insist

725
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,940
on such a costly affair?

726
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,020
Merchants prioritize profit.

727
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:33,300
For him to disregard the cost

728
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,460
for me is rare.

729
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,260
Yes.

730
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,220
The master

731
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,940
is sincere.

732
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,460
He said

733
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,460
money could be earned back,

734
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,020
but once trust was broken,

735
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,860
even a thousand gold couldn't restore it.

736
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,980
A local feast is worth it.

737
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,340
Well.

738
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,020
Your concerns

739
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,020
stem from the anxiety

740
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,340
caused by your memory loss.

741
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,980
You're worried and suspicious

742
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,340
because everything

743
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,540
feels unfamiliar.

744
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,780
As they say,

745
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,020
"Care breeds confusion."

746
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,260
The master's methods may seem clumsy,

747
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,220
he's only doing this

748
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,580
to put your mind

749
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,500
at ease.

750
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:19,980
Madam,

751
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,540
do you still have more doubts?

752
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,500
These days,

753
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,780
I only thought about myself.

754
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,340
I haven't considered

755
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,660
how he's been enduring it.

756
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,980
Nanny Li, please prepare

757
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,660
more of his favorite dishes tonight.

758
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,060
What a sin.

759
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,340
What a sin.

760
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,660
The neighbors

761
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,460
can be verbally invited to the feast,

762
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,340
but for business matters,

763
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,660
inviting influential figures

764
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,100
requires formal invitations.

765
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,420
Invitations?

766
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,700
Here's a list of merchants.

767
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:37,020
Please copy these

768
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,220
into the invitations.

769
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:40,860
So many.

770
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,260
And this is a list of officials.

771
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:44,980
Though

772
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,420
some might not attend,

773
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,420
it's proper

774
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:48,260
to extend the invite.

775
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,260
Dear, you

776
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,460
don't have to do this.

777
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,620
Lingquan Town is small.

778
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,740
Those who wish to come will.

779
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,580
What's important

780
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:00,740
is you.

781
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,580
True.

782
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:07,260
In that case, perhaps

783
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,260
I should write the invitations.

784
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,500
Is my handwriting that bad?

785
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:25,660
Indeed.

786
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:27,860
Well.

787
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,140
Let me teach you.

788
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,340
I'm asking for the brush.

789
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,020
First of all,

790
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,980
your problem with writing

791
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:00,940
is with horizontal and vertical strokes.

792
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,580
Practice characters

793
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:04,380
with more horizontal strokes first.

794
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,420
Then I want to write

795
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,900
the character for "wife".

796
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,500
It's better to write

797
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:16,140
the character for "fairness".

798
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,100
You can practice the strokes.

799
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:27,140
The long one needs to start with a pause,

800
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,860
gradually become thinner,

801
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,580
and gradually become thicker.

802
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:33,380
End the stroke.

803
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,940
The short one should start lightly

804
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,620
and gradually get heavier.

805
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,340
End the stroke.

806
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,500
It sounds so sorrowful.

807
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,340
