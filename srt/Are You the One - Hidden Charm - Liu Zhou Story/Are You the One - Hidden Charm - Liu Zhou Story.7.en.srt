14
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,100
We did it!

15
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,890
We finally get the dragonfly pattern.

16
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,890
Good heavens.

17
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,780
I've been working for over ten years.

18
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,240
These plates are the hardest
I've ever fired.

19
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,440
Let's head to the trade guild now

20
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,580
and show them what we've achieved.

21
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:00,670
Let's go.

22
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,260
(Lingquan Town Porcelain Trade Guild)

23
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,110
Stop right there!

24
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,160
Please announce my arrival.

25
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,360
I need to see Young Mr. He.

26
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,810
The Young Mr. He said

27
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,290
he's ill

28
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,340
and isn't

29
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,380
seeing anyone, especially women.

30
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,290
My Lord,

31
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,500
the porcelain trade guild
has submitted a joint report,

32
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,660
accusing the Yushao Porcelain Shop in Lingquan

33
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,640
of illegal land acquisition.

34
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:29,830
Who?

35
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,810
Yushao Porcelain Shop
from the porcelain trade guild.

36
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,240
The trade guild

37
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,920
has been monopolizing

38
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,290
the porcelain business for years.

39
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,780
Ms. Liu only bought a piece of land.

40
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,660
It can't be considered
illegal land acquisition.

41
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,040
I must take this opportunity

42
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,410
to teach the trade guild a lesson.

43
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,220
B-But

44
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,000
the porcelain business

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,320
accounts for a third of

46
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,780
Lingquan Town's tax revenue.

47
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:00,390
Besides, the date for the royal tribute

48
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,570
is just around the corner.

49
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,530
Ms. Liu dared to do that.

50
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,290
She should be the one

51
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,600
to be punished.

52
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,060
Ms. Liu purchased the land legally.

53
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,060
What crime is there?

54
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,200
Sorry...

55
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,940
I made a mistake.

56
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:24,810
How should we handle this case?

57
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,570
I await your instructions,

58
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,340
My Lord.

59
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,920
I've already

60
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,970
cut their taxes

61
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,000
to support their road expansions.

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,520
The routes they choose

63
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,040
are totally up to them,

64
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,940
and Zhenzhou authority

65
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,290
shall not interfere.

66
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,010
Yes,

67
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,690
My Lord.

68
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,970
What are you thinking?

69
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:57,010
Honey,

70
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,000
I was turned away

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,010
by the He family today.

72
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,130
Then I asked around and found out

73
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,760
they accused me of illegal land acquisition

74
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,850
to His Lordship.

75
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,100
I heard about that.

76
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,290
That's not your fault.

77
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,150
Even if this issue

78
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,430
reaches Lord Huaiyang,

79
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,460
you still have a valid case.

80
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,080
But those merchants

81
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,730
have held power in Lingquan for a long time.

82
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,260
I'm afraid Lord Huaiyang

83
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,970
will listen to them.

84
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,230
No, he won't.

85
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,950
From what I know

86
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,220
of Lord Huaiyang,

87
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,410
he will uphold justice

88
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:30,930
and remain unbiased.

89
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:35,220
Right.

90
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,260
How did I not think of that?

91
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,000
Do you trust him now?

92
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,840
No.

93
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,490
I trust you, honey.

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,900
We can't take a hit and stay quiet.

95
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,960
Let's go

96
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,630
meet Lord Huaiyang and petition him

97
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,900
to clear this up.

98
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,190
Honey?

99
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,820
Lord Huaiyang is very busy.

100
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,730
That's why you must help.

101
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,120
You play Go with His Lordship,

102
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,170
so you can introduce me to him.

103
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,370
- I...
- Nanny Li.

104
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,230
Prepare a formal outfit for me.

105
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,370
We'll go to the Mansion of Lord Huaiyang
this afternoon.

106
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,860
(Cui Mansion)

107
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,990
To the Mansion of Lord Huaiyang.

108
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,020
Drive steadily.

109
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,070
Yes.

110
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:31,380
(Cui Mansion)

111
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,220
What a disaster.

112
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,520
Honey.

113
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,520
When we meet His Lordship,

114
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,780
follow my lead.

115
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,430
Follow your lead?

116
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,470
Well,

117
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,510
all you need to do

118
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,610
is build a good rapport with him.

119
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,020
I'll handle the business.

120
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,140
You won't need to say anything.

121
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,780
Don't be so nervous.

122
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,470
His Lordship and Ms. Liu will arrive soon.

123
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,560
You'll pose as a military officer

124
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,460
and meet them.

125
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,640
Don't give away

126
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,480
His Lordship's identity.

127
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,520
But...

128
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,030
Why is it happening so suddenly?

129
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,460
Cut it out now.

130
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,410
If Ms. Liu insists on seeing His Lordship,

131
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,930
tell her he is still at the military camp.

132
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,440
Quickly. Go, go, go!

133
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,280
Alright, alright.

134
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,050
They're here!

135
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,080
Send the owner of Yushao Porcelain Shop in.

136
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,500
It's not the owner of Yushao Porcelain Shop.

137
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,780
It's the members of the trade guild.

138
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,520
They're on their knees at the door
to make a petition.

139
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,410
His Lordship and Ms. Liu are here.

140
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,170
Won't that give it away?

141
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,340
The 12 trade guild members

142
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,660
are asking Lord Huaiyang

143
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,910
to address the Yushao Porcelain Shop's
illegal land acquisition.

144
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:57,520
- Please rule and judge fairly, Your Lordship.
- Please rule and judge fairly, Your Lordship.

145
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,660
Honey, did you hear that?

146
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,390
These merchants are making

147
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,700
nasty accusations right here.

148
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,960
Can't hear it clearly.

149
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,370
Then come here.

150
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,780
- Look at them.
- I...

151
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,220
Come and see for yourself.

152
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,700
I saw it. I saw it.

153
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,410
They won't succeed.

154
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,520
General Huang.

155
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,700
There he is.

156
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,220
Look. There he is.

157
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,530
But that's not His Lordship.

158
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:30,000
Crowding in front of His Lordship's residence,

159
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,840
how disgraceful!

160
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:31,900
Stand up!

161
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:36,260
We didn't mean to disturb His Lordship,

162
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,760
but Mrs. Cui

163
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,600
has been unfair in business

164
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,530
and illegally seized land.

165
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,370
If this isn't resolved,

166
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,100
our livelihoods

167
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,470
will be at risk.

168
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:48,620
Yes.

169
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,410
If I don't sell my stock soon,

170
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,260
my shop will go under.

171
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,410
(The Mansion of Lord Huaiyang)
Please rule and judge fairly.

172
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,660
Please rule and judge fairly, Your Lordship.

173
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,600
Where are you going?

174
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,220
Coachman, let's go back.

175
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,200
We're not seeing His Lordship?

176
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,140
With them causing a scene,

177
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,320
we'd better get out of here.

178
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,160
Exactly.

179
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,370
Besides,

180
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,020
they might not be targeting me.

181
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,400
What do you mean?

182
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,900
They might be targeting Lord Huaiyang.

183
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,840
Where is His Lordship?

184
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,060
Their carriage has left.

185
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,250
It's ridiculous.

186
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,750
This is a joint petition

187
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,820
from 12 trade guild members.

188
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,300
Please give it to His Lordship.

189
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:42,500
(Petition)

190
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,510
(Please favor the guild's annual tax)
Merchants only see profit

191
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,400
(and offer more benefits.)
in everything they do.

192
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,340
If His Lordship punishes me,

193
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,230
the Zhenzhou authority will

194
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,630
have to change its policies.

195
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,710
That will upset the people.

196
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:52,770
If he doesn't punish me,

197
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,870
those merchants

198
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,120
will definitely make

199
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,970
unreasonable demands.

200
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,010
That's not our problem

201
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,610
but Lord Huaiyang's.

202
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,420
Honey, is there a problem?

203
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,490
Are you not feeling well?

204
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,730
Just now,

205
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,190
I bumped into something.

206
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,460
It was too bumpy.

207
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:19,670
Dear,

208
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,610
that's Lord Huaiyang we are talking about.

209
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,770
Even if those members overstep,

210
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,820
His Lordship just needs to be a bit firm,

211
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,100
and they'll back off.

212
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:35,700
If Lord Huaiyang really
resorts to rough measures...

213
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:38,970
If I were him,

214
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,580
I wouldn't do that.

215
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,850
Do you have any good ideas?

216
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,280
Great.

217
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,400
Great.

218
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,990
The colors are applied well,
the brushstrokes are strong,

219
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,110
and the composition is exquisite.

220
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,460
What a magnificent
"Snowy Evening on the Broad Road".

221
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,950
I'll take it.

222
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,120
Mr. Jia.

223
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,420
This painting has been sold.

224
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,640
Sold...

225
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,180
Sold?

226
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,350
To whom?

227
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,430
Well...

228
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,400
I made sure to come

229
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,100
on the agreed day.

230
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:13,680
The buyer

231
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,700
arrived as soon as the market opened

232
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,610
and offered this price.

233
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,250
She'll pick it up after it's mounted.

234
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,430
You know,

235
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,540
I thought it was fate.

236
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,060
Fate?

237
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:30,650
What's fate worth?

238
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,370
She offered this price.

239
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:33,890
I'll offer this price.

240
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,190
So, this painting

241
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,640
is mine.

242
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,460
I can see you really like this painting,

243
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,320
but I can't just back out

244
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,890
and tell the buyer that

245
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,580
the highest bid won it.

246
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,120
How about this?

247
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,750
The buyer seems like

248
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,700
a reasonable lady.

249
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,300
I'll introduce you to her.

250
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,680
And you two

251
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,840
can have tea and a nice chat

252
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,010
at the Zuixian Tavern.

253
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,650
This will be your treat.

254
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,850
See if she'll let you have the painting.

255
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,120
Alright.

256
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,240
Then,

257
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,970
everyone will look good.

258
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:12,710
Yes. Yes.

259
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,200
Hi, Mrs. Xue.

260
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,940
I've been waiting for you.

261
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,510
Whenever your shop gets new fabrics,

262
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,910
I'm always the first to buy them.

263
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,320
- Yes. Exactly.
- Tell me.

264
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,770
What fabric do you have today?

265
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,560
Rain silk brocade from Xizhou.

266
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,280
The weave is as delicate as rain threads,

267
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,830
perfect for jackets.

268
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,730
And we only have one bolt.

269
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,480
So it's better than

270
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,460
Liu's watered gauze?

271
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,650
I'll take the rain silk brocade.

272
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,560
Mrs. Xue,

273
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,490
what a coincidence.

274
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,460
I'm here first.

275
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,320
If that's the case,

276
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,700
I won't take what you love.

277
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,490
It's not that much.

278
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,710
Mrs. Cui,
since you didn't join the trade guild,

279
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,100
how's your business doing lately?

280
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,060
You've hit the nail on the head.

281
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:03,010
Someone invited me for business

282
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,460
and reserved the best private room
at Zuixian Tavern for the morning.

283
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,350
Right.

284
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,890
I heard

285
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,750
members of the trade guild

286
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:14,920
haven't been eating

287
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,100
or sleeping well.

288
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,120
Yet here you are buying fabric,

289
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,400
Mrs. Xue.

290
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,590
Then I guess your family

291
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:22,370
has figured out how to transport the porcelain.

292
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:30,540
I'd like to see

293
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,680
who is doing

294
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,180
business with her.

295
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,920
- Let's go.
- Mrs. Xue.

296
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,180
Do you want the fabric?

297
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:39,730
Mr. Jia, this way please.

298
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,590
This way, please.

299
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,350
Mr. Jia,

300
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,770
this is the buyer of the painting.

301
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,710
I heard someone wants to
get the painting from me,

302
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,340
but I didn't expect it to be an old friend.

303
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:58,160
Ms. Liu must have gone to

304
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,820
great lengths to see me.

305
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,700
So you know each other?

306
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,460
That would be best.

307
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,370
Whoever gets this painting will be good.

308
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,420
I'll leave you to it.

309
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,650
Call me if you need anything.

310
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,010
I have nothing to talk about with her.

311
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,770
It's just a painting.

312
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,060
I don't want it now.

313
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,060
Mr. Jia, are you really sure about that?

314
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,800
True.

315
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,990
The scenery in this painting

316
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,610
mirrors your current situation.

317
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,130
Not buying it to avoid troubling your family

318
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,130
is a wise choice.

319
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,010
What do you mean?

320
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,180
Mr. Jia,

321
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,250
since you're here,

322
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:46,820
why not sit down
and appreciate this painting with me?

323
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,250
It might ease your mind.

324
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,850
That's right.

325
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,830
Please, take your time to appreciate it.

326
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,130
I'll wait outside.

327
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,240
- Stay.
- Stay.

328
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,550
Alright.

329
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,120
Let's make a deal.

330
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,100
We'll only discuss the scenery in the painting.

331
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,730
No business.

332
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,190
Deal.

333
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,340
This painting is called

334
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,300
"Snowy Evening on the Broad Road".

335
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,460
Mountain villagers lead
a horse team carrying goods

336
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,300
but encounter a severe snowstorm.

337
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,770
When they reach the deep mountains,

338
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,750
they might run out of food

339
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,060
and starve.

340
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,890
Honestly,

341
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,700
what does that mean?

342
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,100
When resources are exhausted,

343
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,490
eating horse meat is also an option.

344
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,060
But which horse

345
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:50,820
will they choose to slaughter first?

346
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,630
A horse team can't do without a lead horse,

347
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:54,700
so the lead horse must be spared.

348
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,160
The young horse is strong

349
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,850
and has great potential.

350
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,840
But the second old horse

351
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,250
after the lead horse,

352
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,060
which bears the most burden

353
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,220
and suffers the most,

354
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,100
has a bleak future.

355
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,650
Wrong, wrong.

356
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,850
This painting focuses on
the snow and mountains,

357
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,080
not the horses.

358
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,920
Let her continue.

359
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,220
Why does the second horse

360
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:21,340
have a bleak future?

361
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,250
When the snowstorm hits,

362
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,610
the lead horse has its own
survival strategies.

363
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,060
The young horse,

364
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,420
though weak,

365
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,340
isn't burdened.

366
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:34,420
Only the second horse,

367
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,350
which isn't as strong as the lead horse,

368
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,560
carries a load equal to

369
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,730
the lead horse's.

370
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,800
With each layer of snow,

371
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,300
the risk increases.

372
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,850
While other horses can endure,

373
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:47,180
this second horse can't afford any delay.

374
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,180
If this continues,

375
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:50,970
the second horse

376
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,940
is likely to be the first one to die.

377
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,300
If the villagers spread the load

378
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,730
among these horses and work together,

379
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,130
they might make it through the snowfield.

380
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,490
Mr. Jia, you must know best

381
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:12,420
how the burden is shared.

382
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,300
As for the so-called unity,

383
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,610
is it about sharing the hardships,

384
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,480
or is it just an excuse from the lead horse

385
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,890
to prevent others from surpassing it?

386
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,540
After all, if I can figure it out,

387
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,250
so can you

388
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,970
and others, for sure.

389
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:39,710
Yes. That's right.

390
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,710
I didn't expect such a simple painting

391
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,520
to have such deep meaning.

392
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,880
I've gained a lot from it.

393
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,610
Ms. Liu.

394
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,820
Although you are a woman,

395
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:55,850
you truly have a great
understanding of paintings.

396
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,460
I admire you.

397
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,870
Are you saying that women

398
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,590
are only meant to manage the household,

399
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,370
and make meals and bed?

400
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,120
Are women not allowed

401
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,510
to appreciate fine art

402
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:09,170
and elegant porcelain?

403
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,230
What men can do,

404
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,450
women can do too.

405
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,060
The only real difference

406
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,580
lies in people's hearts.

407
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,750
Mr. Jia, if you buy this painting,

408
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,210
we'll become fellow art enthusiasts.

409
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,850
From now on,

410
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,160
we can appreciate

411
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,960
this "The Broad Road" painting

412
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,540
and the beauty of art together.

413
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,270
Mr. Jia, if you

414
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,130
could introduce more art enthusiasts,

415
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,210
we could enjoy it together.

416
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,370
It would turn personal joy into shared joy.

417
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,300
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

418
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,520
Mr. Jia,

419
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,200
since you bought "The Broad Road" painting
for a high price,

420
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,370
please take good care of it.

421
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,130
Gentlemen, please.

422
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:53,640
I didn't expect Ms. Liu to transfer

423
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,740
this painting to me.

424
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,780
Congratulations, Mr. Jia.

425
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:02,160
Madam, will Mr. Jia's words

426
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,740
really help you join the trade guild?

427
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,480
Let's go home.

428
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,820
Good news will come.

429
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,270
I saw and heard everything myself

430
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,370
at Zuixian Tavern.

431
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,500
Mr. Jia spent a fortune to buy
the painting "The Broad Road" from Liu.

432
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,820
They were talking in a private room

433
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:27,530
and had a middleman involved.

434
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:28,610
Yes, Master.

435
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,270
I also saw it clearly.

436
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,340
- Let them through.
- On the land in Shuangling Village,

437
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,370
Liu allowed a convoy to pass.

438
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,170
It's most likely from the Jia family.

439
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,160
They were talking

440
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,000
at Zuixian Tavern.

441
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,020
Jia even

442
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,840
found a middleman

443
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,300
to persuade Liu Miantang.

444
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,500
They were talking

445
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,540
about "The Broad Road" or something.

446
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,480
Also,

447
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,890
there was a lot of silver on the table.

448
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,640
I mean it.

449
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,880
My wife saw

450
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,170
and heard everything.

451
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,410
It can't be wrong.

452
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,070
Young Mr. He.

453
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,850
We have no tea here.

454
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,260
We haven't found the trade guild's

455
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,540
main transport route.

456
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:28,070
We didn't talk much,

457
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:29,200
and there was nothing we could do.

458
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,060
So we didn't feel thirsty.

459
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,150
Right.

460
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,240
Not thirsty at all.

461
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,680
Come.

462
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:36,590
Serve the tea.

463
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,020
Mr. Jia probably feels thirsty

464
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,580
because

465
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,210
he talks a lot.

466
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:49,400
Do you have any good ideas

467
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,820
about our main transport route?

468
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,440
I'm also worried about this.

469
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,370
What good ideas could I have?

470
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,020
Everyone is at a loss.

471
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:07,550
But just sitting here
and staring at each other

472
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,390
isn't

473
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,690
going to help.

474
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,200
True.

475
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:12,820
How about this?

476
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,310
Let's all

477
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,580
go to Shuangling Village,

478
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,550
take a look,

479
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,850
and see

480
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,650
that "broad road".

481
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:23,150
Okay.

482
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,690
That's a good idea.

483
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,120
Maybe

484
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,300
we can see Liu

485
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,500
in Shuangling Village.

486
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,300
We can also take this chance

487
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,370
to meet and talk to her.

488
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,170
- Yes.
- Mr. Jia,

489
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,390
what do you think?

490
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,120
What's the point

491
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,500
of going to a remote village?

492
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,520
Besides,

493
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,130
Liu might not even be there.

494
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,300
Mr. Jia,

495
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,030
that's not what I meant.

496
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,740
We might not

497
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,650
necessarily see Liu.

498
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,580
That place is flat.

499
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,890
Perhaps we can find a suitable place

500
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,650
to build a road.

501
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,650
As long as we

502
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,300
work together,

503
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,930
we will certainly find a solution.

504
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,130
Mr. Jia, what do you think?

505
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,300
The route in Shuangling Village

506
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,500
is the only flat one nearby.

507
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,020
And also,

508
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,580
building a road

509
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,100
would cost a lot of money

510
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:20,410
and consume much time.

511
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,930
No route would be better than the current one.

512
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,740
So, I think that is not a good idea.

513
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:28,110
I suggest

514
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,260
we give it another thought.

515
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,520
Give it another thought.

516
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,750
There might be a better solution.

517
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:34,540
A better solution.

518
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,210
By sowing discord.

519
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,740
Since you already know,

520
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,060
I won't tell you more.

521
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,540
No, no. Dear.

522
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,130
I'm not that smart.

523
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,790
Please tell me clearly

524
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,930
how to help our

525
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,310
Yushao Porcelain Shop

526
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,480
join the trade guild

527
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,540
openly and honestly.

528
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,070
Buying the land in Shuangling Village

529
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:57,000
seems like a way to control

530
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,060
the land transport route.

531
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,780
Actually,

532
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,850
I don't intend to trouble the merchants.

533
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,890
It's just that they are stubborn

534
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,300
and refuse to do business fairly with me.

535
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:11,300
So you sowed discord among them?

536
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,410
Merchants prioritize profit.

537
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,740
Even long-term partners

538
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,400
don't have

539
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,370
solid trust.

540
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,690
Especially when they hear

541
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,600
that someone has secretly allied with me

542
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,890
for transport benefits,

543
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,780
they'll waver.

544
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:30,030
Moreover, I let the so-called

545
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:32,650
Jia's convoy pass.

546
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,060
But Lord Huaiyang didn't
cut off their livelihood.

547
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:37,550
He only made them

548
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,740
wait an extra month.

549
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:42,270
Will they betray the trade guild

550
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,300
for this momentary loss?

551
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,750
Those merchants

552
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,170
are all sharp.

553
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,550
Every day goods are stored in the warehouse

554
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,740
is a day of real money lost.

555
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:53,960
Now,

556
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,990
they all think

557
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,930
Mr. Jia and I are in collusion.

558
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,060
At present,

559
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,170
the most anxious

560
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,270
are those from the trade guild,

561
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,600
except for the He family.

562
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,740
Especially the Xue family,
who hold the third leadership role.

563
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,270
They will definitely come

564
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,540
seeking help from me.

565
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,020
Dear, your reasoning

566
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,890
is very clear.

567
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,170
As long as we open the door with Mr. Xue,

568
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,030
the others in the trade guild

569
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,210
won't stay idle.

570
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,270
Once they get tangible benefits

571
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,690
from me,

572
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,000
who would risk

573
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,790
offending Lord Huaiyang

574
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,130
to cause trouble?

575
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,740
This way, we will gain benefits,

576
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,440
and Lord Huaiyang's troubles

577
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,440
won't affect

578
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,650
our family.

579
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,100
Our family can't get by

580
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:40,780
without you, dear.

581
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,780
Stupid!

582
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:47,550
How could you?

583
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,070
I was ill

584
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,060
for a few days,

585
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,610
and now the trade guild

586
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:59,580
is in such a major upheaval and mess!

587
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,170
Submitting the petition,

588
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,500
and protesting at the Mansion of Lord Huaiyang!

589
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,850
Who gave you the courage?

590
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,890
Who gave you the courage?

591
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,930
Are you trying

592
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:16,850
to kill me by doing that?

593
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,740
No, Father.

594
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,580
You can't blame me.

595
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,780
It's all Liu's fault.

596
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,130
She's going too far!

597
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,130
Besides,

598
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,930
aren't we close with the Prefect?

599
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,310
Why isn't he doing anything now?

600
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,740
Shut up!

601
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,520
You...

602
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,500
You don't know your mistake yet,

603
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,300
do you?

604
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:43,130
From tomorrow,

605
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,830
hand over

606
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,850
all business matters to Zhen.

607
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,170
You need to start over from scratch!

608
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,980
Come on, Father, this isn't necessary.

609
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,120
Give me another chance.

610
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,240
I'll get that land back for you.

611
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,750
I-I'll definitely make

612
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:58,790
Liu Miantang regret it.

613
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,890
- Get out of here!
- Is that okay?

614
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,450
I don't...

615
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:06,210
I don't want to see you right now.

616
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,350
Go.

617
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,350
Get out!

618
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,650
Get lost!

619
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,520
Father,

620
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,890
don't be angry.

621
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:20,100
Calm down.

622
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,860
(Lingquan Town Porcelain Trade Guild)

623
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,510
- Ms. Liu.
- Ms. Liu.

624
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:13,850
- Please come in.
- Please come inside.

625
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,120
Truly fine porcelain.

626
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:44,960
Fine porcelain.

627
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,880
- It's so beautiful.
- Look at the color.

628
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,890
So exquisite!

629
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,240
Yes.

630
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,550
This is high-quality porcelain.

631
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:51,980
Yes, it's top quality.

632
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,480
Such craftsmanship

633
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,820
is top-notch.

634
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:56,930
Amazing.

635
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:04,240
(Auspice and Fortune)

636
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:05,210
Ms. Liu.

637
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,370
Miss He.

638
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,210
I want to congratulate you.

639
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,790
Also, your porcelain dragonfly pattern

640
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:18,120
is lifelike.

641
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,410
I admire it greatly.

642
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,270
Miss He, you wouldn't believe

643
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:23,170
how many times I messed up
this dragonfly pattern.

644
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,300
But,

645
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:26,030
even with many difficulties,

646
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,230
as long as the raw materials are good,

647
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,930
it will succeed eventually.

648
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,170
Don't you think so?

649
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,760
My Lord,

650
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,470
news from Lingquan Town.

651
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:43,410
Ms. Liu has officially joined the trade guild.

652
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,980
If you want to meet with the guild members,

653
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,160
Ms. Liu will...

654
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,980
You keep addressing her Ms. Liu.

655
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,930
She's very meticulous.

656
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,400
If one day, you say

657
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,340
something wrong in front of her,

658
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,170
what am I supposed to do?

659
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,650
From now on, call her Madam.

660
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:09,630
Yes.

661
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,840
My Lord,

662
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,150
here are today's letters.

663
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,780
The trade guild is causing trouble again.

664
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:24,440
(Celadon bowl with floral impressions)
This is the registry of imperial tribute

665
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,590
(Celadon bowl with floral impressions)
porcelain sent by Mr. He

666
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,890
(Celadon bowl with floral impressions)
for your review and approval.

667
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,930
Master, Madam,

668
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,160
the trade guild's caravans

669
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,400
have been allowed to pass as agreed,

670
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,690
and the merchants have ceased their protests.

671
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,170
Okay.

672
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,850
How does it taste?

673
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:02,540
It's a treat for the eyes and the taste buds.

674
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,520
Honey,

675
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,340
teach me to write a few more characters later.

676
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,350
Okay.

677
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,890
Today, let's write

678
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,060
"a strategic planning".

679
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,410
I'll go get the brush and ink.

680
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,540
Liu!

681
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,100
Come out here!

682
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,740
Liu!

683
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,800
Come out!

684
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:34,630
Liu!

685
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,300
Come out!

686
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,800
Nanny Li.

687
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,240
Liu Miantang! You played dirty!

688
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,580
- Who's that?
- Master.

689
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,130
- It's Young Mr. He.
- Own up to it!

690
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,740
- He's up to no good.
- Now you're a coward, huh?

691
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:46,830
Open the door.

692
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:50,940
(Cui Mansion)

693
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,020
Come out!

694
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:58,910
You must be

695
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,340
that woman's husband, right?

696
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,610
I'm Cui Jiu.

697
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,150
What do you want?

698
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,500
You really

699
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,060
have a big heart.

700
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,830
A woman

701
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:11,840
should be managing the household.

702
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,130
Now she is out in the public eye every day.

703
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,500
Are you totally fine with that?

704
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,130
I trust my wife.

705
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,450
I heard you are a Go player.

706
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,720
You must be seeing things

707
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,340
through rose-colored glasses.

708
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,200
After all,

709
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,690
you don't have much experience.

710
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,640
Do you know

711
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,270
who your wife deals with every day?

712
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:37,480
And do you know what she did to secure

713
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,780
that prime piece of land?

714
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,450
She deals with

715
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,470
the dirty trade guild.

716
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:44,060
She's come this far

717
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:46,790
through her own vision and determination.

718
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:47,850
Her vision?

719
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,370
Ridiculous.

720
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,120
We, the trade guild members,

721
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,120
couldn't get it done.

722
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,720
She's just a young woman,

723
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,880
and she managed to do it?

724
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,070
But this young lady

725
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:58,340
is more capable than all you men.

726
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,160
I'm not wasting my breath with you.

727
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,270
Bring Liu out here.

728
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,450
I need to ask her something.

729
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,360
What are you doing?

730
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,450
Let me go!

731
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:14,130
If you dare speak ill of my wife again,

732
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,820
you might

733
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,580
lose that arm.

734
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,340
Fine, you...

735
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,100
You listen to everything that woman says, huh?

736
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,170
You're not much of a man!

737
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,340
You... I...

738
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,020
My husband is righteous and kind.

739
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,020
He supports his family.

740
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,030
Unlike you, who fails

741
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:42,930
at everything,

742
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:44,440
and is only capable of bullying

743
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,260
the weak and women,

744
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:48,300
he's a real standup man.

745
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,720
Alright.

746
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,000
You...

747
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,720
Wait for it.

748
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,890
Just you wait!

749
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:03,380
(Cui Mansion)

750
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,040
Clear out!

751
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:10,690
- He escaped.
- Nanny Li.

752
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:13,370
Wipe the door.

753
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,160
Stop looking.

754
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,130
Go away.

755
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,280
You're good.

756
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,660
(Tea)

757
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:28,050
Take a look!

758
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,990
It's so fresh. Have a look.

759
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,830
(Cold Rain Courtyard)
Give me some of that.

760
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,880
- Okay, that's enough.
- Here you are.

761
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,400
Thank you.

762
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,110
Young Master.

763
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:55,860
(Cold Rain Courtyard)

764
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:56,910
Young Master?

765
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,690
You're back.

766
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,680
Young Master.

767
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,850
I sent Zhou Cuo to Lingquan Town
to pick someone up.

768
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,310
Yet, under my name,

769
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,510
you sent him halfway north

770
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,850
and went to Zhenzhou yourself

771
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,930
without bringing her back.

772
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,600
Sorry, I took matters into my own hands.

773
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,440
Why?

774
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,990
Ms. Liu left Mount Yang

775
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:22,410
in a huff with me,

776
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,500
so

777
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,820
I wanted to explain things to her in person.

778
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,200
Moreover,

779
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,890
I feared that might trouble you.

780
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:35,020
So I went alone without informing you.

781
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,690
How is she now?

782
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:39,610
Ms. Liu

783
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,540
found her true love

784
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:45,340
and married an ordinary merchant.

785
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:48,230
When she saw me that day,

786
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:50,160
she didn't want to say a single word.

787
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,130
She turned and walked away.

788
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,760
So I think

789
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,370
she still holds a grudge against us,

790
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,600
wanting to sever all ties

791
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,580
with Mount Yang.

792
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,210
Sever all ties?

793
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,170
Could she really let go?

794
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,170
What are you going to do?

795
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,860
Since she won't come to me,

796
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,330
I'll go to her

797
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:24,210
and explain everything.

798
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,640
No.

799
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:28,380
Lingquan Town is under Lord Huaiyang's control.

800
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,510
Going there

801
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:30,810
would be like walking into a trap.

802
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:34,770
Young Master, don't forget

803
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,900
we have more important things to handle.

804
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,330
Are you making crab roe rice?

805
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,720
Yes.

806
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,170
My mother taught me this.

807
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:14,510
When I was a child,

808
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:15,590
she often made this dish

809
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:16,430
for my father and me.

810
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,540
She said

811
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,920
crab roe rice

812
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,360
is best enjoyed

813
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,250
with someone you love.

814
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,630
We've bought

815
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,250
a lot of crabs in the past,

816
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,610
but I don't remember you ever making this.

817
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,730
Why do you suddenly want to make it now?

818
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,730
Are the scallions chopped?

819
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:39,020
Yes, they're ready.

820
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,680
Here.

821
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:51,940
What's wrong?

822
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,770
It's not hot.

823
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,190
Soft and glutinous.

824
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,030
Delicious.

825
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,080
Tasty, right?

826
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,250
I'll serve myself.

827
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,360
Why do you need to be coaxed

828
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,500
just to eat

829
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:14,650
like a child?

830
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:25,460
Madam, dinner is ready.

831
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:26,910
Okay.

832
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:28,580
I'll be right back.

833
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,760
Go ahead, taste it.

834
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,720
How is it?

835
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:18,480
Even more delicious

836
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,540
than the usual June yellow crabs.

837
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,400
I simmered the male crab's roe
to make crab fat,

838
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,940
and stir-fried the female crab's roe.

839
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,960
I used black pig lard for flavor

840
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,470
and mixed it with steaming hot rice.

841
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,470
The hotter, the better.

842
00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:31,290
That's how to bring out the original taste.

843
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,030
Exactly.

844
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:43,670
Madam, even with your old injury,

845
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:45,980
you insisted on picking out
the crab roe yourself.

846
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,190
Next time,

847
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,980
just ask me to do it.

848
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,250
It's okay.

849
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:16,350
Is it hurt?

850
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:23,770
The rice will get cold.

851
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,020
It took me so long to make it.

852
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,280
My arms are sore.

853
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,250
Who's that at this late hour?

854
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,020
Coming.

855
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:40,610
Who is it?

856
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,810
It's me,

857
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,330
Physician Zhao.

858
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:44,470
Today,

859
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,500
I bought some crabs

860
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,500
and stopped by

861
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,460
to let Ms. Liu have a taste.

862
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,880
I-I didn't know why

863
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,460
Physician Zhao would bring crabs today.

864
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,020
I invited him.

865
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,650
It's better to save trouble.

866
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:03,760
Honey, you go meet Physician Zhao.

867
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,730
I'll go to the backyard.

868
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:05,680
Okay.

869
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,200
Master.

870
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,240
Where is she?

871
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,720
Who?

872
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,120
Well,

873
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,360
where's Ms. Liu?

874
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,540
Why do you care?

875
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,170
Do you even know where your true home is?

876
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,610
Cousin Lian asked me to bring this to you.

877
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:55,190
Good for her for finding you.

878
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,380
Although she didn't say anything,

879
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:58,470
I could see in her eyes that she was thinking,

880
00:40:58,470 --> 00:40:59,990
"You, Zhao Quan, are no good.

881
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,210
All men are the same."

882
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,720
Give it to me.

883
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,330
So delicious!

884
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,210
This wasn't made by Nanny Li, was it?

885
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,540
Move your chopsticks away.

886
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,130
W-What do you mean?

887
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,610
It wasn't made for you.

888
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,800
If you want to eat,

889
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:28,980
go back home.

890
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,860
Are you jealous?

891
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:36,060
No.

892
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,160
It's mine.

893
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,210
Then why don't you share some with me?

894
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,760
These are for you.

895
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,650
Have as much as you like.

896
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,130
Are you really jealous?

897
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,460
Then it's right.

898
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:53,810
Right about what? I'm not jealous.

899
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,160
You

900
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,380
are not interested in her,

901
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,510
and in her confusion,

902
00:41:58,510 --> 00:41:59,580
she mistakes you for her husband.

903
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:02,190
This doesn't even count as

904
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:03,030
the start of a romance.

905
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,110
What if she meets a man

906
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:06,240
who truly wins her heart...

907
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,380
That won't be you.

908
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,770
Why not?

909
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,610
I'm so charming.

910
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:11,910
I can be the one.

911
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:13,100
Give me a bite.

912
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,120
What are you doing?

913
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,760
Nanny Li,

914
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,080
clear the dishes.

915
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,460
Since Ms. Liu joined the trade guild,

916
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:46,110
she's taken over the He's
imperial tribute business.

917
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:48,020
She's been well-regarded
by the other members.

918
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,550
Business at the Yushao Porcelain Shop

919
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:50,860
is thriving.

920
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,860
This month,
it brought in over 300 taels of silver.

921
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,720
My Lord?

922
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:02,430
My Lord?

923
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:06,670
Yes. She's more interesting

924
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:08,380
than I initially thought.

925
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:11,280
Ms. Liu has diligently taken

926
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,100
on the role of hostess for the Cui family.

927
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,580
But what if

928
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,170
she finds out the truth later on...

929
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:22,460
Please forgive me for being blunt,

930
00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:23,460
My Lord,

931
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,580
but have you started falling for her?

932
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,810
I don't want to trouble her with rules.

933
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:31,020
So let her be.

934
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:33,580
Let her

935
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,170
earn enough for her future.

936
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:37,690
Once I catch Lu Wen,

937
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:40,130
this playing house game

938
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:41,580
will be over.

939
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,650
Now I understand, My Lord.
