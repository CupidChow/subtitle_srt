Sure.

16
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,590
Okay, this one's done.

17
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,250
Zhao Quan?

18
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,500
Put it over there.

19
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:05,890
Miss He.

20
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,670
I've taken care of everything

21
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,060
you asked for.

22
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,680
Why are you still here?

23
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,520
Well.

24
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,810
I'm here to work.

25
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,060
I heard from the kiln workers

26
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,900
that you're aiming beyond this.

27
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,960
You want porcelain

28
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,460
that will be admired for generations.

29
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,480
How could I miss out

30
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,530
on something like that?

31
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:24,990
Besides,

32
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,680
I've caused you so much trouble.

33
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,660
I have to work hard to repay you.

34
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,510
What's wrong?

35
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,240
You've always lived a life of luxury,

36
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,460
used to the finest porcelain.

37
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,970
You can't handle this kind of rough work.

38
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,570
I'm not picky.

39
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,290
I mean

40
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,180
the more meticulous a person is,

41
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,220
the more meticulous the work they should do.

42
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,570
Miss He.

43
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,660
No one knows me better than you.

44
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,960
I am a meticulous person.

45
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,800
Think about it.

46
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,710
When I was learning acupuncture,

47
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,150
I could only practice on myself.

48
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,240
This rough work is beyond me.

49
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,730
I can only do the delicate tasks.

50
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,920
Are you serious?

51
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,760
I am.

52
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,850
If you want to try, then come with me.

53
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,800
You rough man.

54
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,940
Is this the most meticulous task?

55
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,970
He refused?

56
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,380
He didn't say it outright,

57
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,180
but right after the marriage was decreed,

58
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,060
he broke his leg.

59
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,360
If

60
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,970
it's not bad luck,

61
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,570
it's deliberate.

62
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,130
Either way,

63
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,870
we can't let her

64
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,780
marry a cripple.

65
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,520
I never wanted to marry

66
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,970
Lord Huaiyang anyway.

67
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,380
During the spring hunt, he didn't let me win.

68
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,520
If I marry him,

69
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,590
who knows how arrogant he'll become?

70
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,530
It's good that he fell.

71
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,460
See? See?

72
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,380
It seems Wuhua really has no interest

73
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,780
in Lord Huaiyang.

74
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,220
Falling off the horse

75
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,170
was fate's way.

76
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,490
People make their destinies.

77
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,660
By doing this,

78
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,780
he clearly doesn't regard me.

79
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,190
But you bestowed the marriage

80
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,340
without consulting me.

81
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,370
Did you consider my feelings?

82
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:36,930
It seems

83
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,590
Cui Xingzhou

84
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,580
has shattered his leg,

85
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,460
half-paralyzed in bed.

86
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,790
How could someone

87
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,370
do this to themselves

88
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,290
just to refuse a marriage?

89
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,320
I fear he did it

90
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,780
on purpose to show others.

91
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,100
He requested an imperial decree...

92
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,970
What decree?

93
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,700
I believe

94
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,760
Lord Huaiyang's leg injury is real,

95
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,020
and the fall was deliberate.

96
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,440
The Grand Empress Dowager

97
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,640
granted the marriage

98
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,580
out of respect and to ensure his safety.

99
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,800
But the Lord already holds

100
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,320
great military power

101
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,260
and has just achieved an extraordinary victory.

102
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,470
If he marries the Princess now,

103
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:26,700
there will inevitably be rumors
in the court.

104
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,100
So I suspect

105
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,290
that the Lord allowed
the marriage news to spread

106
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,710
and then fell off his horse
to protect the Lord of Beizhou's son.

107
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:37,790
This way,

108
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,640
he can gain the great-grandmother's favor,

109
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,610
making sure Lord of Beizhou can't touch him,

110
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,590
while also showing Your Majesty

111
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,610
that he won't become arrogant

112
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,460
or form factions.

113
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:56,550
Great-grandmother,

114
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,640
I have some official matters.

115
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,530
I must take my leave.

116
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,020
Xueji.

117
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,850
I think what you said makes sense.

118
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,100
Empress,

119
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,020
His Majesty has summoned you to Qinying Hall.

120
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,110
Your Majesty.

121
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,720
Please sit.

122
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,820
You haven't had lunch yet, have you?

123
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,850
These dishes are prepared for you.

124
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:08,970
Thank you, Your Majesty.

125
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:25,630
Eat.

126
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,360
Yes.

127
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,680
Your Majesty, Your Highness,

128
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,520
please enjoy.

129
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,900
I know

130
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,730
you're upset.

131
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,590
Earlier today at Yongshou Palace,

132
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,290
the things I said were meant

133
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,560
to comfort the Grand Empress Dowager,

134
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,140
but they went against your wishes.

135
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,260
Please, forgive me.

136
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:29,870
This...

137
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,100
It's not my last meal, is it?

138
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,970
I just wanted some peace.

139
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,100
Does watching me eat give you

140
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:49,850
peace?

141
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,160
Eat.

142
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:22,660
(Laixi Courtyard)

143
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,770
Why are you here again?

144
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,060
How could you be so heartless?

145
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,400
Aren't you going to ask about my leg?

146
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,840
It hurt so much last night.

147
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,130
I could hardly sleep.

148
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,580
Didn't I get this injury at your place?

149
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,940
I couldn't recover back there,

150
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,490
so I came here to heal.

151
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,470
Lord of Beizhou's place
has the best physicians.

152
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,650
Please return.

153
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,520
Fine.

154
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,720
I'll just go tell Lord of Beizhou

155
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,630
that I got this injury

156
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,110
at your Qiao family's place.

157
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,950
Cui Xingzhou.

158
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,770
Why are you acting like a stray dog?

159
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,610
I have a master, don't I?

160
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,580
Since you do,

161
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,890
I can put you wherever I want, right?

162
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,250
No. No need to be so quick.

163
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:37,990
There's an old story.

164
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:39,540
A lazy man named Lan Dong had pastry

165
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,100
but starved to death.

166
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,040
But you don't seem

167
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,650
like the lazy type.

168
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,010
The watercourse here is well-repaired.

169
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,920
You're a hard worker.

170
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,610
I'm sure you've been eager to see it.

171
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,100
It's really not necessary.

172
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:57,100
Just sit here for two days.

173
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:58,700
By then,

174
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,130
the watercourse will be fixed.

175
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,350
Your leg will be healed.

176
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,630
You can walk back on your own.

177
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,820
Perfect.

178
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,850
Why do I need to sit here for two days?

179
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,580
Can I recover in two days?

180
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,890
I'm a cripple now!

181
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,000
Liu...

182
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:23,800
It slipped! It slipped!

183
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,640
Liu Miantang!

184
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,100
Liu... Liu... Liu Miantang!

185
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,610
Are you alright?

186
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,250
My hand is cut.

187
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,310
It hurts!

188
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,580
Is it your hand that hurts or your leg?

189
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,940
My leg hurts too!

190
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,490
My hand's all scraped up.

191
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,870
You came over suddenly.

192
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,830
There's no extra food

193
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:37,990
prepared at home.

194
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:38,970
Make do with this.

195
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,820
Crab roe rice.

196
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,610
You made this for me?

197
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,420
You're overthinking.

198
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,830
In this season,

199
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,130
where would we get crab roe?

200
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,970
This the crab-like dish,

201
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,420
made with salted duck egg.

202
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,610
You got tricked, right?

203
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,300
Are you okay?

204
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,040
If you really want to eat it,

205
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,910
I'll go buy crab

206
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,460
for you tomorrow.

207
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,000
But at this time of year,

208
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,400
crabs don't have roe.

209
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,540
You'll probably...

210
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,540
You'd still cook for me?

211
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,820
(Guide to Wheel Throwing)

212
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,820
None of the items have been sold,

213
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,610
but the accounts keep piling up.

214
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,960
Stop frowning all the time.

215
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,470
If you're short on capital,

216
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,370
I could invest.

217
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,850
It's not about money.

218
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,200
You wouldn't understand.

219
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,700
How can I know if you don't tell me?

220
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,770
To be honest,

221
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:43,890
I've become quite good

222
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,300
at making chamber pots lately.

223
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,470
Besides,

224
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,830
am I not your

225
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,300
most capable helper?

226
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,040
Shouldn't I know

227
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,000
what my shopkeeper

228
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,850
is worrying about every day?

229
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,770
Do you really want to know?

230
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,270
Then come with me.

231
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,110
Let's go.

232
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,580
Why did you bring me here?

233
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,620
He Zhen, let's be clear.

234
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,860
I'm just here to work.

235
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,380
I haven't thought about anything else.

236
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,300
Shut up.

237
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,180
But sometimes,

238
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,340
I'm not that much

239
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,300
of a gentleman.

240
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,820
This is something I accidentally made.

241
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,940
It's not perfect,

242
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,460
but it's the closest to what I envisioned.

243
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,980
Afterward, no matter how

244
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:48,100
I adjusted the temperature
and glaze at each phase,

245
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,420
I could never achieve the same result again.

246
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,420
The booklet you just saw

247
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,220
is a record of my every attempt.

248
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,500
I think they're all great.

249
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,580
They're not what I want.

250
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,180
Where are you going?

251
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:56,100
(Clear Water)

252
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,060
I know you're awake.

253
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,060
After you left,

254
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,300
I went a bit crazy.

255
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,820
But recently,

256
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,420
I've become clearer in my thoughts.

257
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,620
During the time you were gone,

258
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,380
I think I've finally figured out

259
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,060
what kind of person you are,

260
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:43,380
what you like,

261
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,100
and what you want.

262
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,140
I think I understand it all.

263
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,500
What you want,

264
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,340
from the beginning,
is a relationship of equality.

265
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,740
Just like that little copper ingot

266
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,820
on the scale.

267
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,700
If one side becomes unbalanced,

268
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,900
even by a feather,

269
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,220
you would never allow yourself

270
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,100
to stay in that situation.

271
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,900
You would rather walk away,

272
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,140
leaving everything behind.

273
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,300
That's how proud you are.

274
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,700
I admire your pride.

275
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,300
I want

276
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,460
to protect it.

277
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,780
It's not because

278
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:31,980
you're a pampered lady

279
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,620
from a small household

280
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,740
that I care about you.

281
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,740
When I learned you were Lu Wen,

282
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,540
I realized

283
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,660
what I care about

284
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,300
is the feeling of having met my match.

285
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,380
I like your intelligence that allows you

286
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,660
to find a way out of any situation.

287
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,220
And the way you live is

288
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,020
always free and unrestrained.

289
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,420
What I love

290
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,460
is all of you.

291
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,020
You speak as if you truly know me.

292
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,820
I wouldn't claim

293
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,900
to understand

294
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,580
your every thought,

295
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:14,140
but I'll do my best

296
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,500
to understand.

297
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,220
Miantang.

298
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:20,820
Since you left Xizhou with regret,

299
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,500
I knew you never let go

300
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,380
of avenging your brothers at the agency.

301
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,380
Returning to Beizhou

302
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,180
was a move to plan and then act.

303
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,500
These unfulfilled wishes,

304
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,540
unexplored adventures,

305
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,820
and unfinished pasts.

306
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,100
They've slowly become

307
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,180
things I can't let go of either.

308
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,300
I want to experience them with you.

309
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,420
In front of you,

310
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,700
I'm never a lord.

311
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,660
I'm just an ordinary man
who wants to hold your hand

312
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,020
and spend a lifetime with you.

313
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:06,020
But you're not just any man.

314
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:07,750
My Lord.

315
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,980
What lies between us started with a deception.

316
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,340
Maybe in Lingquan Town,

317
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,980
or even in Beizhou,

318
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,580
we can play house

319
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,900
for a while,

320
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,060
passing the days away.

321
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,980
But every dream has an end.

322
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,780
I don't want to look back on you later

323
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,620
with nothing but regret.

324
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,740
Then don't let it be temporary.

325
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,540
I want to marry you.

326
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,020
Let's spend this life together.

327
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:23,290
Enough.

328
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,780
There's more than one way
to live in this world.

329
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,540
People who don't live in a lord's mansion

330
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,300
aren't lowly or insignificant.

331
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,580
Don't ever bring up making me
a concubine again.

332
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,180
Someone else can be your concubine.

333
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,180
Who said anything about a concubine?

334
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,180
If I marry you,

335
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,420
you'll be the Princess of Huaiyang.

336
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:42,380
We have vastly different statuses.

337
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,980
I could never covet the position of Princess.

338
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,780
And the choice of a Princess

339
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,180
isn't solely up to you.

340
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,460
I appreciate your kindness,

341
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,340
but I must decline.

342
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,580
My mother has already agreed.

343
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,980
And my family

344
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,540
isn't some treacherous place.

345
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,140
My mother is busy with tea gatherings

346
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,260
and opera performances.

347
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,110
You'd be lucky

348
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:03,740
to see her during routine greetings.

349
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,220
What are you worried about?

350
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,780
It's still a no.

351
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,500
Since when did you become so cautious?

352
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,820
Aren't you very petty?

353
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,460
After I deceived you,

354
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,020
you shouldn't let me off so easily.

355
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,500
What do you want?

356
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,180
Money or me?

357
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,660
Whatever I have,

358
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,220
I'll give it to you.

359
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,260
I can earn money on my own.

360
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,420
So, it's me you want.

361
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,540
Cui Xingzhou.

362
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,180
When did you turn into such a rascal?

363
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,060
You can stay here tonight to recover,

364
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,620
but tomorrow morning you're leaving.

365
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,460
Where am I supposed to go?

366
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,140
Wherever you are,

367
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,380
that's where I should be.

368
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,380
This game.

369
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,140
You've managed to turn it around again.

370
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,420
Good game.

371
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,420
It seems Lord Huaiyang

372
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,180
can't find worthy opponents,

373
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,500
so you came to me

374
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,820
to show off.

375
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,100
I was trying

376
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,380
to hold back

377
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,220
and flatter you,

378
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,540
but then I thought

379
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,900
of your family's teachings:

380
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,460
Respect the strong.

381
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,860
Being humble

382
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,300
might not win your favor.

383
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,300
How can someone

384
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,260
who flatters others

385
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,820
be worthy of our Miantang?

386
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,420
And I've decided.

387
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,060
If someone wants

388
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,340
to marry my daughter in the future,

389
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,100
I'll make sure she chooses

390
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,500
a capable man.

391
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,180
Again.

392
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,340
Cui Xingzhou?

393
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,380
The Qiaos have accepted my visit card.

394
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,460
Today, I'll visit to propose.

395
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,620
I'll return by dusk.

396
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,460
Please await good news.

397
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,420
If you want to marry Miantang,

398
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,820
then every day,

399
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,700
in the morning and night,
you must play Go with me.

400
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,980
I might consider it.

401
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,860
Why not move your entire family

402
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,860
to Zhenzhou?

403
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,060
I'll even get you

404
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,700
a fine estate.

405
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,740
Nonsense.

406
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:56,100
I've built my entire life's work here.

407
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,860
How could I just leave for Zhenzhou?

408
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,780
But I am

409
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,420
Lord Huaiyang.

410
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:07,780
I can't...

411
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,020
Once I set a rule,

412
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,020
you throw

413
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,620
your royal weight around.

414
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,460
No, no.

415
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,980
I wouldn't dare

416
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:17,420
make promises lightly.

417
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,020
That's something Miantang taught me.

418
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,180
You keep calling her "Miantang".

419
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,900
Do you think

420
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,980
you can have it all in the world?

421
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,620
Her business in Beizhou

422
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,660
is just taking off.

423
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,900
How can she easily follow you to Zhenzhou?

424
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,020
If you want to marry Miantang,

425
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:33,940
then give up

426
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,140
everything of Lord Huaiyang.

427
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,500
What will you choose?

428
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,860
Is that

429
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,580
your anger speaking,

430
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,220
or Miantang's wish?

431
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,500
Whose wish it is doesn't matter.

432
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,980
My Lord, you can't do it anyway.

433
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:10,780
Uncle.

434
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,780
Where is Cui Xingzhou?

435
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,460
Miantang.

436
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,780
It seems

437
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,860
I might

438
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,340
have made a mistake.

439
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,940
What?

440
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,860
I might have

441
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,860
refused the proposal

442
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,660
on your behalf.

443
00:29:55,980 --> 00:30:00,820
(Lord of Beizhou's Mansion)

444
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,940
You must be Ms. Liu.

445
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,820
Greetings, Manager.

446
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,700
Lord Zhao said it to me earlier.

447
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,740
You're an old acquaintance of Lord Huaiyang

448
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,740
and want to meet him.

449
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:21,980
However,

450
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,460
the Lord is not currently at the mansion.

451
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,420
Do you know where he went?

452
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,220
He mentioned yesterday that he would return.

453
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,340
My lord prepared a cartload of luggage

454
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,780
and saw him off.

455
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:34,980
But by midday today,

456
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,180
he came back briefly,

457
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,860
grabbed some paper and documents,

458
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,660
seemed upset,

459
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,060
didn't speak to me,

460
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,220
and didn't mention where he was going.

461
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,060
Then he left again.

462
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,180
I think

463
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,420
this time,

464
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,620
the Lord has truly left for Zhenzhou.

465
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,220
Thank you for your help.

466
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,060
My pleasure.

467
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,500
(You've been gone for so long.)

468
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,300
I've been unable to eat or sleep.

469
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,820
If my dreams lack you,

470
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,900
my nights are dull.

471
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:38,460
If my dreams include you,

472
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,540
I can't sleep through the night.

473
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,140
(During the time you were gone,)

474
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,860
(I think I've finally figured out)

475
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,420
(what kind of person you are,)

476
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,780
(what you like,)

477
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:53,460
(and what you want.)

478
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,220
(I think I understand it all.)

479
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,260
(What I care about)

480
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,940
(is the feeling of having met my match.)

481
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,900
I like your intelligence that allows you

482
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,300
to find a way out of any situation.

483
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:08,780
(In front of you,)

484
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:11,260
(I'm never a lord.)

485
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,020
I'm just an ordinary man
who wants to hold your hand

486
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,180
and spend a lifetime with you.

487
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,740
I only joked with his title

488
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,180
to tease him.

489
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,860
He wouldn't take it seriously, would he?

490
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,780
(How could there be someone
so earnest in this world?)

491
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,060
My Lord.

492
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,460
Why haven't you returned?

493
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,900
I had to give you an answer

494
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:40,990
before I could leave.

495
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,180
Then listen carefully.

496
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,940
What my grandfather said...

497
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:45,940
Wait a moment.

498
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,820
Let me speak first.

499
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:50,900
Zhenzhou

500
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,060
was pacified by my father.

501
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,660
He dedicated

502
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,660
his life's efforts to it.

503
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,220
The people of Zhenzhou have long

504
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,260
been under the protection of my family.

505
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,500
My mother, my brothers, and their wives

506
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,220
live under the shelter of my official rank.

507
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,620
For their sake,

508
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,900
and for my father's legacy,

509
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,940
I can't be so selfish

510
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:13,060
as to abandon my title.

511
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,140
Starting so bluntly.

512
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,940
What if I get mad?

513
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:20,780
I'm afraid of that.

514
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,860
But I'm more afraid
of deceiving you like I did before.

515
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:26,780
Then

516
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:29,420
why are you still so leisurely here?

517
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,660
Why not hurry back

518
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,340
to protect your people?

519
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,180
Is it because you couldn't walk?

520
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,860
Or are you getting angrier
the more you think about it,

521
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,700
ready to knock me out

522
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,900
and drag me back to Zhenzhou?

523
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,380
Well, listen carefully.

524
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,050
I've put on weight these days.

525
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,380
Your legs wouldn't be able to carry me.

526
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,740
I want you to see

527
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,600
our future.

528
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,510
This document here

529
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,530
outlines my schedule for the year.

530
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,340
Take a look.

531
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,580
Did you write this in just one day?

532
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,660
I've carefully counted.

533
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,860
I'm busy in the summer and autumn.

534
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,660
If I focus my efforts,

535
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:25,020
I can handle everything in five months.

536
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,940
Apart from various duties

537
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,660
and travels,

538
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,140
I can free up

539
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,300
at least four months

540
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,820
each year to spend

541
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:34,860
in Beizhou with you.

542
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:38,020
With holidays and festivals,

543
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,420
we could have even more time.

544
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,780
I've written it all down here.

545
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:47,780
You don't have to...

546
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,140
Wait, no need to rush.

547
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,140
I have something else.

548
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,700
This is the plate of the mansion.

549
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,100
And this.

550
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,660
This is a handwritten letter
with my official seal.

551
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,300
With it,

552
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,820
you can freely travel

553
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,900
to any state or county

554
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,660
where I am.

555
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:17,780
You can even enter

556
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:19,140
the Zhenzhou camp as you wish.

557
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,820
So, do you mean

558
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,260
wherever you go,

559
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,460
- I should follow?
- No, no.

560
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,420
That's not what I meant.

561
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:28,900
I was thinking

562
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,660
that when you're free from your duties,

563
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,220
perhaps we could

564
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,460
meet in other places.

565
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,780
I understand your grandfather's concerns,

566
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,220
and I respect your choice.

567
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,580
I still can't

568
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,860
immediately give up

569
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,580
my title as Lord Huaiyang,

570
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,220
but

571
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,700
everything must have a solution,

572
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:53,860
right?

573
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,740
And

574
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,500
if you're willing

575
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,700
to give me a chance,

576
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:06,020
I'll do everything I can.

577
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,020
I want to marry you.

578
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:14,020
But I'm not forcing you

579
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,300
to make any decision right now.

580
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,100
I respect your choice.

581
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,180
If

582
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,420
you're not willing

583
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,700
now,

584
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,580
I promise

585
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,540
I won't trouble you anymore.

586
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,180
I...

587
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:42,740
I'm not willing.

588
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,820
Don't you want to know why?

589
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,340
No need.

590
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,660
The fresh crabs in Zhenzhou

591
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,100
are incredibly delicious,

592
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,580
far better than those in Beizhou.

593
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,460
If I stay in Beizhou all the time,

594
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,700
I'll miss out

595
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,180
on many earthly delights.

596
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,420
Besides, I don't want to miss out on...

597
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,660
What is it you don't want to miss out on?

598
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,840
You.

599
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,140
A man's word is his bond,

600
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,420
hard to take back once spoken.

601
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,700
I'm just an ordinary woman,

602
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,940
not some great man.

603
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,340
But the decisive Lu Wen

604
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,820
that I knew before

605
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,300
was never

606
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,740
so hesitant.

607
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,580
Lord Huaiyang could

608
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,380
understand a hint without a word.

609
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,020
He wouldn't ask so many questions either.

610
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,300
By the way,

611
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,300
there's one more thing.

612
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,660
I still have an unresolved revenge

613
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,500
with the faction of Prince Sui.

614
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,820
One day,

615
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,880
I intend to settle that score.

616
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:26,420
How coincidental.

617
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,020
I have the same intention.

618
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,300
Dear.

619
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,740
How improper.

620
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,660
Without the certificate,

621
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,940
if you continue,

622
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,580
and my grandfather hears you...

623
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,140
Never mind.

624
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,380
Today,

625
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,540
he owed you a debt.

626
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,740
Owed me?

627
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,020
What do you mean?

628
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,420
Wasn't it your idea?

629
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,220
It's Grandfather's idea.

630
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:05,420
There's this poor Go player

631
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,580
who won a game

632
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,380
but then had to put on airs as Lord Huaiyang.

633
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,940
My grandfather meant to put him down

634
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,300
but didn't expect him to take it seriously.

635
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,260
But all of it was my true feelings.

636
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,180
Forget it.

637
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,500
I've always

638
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,500
been open.

639
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,740
But I wonder

640
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:24,940
when the woman facing me

641
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,940
will be just as open.

642
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,820
I've always been open.

643
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:31,100
But one

644
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,020
has to be thoughtful,

645
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:34,380
or I might end up

646
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,460
calling you "honey" without realizing it.

647
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,220
You rogue.

648
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:41,940
Once you sign the certificate,

649
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,700
I won't be a rogue, right?

650
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,500
Why don't you hurry up

651
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,740
and have your mansion

652
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:47,900
send over the certificate

653
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,820
before I change my mind?

654
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:53,140
That can be signed by Guangcai.

655
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,900
We can do it right now.

656
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:56,740
How childish.

657
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,820
The offices are closed.

658
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,260
Are you scared?

659
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,620
Who's scared?

660
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:02,980
Then let's go.

661
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:03,940
Fine.

662
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:04,780
You first.

663
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,260
Let's see if you can catch up to me.

664
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,980
My leg hurts. I don't dare to try.

665
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:18,380
(Beizhou State Office)

666
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,020
A drum beat so late.

667
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,060
It must be a serious case.

668
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,100
It has never been so urgent

669
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,220
since I came to Beizhou.

670
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,060
Hurry up.

671
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,940
Who is beating the drum outside?

672
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,980
Why is it you two?

673
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:43,260
(Qingzheng Hall)

674
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,300
See? What did I say?

675
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,220
Guangcai,

676
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:47,300
ever so dutiful,

677
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:48,660
would surely open the hall.

678
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,380
Beating the drum in the dead of night.

679
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,180
Do you have a grievance?

680
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:55,940
A quarreling couple

681
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,220
suffered enough.

682
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,820
Please, Magistrate Li,

683
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,020
be our witness

684
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,700

This is the future Princess of Huaiyang.

If her belongings are scratched or damaged,

700
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,420
I'll see that you're all sold off,

701
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,660
and you can't afford that.

702
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:38,980
This is all my dowry

703
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:40,020
from Grandfather.

704
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,420
You can carry it without worry.

705
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:43,940
Indeed.

706
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,860
We're a small household.

707
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,860
I'm afraid you might look down on us.

708
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:51,940
Miantang.

709
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:55,020
You're a member of the Qiao family.

710
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,620
As your aunt,

711
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:58,140
I truly wish you well.

712
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:01,420
But to be blunt,

713
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,580
a lord's family is complicated.

714
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:06,740
This marriage isn't between equals.

715
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:09,180
I fear you'll suffer for it in the future.

716
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:12,660
But the Lord treats Ms. Liu well.

717
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,340

have filled the entire street.

718

719
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:19,780
Yes.

720
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:20,940
Miantang,

721
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,980
don't be fooled

722
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:24,780
by how the Lord cherishes you now.

723
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,140
Once you marry him,

724
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:27,580
if he grows tired of you,

725
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:29,700
you'll have no one to rely on.

726
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:31,620
I'll simply enjoy

727
00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:33,180
the happy days while they last.

728
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:34,340
If it comes to that,

729
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,300
I'll return to Beizhou

730
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:36,700
and reestablish my household.

731
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:38,780
I still have the escort business.

732

I'll always have a way out.

00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,620
You just won't admit it, will you?

734
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:46,940
