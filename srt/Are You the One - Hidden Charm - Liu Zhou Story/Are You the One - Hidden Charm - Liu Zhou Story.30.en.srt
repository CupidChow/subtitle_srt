14
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:46,600
These dates are incredibly fresh.

15
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,660
You two should try them.

16
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,640
Thank you.

17
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,410
Are they sweet?

18
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,000
- Very sweet.
- Sweet.

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,220
Then be careful.

20
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,500
Empress.

21
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,360
Your Majesty.

22
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,720
Get up.

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,220
What are you doing?

24
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,660
Washing dates.

25
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,130
Dates.

26
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,100
Did your return home go smoothly?

27
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,810
Everything went smoothly.

28
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,150
My father asked me to pass on a message

29
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,250
to wish you well.

30
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,530
So, Empress,

31
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,810
is there anything else you wish to tell me?

32
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,480
Yes.

33
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,520
I feared you might find dinner greasy.

34
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,060
I prepared some green dates.

35
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,940
They're in season.

36
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,660
I recall

37
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,940
that common folks serve dates at their tables

38
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,340
to prompt an early childbirth.

39
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,060
What do you mean

40
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,570
by using green dates?

41
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,360
Your Majesty, do you know?

42
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,850
There are many kinds of dates.

43
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,870
These are barely-in-season green dates.

44
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,270
When it gets colder,

45
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,460
there will be winter dates.

46
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,810
In the western regions with plenty of sunlight,

47
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,250
there are also tribute dates.

48
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,380
What do you mean by this?

49
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,730
I believe

50
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,290
that people should eat what's in season.

51
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,500
Otherwise, it's untimely.

52
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,250
Without enduring frost

53
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,500
and sunlight,

54
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,500
these green dates can only remain green dates.

55
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,380
They can never become tribute dates.

56
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:00,550
This is

57
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,690
what I wanted to say.

58
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,780
What do you think,

59
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:19,990
Your Majesty?

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,260
Sweet, crisp, and refreshing.

61
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,050
I am very satisfied.

62
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,100
Why did you bring me here?

63
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,700
In Chonghua Palace,

64
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,580
this is my favorite place.

65
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,580
Looking out from here,

66
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,490
I always feel at ease

67
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:48,750
and peaceful.

68
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,220
I know what you want to say.

69
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,290
You want to ask

70
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,580
why I don't favor the Shi family.

71
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,290
I haven't known you for long,

72
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,660
yet it feels like a long time.

73
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,020
You always make me feel at ease.

74
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,220
But behind this comfort,

75
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,490
are you entirely at ease?

76
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,370
When you were with the Shi family,

77
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,680
you feared making mistakes

78
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,730
and being schemed against

79
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,430
and left with no options.

80
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,270
You don't want

81
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,020
to sacrifice for your father's ambition.

82
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,490
I brought you to the Palace

83
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,520
thinking I could provide

84
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,050
you with complete peace of mind.

85
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,580
With you choosing me as the Empress,

86
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,000
I have indeed gained

87
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,220
great peace of mind.

88
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,140
You have indeed acted like an Empress,

89
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,260
and you've done well.

90
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,260
But the more you do so,

91
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:08,830
the more I sense

92
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,580
your inner uncertainty

93
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,170
and unspoken grievances.

94
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,710
This grand palace to you

95
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:21,780
is like

96
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,260
another Shi family,

97
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:27,430
isn't it?

98
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,190
Yes.

99
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,340
Is it because of me?

100
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,390
Have you heard the story

101
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,220
of the hunter seeking the hidden deer?

102
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,960
A starving woodcutter

103
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,730
finds an injured deer.

104
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:00,020
The deer's meat could satisfy his hunger.

105
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,260
It's another story of food.

106
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,780
The woodcutter, fearing discovery,

107
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,230
hides the deer in a ditch

108
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,820
and covers it with banana leaves.

109
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,900
He comes back at night to retrieve it.

110
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,580
But he can't find the deer anywhere.

111
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,240
The woodcutter remains

112
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,020
a starving woodcutter

113
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,900
and must consider it all

114
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,730
as just a beautiful dream.

115
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,710
Your appearance

116
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,580
is not trapping me,

117
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,850
but rather my dream.

118
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:47,100
I seem to have transformed from a mere swallow

119
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,220
into a high-branch phoenix.

120
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,720
Yet, in reality,

121
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,050
there is no real difference.

122
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,260
For the Shi family,

123
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,960
I'm someone who can be discarded

124
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,290
and replaced at any time.

125
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,970
There's only obedience for me.

126
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:02,900
No way to retreat.

127
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,370
In the past, I was used

128
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:11,220
to surviving one day at a time.

129
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,820
Now, in the Palace,

130
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,820
I just want to protect myself.

131
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,560
So why do you

132
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,260
oppose Shi Yikuan's wishes?

133
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:31,970
Do you truly possess your so-called

134
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,940
complete peace of mind?

135
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,560
Now, Prince Sui holds all the power

136
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,750
in the court.

137
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,870
I can see

138
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,630
that you stand under a precarious wall.

139
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,850
I can also see

140
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,970
that you want to be a wise ruler.

141
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,180
As your principal wife,

142
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,970
protecting you

143
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,770
is protecting myself.

144
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,130
The Shi family

145
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,420
has never been my fallback.

146
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,650
I only share the same boat with you.

147
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:28,700
There is green wine in the Palace.

148
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,100
It's recently presented.

149
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,970
Xueji, would you like some?

150
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,970
It seems I haven't heard you

151
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,300
speak about your past.

152
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,850
I'd like to share my past

153
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,970
with you too.

154
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,650
Yesterday, there was heavy rain.

155
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,010
That dog came to the courtyard again

156
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,160
with its fur wet,

157
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,580
ears drooping,

158
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,540
rarely aggressive.

159
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,340
At night, I dreamed

160
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:30,220
that you invited it to shelter under the eaves.

161
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,940
The dog turned into a man,

162
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,970
claiming to be your husband.

163
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,970
I was upset,

164
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:39,970
so I killed the dog.

165
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,850
When I woke from the dream,

166
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,990
there was no dog,

167
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,010
nor you.

168
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,040
That dog often visits the courtyard,

169
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,340
annoying me,

170
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,300
but I must feign civility.

171
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,300
Cui Xingzhou?

172
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:32,730
Cui Xingzhou?

173
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,220
Didn't expect it to happen to you.

174
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,460
So, tell me.

175
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,370
Do I appear in your dreams now?

176
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,540
Have you ever dreamed

177
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,770
that I would kill you with a single knife?

178
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:34,970
You've already woken up.

179
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:37,840
If you want to see me,

180
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,220
I won't avoid you.

181
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,340
You don't need to sneak around.

182
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:46,770
Why the smoke?

183
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,480
I thought for a moment

184
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,300
that an assassin had snuck in.

185
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,250
But then I thought of it.

186
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,110
Which assassin would

187
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,350
enter someone else's room

188
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:59,010
only to read letters?

189
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,590
I'm not interested

190
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,820
in those cheesy letters.

191
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,820
Those are my personal letters.

192
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,420
Every word is sincere.

193
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,060
Not exaggerated in the slightest.

194
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,130
Dreams are false.

195
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:13,700
Things built on deception.

196
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,730
What truth can they hold?

197
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,180
I agree with that.

198
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,160
I used to dream

199
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,100
thousands of times

200
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:26,770
that you tried to kill me.

201
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,370
But dreams are always the opposite.

202
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,250
You softened.

203
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,010
Wrapped so well.

204
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,820
I just came to return the medicine to you.

205
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,970
I don't want

206
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,650
to owe this favor for nothing.

207
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,220
Isn't there more to it?

208
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,440
If you're repaying a favor,

209
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,790
there are plenty

210
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:49,850
of other ways to do it.

211
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,850
But tonight,

212
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,420
you still came.

213
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,220
Let go.

214
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,890
Since you're here, how can I let go?

215
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,970
If Lu Wen were truly ruthless,

216
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,100
you would have attacked my injured leg.

217
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,250
But you didn't.

218
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,580
Do you think I wouldn't dare?

219
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,160
To speak insincerely

220
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,220
is also a form of deceit.

221
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:19,820
Liu Miantang,

222
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,920
you're also always

223
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,100
deceiving me,

224
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,070
aren't you?

225
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,850
You madman.

226
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,040
If you truly didn't want your life,

227
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,220
why not just fall harder?

228
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,280
If this injured leg were

229
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,340
to be given to that Princess,

230
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,100
she couldn't bear it.

231
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,890
But if it's broken here with you,

232
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,770
it's fine.

233
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,510
Forget about this injured leg.

234
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,200
Even if I were to give my life to you,

235
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,040
I would...

236
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:03,950
Miantang.

237
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,250
Actually, I've always owed you an apology.

238
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,540
From the start, I was wrong.

239
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,340
I shouldn't have deceived you.

240
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,340
I shouldn't have claimed to be your husband.

241
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,540
When falling in love with you,

242
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,100
I shouldn't have tried to maintain this lie,

243
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:30,540
which only made my mistakes worse,

244
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,700
and my feelings for you grow.

245
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:36,370
You've been gone for so long.

246
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:39,180
I've been unable to eat or sleep.

247
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,850
If my dreams lack you,

248
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,820
my nights are dull.

249
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,340
If my dreams include you,

250
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,370
I can't sleep through the night.

251
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,460
In the past, I was proud

252
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,970
and arrogant.

253
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,940
But now I've realized

254
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,300
that in this lifetime,

255
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,420
I won't marry any other woman besides you.

256
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,340
But I'm not.

257
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,100
I live very comfortably now.

258
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,690
Even if one day I fall into poverty

259
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,540
and become a beggar on the streets,

260
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:16,850
I'd still be content.

261
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,540
I've now established my own household.

262
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,160
Even if I don't marry,

263
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,340
I can still live well.

264
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,650
If someday

265
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,690
I meet a handsome and charming person,

266
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,200
I can always have a fling.

267
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,310
If you have another man,

268
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,600
I would kill someone.

269
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,440
Kill whom?

270
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,350
Kill me?

271
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,210
When would I ever bear
to lift a finger against you?

272
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,120
I want to kill that adulterer.

273
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,500
Where does the adulterer come from?

274
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,840
If we discuss it in detail,

275
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,600
you are the most playful.

276
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,820
How am I playful?

277
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,300
Both of us are unmarried.

278
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,170
I'm the most proper.

279
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,650
If you want a life like that,

280
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,500
then you might as well choose me.

281
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,440
I'll do that with you.

282
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,280
You...

283
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,790
I, Liu Miantang, vow here

284
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:01,750
that even if all the men

285
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,070
in the world die out,

286
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,260
I will never...

287
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,500
These words are to sever ties.

288
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,020
Don't say that.

289
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,790
Cui Xingzhou,

290
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,930
I haven't forgiven you yet.

291
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:40,930
My Lord, you're awake.

292
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,340
Then I'll sleep a bit more.

293
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:49,910
I...

294
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,170
Mr. Cui.

295
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,990
You've achieved your goals

296
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,120
in Beizhou

297
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,160
and don't need to stay.

298
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,310
Also, your leg injury

299
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,820
hasn't affected the bones.

300
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,130
Now is the right time to return to Zhenzhou.

301
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,510
But

302
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:20,230
I really feel a bit reluctant to part with you.

303
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,840
Then I'll stay a few more days.

304
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,130
- Just to rest a bit.
- No, no.

305
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,300
Zhenzhou's affairs are urgent.

306
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,550
Moreover, the gifts
I've prepared for your mother

307
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:28,960
are mostly seasonal.

308
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,170
They can't be stored for long.

309
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,280
My mother,

310
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,850
with her sharp eyes,

311
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,740
would find the specialty of Beizhou

312
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,040
a bit coarse.

313
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,300
I've prepared them myself

314
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,310
to ensure top quality,

315
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,310
suitable for all ages.

316
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,150
Alright, alright.

317
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,240
Ms. Liu.

318
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,890
Are you still happy to see me?

319
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,650
Are you finally going back to Zhenzhou?

320
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,160
You have a long journey.

321
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,400
So I won't be seeing you off.

322
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,300
My Lord, take care.

323
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,390
Stop.

324
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,650
Your cousin is coming home

325
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,740
after her wedding.

326
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,920
You're dressed

327
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,210
a bit too plainly.

328
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,880
Only men

329
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,600
who are full of themselves

330
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,170
like to comment on a woman's attire.

331
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,890
You look so dignified.

332
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:17,890
Do take care on the road.

333
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,500
Do you think I look dignified?

334
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,720
That's good.

335
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,360
I'll feel at ease going

336
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,400
to the Qiao's mansion.

337
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,240
Stop.

338
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:26,870
You...

339
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,100
Why are you going there?

340
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,930
The Qiao family is
a prominent family in Beizhou.

341
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,790
Local gentry want to befriend them.

342
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:36,130
Of course, I need
to pay my respects to Master Qiao.

343
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,300
You're not thinking

344
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,740
I'm going to propose, are you?

345
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,580
Whether it's for a proposal

346
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:48,780
or for charity,

347
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,170
it's none of my business.

348
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:51,990
My grandfather

349
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,260
won't pay you any attention.

350
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,020
- Moru.
- Yes.

351
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,440
Let's go meet Grandfather.

352
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,370
Alright.

353
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,600
(Qiao Mansion)
They came.

354
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,450
Mr. Qian's demeanor is quite grand.

355
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,790
See? I told you.

356
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,650
The Qian family was the right choice.

357
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,070
He treats Qingying so well.

358
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,120
He sent such a splendid carriage for the visit.

359
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,740
Is this carriage from the Qian family?

360
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,170
Could it be from some other lord?

361
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,520
Ridiculous.

362
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,100
Beizhou doesn't have that many lords.

363
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,780
Isn't that the madman
who stopped the sedan?

364
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,480
Be careful.

365
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,370
Sorry to trouble you.

366
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,020
I'm Cui.

367
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,370
I'm here today to...

368
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,690
My Lord.

369
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,200
There are

370
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,540
important matters at home today.

371
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,790
If you're here for questioning

372
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,200
or anything else,

373
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,690
could you delay it?

374
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,060
I know there's a celebration at home today.

375
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,060
Just introduce me

376
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,300
as an old friend

377
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,650
who's here to congratulate you.

378
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,880
The last person said the same thing.

379
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,100
It didn't work.

380
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,440
Xian.

381
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,500
May I ask who this is?

382
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,540
This is Mr. Cui, my friend.

383
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,960
He's here to congratulate us.

384
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,980
He'll be leaving soon.

385
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:24,910
This...

386
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:29,340
To congratulate.

387
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,830
You...

388
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,500
You actually dared to come?

389
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:41,850
- Moru.
- Yes.

390
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:44,000
Ms. Liu is here.

391
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,130
Have the gifts been unloaded?

392
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,580
Yes.

393
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:47,550
Good.

394
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:52,630
Grandfather.

395
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,980
After getting your household,

396
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,960
you actually brought an outsider

397
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,500
to visit.

398
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,780
I'm Cui Xingzhou.

399
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,300
Greetings, Master Qiao.

400
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,760
Greetings,

401
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,450
two elders.

402
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,780
Another friend?

403
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,540
Maybe.

404
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,410
Maybe?

405
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:26,980
Maybe yes.

406
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,000
Mr. Qiao is a man of the world,

407
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,690
making friends everywhere.

408
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,170
I truly admire him.

409
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,930
You're a martial artist.

410
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,260
I'm from a military background.

411
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,060
What a pity.

412
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:44,650
Otherwise, you could fight

413
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,850
and defeat some foreign enemies.

414
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,880
I often hear Mr. Qiao speak highly

415
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,850
of Master Qiao's teachings.

416
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,780
And the girls

417
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:04,060
are also very gentle.

418
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,130
The words are the same.

419
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:10,540
Since it was my first visit,

420
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,260
I brought a small gift

421
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,370
as a token of respect.

422
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,720
Moru.

423
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,400
It's just two walnuts.

424
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,820
What's so special about them?

425
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,980
Uncultured.

426
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,890
These are Hetian jade.

427
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:32,200
Before, they were imperial tributes.

428
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,100
They would never have flowed into the market.

429
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,400
Even if they did,

430
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,720
they'd be made into pendants,

431
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,930
not this large.

432
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,960
We've escorted goods for twenty years.

433
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,510
I can judge with precision.

434
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:43,300
Such a large pair of jade walnuts

435
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,840
could feed our guards

436
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,740
for a lifetime.

437
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:52,170
Qingying married early.

438
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,210
Who married early?

439
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,370
Mr. Cui,

440
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,920
you're just here for a visit.

441
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,840
Our Qiao family

442
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,640
will host you with good wine and meat.

443
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,260
There's no need for such a grand gift.

444
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,210
Please take it back.

445
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,020
I can't accept it.

446
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,780
It's not something of high status.

447
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,270
My mother likes

448
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,540
to collect small items.

449
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,100
Hope you don't mind.

450
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:19,540
I once received a treasure

451
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:22,170
from Mr. Qiao.

452
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:24,510
Even if it's gold or silver mountains,

453
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,580
you can accept it.

454
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,850
I'll go check if Qingying has arrived.

455
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,260
Mr. Cui, don't speak carelessly.

456
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:47,960
When did I ever

457
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,930
promise you anything?

458
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,890
What exactly is this treasure?

459
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:00,870
Master.

460
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:01,840
They've arrived.

461
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,230
Ms. Qiao and her husband are here.

462
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,120
That's more important.

463
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,260
Let's step out.

464
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,660
(Known for Honesty)

465
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,540
Greetings, Mr. Qiao.

466
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,000
Greetings, Mrs. Qiao.

467
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,930
Father, Mother.

468
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,880
Glad you're here.

469
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,410
Why bring all these things?

470
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,210
Hurry and greet Grandfather.

471
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,850
- Come on.
- Alright, go in.

472
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:48,580
Wait a moment.

473
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,260
Aren't you fearless?

474
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,650
You do have someone you're wary of.

475
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,130
What exactly do you want to do?

476
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,100
I remember

477
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:07,130
that outsiders don't have
to attend the banquet.

478
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,210
What are you doing here?

479
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,100
I'm here to take you back.

480
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,980
Take me back?

481
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,310
Send you out.

482
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,650
To the Lord of Beizhou's place.

483
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:19,370
Then I should indeed return.

484
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,130
But I have to wait

485
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,370
for your grandfather

486
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:24,630
to be free.

487
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:25,920
After my talk with him,

488
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,890
I'll let you

489
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,130
take me back.

490
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:29,930
Mr. Cui.

491
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,300
Please have a chat with me.

492
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:41,980
Go to the banquet.

493
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,260
My granddaughter

494
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,440
once had an old friend

495
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,260
in Zhenzhou.

496
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,210
According to my eldest son,

497
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,890
he's also surnamed Cui.

498
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,210
That's me.

499
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,020
Good.

500
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,740
I was just about to find you,

501
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:40,070
and you showed up at my door.

502
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,100
I know

503
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,600
how important you are

504
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,370
in Miantang's heart.

505
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,260
I came here today

506
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,020
to apologize to you

507
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:52,890
and confess everything.

508
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,930
I truly come from a military background,

509
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,980
and my admiration for Miantang is real.

510
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,650
But all of this started

511
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,120
because of my own selfishness

512
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,170
and arrogance.

513
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,740
I pretended to be Cui Jiu from the capital,

514
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,210
taking advantage

515
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,300
of Miantang's amnesia,

516
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,100
and kept her at home,

517
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,170
saying it was to lure the enemy.

518
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,170
But the truth is

519
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,750
I can't live without her.

520
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:32,590
Enough.

521
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:35,930
I made her think she was my wife,

522
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,160
invest her true heart,

523
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,020
and even follow me to the war.

524
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,980
Knowing it was a grave mistake,

525
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:44,740
I still continued
to take this illusion seriously,

526
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,100
falling completely in love with her.

527
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,300
You wretched thing.

528
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,690
Did you come here

529
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:02,170
to flaunt your power?

530
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,170
I came here today

531
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,170
to sincerely

532
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:09,130
apologize to you.

533
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,500
Miantang has said

534
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,440
you're the one

535
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,780
who loves her the most.

536
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,890
You taught her to be kind,

537
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,020
wise, and righteous.

538
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:19,880
But such a woman,

539
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,370
because of my mistakes,

540
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:24,300
has been forced to endure
all kinds of suffering,

541
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,980
when all of it

542
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,410
should have been borne by me, the man.

543
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,200
Today,

544
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,680
you can vent all your hatred

545
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,160
on me alone.

546
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,720
I will accept it willingly,

547
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,020
without a shred of complaint.

548
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:44,650
Good.

549
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:48,020
If you want to be punished, then I'll do it.

550
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,450
Grandfather,

551
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,520
What?

552
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,980
Are you still protecting this beast?

553
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:01,510
The grievances between us

554
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:02,500
and all consequences

555
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:04,370
should be borne by me alone.

556
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,130
Grandfather, please don't get angry.

557
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,020
Is struggling with him

558
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,990
your way to handle this?

559
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:11,160
Like you're doing now,

560
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,890
blocking my way?

561
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,410
I've got my household.

562
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,820
My matters

563
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,410
are beyond your jurisdiction.

564
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,130
Dare you say that again?

565
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,020
Grandfather.

566
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:30,060
He is Cui Xingzhou, Lord Huaiyang.

567
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,440
What?

568
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,500
Lord Huaiyang defeated the western tribes.

569
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,060
He's a benefactor to the world.

570
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:00,150
I went

571
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,580
to Xizhou

572
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,370
to follow him.

573
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,500
He may have worldly merit.

574
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,890
But does that mean he can

575
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:11,650
mistreat ordinary people?

576
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:19,170
I've lived for over sixty years.

577
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:21,600
So what if I risk my life today

578
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,350
and stab him?

579
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,450
Grandfather.

580
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,270
Do you

581
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,450
remember

582
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,270
when you were afraid

583
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,580
of being implicated in my father's case?

584
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,450
No matter how much I cried and fussed,

585
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,540
you insisted on

586
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,880
marrying me off

587
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,130
to that unrelated Cui Jiu.

588
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,540
Why did you of that day

589
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,410
not have the courage of today?

590
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,740
Why did you not foresee

591
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,740
that with my temperament,

592
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:19,630
I would suffer

593
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,100
such ordeals later?

594
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,260
Good.

595
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,100
Good.

596
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:30,820
Your gaze

597
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,020
is just like

598
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,780
your mother's.

599
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,500
If Mother were alive,

600
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,650
she would never agree.

601
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,440
Sometimes,

602
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,650
I can't understand

603
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,500
whether you're angry with me

604
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,850
or with yourself

605
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,340
for not stopping my mother.

606
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:06,020
What do you know?

607
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,170
The world is harsh.

608
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,770
If a woman chooses

609
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,630
according to her own will,

610
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:17,940
what good outcome can she expect?

611
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,550
Only by marrying a good family

612
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,860
can she secure a stable life.

613
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,130
But you

614
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:29,290
just don't understand.

615
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:32,610
You don't understand.

616
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:42,550
If Miantang wants to secure her life,

617
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,730
she doesn't need to marry a good family.

618
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,320
She is her own

619
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,650
secure place.

620
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,420
She can control her own fate.

621
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,580
What does it have to do with you?

622
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,060
Forgive me for speaking too much.

623
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,690
Although I don't

624
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:02,110
understand the rift

625
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,770
between you and your granddaughter,

626
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,980
What I do understand

627
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,190
is that

628
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,730
in less than a year,

629
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,150
she turned a small shop

630
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,150
into a royal tribute porcelain store,

631
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,690
joining a century-old guild.

632
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,320
She single-handedly

633
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,720
resisted a group of rulers.

634
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,810
She didn't lose to any man.

635
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,130
That great battle in Xizhou

636
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:29,860
that everyone praises

637
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,860
was won with the help

638
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,330
of your granddaughter.

639
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,250
She showed me for the first time

640
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:41,380
that while men can defend the country,

641
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,150
women can also defend the rear

642
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:45,170
and even achieve victory in extraordinary ways.

643
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,060
I also know

644
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,500
that such a seemingly weak woman

645
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,400
once led tens of thousands of bandits,

646
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,540
set up her own banner,

647
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,210
and helped the poor from the rich.

648
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,060
A woman like her

649
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,060
can live elegantly

650
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,860
even if she never marries.

651
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,590
She doesn't need to rely

652
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:09,400
on anyone for her livelihood.

653
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,800
There is no towering figure

654
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,210
she needs to depend on.

655
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,100
If she wants to marry,

656
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,770
she would marry a man

657
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,420
who is on equal footing with her,

658
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,060
who respects her choices,

659
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,250
and who she deeply loves.

660
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,380
Even someone like me

661
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,290
who has known her

662
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,110
for only a year

663
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,420
can understand this.

664
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,210
As a family member,

665
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,980
Grandfather, you should also understand.

666
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,940
I won't punish you.

667
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:52,580
You may leave.

668
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,770
My Lord, be careful.

669
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,860
Slow down. Be careful.

670
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,250
Did you all see it?

671
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,070
Anyone who dares to bully

672
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,770
our family's girls

673
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,420
will end up like this.

674
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,880
Years ago,

675
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,650
your mother, like you,

676
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,760
wanted to do business.

677
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,510
But I thought a woman

678
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:57,420
could achieve nothing.

679
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:59,500
Later,

680
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,290
the Shenwei Escort Agency

681
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:03,020
gained fame throughout Beizhou.

682
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:05,250
People knew me.

683
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,250
But they didn't know

684
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,730
that behind the scenes,

685
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,060
your mother managed it.

686
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,400
Later, your mother

687
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,940
met your father.

688
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:23,380
Your father was quite prominent then,

689
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,460
an education official of a county.

690
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,360
In the eyes of the world,

691
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,880
he was well-educated

692
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,330
and promising.

693
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:31,990
Your mother

694
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:33,900
admired his talent.

695
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,130
Despite public criticism,

696
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,100
she became his second wife.

697
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,980
But your father,

698
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,100
who read all the classic books,

699
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,020
turned out to be a complete fool.

700
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,860
He was implicated in a serious crime.

701
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,070
If your mother

702
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:55,290
hadn't worked so hard for him,

703
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,150
trying to save him from death,

704
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,420
she wouldn't have

705
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,250
died young

706
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:03,290
from tuberculosis,

707
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,210
burning out early.

708
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:09,020
It's all my fault.

709
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,760
I didn't think things through.

710
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,770
I didn't see your father's true nature,

711
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,130
which led my daughter

712
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,460
astray.

713
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,170
It's all my fault.

714
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,580
My fault.

715
00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:29,860
Grandfather.

716
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,170
Do you want to hear some truth?

717
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:39,500
Before she died, my mother told me

718
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,860
that she was very happy

719
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,860
and satisfied

720
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,250
with her life.

721
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,500
Although

722
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,170
there were some disappointments,

723
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,770
she had no regrets.

724
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,330
She also said

725
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:58,760
that despite the flow of time

726
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,060
and the passage of years,

727
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:03,330
she would always remember
two periods in her life.

728
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:06,380
One was the time

729
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:08,730
spent with my father.

730
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,060
And the other was

731
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,730
the journey to Nanyi for the marriage.

732
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:21,130
At that time,

733
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:26,900
I took her to Nanyi.

734
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,650
Yes.

735
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,860
Miantang.

736
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:38,460
You are more and more like her.

737
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:41,940
You're more decisive than she was.

738
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,380
Lord Huaiyang,

739
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,420
though he did something outrageous,

740
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,290
is a reasonable person.

741
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,100
I'm old

742
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,170
and don't understand young people.

743
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,900
But I can see it.

744
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:07,730
Girl,

745
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,900
you've softened.

746
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:15,860
As you said,

747
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:17,250
you've got your household.

748
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,100
Take charge

749
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:21,770
of your own affairs.

750
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:34,860
(Qiao Mansion)

751
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,860
Ms. Liu,

752
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:37,690
the Lord's injury is unbearably painful.

753
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,510
He's worried about you being mistreated.

754
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:40,550
However I persuade him,

755
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:41,390
he refuses to leave.

756
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:45,870
Perhaps

757
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,020
you could try to persuade him?

758
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,720
Please.

759
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,290
Grandfather isn't here.

760
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:10,860
Who are you putting on a show for?

761
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,120
What is this?

762
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:27,730
I took it from home.

763
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:30,330
I've never seen a lord like you.

764
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,840
My grandfather is so old and weak.

765
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,190
Can't you avoid this?

766
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:35,810
Must you insist on getting beaten up?

767
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:38,670
You made my grandfather

768
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:40,690
bear the crime of assaulting a great minister?

769
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,130
If I hadn't taken these beatings,

770
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:47,730
how could he have calmed down so quickly?

771
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:51,510
I think in your Qiao family,

772
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:53,290
from top to bottom,

773
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,130
only he's reasonable.

774
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,250
You should learn from him.

775
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:00,420
That temper of yours

776
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,690
is like a stone in the latrine.

777
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:08,690
I'm stinky and hard,

778
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,980
but I didn't delay you chasing me, did I?

779
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:15,540
Good.

780
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:19,860
You mean I'm like a fly, right?

781
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,810
Behave yourself.

782
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,940
Injuries to bones take 100 days to heal.

783
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:28,210
My Lord, remember today's pain.

784
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,960
In the future, sit in a wheelchair

785
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,810
and go home to recover if you need to.

786
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:34,650
Don't run around outside

787
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,290
to avoid being beaten up.

788
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,500
You're still bullying me.
