14
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,080
Come on.

15
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,300
This is Lord Huaiyang.

16
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,890
Greetings, Lord Huaiyang.

17
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,080
Father, I want to ride the big horse.

18
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,920
Alright.

19
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,380
Take him to play.

20
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,500
Mr. Cui.

21
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,660
There's no need to worry.

22
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,450
You should learn from me,

23
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,150
with family by your side,

24
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,850
enjoying the blessings of concubines.

25
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,850
The imperial edict has been issued.

26
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,430
If you don't go,

27
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,530
that wouldn't be proper.

28
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,120
What if the Emperor misunderstands

29
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,520
that I kept you here in Beizhou?

30
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,060
What would we do then?

31
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,670
My memory isn't great,

32
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,290
but I seem to recall saying

33
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,760
I'm only afraid even if you

34
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,870
want to send me away,

35
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,340
you won't be able to.

36
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,060
Mr. Cui,

37
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,800
I'm not trying to send you away.

38
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,460
I'm thinking of your well-being.

39
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:39,950
Even if

40
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,250
you go to the Palace

41
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,290
as per the edict,

42
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,830
you can still find a way

43
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:45,940
to take a concubine later.

44
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,620
You're incredibly resourceful.

45
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,920
When it comes to emotions,

46
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,340
why don't you know how to adapt?

47
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:52,950
Help!

48
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,730
- Jinyan!
- Help me!

49
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,930
- Help me!
- Someone, hurry!

50
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,130
Save me!

51
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,570
Help!

52
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,940
Help me! Someone, help!

53
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,900
Save me!

54
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,290
Father, hurry and save me!

55
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,410
Save me, save me!

56
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,850
Help me!

57
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,100
Help me!

58
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,110
Help me!

59
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,620
Let go, let go!

60
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,200
Help me!

61
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,780
Are you alright?

62
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,620
I'm fine. I'm fine.

63
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,340
How bad are the injuries?

64
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,710
My Lord, don't scare me.

65
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,010
How badly is the Lord hurt?

66
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,390
The Lord

67
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,900
fell from his horse.

68
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,610
His whole body is injured.

69
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:21,930
The most severe

70
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,530
is this leg.

71
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,460
His left leg is broken.

72
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,640
Even with the best medicine

73
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,140
in the world to cure him,

74
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,410
he might be limping

75
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,170
for the rest of his life.

76
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,730
Mr. Cui.

77
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,880
Your leg

78
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,490
got hurt from saving Jinyan.

79
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,520
You are my son's benefactor

80
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,850
and the benefactor of my family.

81
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,700
If you're crippled in the future,

82
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,020
I'll make you a crutch.

83
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,020
If you're paralyzed,

84
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,140
I'll take care of you for life.

85
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:02,460
My Lord,

86
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,220
I appreciate your kindness,

87
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,490
but I'm

88
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,520
about to marry

89
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,610
Princess Wuhua.

90
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:19,340
Naturally, I will spend my life

91
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,340
with her.

92
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,270
What are you doing?

93
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,050
Slow down, slow down.

94
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,460
Don't worry about me.

95
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,100
I just need to move a bit,

96
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,580
but my leg

97
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:41,680
is numb.

98
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,290
It hurts so much it's gone numb.

99
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,410
Then don't move.

100
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,480
No way.

101
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,640
I've had

102
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,850
many injuries.

103
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,160
Even if this leg is shattered.

104
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,270
I can't delay even for a moment.

105
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,120
I must go to the capital.

106
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,600
I can't disappoint

107
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,710
the Grand Empress Dowager's decree.

108
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,460
Absolutely not, My Lord!

109
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,700
With a little bump

110
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,780
on the road,

111
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,480
if something goes wrong,

112
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,430
you might never

113
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,270
get out of bed again.

114
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,110
And...

115
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,190
And...

116
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,930
A lifetime

117
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,140
without descendants.

118
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,900
Princess Wuhua

119
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:41,410
is of noble status.

120
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,610
Being with a cripple like me

121
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,530
would be a huge sacrifice for her.

122
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,290
If the Princess doesn't mind,

123
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,790
even if I lose these legs,

124
00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:59,700
and I can't

125
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,260
consummate the marriage,

126
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,970
I have a sincere heart for the Princess.

127
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,490
For the rest of our lives,

128
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,220
we will love each other,

129
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,490
never parting.

130
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,140
If the Princess

131
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,640
is willing to care for the Lord

132
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,440
by his bed for the rest of her life,

133
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,140
then the Lord will surely

134
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,830
soon be able to walk with a crutch.

135
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,260
Everyone in the world

136
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,680
will praise the Princess

137
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,740
for her virtuous character.

138
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,350
This is a serious matter.

139
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,240
It's up to the Grand Empress Dowager

140
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,660
and His Majesty.

141
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,030
Your health is important.

142
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,260
You should rest in Beizhou

143
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,270
to avoid worsening your injuries

144
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,830
on the road.

145
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,830
I will report

146
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,080
your condition truthfully.

147
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,320
The Grand Empress Dowager

148
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,530
will not blame you.

149
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,660
- Yes, yes.
- Then my princess...

150
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,800
Forget it.

151
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,700
How considerate

152
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,340
of you.

153
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,120
Right now, nothing

154
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,410
is more important than health.

155
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,290
Rest well at my mansion.

156
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,480
Lord Zhao,

157
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,530
if you can cure his illness,

158
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,000
use any herbs

159
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,170
in the house.

160
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,260
I will do my best.

161
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,480
Then

162
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,470
rest well.

163
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,580
We'll leave now.

164
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:20,430
Alright.

165
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,430
Let's go.

166
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,410
Sorry, I can't escort you further.

167
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,370
With your skills,

168
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,970
to save a child from falling off a horse,

169
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,200
even if you couldn't escape unscathed,

170
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,970
it shouldn't have ended up like this.

171
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,030
Push me up a bit.

172
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,300
Push me up. I'll lean.

173
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,130
I didn't expect

174
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,010
that such a small fall

175
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,630
could almost end my family line.

176
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,420
Wasn't I helping you?

177
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,180
Why do this to yourself?

178
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,460
Don't worry.

179
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,080
I have a plan.

180
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,300
What's the plan?

181
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,870
Let me tell you. This is a real injury.

182
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,040
If you don't take care of it,

183
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,460
you might really end up limping.

184
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,540
At the cost of the leg injury,

185
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,400
I managed to cancel the marriage.

186
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,240
It's worth it.

187
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,010
You did all this,

188
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,420
yet she won't appreciate it.

189
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,820
I'm doing this out of my own volition.

190
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,720
It has nothing to do with Miantang.

191
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,120
Let me tell you. Don't tell her.

192
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,370
If you tell her...

193
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,180
Alright, I won't mention it to her.

194
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,650
You know.

195
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,870
Cui Xingzhou

196
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,340
has finished the imperial business

197
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,060
and the decree has arrived.

198
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,850
Why hasn't he left yet?

199
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,870
Why not persuade him

200
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,440
to hurry up and head to the capital

201
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,590
and marry the Princess

202
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,300
without any worries?

203
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,590
Lu Zhong.

204
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,200
Sister.

205
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,710
Is this the new physician you mentioned

206
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,630
for the escort agency?

207
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:15,470
Yes, this is him.

208
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,280
If you think

209
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,350
he's talking nonsense

210
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,460
and is a fake physician,

211
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,580
we're short of a punching bag.

212
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,970
Ms. Liu, does your hand still hurt?

213
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,400
I went to great lengths to make that medicine.

214
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,580
Are you still using it?

215
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,340
Go on with your work.

216
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,430
Yes.

217
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,400
You really don't need

218
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,370
to tell me these things.

219
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,750
He is the dignified Lord Huaiyang,

220
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,850
about to marry the Princess.

221
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,590
I am just a common woman.

222
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,940
Even if I meet him,

223
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,940
I can only say congratulations.

224
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,750
He stayed here for you.

225
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,030
My Lord,

226
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,560
that's too much of a burden.

227
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,400
He has legs.

228
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,870
I neither restrained him

229
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,580
nor broke his leg with a stick.

230
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,820
If you want him to change his mind soon,

231
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,270
you should use your brain

232
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,060
and persuade him with your words.

233
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,350
Ms. Liu,

234
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,580
I have one more favor to ask.

235
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:12,970
Where

236
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,490
is He Zhen?

237
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,610
Do you

238
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,340
really want to see her?

239
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,920
I still have

240
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,440
unfinished business with her that needs

241
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,820
to be resolved face-to-face.

242
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,340
You know.

243
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:36,830
He Zhen

244
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,610
hates those who use power
and influence to oppress others.

245
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,300
If you come with a grand carriage

246
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,610
and horses like last time,

247
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,580
she will probably

248
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,770
avoid you completely.

249
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,890
Alright, I'll follow your advice.

250
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:58,980
(Kiln)

251
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,730
Listen to me.

252
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:05,180
Take some dry food with you before you go.

253
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,220
Dry food?

254
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,500
(Refinery, Kiln, Mist)

255
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,460
Is anyone there?

256
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,460
Is anyone there?

257
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,940
Which way is north?

258
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,820
North.

259
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,580
North.

260
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,240
There's someone.

261
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:49,850
There's someone!

262
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,490
There's someone!

263
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,540
Where is Shopkeeper He?

264
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,340
She's inside.

265
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,610
Here, take the pastry.

266
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:04,710
Here, here.

267
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,070
Well.

268
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,240
Oh, no.

269
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:19,940
Lord Zhao.

270
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,420
What is this?

271
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,010
An apology.

272
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,240
No need.

273
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:28,710
Well.

274
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,040
Is this

275
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,590
a rare item?

276
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:32,940
You know?

277
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:37,970
Why?

278
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,280
Well.

279
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,040
How much is this?

280
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,540
I'll compensate you.

281
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:44,770
No need for compensation.

282
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,180
I ran away from marriage,

283
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,820
disgracing your family.

284
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,180
We're

285
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:50,430
even now.

286
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,010
You're too generous.

287
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,060
As you say.

288
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,420
If there's nothing else,

289
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:09,840
just go back.

290
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,680
Wait.

291
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,340
It's not a rare item?

292
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,100
You scared me.

293
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,460
Wait, wait.

294
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,820
I have one more thing to ask of you.

295
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,070
What is it?

296
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,270
It's all my

297
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,890
useless best friend's fault.

298
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,220
He wants you to pass on a message.

299
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,130
To Liu Miantang?

300
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,190
No.

301
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,250
Go and say it yourself.

302
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,490
I have no standing in this.

303
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,300
I don't know what to say.

304
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:48,850
No.

305
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,300
Lord Huaiyang excels in horsemanship.

306
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,750
He deceived you,

307
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,940
so he lost his fortune

308
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,340
and fell from his horse.

309
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,610
Paralysis

310
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,370
is also possible.

311
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,510
The manager of Lord of Beizhou

312
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,360
told me this.

313
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,850
I didn't hear it from Zhao Quan.

314
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,460
Miantang.

315
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,300
What do you think?

316
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,640
It's done.

317
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,540
Last month, the escort agency

318
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,540
had a profit of twenty taels of gold

319
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,770
and thirty bolts of silk.

320
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,130
You're really doing math?

321
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,770
- Bye.
- Where to?

322
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,760
To the kitchen.

323
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,420
Could it be

324
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,820
you're making a tonic for Lord Huaiyang?

325
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,680
Such good news boosts my appetite.

326
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,100
I'll go and make more dishes.

327
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:58,950
Father.

328
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,580
Today, you have a letter.

329
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,250
Who sent it?

330
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:18,430
No idea.

331
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,440
It only says it's to you.

332
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,770
What does the letter say?

333
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,590
Father.

334
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,760
Father.

335
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,370
It's my fault.

336
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,820
Let me tell you, Su.

337
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,080
Our Qingying is now married

338
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,100
to the Qian family of Nanyi,

339
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,940
a top-ranking wealthy family.

340
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,490
Even the Go board is made of jade.

341
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,420
Compared to them,

342
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,180
you are even less than a Go piece.

343
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,230
Since Qingying is well married,

344
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:53,710
our family can now

345
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,130
safely seek to marry Ms. Liu.

346
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,580
- You...
- Enough.

347
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,370
The second branch, go out.

348
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,540
- Father.
- Father.

349
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,540
Let's go outside first.

350
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,820
Why did you leave

351
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,340
without a word back then?

352
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,200
I previously had an appointment

353
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,170
with Ms. Qiao.

354
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,450
I was weak at the time,

355
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,120
but I was also worried

356
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,610
about causing Ms. Liu distress

357
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,130
due to Ms. Qiao.

358
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:27,470
Thus,

359
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,120
I waited until Ms. Qiao was married

360
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,350
before coming to apologize.

361
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,210
Debts.

362
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,200
Debts.

363
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,470
A prominent Beizhou family.

364
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,310
To marry my granddaughter,

365
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,150
what?

366
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,450
Are you losing your dignity?

367
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:43,910
Yes.

368
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,820
Sincerity can't just be

369
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,890
about words.

370
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:49,910
Father.

371
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,820
I heard that Mr. Su is a heavy gambler.

372
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,850
Recently, he incurred a huge debt

373
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,710
and was chased by creditors,

374
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,600
so his family fled Beizhou

375
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,070
without even a word,

376
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:01,070
disappearing like that.

377
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:02,070
We...

378
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:04,780
Our family has just recovered.

379
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,580
If Miantang marries him,

380
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,820
won't it be a loss of her and the money?

381
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:14,910
A misunderstanding.

382
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,500
A huge misunderstanding.

383
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:19,750
I took on debt

384
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,500
to help a friend.

385
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,600
Leaving Beizhou that day

386
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,750
was just

387
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,750
to clear

388
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,020
all the debts.

389
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,370
Stop talking nonsense.

390
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,060
I've already investigated thoroughly.

391
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,130
850 taels of gold.

392
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,450
It couldn't have been repaid in a few days.

393
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,360
My family is wealthy

394
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,580
with ways to generate income.

395
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,370
We have 3,000 mu of good land

396
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,760
and have recently

397
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,680
purchased several estates.

398
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,300
All our assets

399
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,710
are documented with official seals.

400
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,720
Uncle,

401
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,580
if you don't believe it,

402
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:57,610
I can show you

403
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,930
the documents anytime.

404
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,200
Since when did I have

405
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,410
a nephew like you?

406
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,880
Master Qiao,

407
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,610
you should think carefully.

408
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,980
If you miss this chance,

409
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,410
you might

410
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,880
delay

411
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,410
your granddaughter's future.

412
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:23,960
Father,

413
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:26,060
this matter is not that simple.

414
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,840
Grandfather,

415
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,580
since you understand my intentions,

416
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,310
please return

417
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,450
these betrothal gifts.

418
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,820
First, read this letter.

419
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,030
Does the letter's content

420
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,500
match the truth?

421
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,890
You were deceived in Zhenzhou,

422
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,500
becoming the mistress of a noble.

423
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,510
He wanted to sever ties with you.

424
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,850
And you

425
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,020
even followed him to Xizhou.

426
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:08,600
Well.

427
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,020
Who sent this letter?

428
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,740
Tell me.

429
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,300
Is this true?

430
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,680
What about Qiao Xian?

431
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,130
Does he know about this?

432
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,640
He's your uncle. What did he do?

433
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,210
It's all my fault.

434
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,210
Uncle only learned about it later,

435
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,470
and the details

436
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,210
are not as you imagine.

437
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,980
Where is the man

438
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,650
in the letter now?

439
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,040
He...

440
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,410
He's serving in the northwest.

441
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:40,540
Jerk!

442
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,840
Qiao Xian was in the northwest at the time.

443
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,470
Why didn't he deal with that scoundrel?

444
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,980
Why didn't he break that lecher's leg?

445
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,360
I've already severed ties with him.

446
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,740
You can rest assured.

447
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,540
How can I rest assured?

448
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,120
How many people know about this?

449
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,550
If word gets out in the countryside,

450
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:01,020
your reputation will be ruined.

451
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,300
How will you handle it?

452
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,740
I'm not afraid of rumors.

453
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,600
As a woman,

454
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,790
how can you not care

455
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,500
about your reputation?

456
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,230
I only fear

457
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,370
that my family will worry excessively

458
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:17,820
and make unnecessary plans for me.

459
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:23,820
Mr. Su

460
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,340
is sincere about marrying you.

461
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,820
If you still care about me,

462
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:33,370
you should marry him.

463
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,410
Grandfather,

464
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,850
do you only care about reputation?

465
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,820
You should marry,

466
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:44,260
and Mr. Su happens to be a good match.

467
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:46,820
Is it really possible for the man

468
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:49,020
in the letter to marry you?

469
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,880
Absolutely impossible.

470
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,740
I would never agree.

471
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,600
You should return

472
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,170
these betrothal gifts promptly.

473
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:05,820
According to the laws,

474
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,130
the certificate comes first.

475
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,710
Before the gifts,

476
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,740
both sides should sign
the marriage certificate,

477
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:11,960
or it's considered

478
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,690
forced marriage.

479
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,150
What?

480
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,820
Then I'll take care

481
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,740
of these matters for you.

482
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:26,910
Good.

483
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:28,820
Good.

484
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,260
The marriage certificate comes first.

485
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,070
Afterward, the Su family

486
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,790
sent my colleagues

487
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,230
to list all the land and property deeds,

488
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,400
matching each

489
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,850
with the official seal.

490
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,360
The Su family

491
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,120
is indeed very wealthy.

492
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,200
Mr. Qiao Xian

493
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,060
had nothing to say about it.

494
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,400
It seems it won't be long

495
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,890
before the Qiao family
will have double happiness.

496
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,980
The Emperor couldn't keep her back then,

497
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,880
and I couldn't do anything to her.

498
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,120
But now she's marrying someone

499
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,060
named Su?

500
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,160
I don't know

501
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,790
who this infatuated man was

502
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:08,300
who stopped the wedding procession

503
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,580
out of fear of...

504
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,300
Forget it. I didn't say anything.

505
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,210
You have a past,

506
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,020
and His Majesty has concerns.

507
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:19,650
However, Xingzhou,

508
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,580
the Su family

509
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,170
really does spare no expense

510
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,850
for Ms. Liu.

511
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:28,540
I also spare no expense.

512
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,850
Has she looked at me more than once?

513
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,310
Now, to marry

514
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,640
for money,

515
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,880
is she still Liu Miantang?

516
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,820
If what you say is true,

517
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,360
there's no need for me to show you

518
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,610
their marriage certificate.

519
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,680
Whose is it?

520
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,690
You should be familiar with this.

521
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,170
A few years ago,

522
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:53,070
Ms. Liu married in the capital

523
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,120
by order of her parents

524
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,360
and a matchmaker's arrangement

525
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,820
with a marriage certificate.

526
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,890
Today, the Su and Qiao families...

527
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,100
Why are you going?

528
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:05,650
Where are you going?

529
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:08,270
Get up.

530
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,580
You're still injured.

531
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,070
I need to clarify this.

532
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:13,640
Why are you holding me?

533
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,690
You need to calm down.

534
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,270
She is currently awaiting marriage

535
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,170
and is not seeing anyone.

536
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,610
This cannot be her own idea.

537
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,070
She is thinking of a solution.

538
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,180
- Right?
- Right.

539
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,820
Marriage is a serious matter, not a joke.

540
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,930
I've reviewed the marriage certificate.

541
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,440
It's not parallel prose

542
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,750
nor in proper form.

543
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,850
It's indeed hasty.

544
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,100
Don't worry.

545
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,300
I will not approve it hastily.

546
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,760
Don't rush.

547
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,260
Hurry back and sit down. You're still injured.

548
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:50,960
My leg hurts.

549
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,890
Have you thought it through?

550
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:00,580
Lu Zhong has bought the house for me.

551
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,710
I'll apply for a female household registration

552
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,610
and move out tomorrow.

553
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,650
Will your grandfather

554
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,930
agree to this?

555
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,340
He will never agree.

556
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,410
So, we will act first and report later.

557
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,020
Your grandfather will only think

558
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:15,310
you're leaving

559
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,370
because of marriage.

560
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,990
If he thinks that way,

561
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,370
that would be ideal.

562
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:25,480
The Su family suddenly

563
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,020
had so much land,

564
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,550
and Grandfather received

565
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:29,650
an anonymous letter.

566
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,890
Uncle, don't you find it suspicious?

567
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,610
Moreover, the letter is not

568
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:36,980
about a merchant in Lingquan Town

569
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:38,990
but a noble in Zhenzhou.

570
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:40,890
This is what my grandfather fears,

571
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,710
so he's been pressured

572
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:45,980
to force me into the Su family.

573
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,100
This is all aimed at me.

574
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:49,370
Therefore,

575
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,120
I won't let the Qiao family

576
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,210
be involved.

577
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,740
If absolutely necessary,

578
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,340
you can seek help from Lord Huaiyang.

579
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,040
No need.

580
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,610
He should be heading

581
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:05,740
to the capital soon.

582
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,850
Lord Huaiyang is still in Beizhou.

583
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,260
I heard he might not

584
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:10,980
marry the Princess.

585
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:16,540
He has his life.

586
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,040
My matters

587
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,650
should not trouble him.

588
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:39,340
(Auspice and Fortune)

589
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,640
My Lord, everything is as you expected.

590
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,410
Prince Sui's people have come to Beizhou.

591
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,300
Put this in the inner room.

592
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,640
(Laixi Courtyard)

593
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,030
Careful. Be careful with this.

594
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,880
These are all jewels and treasures.

595
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,020
- Be careful.
- Don't worry.

596
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,960
Move it over there.

597
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,800
- That room.
- Why isn't she staying at home?

598
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,000
- Come on.
- Why move out?

599
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:02,870
Come on.

600
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,720
Inside.

601
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,200
Everyone, thank you.

602
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,040
Thank you, Sister.

603
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,040
Thank you, Sister.

604
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,740
Thank you, Sister.

605
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,820
Is Ms. Liu at home?

606
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,060
Ms. Liu?

607
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,300
Is Ms. Liu at home?

608
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,360
Is Ms. Liu at home?

609
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,740
I'm from the house next door.

610
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,130
My wife made some pastries

611
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,300
for the neighbors in the alley.

612
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,740
Since you're already here,

613
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,690
why pretend to be a neighbor

614
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,020
and beat around the bush?

615
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,060
How did you know?

616
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,740
It's not a merchant who trapped me,

617
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,580
but a noble.

618
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,370
Only a few people know this secret.

619
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,820
With a bit of thought,

620
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,820
I could guess who sent the letter.

621
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,580
Within a month,

622
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,980
giving away three thousand mu of fertile land

623
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,170
is something only Prince Sui

624
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:13,720
in the kingdom

625
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,020
could afford.

626
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,020
Let me guess.

627
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:18,580
If I

628
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,270
were really forced

629
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,980
to marry Mr. Su,

630
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:25,370
I fear that once the procession
leaves Beizhou,

631
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,450
I would be drugged

632
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,880
and taken

633
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,540
to an unknown estate

634
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,060
where life and death

635
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:34,100
are controlled by Prince Sui.

636
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,340
At that time,

637
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,370
even the reigning Emperor could do nothing.

638
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,410
Am I correct in my guess?

639
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,130
Ms. Liu speaks heavily.

640
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:50,690
(Laixi Courtyard)
Though I do work for Prince Sui,

641
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:53,980
I am only passing through Beizhou
for official business.

642
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:55,740
Keep with your story.

643
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,890
As instructed by Prince Sui,

644
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,890
this trip is to resolve

645
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,850
past grievances with you.

646
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:05,270
What happened

647
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,580
is already in the past.

648
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:09,060
Prince Sui is magnanimous and forgiving

649
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:11,610
and wishes to clear up
misunderstandings with you.

650
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,100
Ms. Liu,

651
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:14,850
please open the door.

652
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:23,200
Ms. Liu, don't forget

653
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,610
that you still have family in Beizhou.

654
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,070
Some situations

655
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,990
cannot be resolved

656
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:30,890
by establishing a female household.

657
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,070
Go.

658
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:49,270
I'm not interested

659
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:50,600
in the pastries you brought.

660
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,260
Go back to where you came from.

661
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:53,890
Go, everyone.

662
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,360
Search all over.

663
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,470
Hurt them if you have to.

664
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:01,710
Just keep them alive.

665
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:02,550
Yes.

666
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:23,630
Over there.

667
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,540
Inside.

668
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,150
Lord Huaiyang.

669
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,500
What are you doing here?

670
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,850
An old friend moved.

671
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,170
I'm here for a housewarming.

672
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:58,640
There are many people here.

673
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,510
It's very lively. No need for a housewarming.

674
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,850
But you need me.

675
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,750
They're chatting already.

676
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:05,160
Why are you standing there?

677
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,000
Go!

678
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,240
Move aside.

679
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,300
Your archery skills are good, Lord Huaiyang.

680
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,920
Ms. Liu.

681
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,850
You flatter me.

682
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,800
Cui Xingzhou!

683
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:37,990
Protect the Lord!

684
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,180
- Protect them!
- Protect!

685
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,040
Don't move.

686
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:40,960
Be still.

687
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,210
Move and you'll be killed.

688
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:44,150
- Don't.
- My Lord.

689
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:45,030
- Stop.
- Don't move.

690
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,750
- Quickly. Don't move.
- This…

691
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,930
Spare my life, Lord Huaiyang.

692
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:59,100
Let me tell you.

693
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,170
The Lord of Beizhou has already declared

694
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,580
anyone

695
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,260
from Huizhou

696
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:06,930
would be killed.

697
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,650
If he doesn't go to the capital,

698
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,540
he will present to the throne

699
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,980
and place the blame on Prince Sui.

700
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:16,930
It seems

701
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:20,070
I can't marry Mr. Su

702
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:21,400
nor reconcile

703
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,650
with Prince Sui.

704
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,990
How the grudge between Prince Sui and Ms. Liu

705
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:25,960
should be settled

706
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,130
is up to you.

707
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,200
Yes.

708
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,880
You tell me how you want

709
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,980
to deal with them.

710
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,850
Please, Ms. Liu, have mercy

711
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,470
and spare my humble life.

712
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,310
I...

713
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,610
As for how to deal with them,

714
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:39,990
I believe Lord Huaiyang

715
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,300
must've had a decision in mind.

716
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:43,740
I'm just pained that my courtyard

717
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,890
has been ruined beyond recognition.

718
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,020
Got it?

719
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:49,850
Yes, Madam.

720
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,020
Madam, goodbye.

721
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:27,150
Let's go.

722
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,560
My hands, my hands.

723
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,260
(Laixi Courtyard)

724
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,860
Your soldiers are more sensible than you.

725
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,100
Do you mean

726
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,940
they all call you madam?

727
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,540
I mean

728
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:01,540
they all disappear promptly and efficiently.

729
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:10,510
Can you still stand?

730
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,350
I can stand,

731
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:16,100
but I'd like a seat.

732
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,160
My Lord,

733
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,380
the carriage has arrived.

734
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,770
Safe travels, My Lord.

735
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,210
It truly bothers me.

736
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,540
Cui Xingzhou.

737
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,760
You said that the local ruffians

738
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,130
want to steal your woman.

739
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:09,030
I lent you the manpower

740
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,510
just to make a show.

741
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,630
Why didn't you tell me

742
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,130
it was Prince Sui's people?

743
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,510
I already told you to be cautious.

744
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,760
Why did you offend

745
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,980
Prince Sui again?

746
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,860
- You…
- Now you can only

747
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,650
go to the capital.

748
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,200
Come. Come here.

749
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,900
Now you...

750
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,560
His Majesty.

751
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,640
Prince Sui.

752
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:38,830
Really?

753
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,210
My Lord.

754
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,200
My Lord.

755
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,800
Your Majesty.

756
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,290
Your Majesty, why don't you light the lamp?

757
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,810
Light the lamp

758
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,280
so we can see things more clearly

759
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,500
in black and white.

760
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,860
(From Chancellor Liu Donghai)

761
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:27,580
Grand Marshal Shi.

762
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,940
You're well-versed in rites.

763
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,730
Tell me.

764
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,460
Can Shi Yikuan be honored

765
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,100
at the Imperial Ancestral Shrine?

766
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,900
The shrine belongs to the imperial family.

767
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,670
In the past century,

768
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,630
only nine founding heroes

769
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,020
have been honored there.

770
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:47,880
Other meritorious officials

771
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,170
must have made
significant contributions to the state

772
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,630
to be buried there

773
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:54,580
with the honor of a lord.

774
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,980
Mr. Shi has helped you ascend the throne

775
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,020
and is your father-in-law,

776
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,290
but he lacks extraordinary merit.

777
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,900
Forgive me for speaking frankly.

778
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,280
He doesn't deserve his position.

779
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,810
Submitting three petitions

780
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,210
is shameless.

781
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,500
If Your Majesty agrees,

782
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,980
I'm afraid in the future,

783
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,770
even a minor official,

784
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,650
while he's dying,

785
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:19,580
would want to enter the shrine.

786
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:24,250
Minister Shi thinks highly of himself.

787
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,980
He's a good move to checkmate Prince Sui.

788
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,110
Your Majesty,

789
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,460
what are your plans?

790
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,900
He wants honor.

791
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,420
I'll give him honor.

792
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,240
(Minister's Mansion)

793
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,730
It's the Empress's procession.

794
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,540
It's Xueji.

795
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,650
It's Xueji.

796
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,210
It's Xueji.

797
00:38:58,550 --> 00:38:59,650
She's back.

798
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:14,940
Greetings, Your Majesty.

799
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,070
We're all family,

800
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,880
No need for formalities.

801
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,300
Thank you, Your Majesty.

802
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,590
I prepared some gifts

803
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:29,940
for you to choose from.

804
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:21,020
They are good for other sisters,

805
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:23,170
but isn't the reward from Your Highness

806
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,330
a bit light for me?

807
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:28,950
Don't.

808
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,080
What's wrong?

809
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,840
However high she flies,

810
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,330
she's still our sister.

811
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:34,940
Insolent!

812
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,600
Father, I...

813
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:40,980
Get out!

814
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:43,870
Yes.

815
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,130
I'm Shi Yikuan.

816
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,380
Greetings, Your Majesty.

817
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:58,020
Leave!

818
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:02,420
- Yes.
- Yes.

819
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:12,210
You're acting like an Empress now,

820
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,810
so powerful.

821
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:15,960
Your sister

822
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,500
spoke rashly,

823
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,210
but she was right about one thing.

824
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,580
Even if you're honored,

825
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:27,290
never forget your family.

826
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,940
Always work for the Shi family.

827
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,580
I shall never forget.

828
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:35,960
Have you forgotten

829
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,290
what I asked of you?

830
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,590
I sent you letters,

831
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:44,420
but you didn't respond to any.

832
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:46,590
I'm not asking you

833
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:48,650
to kill or rob,

834
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:50,690
just for a nominal title

835
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,250
to be honored at the imperial shrine.

836
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,290
The Emperor is your husband.

837
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,770
It's just a word from you.

838
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,580
Why haven't you acted?

839
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:05,250
Because I don't want to agree.

840
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,800
What?

841
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,880
Father, you're already the Grand Marshal,

842
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,730
trusted unconditionally by His Majesty.

843
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:15,280
With more merit,

844
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,380
rewards will come naturally.

845
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,320
Why rush

846
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,810
for a nominal title now?

847
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,810
What do you know?

848
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,290
I understand

849
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,540
Father resents Prince Sui,

850
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:31,420
and Prince Sui is deeply suspicious.

851
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:35,420
But His Majesty just dismissed Minister Lu.

852
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,840
If you're made

853
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,210
to be enshrined now,

854
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,730
Prince Sui will be displeased.

855
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,900
The Shi family

856
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,060
will become everyone's target.

857
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:49,540
If His Majesty wants
to eliminate Prince Sui's faction,

858
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,330
who can he rely on?

859
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:54,650
The clean, upright officials in the Censorate?

860
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,100
He has to rely on me.

861
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:01,020
If you act like this,

862
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,810
how are you different from Prince Sui?

863
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:11,070
Don't forget you wouldn't be

864
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:12,330
in this position today

865
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:13,940
if it weren't for me.

866
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,650
Without me,

867
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,130
you'd be nothing.

868
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:22,150
No wonder rumors say

869
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:23,770
you're not favored in the Palace.

870
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,330
No wonder.

871
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:27,290
With your wooden face,

872
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,860
I'm annoyed just looking at you.

873
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,110
Instead of arguing,

874
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,060
why don't you think

875
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,170
