Honey.

16
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,960
Do you still remember

17
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,410
that ruffian who impersonated you?

18
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,540
I remember.

Nanny Li said

20
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,220
our marriage certificate

21
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,700
was lost during the move.

22
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,300
I saw the certificate

23
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,220
the ruffian had,

24
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,500
but I didn't find anything unusual.

25
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,220
Thinking it over,

26
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,780
it's probably ours.

27
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,860
It doesn't matter.

28
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,860
How can it not matter?

29
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,380
That's not just a marriage agreement.

30
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,700
It also has

31
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,220
both our names on it.

32
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,020
If it's a man with the same name,

33
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,620
as long as it's not you, Cui Jiu,

34
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,220
it holds no meaning.

35
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,220
I truly hate that scoundrel

36
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,060
for daring to steal your name

37
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,660
and taint our names.

38
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,020
I mean I've asked the authorities.

39
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,220
That marriage certificate isn't ours.

40
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,100
Is that so?

41
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,180
That's a relief.

42
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,900
Don't get upset over this.

43
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,900
You're not healthy enough.

you're drunk.

78
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,380
Why do you still call me uncle?

79
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,060
You should call me father instead.

00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,020

00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,220

91
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,250
to hear Binglan

92
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,780
call me mother.

93
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:39,500
Xingzhou has waited three years

94
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,380

How do you plan

112
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,180
to organize your wedding?

Madam, why are you suddenly buying fabric?

134
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,780
To make clothes?

135
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,220
Not for clothes.

136
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,900

I'd like to choose a red fabric

that's resistant to decay.

143
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,940
Red with gold. Resistant to decay.

00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:13,940
It's done, My Lord.

My Lord,

165
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,860
are you preparing for the wedding

166
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,140
or settling...

167

Or settling Ms. Liu?

Rest assured, My Lord.

169
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,060
I'll take care of these things.

170

Nanny Li and Fan Hu will look after her.

172
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,420
Prepare the carriage.

173
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:04,980

Yes.

winning the beauty.

178
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,660
So why are you

179

like a solitary figure?

180
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,620
I envy you, though.

At least Cousin Lian

No.

184
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,820
She's committed to the position
as the Princess.

185
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,700
That's still faithful.

186
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,740
At least she didn't run away
before the wedding,

187
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,100
leaving you in disgrace.

188
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,900
If she had someone else in her heart,

189
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,020
we'd truly be brothers in misfortune.

190
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,700
Come here.

191
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,380

192
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,980
I'm very content.

193
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,460
If you're content,

194
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,860
why did you ask me to drink?

195
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,020
I'm thirsty.

196
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,100
Be honest with me.

197
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,140
Do you feel guilty

198
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,460
abandoning Liu Miantang?

199
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,180
It was all just a show

200
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,540
from the start.

201
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,900
Now that everything is back on track.

202
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:23,980
Why would I feel guilty?

203
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,540
If I continued deceiving her...

204
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,300
You're still guilty after all.

205
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,300
True.

206
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,140
Sending Liu Miantang back to her family,

207
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,580
without holding her past,

208
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,660
and freeing her,

209
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,060
is indeed a great kindness

210
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,420
from you.

211
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:41,180
Anyway, Liu Miantang is happy.

212
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,660
When she reaches Beizhou

213
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,940
and receives that letter,

214
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,380
learning the harsh truth,

215
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,580
no matter how stormy her emotions,

216
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,060
she won't be able to confront you.

217
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:52,660
This move

218
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,540
is truly brilliant.

219
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,860
I admit it.

220
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:00,500
I don't dare face her for a farewell,

221
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,140
nor do I dare

222
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,860
to explain everything in person.

223
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,780
Then why did you let her go?

224
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,020
Even if you kept her around,

225
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,420
with Cousin Lian's temperament,

226
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,300
there wouldn't be any trouble.

227
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,540
Without any choice,

228
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,740
the crabapple blossoms have fallen.

229
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,580
The swallows return,

230
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,460
familiar yet new.

231
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,460
Madam,

232
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,220
the wind is strong.

233
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,260
With the medicine on,

234
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,660
go rest quickly.

235
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,060
Nanny Li.

236
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,980
Did you prepare the robes

237
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,500
and the charcoal stove as I asked?

238
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,100
Yes, everything is ready.

239
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,980
Tomorrow, Moru will deliver them

240
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,420
to the master.

241
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,620
This is the first time
he's been away for so long.

242
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,180
I wonder

243
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,780
if he's adjusting well to life on the mountain.

244
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,220
I heard

245
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,180
that Go masters tend to be quite eccentric.

246
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,500
I hope he isn't having a hard time.

247
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:34,580
Moru will take care of the master.

248
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,580
Follow the master's wishes

249
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,820
and go visit your family in Beizhou at ease.

250
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,060
Spend some quality time at your grandpa's home.

251
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,980
When that time comes...

252
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,660
What?

253
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,020
By then,

254
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,180
the master

255
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,020
should have returned home.

256
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,620
Lately,

257
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,660
my right eyelid keeps twitching.

258
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,620
I can't shake this uneasy feeling.

259
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,980
Well.

260
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,180
You must be exhausted from working

261
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,860
in the shop these past few days.

262
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,100
You should rest earlier.

263
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,620
Madam,

264
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,500
the carriage and luggage for Beizhou

265
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,300
are all prepared.

266
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,420
We can

267
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,060
set off anytime.

268
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,700
I don't want to go to Beizhou now.

269
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,780
Why not?

270
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,420
There's still

271
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,220
something unfinished here.

272
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,740
I'm Shi Yikuan, Chief Commander of Qingzhou.

273
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,780
Greetings, My Lord.

274
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,620
General Shi.

275
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,180
Please come in.

276
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,820
(Soldier Documents)
My Lord.

277
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,340
Thirteen thousand men have been enlisted.

278
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,180
Those unwilling for service,

279
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,060
of old age or frailty

280
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,740
have been sent back home.

281
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,500
From now on,

282
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,740
our country

283
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,900
is free from the worries of Mount Yang.

284
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:27,940
General,

285
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,020
your meticulous work

286
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,020
has been invaluable.

287
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,940
I will surely speak for you

288
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,660
to the Empress Dowager.

289
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,060
A promotion is in your future.

290
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,300
Ziyu is already my future son-in-law.

291
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,540
The Mount Yang issue

292
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:51,180
is practically a family matter now.

293
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,580
Besides,

294
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,780
as a military man,

295
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,900
if it weren't for your guidance,

296
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,620
I wouldn't have thought

297
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,260
of such a perfect plan

298
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,580
to pacify Mount Yang and gain a son-in-law.

299
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,500
However, Ziyu

300
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,540
once was...

301
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,340
General,

302
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,300
I hold Ziyu

303
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,820
in high regard.

304
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,100
He comes from the underworld,

305
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,300
but as they say,

306
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,540
heroes are not defined by their origins.

307
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,940
Yes.

308
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,660
My Lord.

309
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,660
Does your admiration

310
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,300
stem from official duty

311
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,620
or personal affection?

312
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:46,940
The court desires

313
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,420
to reduce the power of regional governors,

314
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,300
starting with those

315
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,620
not of royal blood.

316
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,700
If someone from Zhenzhou
insists on being rebellious,

317
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,020
then our loyalty

318
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,780
will make us virtuous officials.

319
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,260
When the time comes,

320
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,900
General, you'll be a favored minister,

321
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,420
and I

322
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,100
will also be blessed.

323
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,380
For both public and personal reasons,

324
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,300
our goals align,

325
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,140
General.

326
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,060
Our goals align.

327
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,140
Miss, are you still managing?

328
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,140
Why not let me carry more of it?

329
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,700
- Careful yourself.
- Don't run!

330
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,540
If it drops...

331
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,260
- Slow down!
- Sorry!

332
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,140
Sorry! Sorry!

333
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,180
What should we do?

334
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,540
Stop running!

335
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,740
Mr. Ziyu.

336
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,660
I thought I saw you earlier

337
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,580
but wasn't sure.

338
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:45,900
What a coincidence.

339
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,740
You really like that crimson.

340
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,460
You just bought it,

341
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,740
and you're holding it.

342
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,100
It's for my sister.

343
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,540
What about yours?

344
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,780
I have enough clothes.

345
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,780
No need for more.

346
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,140
I'll wait for my sister.

347
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,220
- Help her with it.
- Yes.

348
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,420
I wouldn't dare trouble you.

349
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,980
Our family's carriage is just ahead.

350
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:19,820
No trouble at all.

351
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,620
I'll escort you.

352
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,140
The market here is quite lively.

353
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,180
Is there anything you like?

354
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,420
Feel free to choose.

355
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:40,740
A proper lady

356
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,180
should stay within her bounds.

357
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,180
I only came out to buy things.

358
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,700
It's best not to linger.

359
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,060
There are many candy vendors

360
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,780
along the way.

361
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,940
They must be popular among young ladies.

362
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,140
Would you like to try some?

363
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,820
Thank you.

364
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,340
But my mother always taught me

365
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,700
that street food is improper.

366
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,860
You should adhere to those teachings.

367
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,820
Forgive my presumptuousness.

368
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,620
Take it. Careful.

369
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,460
- Come back.
- Go.

370
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,860
Let's go home and eat.

371
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,060
Take a look.

372
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,120
Come on.

373
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,740
Want some?

374
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:46,620
Yes.

375
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,500
This is heavy.

376
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,100
Take it over there.

377
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,060
Thank you for your help today.

378
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:54,940
Slow down.

379
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,140
Zhuwen.

380
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,140
What's this?

381
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,340
Mr. Lu bought two bolts

382
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,300
of fine patterned silk.

383
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,620
I think they're

384
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,060
prettier than that crimson one.

385
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,200
I've heard that you're

386
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,420
highly favored at home.

387
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,940
I must do my best

388
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,780
to ensure you aren't wronged.

389
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,540
Don't lose the rouge

390
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,900
you just bought.

391
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,780
Thank you, Young Master.

392
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,980
What...

393
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,020
What are you doing?

394
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,420
I...

395
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,180
Maintain your distance.

396
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,500
My sister is about to be married,

397
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:38,860
and you can't afford

398
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,180
to offend her fiance.

399
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,300
Are you mad?

400
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,220
How dare you walk with a strange man?

401
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,300
- This...
- If that bandit sees this,

402
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,100
who knows how he'll punish you?

403
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,100
Sister, he...

404
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,100
The bandit?

405
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,220
Miss Shi, is that what you call me?

406
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,460
Sister,

407
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,980
this is Mr. Ziyu

408
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,300
from Mount Yang.

409
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,620
(Jinchen Tea)

410
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,980
Congratulations, Miss.

411
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:30,180
Your wish is finally coming true.

412
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,140
At the auspicious hour today,

413
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,300
the Lord will personally deliver the gift list,

414
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,460
showing his respect

415
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,220
and esteem for you.

416
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,340
Cousin Xingzhou has always

417
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,220
been thoughtful and considerate towards me.

418
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,540
Of course.

419
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,260
Once the gift list arrives,

420
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,420
only the wedding ceremony remains.

421
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,740
Miss,

422
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,060
after today,

423
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,260
you'll no longer be my lady.

424
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,100
I will have to start calling you Princess.

425
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,500
The auspicious hour approaches.
It's time to depart.

426
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,740
(Betrothal Gift List)

427
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:07,780
Go wait for me.

428
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,140
Yes.

429
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,060
This pattern of twin lotuses

430
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,660
is exquisite.

431
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,740
The colors are perfect,

432
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,420
creating a sense of white and cyan.

433
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,660
How elegant and pure.

434
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,380
Yushao Porcelain Shop.

435
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,140
I remember this shop.

436
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:52,300
They made the fish bowl with Tancho Kohaku

437
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,300
in the courtyard.

438
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:58,660
Is the owner here today?

439
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,180
I am here.

440
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,060
I didn't expect the owner

441
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,380
to be a woman.

442
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,740
Only someone as talented and refined as you

443
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,060
could create

444
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,580
such beautiful porcelain.

445
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,460
Indeed.

446
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,380
You're too kind.

447
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,300
I was inspired by the Lord's wedding,

448
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,040
and only with such best wishes

449
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,100
could I craft this vase.

450
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,900
I wish the Lord and his future Princess

451
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,980
everlasting peace,

452
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,940
like the twin lotuses,

453
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,860
united forever, staying together,

454
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,180
with many kids and blessings.

455
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,580
Well said.

456
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,740
What a clever and charming girl.

457
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,780
The Consort Dowager likes your porcelain.

458
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:47,820
You...

459
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,420
Please instruct anything.

460
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,900
No need to bother.

461
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,540
Why?

462
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:01,860
Consort Dowager,

463
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,260
the Lord sent word earlier

464
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,260
that he doesn't favor their porcelain.

465
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,340
The He family, leading the merchants,

466
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,580
has contributed greatly

467
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,420
to the county.

468
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,940
The wedding porcelain business

469
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,140
has been given to them.

470
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,180
If that's the Lord's decision,

471
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,700
so be it.

472
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,700
On behalf of the shop,

473
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,900
we're grateful

474
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,660
to the Consort Dowager and the Lord.

475
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,300
Congratulations. Congratulations.

476
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,660
My Lord.

477
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,140
My Lord.

478
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,180
Stop!

479
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,180
How dare you

480
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,620
walk freely in the mansion?

481
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,780
My Lord.

482
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:58,140
I am Liu Miantang. My husband is Cui Jiu.

483
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:58,980
Your Go companion.

484
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,300
These past days,

485
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:06,020
I'm grateful for your care of my husband.

486
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,500
He loves Go

487
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,180
and considers it a blessing

488
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,340
to have met you.

489
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,220
But

490
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,220
we are simple folk.

491
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,140
My husband is gentle and weak.

492
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,580
He only wishes

493
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,540
for a peaceful life with me,

494
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,860
without the intention of mixing with nobility.

495
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,500
If we have offended you in any way,

496
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,900
please forgive us.

497
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,100
What's with the panic?

498
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,060
My Lord.

499
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,540
The Emperor's uncle is here,

500
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,460
with a royal decree.

501
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,100
The Emperor has decreed.

502
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,660
The western tribes invaded us,

503
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:02,860
affecting the people.

504
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,260
Cui Xingzhou, Lord Huaiyang,

505
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,380
is a loyal official,

506
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,700
serving the country,

507
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,780
and keeping promises.

508
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,060
Based on your merits,

509
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,740
you are hereby General of the Western Front,

510
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,060
commanding the entire army of Zhenzhou.

511
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,540
Within a month, you must reach Jinjia Pass

512
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,820
and intimidate the tribes.

513
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,220
The end.

514
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,660
Lord Huaiyang,

515
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,860
accept the decree.

516
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,020
Lord Huaiyang

517
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,780
isn't someone easy to deal with.

518
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,260
Such a decree

519
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,220
might anger him.

520
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,220
You're the Emperor's uncle.

521
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,180
With the Emperor's decree,

522
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,900
no matter how bold Cui Xingzhou is,

523
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,060
he wouldn't dare oppose you.

524
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,860
Do you think so, Your Majesty?

525
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,860
The books say

526
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,460
the ancient sages created a wooden kite

527
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,780
to fly in the sky

528
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,460
and shoot enemies.

529
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:08,100
If the Ministry of Works can produce it,

530
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,140
our kingdom

531
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,100
wouldn't need Lord Huaiyang

532
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,140
to constantly trouble Mother.

533
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,460
You're right, Your Majesty.

534
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,700
But what if he refuses to accept the decree?

535
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,380
Then it wouldn't be my fault

536
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:27,740
to charge him with defying imperial orders

537
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,420
and implicating his entire family.

538
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,260
Lord Huaiyang,

539
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,260
are you to defy the decree?

540
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,100
I

541
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,620
accept the decree.

542
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,260
My Lord,

543
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,340
please rise.

544
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,740
And please inform the Emperor

545
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,500
and the Empress Dowager

546
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,860
that I'll prepare the troops

547
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,460
and reach Jinjia Pass

548
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,580
within a month.

549
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,380
Having a general like you

550
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,660
is truly a blessing for our kingdom,

551
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:15,060
the Emperor and the Empress Dowager.

552
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,180
The peace of the northwestern border

553
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,220
for the next decades

554
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,220
depends on this battle.

555
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,420
Do not let down

556
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,140
the common people.

557
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:30,620
My Lord.

558
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,620
I have to go.

559
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,300
I will take my leave.

560
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,020
You aren't a border general.

561
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,220
Jinjia Pass is in the northwest,

562
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:49,900
where a general familiar
with the terrain and climate is needed.

563
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,100
Moreover,

564
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,060
the court does have other generals.

565
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,740
Our army has been reduced by half.

566
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,260
The canal troops

567
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,260
cannot be dispatched.

568
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:59,460
Jinjia Pass is far in the northwest.

569
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:01,140
How can we arrive in a month?

570
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,740
Is there no room for negotiation?

571
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,420
Mother.

572
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,220
The war is not so terrifying.

573
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,820
It's the mobilization of the entire army today

574
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:20,500
that has been overwhelming.

575
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,700
I really wish I could

576
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,740
split myself in two.

577
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,060
How can you still be smiling?

578
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,380
This...

579
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,180
Defying is punishable by death.

580
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,500
It's not what an official does.

581
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,740
Only going to battle provides some leeway.

582
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,180
Mother,

583
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,980
please forgive me.

584
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,380
If it's necessary,

585
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,100
I would also wish

586
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,340
for you to fulfill one of my wishes.

587
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,660
Mother, please speak,

588
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,020
and I will fulfill it.

589
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,020
Good.

590
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,640
Before you go to battle,

591
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,380
marry Binglan.

592
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,060
But

593
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,900
with the battle imminent,

594
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,100
all arrangements

595
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,180
must be simplified.

596
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:43,060
Tomorrow morning,

597
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,260
go to the Lian Mansion to bring her over.

598
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,660
Consort Dowager.

599
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,860
Binglan...

600
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,260
What happened to her?

601
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,180
A while ago,

602
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,540
she said she felt unwell.

603
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,620
When she learned Xingzhou
was going to the battlefield,

604
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,860
she was stricken

605
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,540
with anxiety.

606
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,380
Look. Look.

607
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,700
She broke out in a rash,

608
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,900
some of which is still oozing.

609
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,340
The physician said

610
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:20,220
if she doesn't get proper care,

611
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,620
the fever might reach her brain,

612
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,700
which is incurable.

613
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,900
She seemed fine the other day.

614
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,940
Why did she fall ill now?

615
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,980
- Well.
- Is it serious?

616
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,740
Well.

617
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,220
I don't know.

618
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,100
Speaking of which,

619
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,540
I still have

620
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,180
many matters in my family

621
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,700
waiting for me to handle.

622
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:42,860
Consort Dowager...

623
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:43,820
Aunt.

624
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,260
In that case,

625
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,780
don't delay any further.

626
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,060
Aunt,

627
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,060
you may go back now.

628
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,460
Alright.

629
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,300
Mother,

630
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,500
the Lian family is refusing.

631
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,660
They fear your son will go and not return,

632
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,860
and that their daughter

633
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,460
will become a widow.

634
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,900
Binglan's illness is

635
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,620
due to her worry about you.

636
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,780
Don't think ill of her.

637
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,300
Perhaps I'm overthinking.

638
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,260
But it has come to this.

639
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,260
Cousin Lian and I

640
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,300
aren't meant to be.

641
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,540
My engagement with her

642
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:23,060
should be terminated.

643
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,490
Mother,

644
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,420
the journey will be long.

645
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,780
I really don't know

646
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,340
when I can return home.

647
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,740
It's better this way,

648
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:37,820
so as not to delay

649
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,380
her youth and prospects.

650
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,420
Son,

651
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,340
I am not so old

652
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,980
as to be blind and deaf.

653
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:49,220
I am well aware

654
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:50,900
of the dangers

655
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,900
better than anyone.

656
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,380
Your father left early.

657
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,340
This vast mansion

658
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,100
and the Cui family's honor

659
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,060
rest solely on your shoulders.

660
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,660
All these years,

661
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,300
you've endured grievances

662
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,420
without complaint.

663
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,500
Now,

664
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,740
to protect us,

665
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,180
you'll have to risk your life.

666
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,100
Mother.

667
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,180
It's nothing. Why speak of this?

668
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,420
Son.

669
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,420
I don't want any military merits.

670
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,740
My only wish is for you to return safely

671
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,180
and for our family to reunite.

672
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,020
Don't worry, Mother.

673
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,100
I will.

674
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:00,660
Let me see.

675
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,580
This should be fine.

676
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,740
Why are you up?

677
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,260
If the Lord's mansion sends more people...

678
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:08,700
No.

679
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,180
I'll add more.

680
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,100
Wait, Mother.

681
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,380
How about this?

682
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,220
Send someone

683
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,420
to the Lord's mansion again

684
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,140
to tell them

685
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,580
I am much better,

686
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,740
and marriage is possible.

687
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,700
Are you crazy?

688
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,180
Do you want to marry a dying man?

689
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,100
To continue their bloodline?

690
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,620
It's clear you'd be a widow.

691
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,260
Besides,

692
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,740
once you marry him,

693
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,180
if you can't be pregnant that night,

694
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:35,140
you won't even have a chance to find

695
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,220
another nobleman.

696
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,300
I understand.

697
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:39,940
But what if

698
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,140
Cousin Xingzhou returns victorious?

699
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,900
So many have died at Jinjia Pass.

700
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,980
Does Cui Xingzhou
have three heads and six arms?

701
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:52,020
If Jinjia Pass falls,

702
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,020
even if he survives,

703
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,580
the court will condemn him as incompetent.

704
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,500
Then not only will you be a widow,

705
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:01,700
but our Lian family's future will be ruined.

706
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,820
Your father found a connection

707
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,540
with the Wu family.

708
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,540
They heard

709
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,260
that the court expects defeat

710
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,020
and is preparing to pay tribute for peace.

711
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,900
Think about it. At this moment,

712
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,100
they're sending Xingzhou to fight.

713
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,780
The Empress Dowager

714
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,100
specifically ordered

715
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,300
that if he defied the decree,

716
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:26,460
they'd gather the troops from Huaidong Camp
30 miles from Zhenzhou.

717
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,780
What does that mean?

718
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:32,540
The court wants him dead.

719
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,620
But there

720
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,060
is still

721
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,180
a slim hope of survival.

722
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,100
Mother, let me ask you.

723
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,380
What if he's truly skilled in warfare

724
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,780
and returns victorious?

725
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:48,780
Then marry him after he wins.

726
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,100
He'll have military achievements.

727
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,500
Wouldn't that be better?

728
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,340
Cousin Xingzhou is proud.

729
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,580
If he learns we are deliberately delaying,

730
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,660
he won't marry me

731
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,140
after he returns victorious.

732
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,580
So, Mother.

733
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,140
I ask you to go to the mansion

734
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,820
not because I truly want to marry

735
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,020
but to show our sincerity

736
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,540
to Cousin Xingzhou and Aunt

737
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:08,820
and soothe them first.

738
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:10,940
Tomorrow morning...

739
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,740
Tomorrow morning,

740
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,540
I will feign illness again.

741
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,220
That makes sense.

742
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,580
Repeating this back and forth

743
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,900
shows you're enduring illness

744
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,540
and sincerely want to marry,

745
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:28,060
but your health can't hold out.

746
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,260
Let alone my sister,

747
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,620
even your cousin

748
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,460
will not find fault with us.

749
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,620
Madam.

750
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,780
This is from the Lord Huaiyang.

751
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,500
It's for you.

752
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,700
(Letter from Cui Xingzhou)

753
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:49,980
What?

754
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,100
Cancel the engagement?

755
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,580
What?

756
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,740
Cancel?

757
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,980
How come?

758
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,940
How can Sister be so unfeeling?

759
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:06,060
It must be Cui Xingzhou's idea.

760
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:07,660
Then...

761
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,420
What are you doing? If you go now,

762
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,940
you're just admitting it.

763
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,300
Tomorrow,

764
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,980
when the army departs,

765
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,820
I will drag my sick body

766
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,260
to Cousin Xingzhou's horse

767
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,060
and declare in front of the people

768
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,700
that I will marry no one else but him.

769
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,180
I don't believe it.

770
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,820
He's leaving anyway.

771
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,700
We can't just marry on the spot.

772
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:32,780
If the war escalates,

773
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:35,420
there will be various urgent levies and taxes.

774
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,660
In a war,

775
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,860
we traders are always the ones suffering.

776
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:40,820
Isn't that right?

777
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:41,740
In my opinion,

778
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,660
Lord Huaiyang is brave and skilled.

779
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,940
The enemy won't break into Jinjia Pass.

780
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,140
That may not be true.

781
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:50,460
Previous generals have all gone
and never returned.

782
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,620
How much chance does the Zhenzhou army have?

783
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,460
I heard that recently,

784
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,740
Lord Huaiyang

785
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:58,420
has been conscripting soldiers in Zhenzhou.

786
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,220
Conscripting soldiers?

787
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,220
All the idle young men

788
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,740
on the streets

789
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,820
have been recruited into the army.

790
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:08,540
This shows a lack of troops.

791
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,820
Doing this at the last moment.

792
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,660
- This...
- What should we do?

793
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:12,540
They're even

794
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,740
conscripting able-bodied men.

795
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,700
Yes, if you have male relatives at home,

796
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:16,980
make sure they stay at home.

797
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,740
I need to return home.

798
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:20,700
No, no.

799
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,060
I must prepare.

800
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,380
Let's go back.

801
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,260
Don't bother.

802
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,380
Goodbye.

803
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,140
You look worried.

804
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,020
I'm worried about my husband.

805
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,100
What's there to worry

806
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,820
about Mr. Cui?

807
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,340
This might be laughable.

808
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:39,780
My husband

809
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,700
hasn't been home for days.

810
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,980
He's a timid Go enthusiast.

811
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,180
He can't even argue.

812
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:49,260
If Lord Huaiyang conscripts him,

813
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,740
he might be exhausted

814
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,340
before the battle,

815
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,220
let alone fight.

816
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,140
At such a time,

817
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,980
you're still being melodramatic.

818
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,260
Liu Miantang,

819
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,940
among everyone in the room,

820
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,140
you should worry

821
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,140
the least.

822
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:06,140
Miss He, what do you mean?

823
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:07,940
Wait.

824
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,500
Have I offended you?

825
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,620
Just tell me.

826
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,300
I only speak with straightforward people.

827
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:23,060
(Cui Mansion)

828
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,380
Madam.

829
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,740
We'll leave tomorrow.

830
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,260
Please rest early today.

831
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:37,860
Nanny Li,

832
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:39,740
could it be that Miss He

833
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,380
knew about my husband's

834
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,220
Go-playing relationship with the Lord

835
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,860
and got upset
thinking I made a cold remark?

836
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:47,820
What do you think?

837
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,860
How could I understand

838
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,860
Miss He's thoughts?

839
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:55,820
Madam,

840
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,500
Fangxie and Bicao

841
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,820
have already prepared the luggage.

842
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,740
We'll depart for Beizhou tomorrow.

843
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,060
The journey will be tough.

844
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,340
Madam,

845
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,140
rest early.

846
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,460
Now that the war has started,

847
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,700
I'm even more uneasy.

848
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,180
Let's delay the journey.

849
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,460
Right now, you must accompany me to find him.

850
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:18,300
I can't rest easy until I know he's safe.

851
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,140
How can this be?

852
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,700
The master

853
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,260
is not an idle person.

854
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,100
How could he be conscripted?

855
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,020
Nanny Li,

856
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:30,460
you've been urging repeatedly.

857
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,260
It seems you're very concerned

858
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,300
about going to Beizhou.

859
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:34,740
Well.

860
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,900
It is the master's order.

861
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,020
No.

862
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,060
Why are you not worried

863
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,780
about the master's safety

864
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,020
but always thinking of leaving?

865
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,420
Dear!

866
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,420
Honey?

867
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,060
Honey, you're back.

868
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,060
Now, they're conscripting soldiers everywhere.

869
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,420
You don't know how worried I am.

870
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:24,980
You're overthinking.

871
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:27,540
Are you back with your studies finished?

872
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,060
It's not that simple.

873
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,820
I saw that Moru brought a lot of baggage,

874
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,060
which made me realize

875
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,620
I've made you worry again.

876
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,580
I was afraid you were anxious,

877
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,460
so I came back to see you.

878
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,220
You're beating around the bush

879
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,780
to avoid telling me you miss me.

880
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,140
I haven't had dinner yet.

881
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:46,820
Can I

882
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,140
have a good meal tonight?

883
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,900
I'll ask Nanny Li to make the dishes.

884
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,500
I want to eat your crab roe rice.

885
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:55,580
At this time?

886
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:57,620
It's too late to prepare.

887
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:58,460
How about tomorrow?

888
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,500
No.

889
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,180
I want it now.

890
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,740
Please?

891
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:06,500
Alright.

892
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,020
I'll prepare it right away.

893
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:39,220
It's ready.

894
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,820
Every night is like tonight.

895
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,660
The moonlight is like water.

896
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:00,180
Travelers travel far.

897
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:08,980
Honey, you don't know.

898
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,740
I've been very uneasy

899
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:12,020
these days.

900
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:13,740
Why?

901
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,420
If I tell you,

902
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:18,460
it might make you laugh.

903
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:22,220
When Nanny Li was packing,

904
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,700
I kept having strange thoughts,

905
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:26,620
as if

906
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,740
I'd never see you again

907
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:31,780
after this departure.

908
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,660
Especially with the news of the war.

909
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:37,740
I feel

910
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:39,980
even more

911
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:42,260
uneasy,

912
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:45,940
fearing that we might part forever

913
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:47,220
and never meet again.
