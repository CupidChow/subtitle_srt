14
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,720
My Lord.

15
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,660
Are you still looking for people

16
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,140
to buy porcelain plates?

17
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,080
Wrong.

18
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,050
Those who came today

19
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,970
are all on the list.

20
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,800
No.

21
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:01,890
It was my mistake.

22
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,330
She is a person,

23
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,660
not some cup or plate.

24
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,250
I shouldn't have compared her that way,

25
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:12,060
nor should I have decided on my own

26
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,130
to find someone to take her in.

27
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,500
This would only ease my mind

28
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,690
but ruin her life.

29
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,550
My Lord,

30
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,180
you've figured it out.

31
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,810
I think no man

32
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,100
is as good as her family.

33
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,840
Why not tell her the truth

34
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,250
and send her back to her grandparents?

35
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:03,670
Honey.

36
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,970
You've been acting strange

37
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,100
since you returned from Qingzhou.

38
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,010
If I weren't here,

39
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,380
what kind of life would you want?

40
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,130
Where are you going?

41
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,570
Nowhere.

42
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,010
Just had a bad dream

43
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,290
on the way back.

44
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,060
I dreamed I left,

45
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,380
leaving you

46
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,850
all alone.

47
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,850
Don't worry.
Dreams are the opposite of reality.

48
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,340
Besides,

49
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,520
if you leave me alone,

50
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,500
I won't be lonely.

51
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,680
I have so many businesses

52
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,900
waiting for me to manage.

53
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,460
With business,

54
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,780
you don't need anything else?

55
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,100
That scholar was right.

56
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,660
All those virtues and morals.

57
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,970
A self-sufficient woman like me

58
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,460
is the most admirable.

59
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,700
You're still thinking about him.

60
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,600
Do you regret

61
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,560
he didn't buy

62
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,400
your porcelain plate?

63
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,220
Oh, the porcelain plate.

64
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,930
This plate is still a bit plain.

65
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,490
Why don't you write a poem on it?

66
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,780
(Apricot)

67
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:15,980
(Appears in a flash)

68
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:18,690
Like this?

69
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,030
Honey, admit it.

70
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,700
You like this porcelain plate,

71
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,850
so you've been blocking my business.

72
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,610
Since you've left your mark on it,

73
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,460
why bother looking for another buyer?

74
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,260
Why not keep it

75
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,970
as decoration at home?

76
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:39,550
Let's keep it.

77
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,930
Finally, you admit it.

78
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,140
Where should we place it?

79
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,340
Anywhere is fine,

80
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,220
as long as it stays

81
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,520
in this home.

82
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,110
Miantang.

83
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,340
From now on, do whatever you want to do.

84
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,460
I won't stop you.

85
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:12,260
So, I can do anything I want?

86
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:14,290
Of course.

87
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,590
Speaking of which,

88
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:13,170
- Lord Huaiyang is about to marry Ms. Lian.
- This tea is good.

89
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,480
Exactly.

90
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,580
Ms. Lian's mourning period will end in a mouth.

91
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:17,910
There's going to be

92
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,490
a grand wedding in Zhenzhou.

93
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,350
For a wedding,

94
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,290
they'll need some expensive porcelain.

95
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,320
I wonder who'll get

96
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,140
that lucrative job.

97
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:30,030
In the past, it's always been Miss He

98
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,780
who sent porcelain to the Lord's mansion.

99
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,520
The Consort Dowager and the Lord

100
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,730
even know her.

101
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,830
I'd say

102
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:38,730
this business will go

103
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,820
to the He family.

104
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,970
Miss He, isn't it?

105
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:48,900
This tea is really good today.

106
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,260
Come on, drink up.

107
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,390
Did you see Miss He's face?

108
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,700
She's clearly devoted.

109
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,120
Delaying her marriage

110
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,910
to become a concubine of the Lord.

111
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:01,950
Doesn't Mr. He care?

112
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:02,790
Ladies,

113
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:04,340
watch your step.

114
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:05,750
Is something there?

115
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,200
With tongues so long,

116
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,260
don't trip over them.

117
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,430
Miss He.

118
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,960
How can you tolerate their words like that?

119
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,660
They're speaking the truth.

120
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,460
Pardon me,

121
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,580
but is it

122
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,800
worth hoping for?

123
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,180
When I was young,

124
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,850
he once saved me.

125
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,460
You're married.

126
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,650
You should understand.

127
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,830
When you love someone,

128
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,250
you want to be with him forever.

129
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:52,010
If we can be together,

130
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,850
I can be a concubine.

131
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:57,950
But still...

132
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,700
Thank you for your help today, Mrs. Cui.

133
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,540
I'll take my leave now.

134
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,130
High-arched eyebrows,

135
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:24,970
peach-shaped eyes,

136
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,370
a straight nose,

137
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,580
and slightly upturned thin lips.

138
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,160
Perfect.

139
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,510
What are you mumbling about?

140
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,420
No matter what, you still can't draw well.

141
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,580
My Lord.

142
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,970
This is a portrait of you.

143
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,750
The one man out of ten thousand

144
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,940
whom Liu Miantang finally chose.

145
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,130
Do I look this bad in your drawing?

146
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,770
Face yourself.

147
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:57,680
You claimed

148
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,060
to secure a future for Liu Miantang

149
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,160
but wanted to place her

150
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,180
in your mansion as a concubine.

151
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,920
How ugly.

152
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,040
What are you doing?

153
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,010
Are you a child? How childish can you be?

154
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,520
Fine. I admit it.

155
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,830
I want to take her in.

156
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:18,000
I'll take responsibility.

157
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,970
Enough with your lies.

158
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,460
Deceiving everyone.

159
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,460
Talking about responsibility.

160
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,580
Such a big liar.

161
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,320
When I finish my wedding,

162
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,040
I will bring her to the mansion.

163
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,920
I will tell her the truth to make you mad.

164
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,440
What if that day never comes?

165
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,890
What if her memory suddenly returns?

166
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,390
The clot in her brain

167
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,610
is slowly dissolving.

168
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,850
Liu Miantang is not an ordinary woman.

169
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,850
If she finds out you're Lord Huaiyang,

170
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,970
she'll definitely

171
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,730
despise you even more.

172
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,040
I've made up my mind.

173
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,850
I'm already prepared.

174
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:11,900
(Qingzhou Guild Hall)

175
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,550
Miss Shi.

176
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,820
(Qingzhou Guild Hall)

177
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,300
Miss Shi, let's go.

178
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,070
Miss Shi.

179
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,470
Mr. Lu from Mount Yang

180
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:05,650
is waiting in the hall.

181
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:06,970
Let's hurry.

182
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,400
Miss.

183
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,540
Go chat with him.

184
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,370
Walk past the screen to see him,

185
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:23,320
and fill the teacups

186
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,370
on the table with tea.

187
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,890
That's how the meeting will be finalized.

188
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,490
Miss Shi.

189
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:50,370
You are from Mount Yang...

190
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,890
You can call me by my courtesy name,

191
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:54,710
Ziyu.

192
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,700
Miss Shi, don't be nervous.

193
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,220
No need to worry about formalities.

194
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,010
I don't really want to drink tea.

195
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,850
If you're afraid of me,

196
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,940
we can chat across the screen.

197
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,190
When you return,

198
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,160
I will explain the reason

199
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,180
to your father.

200
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:16,850
I'm not afraid of you.

201
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,130
I just don't understand

202
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,580
how someone as cultured as you

203
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:25,060
could be called a bandit by others.

204
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,460
Among those who become outlaws,

205
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,040
some are reckless men,

206
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,490
while others are righteous.

207
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,460
We each have our own path,

208
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,730
temporarily confined to an ill-fitting cage.

209
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,180
All for the day

210
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,220
we can live as we wish.

211
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:50,730
It's getting late.

212
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,130
Miss Shi, you should...

213
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,490
You should head back early.

214
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,540
Please take care of yourself

215
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,370
and drink more hot tea.

216
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,650
Thank you, Miss Shi.

217
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,520
Young Master.

218
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,060
Did it go well?

219
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,310
It went well.

220
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,610
As long as you marry into the Shi family,

221
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,510
we'll be one step closer

222
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,420
to our plan.

223
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:15,830
Yes.

224
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,970
One step closer to our goal.

225
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,580
But one step farther

226
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,700
from her.

227
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,130
The scissors are too heavy.

228
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,250
Your hand hasn't fully healed.

229
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,280
Let me do it.

230
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,890
Thank you, honey.

231
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,730
I have something

232
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:53,890
to tell you.

233
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,770
I also have something to tell you.

234
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,610
Then you go first.

235
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,010
What I'm about to say

236
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,250
might have something

237
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,370
to do with Lord Huaiyang.

238
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,760
What is it?

239
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,770
Is it about Lord Huaiyang

240
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,370
taking a concubine?

241
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,730
Did you

242
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,730
think of something

243
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,610
or hear something?

244
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,100
I've figured out

245
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,060
everything about this matter.

246
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,970
Well.

247
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,520
What do you think?

248
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,940
Lord Huaiyang

249
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,540
is just a philandering jerk.

250
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,150
If that's how you see it,

251
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,610
I have nothing to argue.

252
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,800
But dear, in this matter...

253
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,610
Don't defend him anymore.

254
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,540
He Zhen is such a good woman

255
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,630
from a wealthy family.

256
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,100
She's so intelligent.

257
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,510
Why would she eagerly

258
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,850
want to become his concubine?

259
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,690
He Zhen said

260
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,030
Lord Huaiyang saved her

261
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:14,960
when she was young.

262
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,650
But they only met that one time.

263
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,440
They haven't spent

264
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,610
any time together since.

265
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,000
How could she know

266
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,550
what kind of person he truly is

267
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:23,980
or if he's worth entrusting to?

268
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,060
Besides,

269
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,980
I once saw him

270
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,980
by the riverbank.

271
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,500
That Lord, broad-shouldered and stout,

272
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,170
and of considerable age,

273
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,300
with a fierce look

274
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,060
in his eyes.

275
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,480
Dear,

276
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,740
what if he were

277
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,400
someone my age,

278
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,020
not broad-shouldered

279
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,540
and stout?

280
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:04,260
If he were of similar age

281
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,690
and quite handsome,

282
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,850
she'd have to be more cautious

283
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,500
to see if she were attracted

284
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,980
by his looks,

285
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,300
making her eager to become his concubine.

286
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:16,840
I'm just worried that Lord Huaiyang

287
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,450
isn't a decent man.

288
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,200
He may have deceived He Zhen,

289
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,020
leaving her with false hopes,

290
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,300
and ultimately ruining her life.

291
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:28,410
- Dear.
- It really makes me mad.

292
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,130
Who would want to be his concubine?

293
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,740
What bad luck.

294
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,410
What kind of world is this?

295
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,170
Some have too little;

296
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,060
and others too much.

297
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,340
If you ask me,

298
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,610
don't worry so much.

299
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,410
Just accept your fate,

300
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,030
inherit the old lord's

301
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,020
legacy of romance,

302
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,820
and take He Zhen in.

303
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,370
Is that your solution

304
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,890
to ease my worries?

305
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,310
When your wife

306
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,920
and concubines in the backyard

307
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,780
need one more person to play cards,

308
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,780
I will gladly join.

309
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:39,100
(Long and Enduring)

310
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:45,550
Cousin Lian.

311
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,360
(Zhen Nan Marquis' Manor)

312
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,680
Greetings, Cousin Quan.

313
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,650
Why are you here?

314
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,070
Today,

315
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,960
we got some fresh melons,

316
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,070
so I thought I'd bring some for Aunt.

317
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,210
I happened to run into you.

318
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,890
How thoughtful.

319
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:58,910
It's nothing.

320
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,740
Cousin Quan,

321
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,500
I recently heard

322
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,450
some gossip at a tea party.

323
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,470
Though I shouldn't

324
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,100
take a woman's words too seriously,

325
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,020
it does concern the Lord,

326
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:14,580
so I couldn't help

327
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,780
but feel a bit uneasy.

328
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,800
What is it?

329
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,070
They said...

330
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,540
They said

331
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,260
that the Lord had found a beauty

332
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,370
in Lingquan Town

333
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:36,370
and wanted to take her as a concubine.

334
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,500
You're close to the Lord.

335
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,890
You must know about this, right?

336
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,500
Is that true?

337
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,880
Could it be that North Street...?

338
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,170
What North Street?

339
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,820
It must be Miss He.

340
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,020
I'm just joking.

341
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:56,830
Cousin Lian.

342
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,850
Don't overthink it.

343
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,650
Focus on preparing for the wedding.

344
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,020
I understand now.

345
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,170
This is the prescription to North Street.

346
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,500
I had someone copy it for me.

347
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,340
I know that one in North Street.

348
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,450
It's just a tonic prescription.

349
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,210
Look closely.

350
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,160
Old ginger and hairy antler.

351
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,440
Golden-eyed grass.

352
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,650
These are for the Lord's wife and concubines.

353
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,210
That North Street enchantress

354
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,100
has bewitched Xingzhou so thoroughly.

355
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,450
If she has a child before you...

356
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,690
No, no. I must find my sister.

357
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,470
Mother,

358
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:41,100
what good will it do to find Aunt?

359
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,170
Cousin Xingzhou won't listen to her.

360
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:44,920
Going to her

361
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,160
will only make him mad at me.

362
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,360
It won't help at all.

363
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,930
Then what do you suggest?

364
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,210
The wedding is imminent.

365
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,790
I will soon

366
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,170
be his princess.

367
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,850
Eventually, he will take concubines.

368
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,750
Why not act as the good person now,

369
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:00,850
help him,

370
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,990
and bring the woman he favors

371
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:05,210
into the mansion early?

372
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,030
But with her background,

373
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,850
how could she be brought into the mansion?

374
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,510
That woman is too lowly,

375
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,890
so she can't be brought in.

376
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,440
Otherwise, Cousin Xingzhou wouldn't have

377
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,690
placed her outside.

378
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,890
But Cousin Quan mentioned a lady,

379
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:21,610
He Zhen.

380
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,410
Though she comes from a merchant family,

381
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:28,060
her family works for the royal family.

382
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,260
They're acquainted with the capital ministers.

383
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,710
If we can ally

384
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,170
with such a woman,

385
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,400
wouldn't that be

386
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,780
even better for us?

387
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,500
That makes sense.

388
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,680
North Street might be favored,

389
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,340
but even if she has a child,

390
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,600
she'll never be listed

391
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,540
in Cui's genealogy,

392
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,980
at best having some security in old age.

393
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,120
But Miss He

394
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,890
is a true noblewoman,

395
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,780
from a respected and clean family.

396
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,710
If she gains the Lord's favor,

397
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,020
she will be our real rival.

398
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,450
We must act first

399
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,690
and win her over.

400
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:09,990
This is good.

401
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,690
Take it back to bring wealth and fortune.

402
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,240
Yes.

403
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,360
This one is good too.

404
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,160
This lake-green narcissus pear-shaped vase

405
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,410
is truly exquisite.

406
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,750
Miss He.

407
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,210
Do you think the Lord would like it?

408
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,130
About this,

409
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:24,690
it's not up to Miss He or us.

410
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,740
Ms. Lian is here today to choose
her wedding gifts.

411
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,370
Her thoughts

412
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:31,340
are the Lord's thoughts.

413
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,600
That's what truly matters.

414
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,550
Indeed.

415
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:35,390
Ms. Lian is here.

416
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,440
Please come inside.

417
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,590
How about that one?

418
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:39,500
Ms. Lian.

419
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,510
The rumors don't do you justice.

420
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:45,130
You're truly dignified and noble.

421
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,750
Ms. Lian?

422
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,500
This is the future Princess of Huaiyang.

423
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,740
- Shopkeeper.
- Yes.

424
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,280
Coming.

425
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,410
Are you He Zhen?

426
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,790
We met

427
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,790
at Lord Huaiyang's mansion before.

428
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:05,820
Do you remember?

429
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:07,270
This...

430
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,370
Ms. Lian already knew you.

431
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:17,480
We once met when I
delivered porcelain to the Lord's mansion.

432
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:18,740
But we didn't speak.

433
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,360
Ms. Lian

434
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,060
is truly approachable.

435
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,790
The day she came for porcelain,

436
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,070
we hit it off right away.

437
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,210
She talked a lot,

438
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,740
and even let me choose porcelain

439
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,060
to send to Lian's mansion.

440
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,580
Really?

441
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,500
I was worried,

442
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,270
but when I arrived,

443
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,160
her family

444
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:39,500
was so polite.

445
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,130
Ms. Lian even said...

446
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,060
She said...

447
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,060
The Lord is always busy with official affairs

448
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:52,030
and is short of people

449
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,780
to serve him closely.

450
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,960
But how could a lord

451
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,820
be without concubines?

452
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,640
I hadn't found

453
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,540
a suitable candidate,

454
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:08,060
so I was always worried,

455
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,020
until that day

456
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,210
when I met you.

457
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,500
He Zhen.

458
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:16,690
I know,

459
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,030
whether in appearance or talent,

460
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:20,580
you are no less than any noblewoman.

461
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,100
So, I wonder if you'd like

462
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,540
to join the Lord's mansion

463
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,610
and keep me company.

464
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,740
Keep her company?

465
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,200
Ms. Lian

466
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,920
even wants to be close friends with her

467
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,410
and share her husband.

468
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:40,690
Share her husband?

469
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,520
Honey,

470
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,340
Lord Huaiyang is taking a concubine.

471
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,650
It's He Zhen.

472
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,440
What's the matter?

473
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:57,830
Block the sun.

474
00:25:58,790 --> 00:25:59,650
Block the sun?

475
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:13,460
(Mansion of Lord Huaiyang)

476
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,890
Aunt, is this tea nice?

477
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,520
It is.

478
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,130
Xingzhou, why not join us for tea?

479
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,240
- Mother.
- Xingzhou.

480
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,080
No need.

481
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,760
Come with me.

482
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:42,300
Did you like the porcelain

483
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,740
from Lingquan Town?

484
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,300
My mourning period is nearly over.

485
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,200
Mother is looking
for a narrow-neck white-glazed vase

486
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,170
for offering flowers.

487
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,410
So, I accompanied her to the town for a walk.

488
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:58,610
We also saw your newly repaired canal.

489
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:01,100
The scenery by the East Bridge was beautiful.

490
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,800
Cousin Xingzhou.

491
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,040
Is there more?

492
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,210
I also made some new friends.

493
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,060
We hit it off right away,

494
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,850
so I invited them back home.

495
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,610
We have a tea party today.

496
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,070
I personally

497
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,610
made some tea snacks.

498
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,360
I'll ask Moru

499
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,690
to take some for you later.

500
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,880
A tea party is fine.

501
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,580
You're an official's daughter.

502
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,960
It's always good

503
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,000
to make friends

504
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,130
with like-minded people.

505
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,930
But don't be too affable.

506
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,040
No need to befriend
unrelated merchants' daughters.

507
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,260
Yes.

508
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,200
Cousin Xingzhou.

509
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,340
Mother has always taught me

510
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,100
to respect my husband.

511
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,370
I'm always thinking of you,

512
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,210
alone outside,

513
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,610
with no one to care for you.

514
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,930
I wanted to help,
but I couldn't go to the camp.

515
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:07,690
I wanted someone to look after you,

516
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,740
so I had a momentary lapse.

517
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:12,820
Please forgive me.

518
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,100
You did nothing wrong.

519
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,850
There's nothing to forgive.

520
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:20,350
Don't overthink it.

521
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,300
I have to go.

522
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:27,870
Enjoy your tea.

523
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:39,580
(Lian Mansion)

524
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,540
(Invitation)
This is an invitation from Ms. Lian,

525
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:56,510
inviting me here for a tea party.

526
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,600
Please inform her.

527
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,880
Ms. Lian has instructed

528
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,120
that no guests today.

529
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:00,980
Please go back.

530
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:03,820
This...

531
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:06,140
(Invitation)

532
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:15,260
(Lian Mansion)

533
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:32,630
Let me.

534
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,500
Dear, have you heard?

535
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:44,300
Lord Huaiyang isn't marrying He Zhen.

536
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,440
Yes.

537
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,540
He Zhen has been abandoned.

538
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,210
He pursued her

539
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,400
but told Ms. Lian to refuse

540
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,640
to let her in.

541
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,910
He doesn't even bother explaining anything to her.

542
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,580
How condescending.

543
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:03,780
Ignoring others' happiness or sorrow.

544
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,690
Is it wrong to not take her?

545
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,930
If he loves her,

546
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,820
he wouldn't treat her as a concubine.

547
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,650
I went to see He Zhen.

548
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,300
She cried to me the whole time,

549
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,710
saying she'd been

550
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:22,540
ridiculed and looked down upon along the way.

551
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,340
Her heart is utterly broken.

552
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:28,540
It's better than prolonged suffering.

553
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,740
It's better to end it now.

554
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,980
She could have been a proper wife.

555
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,610
Why insist on being someone's concubine?

556
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,100
Isn't that Lord Huaiyang's concubine?

557
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,060
So what?

558
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,020
Even the Emperor has his limitations.

559
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:49,340
If it were me, I'd never accept it.

560
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:53,630
Right.

561
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,150
Dear,

562
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,240
let me ask you.

563
00:30:58,790 --> 00:30:59,890
If Lord Huaiyang

564
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,850
respected you,

565
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,800
cherished you,

566
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,260
and didn't let anyone boss you around,

567
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:06,830
would you be willing?

568
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,410
If he truly respected and cherished me,

569
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,370
he wouldn't make me his concubine.

570
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,060
My mother left me a family motto.

571
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,990
Even in poverty, do not become a concubine;

572
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,980
Even in distress, do not become a second wife.

573
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,960
It seems to hold true after all.

574
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,790
What if Lord Huaiyang

575
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,070
were your heart's desire,

576
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:34,540
and you knew he had his reasons?

577
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,280
What then?

578
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:39,210
Then it would simply be a case of fate.

579
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:46,310
What's the matter, honey?

580
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,340
You seem down.

581
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,340
Suddenly, I feel

582
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,200
a bit dizzy

583
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:53,910
and a bit tired.

584
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:56,670
Are you hiding something from me?

585
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,260
- I...
- Do you also want to take a concubine?

586
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,480
Just kidding.

587
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,020
Don't kid around.

588
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,130
Did she hit you?

589
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,780
What?

590
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,060
I couldn't sleep.

591
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,690
Honestly, tell me.

592
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,740
Out of all these paintings of you,

593
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,540
which one do you like the most?

594
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,980
If I were to tell her the truth,

595
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,340
she wouldn't accept it.

596
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,110
Why?

597
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,170
She said,

598
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,060
"Even in poverty, do not become a concubine;"

599
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,610
"Even in distress,
do not become a second wife."

600
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,930
Liu Miantang is quite interesting.

601
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,540
You're Lord Huaiyang.

602
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:15,910
Well.

603
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,850
So noble and dignified.

604
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,230
An ordinary merchant's daughter

605
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:23,410
isn't even fit to be your concubine.

606
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,020
What does she want?

607
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,690
Does she want to be your Princess?

608
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,110
Cui Jiu.

609
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,610
Cousin Lian's

610
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,260
mourning period will end

611
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,690
in less than half a month.

612
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,760
Of course.

613
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,980
I am Lord Huaiyang.

614
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,370
I was born to bring peace to the land.

615
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,710
I'm responsible

616
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:53,740
for my family and country.

617
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,450
What right do I have to talk about love?

618
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,600
I can't spend my life

619
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,440
with only her.

620
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,820
I won't promise her that.

621
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,100
In the end, this is just a game.

622
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,580
When the game's over,

623
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:06,830
who would take

624
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,500
the pieces away?

625
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,860
Glad that you can

626
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,280
think that way.

627
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:20,770
(Cui Residence)
Mrs. Cui!

628
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,060
Mrs. Cui!

629
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,720
Mrs. Cui!

630
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,810
Please save my lady!

631
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,810
What happened to her?

632
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,210
She has fallen gravely ill.

633
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,070
She can't eat

634
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,170
or see now.

635
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,720
I fear...

636
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,290
I fear she won't last

637
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,240
more than a few days.

638
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,590
Why so severe so suddenly?

639
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,460
Did you get a doctor?

640
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,190
We've got several physicians,

641
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,900
but they all say it's a heartache.

642
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,800
She's taken calming medicines,

643
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,900
but none have worked.

644
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,470
The master said

645
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,810
you're close to her

646
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,810
and of similar age,

647
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,940
so he asked you to go and comfort her.

648
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,200
Perhaps...

649
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,880
Perhaps it might cure her heartache.

650
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,190
We're just grasping at straws here.

651
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:08,190
- Bicao, go get Physician Zhao.
- Yes.

652
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,290
I'll pack up and go now.

653
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:11,290
Thank you, Mrs. Cui.

654
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:29,980
Miss He,

655
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,210
the key to your illness

656
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,460
lies in adjusting your mindset.

657
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,110
Why torture yourself

658
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,540
like this?

659
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,900
Your forehead is full

660
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,330
and shows signs of wealth.

661
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,800
Even if you can't be

662
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,130
Lord Huaiyang's concubine,

663
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,020
you will surely marry into a noble family.

664
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,120
Physician Zhao.

665
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,900
I don't think I've ever mentioned this to you.

666
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,500
How did you know?

667
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,030
I heard it.

668
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,210
From whom?

669
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:01,810
Do you have to ask?

670
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:04,020
Words spread.

671
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,690
Everyone knows about her foolish plan

672
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,330
to marry Lord Huaiyang.

673
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,680
Sister-in-law,

674
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,580
I can't be a noble's concubine.

675
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,100
That's my business.

676
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,940
No gossip is needed.

677
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,540
But you can't drag us down with you.

678
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,580
You've read a few books.

679
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,960
Does that make you think

680
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,380
you can marry the Lord?

681
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,060
Just stop talking.

682
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:29,390
Physician.

683
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:31,020
Please save my lady.

684
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,160
Alright.

685
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,030
Later,

686
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,650
I'll prescribe you some medicine.

687
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,170
Take it in three seven-day courses,

688
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,500
for a total of 21 days.

689
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,680
Remember.

690
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,250
During these three courses,

691
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,810
you must not leave the house.

692
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,860
You must not expose yourself to the wind.

693
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,420
Why is this prescription so unusual?

694
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,130
If Miss He

695
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,290
weren't critically ill,

696
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,130
I wouldn't dare

697
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,730
prescribe such a strange remedy.

698
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,860
This involves using poison to fight poison.

699
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,320
If she goes outside

700
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,770
or catches a breeze,

701
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:05,730
not only will the medicine be ineffective,

702
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:08,330
but it could lead to a fatal wind attack,

703
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:11,060
and she might die in the street at once.

704
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:17,800
But don't worry.

705
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,060
If you follow my instructions,

706
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:21,940
she'll surely be cured.

707
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,330
Thank you, Physician.

708
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,470
Honey?

709
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:57,070
Why do you look so down

710
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,380
after your trip?

711
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,900
Your face doesn't look good either.

712
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,730
I...

713
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,540
I just went to the porcelain shop.

714
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:14,170
You asked me to inscribe something
on the porcelain.

715
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,240
I couldn't do that.

716
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,250
I don't want to write anymore.

717
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,730
I thought your handwriting was good,

718
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,380
so why let others profit from it?

719
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:31,060
Why did it become a burden for you?

720
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:32,870
From now on,

721
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,920
if you want to write or paint,

722
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,900
go ahead.

723
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,290
If not, just don't do it.

724
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:38,510
It's up to you.

725
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,330
Mr. Zhang,

726
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,400
you've ruined the foundation of our wall.

727
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,380
How can you just leave?

728
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:28,980
Come on.

729
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,940
I didn't damage it.

730
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,460
I was just fixing my courtyard.

731
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:35,150
It just so happens

732
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:36,990
that your wall wasn't stable enough,

733
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:38,110
and it

734
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,320
collapsed

735
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,330
on its own.

736
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,110
You've dug the cellar like this.

737
00:39:43,110 --> 00:39:44,650
How's that fixing the courtyard?

738
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,320
What's wrong with digging a cellar

739
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,330
in my courtyard?

740
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:49,130
Mr. Zhang, you must be joking.

741
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,190
Why would anyone dig a cellar so close

742
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,060
to a neighbor's yard?

743
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,650
No wonder the wall collapsed.

744
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:55,720
Honey, you go inside. I'll handle this.

745
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:59,650
Your feng shui is bad, to begin with.

746
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:01,420
Don't blame others.

747
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,560
Bad feng shui?

748
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,610
Everyone on this street knows that.

749
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:07,810
Mr. Cui is useless,

750
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,180
so his wife has to take care of everything.

751
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,630
That's why the wall collapsed.

752
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:15,060
Don't talk nonsense.

753
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,800
You look quite lovely

754
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,810
when you're angry.

755
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,690
Why marry such a man

756
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,210
with your looks?

757
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,590
If I were your husband,

758
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,590
I'd treasure you every night.

759
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:29,430
- Wait here.
- You.

760
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,680
Honey.

761
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,380
Dear, go inside.

762
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,640
Go inside.

763
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:36,510
You!

764
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,690
Outrageous!

765
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:42,900
The master of the Cui family

766
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,650
is so pale and delicate.

767
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:47,380
Honey, don't stoop to their level.

768
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:48,470
You wait here.

769
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,760
Go inside.

770
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,280
Listen to me.

771
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,380
Everyone in Lingquan Town knows.

772
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:54,470
You

773
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:57,420
are the coward of North Street,

774
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,940
take your wife as a tiger,

775
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,190
bowing to her,

776
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:03,770
stupid and happy forever.

777
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,290
What a jerk in disguise.

778
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,280
What?

779
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:14,130
Such a young boy.

780
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:16,610
If you can't say anything, just listen.

781
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,800
If I

782
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,030
can dig

783
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,510
a cellar in your house today,

784
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:23,480
tomorrow I can dig under your walls.

785
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,540
What can you do about it?

786
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,650
Filthy scoundrel!

787
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:29,980
Street thug!

788
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:32,540
Do you believe I...

789
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,080
What will you do?

790
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,250
Stupid and happy again?

791
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,720
I'll report you.

792
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:41,130
Report me?

793
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:42,650
See? See?

794
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,110
Your tree's leaves

795
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:45,510
are all falling into my yard,

796
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:47,440
making it messy and stinky.

797
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:48,550
I haven't reported you yet.

798
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:50,470
Your dirty clothes and socks smell so bad.

799
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:51,880
The stench drifts into our house.

800
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,290
Who has a smell?

801
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,290
Can't you just cover your nose?

802
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,070
You and your wife argue so loudly

803
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:59,020
that it makes our heads buzz.

804
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,380
That's your problem.

805
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,470
Your ears are too sensitive.

806
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:03,980
Cover your ears if it's so bad.

807
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:07,170
Why should I cover my ears for that?

808
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,840
- Your problem.
- Not mine.

809
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,730
It's your problem.

810
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,990
I'll report it.

811
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:12,440
Go ahead. Report me.

812
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,320
Come over here.

813
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,290
See if I'll report you.

814
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:15,650
I'm coming. So what?

815
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,020
- I'm coming.
- Come over.

816
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,510
- Come here.
- Come here.

817
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:19,350
Walk in here.

818
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,840
I'm not afraid of you.

819
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,680
Walk in here.

820
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,170
- Honey...
- Fine.

821
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,150
I'm walking in.

822
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,030
- Walk in.
- What?

823
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:26,170
- I'll hit you!
- Let go!

824
00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:27,990
Let go!

825
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:29,160
Let go!

826
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:33,880
Where did you get this filth?

827
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,610
- What?
- Get out! Out!

828
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:39,030
Still not leaving?

829
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,120
Honey.

830
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,460
Are you alright? Did you get hurt?

831
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,540
My arm is injured.

832
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,680
Does it hurt?

833
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,460
I didn't sleep well,

834
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:54,910
so I'm a bit dizzy.

835
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,200
But

836
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:58,760
let me tell you.

837
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,580
I didn't lose.

838
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:03,910
I know.

839
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,720
Neither did I.

840
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,540
