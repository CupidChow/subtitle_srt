=Episode 23=

14
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,250
So,

15
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,220
Ziyu didn't send you here.

16
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,810
You're here for the silver.

17
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,530
How did you have it?

18
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,480
This dagger?

19
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,140
Ziyu gave it to me,

20
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,530
so I have it.

21
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,480
Impossible.

22
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,140
- I've already...
- You've already taken it away.

23
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,380
Since you can find where I am,

24
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,180
I can find you too.

25
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,380
Then,

26
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,410
I'll take back what's mine,

27
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,900
like what I did to Cao Duo.

28
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,060
He's repaid

29
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,010
what he owes me.

30
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,530
So you killed Cao Duo,

31
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,010
not Lord Huaiyang?

32
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,150
True.

33
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,590
Cao Duo remained loyal to you

34
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,060
until his death.

35
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:34,870
Yun'er,

36
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,400
you truly raised

37
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,660
a well-behaved lapdog.

38
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,780
But now,

39
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,940
I dare not act against you.

40
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,500
One must consider the master
when hitting the dog.

41
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,460
After all,

42
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:54,180
when I found this dagger in the mansion,

43
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,810
I saw a remarkable man,

44
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,660
Prince Sui.

45
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,010
Once the young master succeeds,

46
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,000
Prince Sui will be

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,380
the most powerful person.

48
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,130
He'll remove the roots then.

49
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,340
But if you beg him,

50
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,220
he will generously

51
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,540
bury you

52
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,540
with 20 people

53
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,660
from Pingyuan Escort Agency.

54
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,420
Why are you laughing?

55
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,460
You're stupid.

56
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,420
Look at this dagger.

57
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,740
Is it the same as before?

58
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,580
You fooled me.

59
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,340
You knew nothing.

60
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,220
Now,

61
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,300
I know everything.

62
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,340
My Lord.

63
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,860
My Lord.

64
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,580
My Lord.

65
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,820
We've found a cave over there,

66
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,060
with clay marks at the entrance.

67
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,580
Some of you, follow me.

68
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,460
Others, follow Huang Gui.

69
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,940
Check for other routes to the cave.

70
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:57,980
Yes.

71
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,820
I thought you'd at least

72
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,740
be loyal to Mount Yang.

73
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,620
Do you enjoy being a commoner?

74
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,660
The young master is trapped here

75
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,380
due to bad luck.

76
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,180
Do you really think he likes it here?

77
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,500
Does he know

78
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,860
it was Prince Sui's order

79
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,700
to kill his brothers in Xizhou?

80
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,420
When Prince Sui came to ally with us,

81
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,620
we all knew he had ulterior motives.

82
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,140
Sister's actions

83
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,940
were truly for the young master's benefit.

84
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,740
For his benefit?

85
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,820
Because of your good intentions,

86
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,300
the young master hesitated

87
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,060
and never took decisive action.

88
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,420
Engaged in a dangerous game, so what?

89
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,580
Do you really think he has

90
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,500
no courage at all?

91
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,580
Then does he know

92
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,660
exactly what happened
on Shangsi Festival?

93
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,420
At that night,

94
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,900
you faked the orders

95
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,660
to attack Zhenzhou troops,

96
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,100
causing them to retaliate.

97
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,380
Your provocation

98
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,220
drove Mount Yang into a desperate battle,

99
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,340
severely weakening them,

100
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,220
and forcing them to ally with Prince Sui.

101
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,220
You wanted to take over the iron mine,

102
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,100
so you had Cao Duo sever my tendons,

103
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,420
trying to kill me.

104
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,900
Does Ziyu know all this?

105
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,580
You care about Ziyu so much.

106
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,660
If he knew all this,

107
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,060
how would he treat you?

108
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,300
Liu Miantang,

109
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,060
do you think

110
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,180
he truly knows nothing?

111
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,420
At the end of the day,

112
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,340
you and I are both equally pathetic.

113
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,820
Kill her!

114
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,460
Go get her!

115
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,820
Save me...

116
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,380
(Sui)

117
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,780
Go ahead. I'll meet you at the old spot.

118
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:04,980
Miantang!

119
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,350
Go.

120
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,210
- Sister.
- Sister.

121
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,050
Go.

122
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,340
Let's go.

123
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,700
These bags hold kerosene.

124
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,780
If you take another step,

125
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,940
I'll shoot through them

126
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,900
and drench you all.

127
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,820
Let the Zhenzhou troops see

128
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,020
their lord turn to charcoal.

129
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,860
I'll do what I said.

130
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,300
My Lord!

131
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:42,820
My Lord!

132
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,900
Soldiers, listen up.

133
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,420
Retreat to the base.

134
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,100
- My Lord...
- Now.

135
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,300
Yes.

136
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,940
- Retreat.
- Retreat.

137
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:50,780
Retreat now.

138
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,740
When did you find out?

139
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,780
You didn't seem surprised

140
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,940
to see me.

141
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,460
You stayed

142
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,020
because you knew
the Zhenzhou troops were here.

143
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,260
You wanted to buy time
for your men, right?

144
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,420
Yes.

145
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,940
Even if it meant I'd kill you?

146
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,140
Yes.

147
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,580
Then what about you?

148
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,940
You knew my identity

149
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,940
and that it was a trap.

150
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,980
Why did you still come here?

151
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,540
I find it ridiculous too,

152
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,540
but I wanted to see

153
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,260
if you would relent.

154
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,140
Liu Miantang, tell me.

155
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,860
When the fire burned,

156
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,620
did you have any regret?

157
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:33,940
You did regret.

158
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,900
Because when Huang Gui arrived,

159
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,260
you had a chance to kill me.

160
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,620
Cui Xingzhou,

161
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,420
why do you think

162
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,660
I would regret it?

163
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,180
Perhaps the old me

164
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,500
gave you the wrong impression.

165
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,780
Let me tell you a secret.

166
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,740
The Liu Miantang from Lingquan Town

167
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,980
is not the real me.

168
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,700
Your wife,

169
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,940
who only had eyes for you,

170
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,780
does not exist,

171
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,980
just like your lies.

172
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,700
And your love

173
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,180
only moved you.

174
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,500
To me,

175
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,300
it means nothing.

176
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,460
I don't

177
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,420
love you.

178
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,260
I hate you.

179
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,420
So,

180
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,100
Lord Huaiyang, how do you plan
to deal with Lu Wen?

181
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,460
I'll give you one more chance.

182
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,460
Don't you have a dagger?

183
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,940
Don't you hate me?

184
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,300
I lied to you before.

185
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,540
I'll repay you with my life.

186
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:21,650
The feud between Lu Wen
and Lord Huaiyang

187
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,720
was settled in that fire.

188
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,380
It was fate.

189
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:43,260
What about Cui Jiu and Liu Miantang?

190
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,500
It's settled now.

191
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,620
From now on,

192
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,500
we owe each other nothing.

193
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,820

Yes.

234
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,780
(Three months later)

235
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:32,420
(The capital city changes. Wu is deposed.
New Emperor rises, enacting new policies.)

236
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,060
Your Majesty.

237
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,860
Please try on the auspicious attire.

238
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,260
His Majesty moved to another place.

239
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,940
He has issued an oral edict.

240
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,740
The country is exhausted,
in need of rebuilding.

241
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,940
Simplify the coronation ceremony

242
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,260
and palace expenses.

243
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,020
His Majesty

244
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,700
will consult the ministers soon.

245
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,860
As the saying goes,

246
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,380
the weather in June

247
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,780
changes suddenly.

248
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,740
Yesterday, he was a boor
living in a remote area.

249
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,940
Today, he is a legitimate member
of the royal family.

250
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,060
One is a lord, like a hidden dragon,

251
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,020
who will achieve great things.

252
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,460
The other is a remarkable woman,

253
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,860
intelligent and unparalleled
in the mundane world.

254
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,180
They are like a fated couple

255
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,420
straight out of a storybook.

256
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,540
But we still need a villain.

257
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,820
A lord would be best.

258
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,220
Aren't you a lord?

259
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,300
You should join us

260
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,580
and cause some trouble.
That will be enough.

261
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:18,980
You see,

262
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,500
the story is over.

263
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,500
Just enjoy your chestnuts

264
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,060
and be a spectator.

265
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,540
Leave me alone.

266
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,220
His Majesty has ascended.

267
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,460
Even the deepest wounds

268
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,460
should have healed by now.

269
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,540
I'm not sure if your pain

270
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,780
is internal or external.

271
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,620
She and I

272
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,780
have long parted ways.

273
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:52,940
You better.

274
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,890
The new emperor has summoned

275
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,340
the regional lords to the capital.

276
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,900
If you can't let go of the past,

277
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,860
consider how awkward

278
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,900
a meeting might be.

279
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,540
What's your plan for going to the capital?

280
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,740
I've made arrangements in the capital,

281
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,060
to protect my elder sister and my mentor.

282
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,740
What do you mean?

283
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,140
Are you not going?

284
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,020
My Lord, a report from the capital.

285
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,940
Traces of Qiulin Xian have been found.

286
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,220
Ms. Liu should be there too.

287
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,460
We don't know much
about the new emperor.

288
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,580
The vassal lords are all watching.

289
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,420
Xingzhou is cautious

290
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,140
and he won't act recklessly.

291
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,340
But the court has issued the edict.

292
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,580
If we don't go,

293
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,460
we'll be defying the emperor.

294
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,260
Consort Dowager, don't worry.

295
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,180
The new emperor's foundation is unstable

296
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,500
and he wouldn't dare offend Zhenzhou.

297
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,220
When the Wu family
took the throne and issued an edict,

298
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,700
didn't the old lord also refuse to go?

299
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,700
And in the end,

300
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,500
what could they do to us?

301
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,220
Moreover, with Xingzhou's temperament...

302
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,180
He is naturally more prudent
than elder brother.

303
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:28,900
Consort Dowager.

304
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,100
His Lordship has gone to the capital.

305
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,380
What?

306
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:39,940
(Treasure as Desired)

307
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,860
Goodbye, esteemed lady.

308
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,060
Bring the catalog items

309
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:55,900
to Prince Sui's Mansion

310
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,140
for the princess to pick.

311
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,460
Thank you.

312
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,780
Thanks to Uncle for traveling all over

313
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,620
and doing business
with neighboring countries.

314
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,820
Or, how could you have
found such rare items

315
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,020
to please the princess?

316
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,780
Come on, Uncle Qiao.

317
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,020
You only have a few pieces.

318
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,860
But Princess of Sui has checked
the whole catalog.

319
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,620
You're an honest man, aren't you?

320
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,460
For a first visit
to Prince Sui's Mansion,

321
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,780
a few items are enough.

322
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:29,620
The key

323
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:31,300
is to pique the interest

324
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,260
of Princess of Sui.

325
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,380
Gradually,

326
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,690
once we make it into his inner backyard

327
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,500
and bribe the servants,

328
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,740
it won't be hard to track
Prince Sui's movements.

329
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,740
Find a secluded place

330
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,940
and kill him.

331
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,580
Sister, your headpiece is too plain.

332
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,460
I want to get a better one for you.

333
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:02,900
It's fine.

334
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,900
We just arrived in the capital.

335
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,420
It's better to keep a low profile.

336
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,500
People's nature is serene,

337
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,380
but their hearts are troubled.

338
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,380
While their hearts may seem calm,

339
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,780
desires drive them.

340
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,940
If one can dispel desires,

341
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,460
their hearts will naturally be calm.

342
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,220
With a clear heart,

343
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,460
the spirit will naturally be pure.

344
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,700
Then...

345
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,060
Then...

346
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,700
Then the six desires will not arise.

347
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,990
The three poisons will be eliminated.

348
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,340
Those who cannot achieve this

349
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,580
have not yet cleared their hearts

350
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,420
or dispelled their desires.

351
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,300
Those who can achieve this...

352
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,980
What about those who can achieve this?

353
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,420
I've taught you three times.

354
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,620
Why aren't you paying attention?

355
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,140
Sorry, I'm dull-witted.

356
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,620
Since you know that,

357
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,620
you should work harder
to make up for it.

358
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:09,580
If you can't even memorize

359
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,420
a few scriptures,

360
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:11,820
how am I

361
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,180
going to tell Minister Shi?

362
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,060
Do you know

363
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:19,980
which palace

364
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,580
the Empress should reside in?

365
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,300
Chonghua Palace.

366
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,220
And are you living in

367
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,620
Chonghua Palace now?

368
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,340
Although you are betrothed
to the Emperor,

369
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,100
the marriage is not yet consummated.

370
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,540
With the new emperor ascending,

371
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,220
anything could happen.

372
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,100
Whether the Empress will be

373
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,060
from the Shi family

374
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,100
is still unknown.

375
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,820
Grand Empress Dowager
loves Taoist scriptures.

376
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,060
Miss Shi,

377
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,900
even if you must stay up all night,

378
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,700
you must memorize

379
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,700
these scriptures.

380
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,020
I understand.

381
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,180
I will memorize them today.

382
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,060
I'll check on you tomorrow.

383
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,660
- Miss Shi, you're working hard.
- Miss Shi, you're working hard.

384
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,340
Have some fruit.

385
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:26,420
For those who can achieve this,
their inner hearts...

386
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,500
I thought Miss Shi had finally
turned her fortune around

387
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,420
and was about to soar high.

388
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,180
But after entering the palace,

389
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,380
nothing changed.

390
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,020
And why His Majesty

391
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,140
delayed the designation of the Empress,

392
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,500
making Miss Shi suffer in vain?

393
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,060
Stop talking nonsense.

394
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,540
His Majesty just ascended

395
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,060
and must be facing many issues.

396
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,020
The day before yesterday,
he cut palace extravagance.

397
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,980
Yesterday, he pardoned
800 palace servants,

398
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:48,940
sending them home.

399
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,060
The designation of the Empress

400
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,820
is only slightly delayed.

401
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,420
He's busy,

402
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,020
busy tending to crabapple trees.

403
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:56,860
Zhuwen.

404
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,580
I'm sorry.

405
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,940
I was just thinking of Ms. Sun.

406
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,360
She suddenly fell ill

407
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,900
and has been recuperating in Qingzhou.

408
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,700
What will Miss Shi...

409
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,660
Songhua.

410
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,740
Do you think she should be punished?

411
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,540
Yes.

412
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,340
You heard that.

413
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,900
Get out...

414
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,140
and fetch me some snacks.

415
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,260
I'll be right back.

416
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:51,980
His Majesty is here.

417
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,220
Please enter the hall, My Lord.

418
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,540
I am Cui Xingzhou.

419
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,220
Greetings to Your Majesty.

420
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,660
Minister Cui, no need for formality.

421
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:31,900
There is no outsider here.

422
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,020
Your contributions are invaluable.

423
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,060
Even without your ancestral glory,

424
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,860
I would not force you to kneel.

425
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,220
Thank you, Your Majesty.

426
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,420
I have invited you to
this temporary palace first.

427
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,700
Do you know why?

428
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,740
This was the former
Crown Prince's residence.

429
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,700
Do you want to remind me

430
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,700
that your ascension

431
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,580
is the rightful succession

432
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,540
of the royal family,

433
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,020
restoring order and justice?

434
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,140
It is both out of nostalgia,

435
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,580
and a reminder to myself that,

436
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,900
even as Emperor,

437
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,340
I must remember those dear ones lost,

438
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,060
the days and nights fleeing

439
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,660
from the Zhenzhou troops,

440
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,860
and my missing loved one.

441
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,140
Your Majesty, are you

442
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,900
intending to settle old scores

443
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,340
and avenge the Qingzhou affair?

444
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,500
In the past, I couldn't
do anything to you,

445
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,620
but things are different now.

446
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,740
You meeting me today

447
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,820
without surprise

448
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,620
suggests you've already investigated

449
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,980
and considered everything thoroughly.

450
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,380
Given that,

451
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,820
the vassal lords have yet to act,

452
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,940
why did you take the lead

453
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,820
and arrive at the capital so soon?

454
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,780
I was summoned by the imperial edict,

455
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,020
so naturally, I was the first to arrive,

456
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:59,190
also to show the vassal lords

457
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,300
how Zhenzhou's fate will unfold

458
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,460
before they decide

459
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,220
how to pledge their loyalty
to the new emperor.

460
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,220
You're afraid

461
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,620
that she'll make her decision

462
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:19,300
in the capital.

463
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,740
Given how things are now,

464
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,900
you remain a pillar of the kingdom,

465
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,090
and I'm

466
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,660
the supreme lord.

467
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,260
Between you and me,

468
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,580
everything from our past can be let go

469
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,460
and must be let go.

470
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,900
Is that an imperial edict

471
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,500
or a command from Ziyu?

472
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,260
Though I have deceived her

473
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,340
and I can't deny it,

474
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:50,980
Mr. Ziyu has no right to judge me either.

475
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,540
When I first found Liu Miantang,

476
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,780
her tendons were severed,

477
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,780
lying in the cold pool, bloodied.

478
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,260
Even if you didn't know this,

479
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,020
you indulged your old followers.

480
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,740
As for our past,
even if I can let it go,

481
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:05,740
she

482
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:07,860
certainly cannot.

483
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,180
I know what happened in Zhenzhou.

484
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,860
She has nothing

485
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,580
to do with you anymore.

486
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:33,100
But as ruler and subject,
our future is long.

487
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,100
Minister Cui,

488
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,580
please rest well

489
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,660
after your long journey.

490
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,380
Be careful.

491
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,500
Don't bump into anything.

492
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,500
- Yes.
- Yes.

493
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,220
You arrived so suddenly.

494
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,460
But that's good.

495
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,580
Everyone in here

496
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,620
is at ease now.

497
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:08,260
Afraid I'll rebel?

498
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,740
Sister,

499
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,660
when did you plant these crabapple trees?

500
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,460
According to palace news,

501
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,460
His Majesty is fond of crabapples,

502
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,940
so the noble families in the capital

503
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:22,820
are all following suit,

504
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,860
making it quite the trend.

505
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,660
He's fond of crabapples.

506
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,300
You're simple-minded.

507
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,980
Serving His Majesty in the capital,

508
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,180
you must always be alert

509
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,180
and grasp his intentions.

510
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,820
I've heard this new Emperor
is quite different.

511
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,260
He advocates for simplicity,

512
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,660
canceled all grand court meetings,

513
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,850
and is nostalgic and traditional.

514
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:44,000
He's using the former Crown Prince's
mansion as a temporary palace

515
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,020
and staying low-profile.

516
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,580
I wonder if this is out of filial piety,

517
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,660
but it's quite strange that he hasn't

518
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,020
appointed the empress or consorts

519
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,660
even after ascending the throne.

520
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,180
Sister, you married into a capital family

521
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,700
and are interested in kingdom affairs.

522
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,220
His Majesty signed
a marriage certificate

523
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,220
with Miss Shi.

524
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,580
But they didn't even live together.

525
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,780
So the official wife's position

526
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,180
is awkward in the palace.

527
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,620
Whether she'll become Empress
is still up in the air.

528
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,020
He also has a concubine surnamed Sun,

529
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,940
daughter of the former
Crown Prince's aide.

530
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,020
She was with His Majesty
before he became Emperor.

531
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,300
But until now,

532
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:19,820
she hasn't been summoned to the capital,

533
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,980
and doesn't seem to be in line
for the empress title.

534
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,540
The new emperor isn't
conducting a selection

535
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,540
and is just waiting.

536
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,740
All my friends believe His Majesty

537
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:32,100
reserves the Empress position
for someone special,

538
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,220
perhaps his loved one.

539
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,500
But no one knows
which noble family she's from.

540
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,060
Since you're often in the palace,

541
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,220
help me find out more.

542
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,540
Sure.

543
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,820
Don't laugh loudly;

544
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,180
speak quietly.

545
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,620
- Your Ladyship.
- Mother.

546
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,740
- Honey.
- Brother-in-law.

547
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:51,660
I was too excited

548
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,500
and forgot the rules.

549
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,780
Our Duke Qing's family

550
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,060
is a noble one in the capital.

551
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,820
As the eldest daughter-in-law,

552
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,980
you forgot the rules
upon seeing your brother

553
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,420
which is unbecoming.

554
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:03,860
Yes.

555
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,420
Lord Huaiyang,

556
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:09,180
you look much more mature now.

557
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,580
I heard that Xingzhou

558
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,900
made quite a splash today,

559
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,140
summoned by His Majesty
as soon as he arrived in the capital.

560
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,220
It's embarrassing to say,

561
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,900
but I haven't even met His Majesty yet.

562
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,500
Since His Majesty summoned me,

563
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,140
he naturally remembered my sister,

564
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,300
and in doing so,

565
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,220
he also recalled

566
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,180
the Duke Qing's.

567
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,140
Brother-in-law,

568
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:27,940
no need to worry.

569
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,300
Yes.

570
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,420
We're family.

571
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,580
I'm tired.

572
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,340
Fu,

573
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,900
you must take good care
of Xingzhou these days.

574
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,140
Xingzhou is my youngest brother.

575
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,340
I will take good care of him.

576
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,540
Mother, don't worry.

577
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,140
Let's go.

578
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,780
After you, Sister.

579
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,500
Where is it?

580
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,420
Where is what?

581
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,580
Face powder from Scent Store,

582
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,420
in the Moon Mist shade.

583
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,020
What's this?

584
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,260
Face powder from Scent Store in Jiangnan.

585
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,140
For me?

586
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,220
Last year, you said you bought it

587
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,380
and would send it to the capital.

588
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,820
I've been waiting for a whole year.

589
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:55,940
Moru.

590
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,140
Yes.

591
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,260
Did he give it to a confidante?

592
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:01,860
A confidante...

593
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,260
Pour me some more tea.

594
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,260
Really?

595
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,220
I'm just curious.

596
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,500
Mother's letter said

597
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,940
you're not marrying Cousin Lian.

598
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,580
So, you've fallen for someone else.

599
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,100
Good for you, Xingzhou.

600
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,700
Giving your girl my gift,

601
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:19,740
that's too good for you.

602
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:24,580
My Lord.

603
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:25,980
Young Lady.

604
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:27,100
Prince Sui's sent an invitation.

605
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,260
Princess of Sui said

606
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,100
they got some good items
from Western Regions.

607
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:32,300
She invites you to come

608
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,140
and enjoy them tomorrow.

609
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,540
Okay. You can leave now.

610
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,740
Princess of Sui?

611
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:41,660
I usually have no contact with her.

612
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:42,680
How come...

613
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:43,860
It's Prince Sui.

614
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:45,680
He wants to see me.

615
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,700
(Inviting Cui Fu and Cui Xingzhou
to Prince Sui's tomorrow.)

616
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,540
Yes.

617
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,620
You're invited too.

618
00:34:55,860 --> 00:35:01,940
(Prince Sui's Mansion)

619
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,300
We've been walking for so long.

620
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,820
Is this the main hall?

621
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,580
We've only passed a few courtyards.

622
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,900
How could it be the main hall?

623
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:12,980
This is Prince Sui's conference hall.

624
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,420
This mansion is so big.

625
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,660
Does the prince usually

626
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,020
travel by carriage?

627
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,340
Or he would be tired.

628
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,180
You entered through the back door,

629
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,220
so the path is longer.

630
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,140
His Lordship uses the main entrance,

631
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,300
which is closer to the main hall.

632
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,500
Sure.

633
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,100
Your Han residences

634
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,300
have so many rules.

635
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,780
I heard about "purple east".

636
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,900
The study must be in the east, right?

637
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,540
Actually, the study is in the west.

638
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,780
The wing rooms are on the east side.

639
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,060
Those rooms are for guests.

640
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,620
Miss, may I ask

641
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,900
if His Lordship is here now?

642
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,020
Aren't you here to see the Princess of Sui?

643
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,020
Last time, I felt that

644
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,990
Princess of Sui was very affectionate
towards Prince Sui.

645
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,460
This time, she might not
choosing for herself.

646
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:00,820
So, we've also prepared

647
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,420
some men's accessories

648
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,740
for His Lordship to try on.

649
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,380
We have guests today.

650
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,940
And you can't go to the inner courtyard.

651
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,140
I'll ask Princess of Sui

652
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,020
and tell you later.

653
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,340
Okay.

654
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,580
Your Lordship, this way please.

655
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,420
My Lord, Lord Huaiyang is here.

656
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,940
Xingzhou.

657
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:48,860
My Lord.

658
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,100
We're from different fiefs,

659
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,220
far apart.

660
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,860
I've missed you for a long time.

661
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,300
A few days ago,

662
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,060
Empress Dowager asked me

663
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,260
to organize a memorial
at the imperial tomb.

664
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,820
I returned yesterday

665
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,580
and couldn't go to the palace
to greet you.

666
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,500
Please don't hold it against me.

667
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,620
It's okay.

668
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:12,740
Please have a seat.

669
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:13,860
After you, My Lord.

670
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:14,860
Come on.

671
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,660
- Please.
- My Lord, please.

672
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,020
Among all the lords,

673
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,540
Lord Huaiyang, you are the one

674
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,300
I most wanted to meet.

675
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,060
I used my wife's invitation
to Duke Qing's

676
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,580
to invite you.

677
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:37,700
We need to

678
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,540
have a good chat

679
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,340
about the past,

680
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:42,620
the present,

681
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:43,820
and the future.

682
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:47,460
I have a million things

683
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,740
that I want to say.

684
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,780
You've flattered me, My Lord.

685
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:53,900
Thinking back,

686
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:55,980
when Wu was in power,

687
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,340
you suffered a lot.

688
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,860
I'm happy for you

689
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,860
in such good spirits today.

690
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:07,300
It's not easy for us

691
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,780
to have this nice talk.

692
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,860
We've earned this day.

693
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,500
Turning the situation around

694
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,180
and restoring order,

695
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,740
these are thanks to His Majesty, My Lord,

696
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,780
and Minister Shi's efforts.

697
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,500
I did nothing.

698
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,620
How can you say that?

699
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,340
Lord Huaiyang's dedication

700
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,380
to coming to the capital

701
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,820
shows your great mind.

702
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,580
It's a blessing for Qi.

703
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,420
The Cui family

704
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,140
has always remained loyal

705
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,380
to the Liu reign.

706
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,060
As for

707
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,740
the past events

708
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,260
during Wu's rule,

709
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,780
there's no need to talk about them.

710
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,740
No need?

711
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:57,060
Didn't you just say we turned

712
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,340
the situation around?

713
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:00,940
The fault

714
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,300
lies entirely with Wu.

715
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:05,740
I know

716
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,100
you have

717
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:08,500
some misunderstandings

718
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,700
with His Majesty

719
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,580
or with others.

720
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,580
- But...
- Misunderstandings?

721
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:18,860
With whom?

722
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,700
Like

723
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,140
Minister Shi.

724
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,700
Or

725
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,660
some current officials.

726
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,420
Forget about it.

727
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,540
That's not important.

728
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:41,300
As long as you and I

729
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,780
serve His Majesty wholeheartedly,

730
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:45,700
I guarantee

731
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,060
that Zhenzhou

732
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,980
will always belong to the Cui family.

733
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,540
Thank you, My Lord.

734
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:02,940
Honestly,

735
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,620
I didn't have much interaction

736
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,020
with your father,

737
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,340
but his achievements

738
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,500
were hard-earned.

739
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:13,260
He knew how to assess the situation.

740
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:17,260
The late emperor often said

741
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,420
that your family
holds a different surname,

742
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:21,820
but...

743
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:22,820
My Lord.

744
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,140
How dare you.

745
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,420
I'm talking to Lord Huaiyang.

746
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:28,740
What's wrong?

747
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,260
My Lord,

748
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,820
Eunuch Fu is here
with an imperial decree.

749
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:34,980
Come in.

750
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,540
My Lord.

751
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:39,700
Grand Empress Dowager

752
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,340
will have lunch with His Majesty.

753
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,380
They'll have burbot, which you like.

754
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:45,700
Grand Empress Dowager misses you

755
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,980
and invites you to join them for lunch.

756
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:51,460
You may leave.

757
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,300
Don't blame me, Xingzhou.

758
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:59,820
Empress Dowager

759
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,860
always misses me

760
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,340
and asks me

761
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,860
to accompany her.

762
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:05,820
I...

763
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:07,460
Well...

764
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,100
My Lord, please go.

765
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,460
I heard from my wife

766
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,380
that she also invited your sister,

767
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,340
Young Lady Guo.

768
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,500
Please have lunch

769
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,420
with your sister here.

770
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,460
My wife has specially

771
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,180
prepared for it.

772
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,700
Very good.

773
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,260
Then I'll take my leave.

774
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,580
This headpiece is called
"crimson dawn and clear day"

775
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:50,780
with the color of fire.

776
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,620
It makes you even more dazzling.

777
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,260
Young Lady Guo, won't you pick one?

778
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,620
I have a yellowish complexion,

779
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:00,620
so it doesn't suit me well.

780
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,460
It only looks good on you.

781
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:03,940
Duke Qing's

782
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:05,780
is too plain and conservative.

783
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,900
Doesn't your brother
arrive in the capital?

784
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,700
Let him take you out shopping.

785
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,740
It's good for socializing.

786
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,780
It's not that I'm anxious.

787
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,100
The noble ladies in the capital

788
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,300
are all asking about him.

789
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:18,900
Three of them have even asked me

790
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:19,940
to introduce him.

791
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,540
Your Lordship.

792
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,980
Young Lady Guo is over there.

793
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:33,540
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

794
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,140
Sister.

795
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:37,340
Have you finished talking

796
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,260
with Prince Sui already?

797
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:39,340
He went to the palace

798
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,340
for an imperial edict.

799
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:43,580
Prince Sui is the youngest son

800
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:45,180
of Grand Empress Dowager.

801
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,180
Naturally,

802
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,180
he is favored in the capital.

803
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,100
Never mind.

804
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,020
Lord Huaiyang arrived just in time.

805
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,620
Today, I've invited two merchants

806
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:53,780
from the Western Regions

807
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:54,860
who have brought

808
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:56,340
rare and valuable items to the capital.

809
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:01,300
From the Western Regions.
