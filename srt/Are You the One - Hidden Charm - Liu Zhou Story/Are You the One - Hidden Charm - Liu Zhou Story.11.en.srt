14
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,670
You wanted to inscribe for the shop.

15
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:54,660
Have you decided

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,840
what to write?

17
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,280
Not yet.

18
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,300
Do you have any suggestions for me?

19
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,970
You can think later.

20
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,910
I feel

21
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,660
that in these days of rest at home,

22
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,730
you've changed a lot.

23
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:10,990
Changed?

24
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,500
Not only do you help with chores
and ease my worries,

25
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,180
but you're more thoughtful.

26
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:29,710
Miantang,

27
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,180
you're really here.

28
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,160
Dear.

29
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,620
I finally found you.

30
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,290
Sir,

31
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,640
are you mistaken?

32
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,270
- I'm not your wife.
- I'm not mistaken.

33
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,110
It's me.

34
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,550
Miantang, I'm your husband.

35
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,390
I'm Cui Jiu.

36
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,990
Who is this fool?

37
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:48,060
Spouting nonsense.

38
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,520
Honey, did you offend someone outside,

39
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,010
causing them to ruin my reputation?

40
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,240
No. He's not your husband.

41
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,250
Your husband is here.

42
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,640
I am your husband.

43
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,250
He is just an impostor.

44
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,500
How can you prove you're not an impostor?

45
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,800
I...

46
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,150
Have you forgotten?

47
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,010
Three years ago,

48
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,240
on June 7th,

49
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,830
you traveled from Beizhou to the capital

50
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,810
encountered bandits,

51
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,920
and disappeared.

52
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,760
Right?

53
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,100
- Bandits...
- In these three years,

54
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,430
I sent people to search for you everywhere.

55
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,310
Finally, Heaven didn't disappoint me.

56
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,410
I heard the news about you in Lingquan Town.

57
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,340
So I rushed over from the capital.

58
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,430
If I weren't the real Cui Jiu,

59
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,730
who else would know this?

60
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,780
This impostor.

61
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,180
Why don't you say anything?

62
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,290
Are you feeling guilty?

63
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,200
Honey,

64
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,990
if you don't speak,

65
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,010
I might believe it.

66
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,750
He came all the way

67
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,780
from the capital.

68
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,100
What you said

69
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:42,730
is what I wanted to ask.

70
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,230
You said

71
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,060
you came specially from the capital?

72
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,270
Exactly.

73
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,620
Then I need to ask.

74
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,340
The fabric of your clothes

75
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,430
is from Jianlin

76
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,060
and you speak with a Jianlin accent.

77
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,290
The Cui family has been

78
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,570
genuine capital folks for three generations.

79
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,520
I...

80
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,520
Did you make a detour

81
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,660
to come here?

82
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:09,010
My wet nurse is from Jianlin.

83
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,060
She made me these clothes

84
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,060
and taught me about the accent.

85
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:13,980
What's the problem?

86
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,140
Words full of deceit.

87
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,140
You're taking advantage
of my wife's memory loss

88
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,660
and causing confusion here.

89
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:21,500
I advise you

90
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,620
to give up on this matter.

91
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,580
I went

92
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,100
to my wife's house several times

93
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,300
to propose,

94
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,740
so my father-in-law

95
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,900
finally agreed.

96
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,420
You're the one with deceitful words.

97
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,780
I can also claim

98
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,460
that I went to Beizhou myself

99
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,380
and personally asked her father for marriage.

100
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,940
You're eloquent,

101
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:47,980
but you don't know

102
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,860
my father has long passed away.

103
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,260
My husband just tested you,

104
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,660
and your lies are exposed.

105
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:55,900
Moru,

106
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,540
send this fraud to the authorities.

107
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,020
- Yes.
- No, no.

108
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,140
Wait.

109
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,660
You can deny me,

110
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,860
but you cannot deny this.

111
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,060
This is our marriage certificate

112
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,140
in black and white.

113
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,660
(Beizhou)
With the official seal.

114
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,380
Now I want to see

115
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,540
who dares to say I'm not Cui Jiu.

116
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:21,980
This is impossible.

117
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,860
Liu Miantang brought this

118
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,100
with her to Mount Yang.

119
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,100
It has now come in handy.

120
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,860
She's always been scheming,

121
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,300
pretending to lose her memory.

122
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,940
I'll send a man to test her.

123
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,140
Even if she really forgets everything,

124
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,380
I'll make sure to create chaos for her,

125
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,500
disturbing her life.

126
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,540
You claim to be the real Cui Jiu?

127
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:51,860
Do you have it?

128
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,780
If you can produce it today, that's fine.

129
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,020
If you can't,

130
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,180
I'll accuse you of stealing my wife.

131
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,180
Compared to a piece of paper,

132
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,340
I trust my eyes more.

133
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,020
I only recognize you as my husband.

134
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,380
His identity in the capital is fake.

135
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,460
A document cannot be true.

136
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,460
Let's go to the authorities

137
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,100
and expose his lies.

138
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,740
True gold fears no fire.

139
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,060
We are a real couple.

140
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:23,900
What's there to fear?

141
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,460
The authorities, huh?

142
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,420
Let's go.

143
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,980
I'll let the authorities judge.

144
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,260
- Move.
- Honey, let's go.

145
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,300
Take a look.

146
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,540
Under the bright sun,

147
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,060
he stole my wife from me.

148
00:06:59,100 --> 00:06:59,940
You...

149
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,700
You sneaked up on me.

150
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,420
Where are they?

151
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,860
You prepared such a big show.

152
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,340
Why not watch it all before leaving?

153
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,700
Who are you?

154
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,780
I've seen you before.

155
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,140
Miantang, why are you here?

156
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,580
If I weren't here,

157
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,700
how would I know who's behind this?

158
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,340
What are you talking about, Miantang?

159
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,140
I just happened to pass by.

160
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,900
Just happened to have tea at that stall

161
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,100
and just happened to follow along.

162
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,940
So many coincidences.

163
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,820
What's your background?

164
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,180
Why incite that fake Cui Jiu

165
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,260
to ruin my reputation?

166
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,780
Incite?

167
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,580
The man just now was shouting and claiming

168
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,820
to be your husband.

169
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,180
It's clearly a personal grudge.

170
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,860
What does it have to do with me?

171
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,660
The villagers watching near my shop

172
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,020
couldn't figure out anything.

173
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,140
They whispered and asked about the reason.

174
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,940
You were just at that tea stall.

175
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,260
How would you know

176
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,180
what he said?

177
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,460
Are you all fools?

178
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,700
You'll have to blame yourselves

179
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,820
for walking right into it.

180
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,450
Move.

181
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,780
Want to run away?

182
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,500
Miss!

183
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,300
Don't move.

184
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,940
Or I'll step on her.

185
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,460
Still daring to fight me?

186
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,180
Even though I'm weak,

187
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,620
it's more than enough to hit you.

188
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,460
Dear, you shouldn't fight.

189
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,580
How can you do this?

190
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,260
Who are you?

191
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,700
Thanks

192
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,900
to you all heroes

193
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,860
for your help.

194
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:08,940
Thank you, thank you.

195
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,260
Heroes,

196
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,220
thank you.

197
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,700
Here's some reward

198
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,820
from me and my husband.

199
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,460
Please take it to buy drinks.

200
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,300
Thank you, Madam.

201
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,700
I want to see

202
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,220
what she's really up to.

203
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,060
Dear,

204
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,940
they have many people.

205
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,300
They must be dangerous.

206
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,940
Let's hand them over to the authorities.

207
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,540
Please, heroes,

208
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,860
take these people

209
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,740
to the authorities.

210
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:37,860
Thank you, thank you.

211
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,620
The authorities will clear this up.

212
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,260
Now you feel the pain?

213
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,100
Is it better?

214
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,340
Still hurting.

215
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,700
What a useless miracle physician.

216
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,100
He took so much effort to find the medicine

217
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,940
and it's useless.

218
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,060
It was just applied.

219
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,700
Even Hua Tuo's medicine

220
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,100
wouldn't work this fast.

221
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,740
Bone injuries

222
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,420
need time to heal.

223
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,660
You know it needs time.

224
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,020
But you were so forceful earlier.

225
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,500
I didn't know why.

226
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,140
When I saw that woman earlier,

227
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,820
I felt

228
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,300
an uncontrollable rage,

229
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,780
wanting to tear her apart.

230
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,140
I completely forgot

231
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,060
about the injury on my hand.

232
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,100
Do you know her?

233
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,980
I've only seen her once at the banquet

234
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,980
with the neighbors.

235
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,660
That day, I just said

236
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,500
I have a poor memory,

237
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,820
and she took it to heart,

238
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,620
sending someone to scheme against me.

239
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,140
I really don't know what she's up to.

240
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,380
That rascal

241
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,060
claimed to be Cui Jiu,

242
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,820
saying he's your husband.

243
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,380
Forget about that dirty business.

244
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,980
That man's face is swollen

245
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,140
with a lewd gaze.

246
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,660
He looks deceitful.

247
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,420
Marrying him

248
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,460
would be worse

249
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,780
than being kidnapped by bandits.

250
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,060
So according to you,

251
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,860
if he were good-looking,

252
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,220
you'd just accept him?

253
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,780
What are you saying?

254
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,460
I'm already married to you.

255
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,980
A gentleman like you,

256
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,580
cultured and talented,

257
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,860
is exactly what I prefer.

258
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,780
Speaking of which,

259
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,700
what was Yun'er thinking?

260
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:06,740
How could someone

261
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,620
mistake their husband?

262
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,860
I lost my memory,

263
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,140
but I'm not a fool.

264
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,220
Can't I tell if my spouse

265
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,380
is sincere

266
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,780
or has ulterior motives?

267
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:18,980
Besides,

268
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,820
with my intelligence,

269
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,940
how deep a scheme

270
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,380
and how superb a skill

271
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,260
would it take to impersonate

272
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,340
my husband so convincingly?

273
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,420
Honey, what are you thinking?

274
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,380
Nothing.

275
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,780
I'm going to see what food

276
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,900
Nanny Li has prepared.

277
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:54,620
(He Mansion)

278
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,540
She's been ill for long.

279
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,660
Why isn't it getting better?

280
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,300
How humiliating.

281
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,220
If it were me,

282
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,460
I wouldn't dare to go out.

283
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,900
She has high aspirations.

284
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,660
Who would dare marry her now?

285
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,140
Unless she finds another lord.

286
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,620
Isn't that right?

287
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,220
Don't listen to their nonsense.

288
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,500
Look here.

289
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,420
Miss.

290
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,540
Physician Zhao said
you can't go out these days,

291
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,780
or you might die.

292
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,740
What's the point

293
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,980
of living like this?

294
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,500
My reputation

295
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,900
can't be restored.

296
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,700
Being derided and mocked

297
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,980
every day.

298
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,740
It's better to die

299
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,300
and be done with it.

300
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,740
Miss.

301
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,020
Look at our porcelain.

302
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,030
Is it to your liking?

303
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:08,060
Little trinkets.

304
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,060
Miss,

305
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,020
take a look at our fans and mirrors.

306
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,620
(Strange.)

307
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,860
(Why do I feel nothing?)

308
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:53,980
Miss,

309
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,100
come home with me.

310
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,180
Go fetch

311
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,140
Physician Zhao.

312
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,140
- Mr. Zhao.
- Zhao.

313
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,100
Miss He.

314
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,500
- Move.
- What are you doing?

315
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,340
Be quiet.

316
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,340
Let me go.

317
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,180
Move.

318
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:14,740
Miss.

319
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,020
What is this about?

320
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,860
A swindler

321
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,380
pretending to be a physician.

322
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,380
No, Miss.

323
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,060
I made a mistake.

324
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,060
Let's talk this out.

325
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:24,980
Mrs. Cui says

326
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,100
Mr. Cui has been asking you

327
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:26,980
to treat her,

328
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,140
spending a lot of money.

329
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,980
It's all a misunderstanding.

330
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:31,980
Fine.

331
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,580
Tie up this swindler and take him

332
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,420
to the Cui Mansion.

333
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,360
- Yes.
- Yes.

334
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,900
How much money did you scam?

335
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,860
Confess honestly.

336
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,140
Miss, please let me explain.

337
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:40,980
Shut up.

338
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:41,980
Hupo.

339
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,340
No, no.

340
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,460
At that time,

341
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,380
what I did...

342
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,340
Was because of the situation.

343
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,180
I...

344
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,540
I know you're anxious,

345
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,820
but please don't rush.

346
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,180
You need to listen to me.

347
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,340
At that time...

348
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,860
Please let me explain.

349
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,700
Miss He.

350
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,740
I'm not...

351
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,660
Please let me explain.

352
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,740
What happened?

353
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,580
Madam.

354
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,660
Bicao, what's the panic about?

355
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,700
Miss He brought people

356
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,900
and came aggressively,

357
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,540
saying she needed to talk with you.

358
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,580
Miss He.

359
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:25,660
What's going on?

360
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,260
Cui Jiu.

361
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,860
- Kneel.
- Miss He.

362
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,380
Physician Zhao.

363
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,980
What's going on? What happened?

364
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,020
Ask him.

365
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,300
Cui Jiu!

366
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,860
Cui Jiu!

367
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,940
Swindler?

368
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,580
It's a shame Mr. Cui regarded him as a friend.

369
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,940
From now on, be more discerning.

370
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,340
Don't be deceived by him again.

371
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,740
Is there a misunderstanding here?

372
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,620
I'll ask my husband

373
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,580
- to confront him.
- Go.

374
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:01,940
Hurry, hurry.

375
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,740
Miss He.

376
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,140
Please release me.

377
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,060
I won't deceive you anymore.

378
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,020
Honey, what are you doing here?

379
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,020
Why aren't you going out?

380
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,220
I'm your husband.

381
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,380
It's inappropriate for me to see her.

382
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,540
What are you saying?

383
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,340
Miss He has brought Physician Zhao,

384
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,580
claiming he's a quack.

385
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,620
You should take a look.

386
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,500
She's causing a scene.

387
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,020
I can't do anything.

388
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,580
I don't know if Zhao Quan is a quack.

389
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,020
I don't know medicine.

390
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,580
It's hard for me to decide.

391
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,260
You should at least go out and see.

392
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,820
You can just question him

393
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:37,940
in front of Miss He.

394
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,780
I...

395
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,940
I know you're a person of dignity

396
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,260
and dislike such noisy situations,

397
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,140
but at least go out and see.

398
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,460
Isn't he your friend?

399
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,420
He's not my friend.

400
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:56,980
No.

401
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,060
I don't have friends like him.

402
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,300
When it comes to treatment,

403
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,260
I've already told him

404
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,780
to practice within his limits.

405
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,300
He can't treat women's illnesses.

406
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,140
Well.

407
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,300
What if he kills someone?

408
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,060
How will this end now?

409
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,420
Let He Zhen report

410
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,740
to the authorities.

411
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,740
Report?

412
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,580
(Cui Mansion)

413
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,540
Cui Jiu!

414
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,380
Go.

415
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,820
Quickly save me.

416
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,100
Hurry, go.

417
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,260
- Miss He, I'm not...
- Be quiet.

418
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,100
To the yamen.

419
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,060
No.

420
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,300
I won't go.

421
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,820
I won't go.

422
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,500
Cui Jiu!

423
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,500
Cui Jiu!

424
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,020
Miss.

425
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,940
I did deceive you before.

426
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,820
I'm sorry.

427
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,020
Please give me another chance

428
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,980
to give you a new prescription.

429
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,580
If you still think

430
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,900
I'm a fraud,

431
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,340
you can take me to the yamen.

432
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,300
Okay?

433
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,940
Do you still dare to fool me?

434
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,020
I didn't deceive you.

435
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,540
Your illness is rooted in your heart.

436
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:09,900
It's not because

437
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,260
you weren't made

438
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,740
a concubine of the Lord Huaiyang.

439
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,340
You just want to make a name for yourself

440
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,540
and prove yourself in front of your family.

441
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:24,980
Keep talking.

442
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,300
I heard

443
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,420
you've been managing the porcelain business

444
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,060
with your father,

445
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,220
so you must be quite talented

446
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,860
and competitive.

447
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,700
But

448
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,340
because you are a woman,

449
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,820
even if you stand out

450
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,740
while doing business,

451
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,140
you're still inferior to your brothers.

452
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,060
That day I went to your house,

453
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,420
even an outsider like me could see.

454
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,460
Shut up.

455
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,540
Glib words.

456
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,380
They're not glib words.

457
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,180
The prescription I gave you

458
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,220
was for calming the heart.

459
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,260
I didn't want you to go out

460
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,660
because I feared you might

461
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,860
encounter Lord Huaiyang,

462
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,900
or hear news about him,

463
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,260
or be pointed at by others,

464
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,460
causing you distress.

465
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,620
Really.

466
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,740
You are in excellent health.

467
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,180
No need to check.

468
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,740
I know.

469
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,500
I'm asking you

470
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,340
to leave.

471
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,180
Release me first.

472
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:57,500
Quickly, get away from him.

473
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,770
I don't know who he is.

474
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,100
How much is this?

475
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,500
Mind your own business.

476
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,660
How dare you tie me up?

477
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,620
Do you know who I am?

478
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:26,060
Our Lord invited you

479
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:27,940
to ask you a few questions.

480
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,280
The Lord?

481
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:30,990
Sun Yun'er.

482
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,420
Who is Mount Yang's Lu Wen

483
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,460
to you?

484
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,580
Mr. Lu Wen

485
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,340
is a hero of this era,

486
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,060
a remarkable man.

487
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,580
I asked how he is related to you.

488
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:43,940
My Lord,

489
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,380
though I was once in Mount Yang,

490
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,300
Mount Yang has submitted to the court.

491
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,340
Mr. Lu Wen and I

492
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,580
are now both court officials.

493
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:55,300
Can court officials disturb the commoners?

494
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,340
This is my personal grudge,

495
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,180
a small matter with my enemy.

496
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,420
I did not wish to trouble you.

497
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,940
What personal grudge

498
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,260
do you have with Liu?

499
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,900
Do you know Liu Miantang?

500
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,180
Tell me.

501
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:15,580
Go.

502
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,500
I'm here to audit accounts.

503
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:25,580
When Liu Miantang left Mount Yang,

504
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,860
she took a large sum of money.

505
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,820
Since Mount Yang has submitted,

506
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:35,700
she risked provoking the authorities
for this money.

507
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,420
It must be

508
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,580
a substantial asset.

509
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,740
Mount Yang's submission

510
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,940
was not for money

511
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,300
but for something more important

512
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,660
than gold and silver.

513
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,380
I also tried to subdue you all.

514
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,140
Lu Wen refused,

515
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,060
resulting in his defeat.

516
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,460
It now seems

517
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,980
he wasn't hiding due to the defeat

518
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,780
but brewing something.

519
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,100
Eliminate the obstacles.

520
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,620
Discard the useless.

521
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,060
He certainly wouldn't submit to Zhenzhou.

522
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:17,180
He had long made deals
with the Chief Commander of Qingzhou

523
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,220
or perhaps,

524
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,340
he had another strong ally.

525
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:24,820
Sun Yun'er,

526
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,180
who is behind him?

527
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,180
No one.

528
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,500
No one.

529
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,820
What exactly does he want to do?

530
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,580
Go.

531
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,260
My Lord, please wait.

532
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,620
I am Gongsun Ye.

533
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:49,700
Greetings, My Lord.

534
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,100
Prince Sui is passing by Zhenzhou

535
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,540
and sent me to meet you.

536
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,460
Sir, save me.

537
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,140
Prince Sui asked me to inform you

538
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,340
that Mount Yang's submission
is a national matter.

539
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:07,140
Sun Yun'er, as a loyalist to the submission,

540
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,980
is a key national official.

541
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,460
If she's done anything wrong

542
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,580
and offended you,

543
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,380
please forgive her

544
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,900
and allow me to take her back.

545
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,300
Open the curtain.

546
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,380
Her involvement

547
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:27,220
is a grave crime affecting
the safety of Zhenzhou's people.

548
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,980
As the Lord,

549
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,460
I am merely inquiring briefly.

550
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,620
Afterward,

551
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,660
I will return her

552
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,700
safe and sound.

553
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,860
You may not have heard clearly.

554
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,620
Now, Prince Sui

555
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,340
has taken over Mount Yang's affairs.

556
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,460
Sun Yun'er was appointed by Prince Sui

557
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,500
to handle negotiations with Mount Yang.

558
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,620
As a meritorious figure,

559
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,100
if you regard her as a bandit,

560
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,660
then Prince Sui

561
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,860
and even the royal family

562
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,900
would be bandits too.

563
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:56,740
You...

564
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,940
Please, My Lord,

565
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,620
for the sake of the court,

566
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,660
be lenient.

567
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,620
Return.

568
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,540
Farewell, My Lord.

569
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,700
Follow me to see the Prince.

570
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,660
Liu Pei, Prince Sui,

571
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,100
is the younger brother of the late emperor

572
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,740
and is favored by Empress Dowager Wu.

573
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,380
No one can do anything about him.

574
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,780
Besides, you're investigating Mount Yang.

575
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,320
The ally behind

576
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:57,200
came uninvited.

577
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,620
No. They acted as the host.

578
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,980
Sun Yun'er means nothing.

579
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,780
But Prince Sui made a scene

580
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,900
and brought her back.

581
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,660
Not only to look after a subordinate.

582
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,500
It's to scare me off.

583
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,820
She's a bandit.

584
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,260
Even if supported by the Prince,

585
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,300
what can she do?

586
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,660
Thinking too much.

587
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:27,340
Prince Sui has taken over Mount Yang.

588
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,340
This must be related

589
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,820
to Sun Yun'er's demand for money

590
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,100
from Liu Miantang.

591
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,020
It's likely

592
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,180
that they can't

593
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,140
report the money to the court.

594
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,180
I have a premonition

595
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,700
that Prince Sui will

596
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,060
stir up a storm in the court,

597
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,220
and we will be implicated

598
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:53,940
and lose control.

599
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,980
And Liu Miantang.

600
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,540
If she is related

601
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,660
to this money,

602
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,300
her situation will only

603
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,900
become more dangerous.

604
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,100
Lu Wen is strange.

605
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,700
He allowed his concubine

606
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,980
to manage the money.

607
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,420
But now, Liu Miantang

608
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,380
surely can't remember where the money is.

609
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,820
Is there a problem?

610
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,260
Yes.

611
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,700
Cui Xingzhou.

612
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,420
You've changed.

613
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:39,860
In these years,

614
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,060
with the young Emperor ascending the throne,

615
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,740
you've spent your days drinking
and playing Go with me,

616
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,700
seeing events unfold.

617
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,460
When did you start saying things

618
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,660
like you have no control over your actions?

619
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,820
And when did you start to worry

620
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,100
about being unable

621
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,220
to protect someone?

622
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,180
This time...

623
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:00,780
You're concerned about someone.

624
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,580
You've had a weakness.

625
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,780
The crabapple flowers bloom beautifully,

626
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,620
tall and graceful, with heavenly fragrance.

627
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,300
Pick flowers while you can.

628
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,100
What a pity.

629
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,500
A lover brings a bottle,

630
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,340
but the bottle

631
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,100
contains the main flower.

632
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,940
Enough of your rambling.

633
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,500
I want to remind you

634
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,180
not to forget tomorrow.

635
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,820
Rest assured.

636
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:45,860
I have a plan.

637
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,100
Thank you for rescuing me.

638
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,380
Yun'er.

639
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,860
Do you realize your mistake?

640
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,140
It was my impulsive action

641
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,980
that led to this dangerous situation,

642
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,900
causing worry for you.

643
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,220
Utterly foolish.

644
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,220
I've been in hiding for many years,

645
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,820
acting meek and subservient

646
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,060
to avoid attention.

647
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,740
Today, you acted recklessly,

648
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,980
blinded by personal grudges.

649
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,980
Are you trying to ruin my major plans?

650
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,700
You were to test others

651
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,420
but got exposed.

652
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,580
If it weren't for your hard work
and achievements,

653
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,740
you'd die

654
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,380
here in Zhenzhou.

655
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,420
I've known my mistake.

656
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,660
Don't you understand?

657
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:48,420
Why would a lord

658
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,460
care about your personal grudge

659
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,780
with Liu Miantang?

660
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,300
Could it be...?

661
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,100
Cui Jiu

662
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,380
is Cui Xingzhou.

663
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:11,500
(Notice)

664
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,980
Impersonating someone's husband

665
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,280
to cheat money.

666
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:16,520
Unheard of.

667
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,500
How can there be such jerks

668
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,700
impersonating husbands

669
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,700
to extort money on the streets?

670
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,980
- It's utterly scandalous.
- Such people who harm others

671
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,190
should be arrested

672
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:27,080
and interrogated.

673
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,670
- Truly depraved, right?
- Yes.

674
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,140
Madam.

675
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,860
The wrongdoers

676
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,620
have been detained by the authorities.

677
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,820
After seeing the notice,

678
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,140
why are you still frowning?

679
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,420
In my view,

680
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,140
Sun Yun'er's manner and appearance

681
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,860
don't seem like those of a lowly person.

682
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,860
Moreover, I always feel

683
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,980
there is some connection between us.

684
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,740
How could that be?

685
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,660
How could you

686
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,740
have any connection

687
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,940
with such petty rats?

688
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,140
Why did she address me

689
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,700
as Miantang so intimately?

690
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,540
Well.

691
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,300
Perhaps

692
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,620
she was trying to get close to you.

693
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,260
And her gaze at me

694
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,540
was filled with resentment.

695
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:19,140
She must be jealous of your beauty.

696
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,060
But when I looked at her,

697
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,260
I also felt inexplicable anger.

698
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,380
Because...

699
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,660
Because...

700
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,580
Nanny Li.

701
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,300
You look guilty.

702
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,860
Are you hiding something from me?

703
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:33,700
No.

704
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:35,740
No, not at all.

705
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,260
Before I lost my memory,

706
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,700
I did know her, right?

707
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,540
No.

708
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,300
No.

709
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,740
What could make

710
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,700
two women

711
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,500
so antagonistic?

712
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,540
Could it be

713
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,020
she's the mistress of my husband?

714
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:55,860
She...

715
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,340
She...

716
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,540
She is

717
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,060
your adulterer's mistress.

718
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,860
What a sin.

719
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,940
(Mansion of Lord Huaiyang)

720
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:33,300
(Mansion of Lord Huaiyang)

721
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,340
Madam.

722
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,380
Have some tea.

723
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:00,580
As for the adulterer,

724
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,100
the master has put it behind.

725
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,090
Madam,

726
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:05,380
no need not worry further.

727
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:08,740
No wonder Sun Yun'er came to bother me.

728
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,920
It's all due to the entanglement.

729
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,380
But I see Ziyu

730
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,700
is also not a good person,

731
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:15,900
fickle and unreliable,

732
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:17,840
much worse than my husband.

733
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,060
Indeed.

734
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,100
Nanny Li,

735
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,140
have you seen

736
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,460
our marriage certificate?

737
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:27,980
Well.

738
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,580
Only the master and you know

739
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:36,180
where the marriage certificate is stored.

740
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,020
I never

741
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,660
touch it.

742
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,860
I searched every room,

743
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,900
only finding property deeds and drafts,

744
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,380
not the marriage certificate.

745
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:45,780
Could it be

746
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,260
someone else took it?

747
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:49,500
Madam,

748
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,660
I confess

749
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,020
my mistake.

750
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,220
Confess?

751
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,940
When we moved from the capital,

752
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,380
I was busy dismissing servants

753
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,540
and selling property.

754
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,980
All the household affairs

755
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:04,140
were managed by me alone.

756
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,700
So I

757
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,740
was overwhelmed

758
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,660
and lost the marriage certificate.

759
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,540
I lost it.

760
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:14,900
Lost it?

761
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,740
It's my fault for being careless

762
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,260
so as to lose such an important item.

763
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,460
I cannot atone for my mistake.

764
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:23,220
Sorry to the master and you, Madam.

765
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,340
It's lost, so be it.

766
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,660
Nanny Li, please rise.

767
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,020
Thank you, Madam.

768
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:30,860
Losing the certificate

769
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,700
doesn't make the marriage fake.

770
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,700
(Draft)

771
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,860
(Deed)

772
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,700
We'll end here for today.

773
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:46,980
You may leave.

774
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,460
My Lord,

775
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,460
we shall take our leave.

776
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:55,740
Miss He.

777
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:57,460
Please stay.

778
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:07,020
I heard your father is unwell.

779
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:08,860
Thank you for your concern.

780
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,220
My father is bedridden,

781
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,780
so I am handling affairs for him.

782
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,780
But did you know

783
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:17,540
your father sent a letter saying your family

784
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,900
would be absent today?

785
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,140
It was my decision to come here.

786
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,380
Please forgive me, My Lord.

787
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,700
There's no need to apologize.

788
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,060
I know why you're here.

789
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,420
I recently heard

790
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,460
some rumors.

791
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,540
Upon reflection,

792
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,300
I realized

793
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,540
I too have made mistakes,

794
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,420
which caused you

795
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,860
to suffer unjustly.

796
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,060
We met today.

797
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,420
I must apologize to you.

798
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,300
This matter

799
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,300
was indeed caused by me.

800
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,420
With your wedding approaching,

801
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,580
I should not trouble you any further.

802
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,260
I only have

803
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,540
one daring question to ask.

804
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,820
Did you reject me

805
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,420
because I come from a merchant family?

806
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,820
I absolutely do not

807
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,100
look down on you.

808
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,260
Was it because Ms. Lian refused to accept me?

809
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,500
I am a stranger to you.

810
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:20,700
If I let you be my concubine,

811
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,500
it would be unfair to you.

812
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,820
What if I'm willing

813
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,180
and wouldn't feel wronged?

814
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,580
If I took you in,

815
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:35,980
you should know

816
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,500
I wouldn't devote myself wholly to you,

817
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,660
and you wouldn't want to share

818
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,700
your husband with others.

819
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,020
In that case,

820
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,060
you'd only end up with regrets.

821
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,700
Even with high status and wealth,

822
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,500
you'd only experience pain,

823
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,340
leading

824
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,060
to estrangement.

825
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,580
You're so considerate of women.

826
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,700
You must have someone you love.

827
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,940
Thank you for enlightening me today.

828
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,940
Someone I love?

829
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,220
Do I?

830
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:33,460
(Mansion of Lord Huaiyang)

831
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,420
Miss, are you going back home?

832
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,260
No.

833
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,340
Go to North Street.

834
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,180
I want to tell Ms. Liu

835
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:48,700
that I've let go.

836
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:08,300
(Cui Mansion)

837
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,660
Master?

838
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,460
Honey.

839
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,220
You're back.

840
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,500
Come on.

841
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,260
Sit with me for a while.

842
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:51,760
♪The boat drifts, bringing back the sunset♪

843
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:59,000
♪When we reunite, we still joke
about the cause and effect♪

844
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,860
If you keep looking like that,

845
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,460
will your gaze burn a hole

846
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,340
in me?

847
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,100
Dear.

848
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,140
I have some

849
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,860
good news to tell you.

850
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,060
Coincidentally,

851
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,340
I also have some good news

852
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,300
to share with you.

853
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,180
Then you go first.

854
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:22,220
Don't get too carried away with joy.

855
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,060
Alright.

856
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:26,260
Lord Huaiyang is getting married this month.

857
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,300
According to customs, the business chamber

858
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,620
needs to prepare the porcelain.

859
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,340
Our Yushao Porcelain Shop

860
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,620
has gained certification.

861
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,900
Honey, our porcelain
can enter the Lord's mansion.

862
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:38,860
Perhaps on the wedding day,

863
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,900
the Lord will drink with his wife

864
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,860
from the cups we made.

865
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,140
I knew you'd get carried away with joy.

866
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,060
Indeed, I am delighted.

867
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,060
Dear,

868
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:07,940
I need to tell you

869
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,020
that the teacher said I've recently

870
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,860
improved in Go skills.

871
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:14,460
Since I couldn't learn much in the club,

872
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,060
he introduced me to a national master

873
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,180
and asked me to go

874
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,180
to study under him.

875
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,180
Really?

876
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:20,940
So,

877
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,020
this is a double happiness.

878
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:23,940
I'll go get ready.

879
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:25,820
Dear,

880
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:29,700
but this time the teacher said

881
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,340
I can't

882
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,260
bring my family.

883
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,020
Well.

884
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,580
When are you leaving?

885
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,300
Well.

886
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,740
Tonight.

887
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,060
So soon?

888
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,260
Such opportunities are rare.

889
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,940
I've already asked Moru

890
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,220
to help me pack.

891
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,580
When will you return?

892
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,500
Maybe in a month.

893
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,460
Maybe...

894
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:07,940
Dear,

895
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,820
don't you want to eat the dishes
from your hometown?

896
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,460
It's a good chance

897
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:14,940
to go back for a visit.

898
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,420
You look guilty.

899
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,220
Every time you leave,

900
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:26,980
you're always in such a hurry.

901
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,420
As your wife,

902
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,940
I never have time to prepare anything.

903
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,580
Prepare what?

904
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,380
Remember

905
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,140
to take

906
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,220
the medicine patches.

907
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,980
Keep them warm in front of the fire

908
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:49,700
each night

909
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:52,020
before you apply them to your arms.

910
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:54,940
After two months,

911
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:57,660
you will be recovered.

912
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,060
When you meet the master,

913
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,540
you must attend to formalities.

914
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:05,660
If you need anything,

915
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:06,780
just send a message.

916
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,460
I'll have Nanny Li deliver it to you.

917
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:13,100
Also, the mountain can be very cold.

918
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:15,020
You like cold drinks and wearing

919
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,180
light clothes while practicing boxing.

920
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:18,740
When you're warm,

921
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:20,180
don't indulge in the cold.

922
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,300
Moru can handle

923
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:29,740
these trivial matters.

924
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:31,260
You needn't worry.

925
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:40,380
I'll leave now.

926
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:42,540
Goodbye.
