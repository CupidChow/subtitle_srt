Liu Yunian's from Beizhou.

15
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,170
(Righteousness Across the World)
His daughter, Liu Miantang

16
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,520
has been noted for her virtuous
and cautious nature,

17
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,100
diligence, and gentleness.

18
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,750
The Emperor deeply appreciates

19
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,020
her past assistance.

20
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,610
Thus, she is specially granted

21
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,780
the title of Princess Huaisang,

22
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,690
with jurisdiction over 500 households.

23
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,910
The local government shall implement it.

24
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,330
I've received the decree.

25
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,780
Thank you.

26
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,870
Princess Huaisang, please rise.

27
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,100
Everyone, please rise.

28
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,690
I have other urgent matters.

29
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:24,950
I must take my leave.

30
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:33,950
Father.

31
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,270
I said that Miantang

32
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,850
has contributed to the Emperor.

33
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,870
Now,

34
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,990
Miantang and the Lord

35
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,750
are indeed a good match.

36
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,690
But the name "Huaisang"

37
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,620
with mourning sounds so ominous.

38
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,550
Well.

39
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,850
What does "Huaisang" mean?

40
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,220
People often say

41
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,860
"sang" and "zi" represent homes.

42
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,020
I am Lord Huaiyang.

43
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,690
Miantang represents my home.

44
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,010
If she's called "Huaizi",

45
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,500
meaning childbirth,

46
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,140
it would be too hasty.

47
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,780
The name "Huaisang"

48
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,900
is just right.

49
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,080
Thank His Majesty for his consideration.

50
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,730
He's done a great favor.

51
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,730
Why did His Majesty suddenly grant me a title?

52
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:30,730
Yes.

53
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,190
Why was it given suddenly?

54
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,730
Please explain clearly.

55
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,660
Well.

56
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,620
I guess

57
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,550
someone achieved military merit in Beizhou

58
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,900
and asked the Emperor for a reward.

59
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,900
I am just a small local lord.

60
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,270
What right do I have

61
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,130
to seek the title of Princess?

62
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,340
The Emperor is so petty.

63
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,250
I just asked for a jade,

64
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,690
and he became anxious.

65
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,690
So,

66
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,590
you planned for the reward,

67
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:03,410
broken leg,

68
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,500
marriage certificate, and title?

69
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:11,100
I thought you were as hard as iron before.

70
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,570
How could I have predicted today's events?

71
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,850
If you want to call it a plot,

72
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,150
it's fate

73
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,460
that aligns perfectly.

74
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:26,300
(Qiao Mansion)

75
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,910
Miantang

76
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,440
inherited my temper.

77
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,530
She is very stubborn.

78
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:33,530
Thank you for not disliking her.

79
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,480
Please be lenient

80
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,100
with her in the future.

81
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,790
If she really is unruly and unteachable,

82
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:43,120
feel free to send her back.

83
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,530
I will properly discipline her.

84
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,680
She can be unruly

85
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,590
in Zhenzhou.

86
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,370
You can be at ease.

87
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,340
Is the luggage

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,780
all sorted?

89
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:03,020
Have you packed

90
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,650
all the items I prepared?

91
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,710
Grandfather.

92
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,410
What? Forgotten?

93
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,320
Then stay another night.

94
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,880
Check it thoroughly.

95
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,730
No, no, no.

96
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,260
I had people check it three times.

97
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,820
Everything is ready.

98
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,700
Won't you have my pacifying whip?

99
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,710
I've been weaving it for several days.

100
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,290
It can really hurt.

101
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,480
If he really bullies me,

102
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,230
you can personally use the whip

103
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:38,100
on him in Zhenzhou.

104
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,340
I bid farewell to Grandfather.

105
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,680
I wish Grandfather good health

106
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,100
and a long life.

107
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,930
May the Qiao family

108
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,460
be safe and prosperous.

109
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,340
Uncle,

110
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,340
you must take good care of Grandfather.

111
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,680
If there is trouble,

112
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,790
let me know in time.

113
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,140
Rest assured, Miantang.

114
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,050
Your only job now is

115
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:35,730
to live a smooth life.

116
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:54,750
Dear.

117
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,840
Let's go.

118
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:28,500
(Qiao Mansion)

119
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,930
They've signed the marriage certificate?

120
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:58,630
Yes.

121
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,370
Your Majesty.

122
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,140
In the end,

123
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,900
she still chose Lord Huaiyang.

124
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,410
According to the customs,

125
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,240
the marriage of a lord

126
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,140
requires approval from me.

127
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,490
My Lord,

128
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,680
let me and the shadow guards

129
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,060
escort you and Madam.

130
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,870
The world's top bodyguard is with me.

131
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:17,710
What's the problem?

132
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,080
Would I be kidnapped

133
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,250
by bad people on the way?

134
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,920
Rest assured.

135
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,650
I'll protect your lord.

136
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,190
Listen.

137
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,730
Hurry back. Hurry back.

138
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:31,630
Spread the news of our wedding

139
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,130
to Zhenzhou.

140
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,630
Yes.

141
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,470
Go.

142
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,850
What's going on?

143
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,540
Where is everyone?

144
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,160
He Zhen!

145
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,370
He Zhen!

146
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,920
He Zhen!

147
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,130
He Zhen!

148
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,970
He Zhen!

149
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,770
He Zhen!

150
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,280
He...

151
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,300
Where is everyone?

152
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,820
They couldn't endure the hardship

153
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,460
and were dismissed.

154
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,630
We just made

155
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,540
a batch recently, didn't we?

156
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,250
Did you break them again?

157
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,850
Such a pity.

158
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,700
I couldn't perfect it

159
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,700
and reach an extraordinary level.

160
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,820
What use is it to keep it?

161
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,700
It's fine.

162
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,890
If it's broken, it's broken.

163
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,100
We can always start over.

164
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,490
He Zhen,

165
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,300
even if we haven't made it now,

166
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,580
as long as we're here,

167
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,580
we'll succeed eventually.

168
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,800
Don't get stuck

169
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,180
in a rut.

170
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,940
How can you still be smiling?

171
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,490
Have you turned foolish?

172
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,700
You're

173
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,100
the foolish one.

174
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,490
You succeeded!

175
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,300
You succeeded!

176
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,340
Yet you scared me.

177
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,320
Give it back.

178
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,970
I won't endure such losses.

179
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,540
Shopkeeper,

180
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,100
congratulations.

181
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:13,710
Oh, my.

182
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,510
The last one like this

183
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,850
was Mrs. Cui.

184
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,800
This time,

185
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,700
it's Cui, the widower.

186
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,460
(Cui Mansion)

187
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:28,710
Honey.

188
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,300
He has a new bride.

189
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,600
No wonder he's been cleaning

190
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,160
and making new arrangements recently.

191
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,350
Yes. How long has it been since then?

192
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,580
- Indeed.
- Men are all unreliable.

193
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:43,940
He deserves his leg injury.

194
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:45,950
Such a jerk.

195
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,300
How unlucky.

196
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,550
This house is truly cursed.

197
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,290
- Listen, listen.
- I heard

198
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,840
- That's me.
- the last wife

199
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,310
was taken by mountain bandits.

200
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,700
- How do you feel?
- We don't know if she is alive.

201
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,300
- That is indeed a light curse.
- Mr. Cui is remarrying.

202
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,680
How does this new bride

203
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,250
compare to the previous one?

204
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,190
Mrs...

205
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,630
Mrs. Cui.

206
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,470
Ladies,

207
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,010
you still love to joke.

208
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,240
It's all a misunderstanding.

209
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,250
You're back.

210
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:27,880
Madam.

211
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,280
- Madam.
- Nanny Li.

212
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,340
Madam is back.

213
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,070
Madam.

214
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,970
I knew it.

215
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,820
The bond between us isn't over.

216
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,340
In the past,

217
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,580
- I...
- Nanny Li.

218
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,890
Don't dwell on the past.

219
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,730
Thank you, Madam.

220
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,590
Even with me away for so long,

221
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:06,630
the house is still so orderly.

222
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,550
Madam, Nanny Li asked us

223
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,750
to rearrange everything

224
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,830
inside and out.

225
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,490
She's been very busy these days.

226
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,920
With a capable and efficient nanny like you,

227
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,490
how could I not return?

228
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,040
Madam, are you hungry?

229
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,870
I'll cook for you right away.

230
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,870
Come on, Bicao. Come on.

231
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,560
You go prepare as well.

232
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,400
Hurry up.

233
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,470
Quickly.

234
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,700
Why does no one

235
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,200
care about me?

236
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,470
You've learned to eavesdrop now.

237
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,960
Once the vixen next door comes back,

238
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,110
you lose your manners, huh?

239
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,390
- Come down here.
- Dear, dear.

240
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,730
- I'm coming.
- The courtyard

241
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,460
- is as usual.
- You didn't tell me.

242
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,610
As usual.

243
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,460
The new year is better than the old.

244
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,320
With their hair bound,

245
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,770
the couple will grow old together.

246
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,110
I want to give this

247
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,680
as a meeting gift to my sister-in-law.

248
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,160
It's also to fulfill

249
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,370
the affection I have with Xingzhou.

250
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,700
You silly child.

251
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,340
How could I bear it?

252
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,700
What's wrong with you?

253
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,800
I see you two are like

254
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,770
mother and daughter.

255
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,010
But from today on,

256
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,890
you'll be separated.

257
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,970
What are you saying?

258
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,350
I watched Binglan grow up.

259
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,400
Even if she can't marry Xingzhou,

260
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,890
I still care for her.

261
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,850
Can't marry him?

262
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,460
Back then,

263
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,770
when Binglan was bedridden,

264
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,830
Xingzhou seized the chance
to break off the engagement.

265
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:39,920
I know

266
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,250
you feel guilty about it.

267
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,160
I'm worried you will try to make up for it

268
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,490
by making Binglan a princess.

269
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,820
That's quite inappropriate.

270
00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:55,130
Mother is confused with worry.

271
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,830
She's afraid that the Princess,

272
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,130
with her wealth and pride,

273
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,940
might make it hard for me

274
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,100
in Zhenzhou

275
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,340
because of my past with Xingzhou.

276
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,500
Don't worry.

277
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,200
Now,

278
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,230
Xingzhou is no longer

279
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,230
with those charming women

280
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,610
from Lingquan Town.

281
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,370
Princess Huaisang.

282
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,100
Though I haven't heard of her,

283
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,020
she is most likely

284
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,380
a newly esteemed lady with merit.

285
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:25,700
She's from a well-mannered family.

286
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,620
She won't make things difficult for you.

287
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,860
Sister,

288
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,980
why don't you

289
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,100
bring Binglan into the mansion?

290
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,260
Binglan is a fine young lady.

291
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,540
Why would she give up her position

292
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,580
as a main wife

293
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,500
to become a concubine?

294
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,580
No, no. That's not what I meant.

295
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,100
What I meant was

296
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,420
if the Princess is reasonable,

297
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,140
you should raise Binglan to be the main wife.

298
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,300
She won't refuse.

299
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,420
Well.

300
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,340
Aunt,

301
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,820
everyone knows I'm with Xingzhou here.

302
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,020
Besides him,

303
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,220
who else could I marry?

304
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,700
Then...

305
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,740
Consort Dowager,

306
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,500
the Lord's letter.

307
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,460
Xingzhou's letter has arrived.

308
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,660
Look, here it comes.

309
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,620
Mother.

310
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,980
We should go.

311
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,140
It's fine.

312
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,460
We're all family.

313
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,220
Manager Gao, read it.

314
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,060
Yes.

315
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,460
Mother, are you alright?

316
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:36,900
Manager Gao.

317
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,940
I know you're reading the letter for Mother.

318
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,700
You and the other people should leave.

319
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:45,260
Mother will read it alone.

320
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,020
What are you waiting for?

321
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:53,860
Go now.

322
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,700
Yes.

323
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,340
You all leave too.

324
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,660
Sister.

325
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,220
We're family.

326
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,060
Mother.

327
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,660
The Princess and I have arrived in Zhenzhou.

328
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,420
This is to inform you of our safety

329
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,580
and to ease your worries.

330
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,420
To explain about the Princess:

331
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:25,100
Her name is Liu Miantang.

332
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,740
Her ancestral home is Beizhou County.

333
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,580
Other people?

334
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,820
What's the matter?

335
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,220
Marrying the Princess,

336
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,420
he's forgotten all the folks

337
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,500
in Zhenzhou.

338
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,620
- Mother.
- Mrs. Lian.

339
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,460
Mrs. Lian.

340
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,820
Actually, I read

341
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,500
that letter a bit more.

342
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,420
What did the Lord say?

343
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,700
He said he was staying in Lingquan Town

344
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,980
to announce the marriage

345
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,300
to the people of Zhenzhou

346
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,420
before he came back.

347
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,980
He won't return yet.

348
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,820
And...

349
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,660
And?

350
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,420
Miantang offered strategies for the Xizhou war.

351
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,500
The Emperor, impressed by her hard work,

352
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,060
bestowed her the title of Princess Huaisang.

353
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,900
I'm increasingly devoted to her.

354
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,620
I love and respect her.

355
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,140
In this life, I will only marry her.

356
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:19,420
With her in this life is enough.

357
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,660
Thank you, Mrs. Lian.

358
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,550
If that mistress marries him,

359
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,580
she won't allow you in the mansion.

360
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,340
Let alone being a main wife.

361
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,460
To identify a mistress?

362
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,100
You three need

363
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,980
to claim to be neighbors from North Street.

364
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,460
In front of those noble families,

365
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,700
identify Ms. Liu
from Yushao Porcelain Shop

366
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,940
and tell them she's been kept

367
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,220
by the Lord in Lingquan Town for a year.

368
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,340
This...

369
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,500
Are you really going to sleep there?

370
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:10,020
Without the proper ceremony,

371
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,500
sharing a bed

372
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,020
is too much.

373
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,180
I don't know Lord Huaiyang.

374
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,780
I didn't expect him to be a man

375
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:19,180
of propriety and rules.

376
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,140
May I ask

377
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,940
what kind of person Cui Jiu was

378
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,140
who once shared my bed?

379
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,140
Yes.

380
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,300
Who is he?

381
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,660
How can you think of him like that?

382
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:31,700
Let's sleep.

383
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,700
Aren't you going to sleep there?

384
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,100
I've changed my mind.

385
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,260
Rogue.

386
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,540
Who's the rogue?

387
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,020
First, you mocked me.

388
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,540
Then, you left me hanging.

389
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,580
You're the rogue.

390
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,820
Without proper ceremony,

391
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,940
you overstepped.

392
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,700
Fine.

393
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,660
Let's sleep.

394
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:22,980
Your kiss back.

395
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,100
We're even now.

396
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,660
I want to hold another village banquet.

397
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,660
To catch thieves again?

398
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,020
Is that my only strategy?

399
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,220
If I set up a feast every time there's a thief,

400
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,700
all the people in Zhenzhou

401
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,140
will become outlaws.

402
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,780
Then why have a village banquet?

403
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,140
I feel that we

404
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,540
have been through so much,

405
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,700
going around in circles,

406
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,620
and ending up here.

407
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,220
I want to make up for past regrets.

408
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,300
Let you present yourself properly

409
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,580
to start afresh.

410
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,060
I think I've said this before.

411
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:05,900
But

412
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,060
this time,

413
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,260
I'm serious.

414
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,140
I trust you.

415
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,460
Fellow villagers.

416
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,460
Fellow villagers.

417
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,300
Alright.

418
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,140
Everyone, quiet down.

419
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,770
Let me say a few words.

420
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,620
I've been troubling everyone

421
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,740
in Lingquan Town

422
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,220
for a while now.

423
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,060
I've caused you all some trouble.

424
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,820
Today, enjoy your food and drink.

425
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,380
I'll start with a drink.

426
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,580
Good, good, good.

427
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:05,820
Great!

428
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,380
But,

429
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,220
villagers,

430
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,300
is one drink enough?

431
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,660
At least ten drinks.

432
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,340
- Right?
- Right.

433
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,460
Ten drinks.

434
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,820
Ten drinks.

435
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:19,700
Come on.

436
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:20,900
Eat up.

437
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,500
Madam,

438
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,380
look at the master.

439
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,660
He's never been like this.

440
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,100
Aren't you going to do something?

441
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,180
He's always been so reserved.

442
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,300
I'm actually glad to see him

443
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,460
let loose for once.

444
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,260
Mr. Cui,

445
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,660
no wonder you've made a name
for yourself in the army.

446
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,100
You're truly impressive.

447
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:37,940
Yes.

448
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,980
We were blind before.

449
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,860
You know?

450
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,820
Ms. Liu

451
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,860
is a true heroine.

452
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,780
How could she marry a dandy?

453
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,060
Yes, yes, yes.

454
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,660
- Come on.
- Fellow villagers.

455
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,180
I'd like

456
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,340
to propose another toast.

457
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,700
Actually,

458
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,860
I am...

459
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,260
You are actually

460
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,140
quite afraid

461
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,780
of your wife.

462
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,980
She always

463
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:21,540
had him under control.

464
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,820
He'd been holding back

465
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,220
his frustration,

466
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:28,380
which is why he joined the army.

467
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,660
I

468
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,780
live next door to him.

469
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,980
I hear

470
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,660
their arguments

471
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,540
clearly.

472
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,500
Honey, you're drunk.

473
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,140
Sorry, everyone.

474
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,380
Too much to drink.

475
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,580
Sorry, sorry.

476
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,140
Cui!

477
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,380
Even if you run to the ends of the earth,

478
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,700
you'll still be kicked back

479
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,460
by your tiger at home.

480
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,460
Zhang.

481
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,580
He's wrong.

482
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:09,140
My wife is gentle and virtuous.

483
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,980
If there's someone to blame,

484
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,020
it is

485
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,140
my fault.

486
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,020
I'm Wen Shisan from Zhenzhou Army Camp.

487
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,220
Greetings, My Lord.

488
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,300
Come on.

489
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,860
Get up, get up, get up.

490
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,100
You...

491
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,060
What are you talking about?

492
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,580
You must be drunk.

493
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,540
There's no lord here.

494
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,460
Yes.

495
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,580
Who's the Lord here?

496
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,180
I'm Aide Huang.

497
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,660
A squad leader under my command

498
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,220
once had the honor

499
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,900
of meeting the Lord in battle.

500
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,620
This

501
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,740
is Lord Huaiyang.

502
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,100
Lord Huaiyang.

503
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:02,980
Lord Huaiyang.

504
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,100
The Lord led from the front,

505
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,660
risking his life with us.

506
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,500
We would never mistake him.

507
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:09,900
Lord Huaiyang.

508
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,060
You've caused trouble.

509
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,300
Quickly, kneel!

510
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,460
Forgive me, My Lord. Forgive me.

511
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,940
Come on. Get up. Get up.

512
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:17,980
Get up.

513
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,100
It's alright.

514
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,660
I am

515
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,700
indeed Lord Huaiyang.

516
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,900
It's truly Lord Huaiyang.

517
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,540
Greetings, My Lord.

518
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,060
Everyone, no need for formalities.

519
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,380
No formalities, no formalities.

520
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:34,540
Disguised as a merchant,

521
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:36,620
I've been staying in Lingquan Town.

522
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,060
I had

523
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,820
official duties.

524
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,260
I had no choice but to do so.

525
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:42,700
The matter is resolved.

526
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,380
I wanted to take this opportunity

527
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,660
to reveal the truth to everyone.

528
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,380
I have

529
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,740
troubled all of you.

530
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,620
No, no, no.

531
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,020
I just want to apologize

532
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,220
to everyone here.

533
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,300
Sorry.

534
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,100
This is unacceptable.

535
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,260
We can't accept that.

536
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,660
You're a lord.

537
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,660
Then Mrs. Cui must be...

538
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,580
She's the future Princess of Huaiyang.

539
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,900
Greetings, My Lady.

540
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,580
No need for formalities.

541
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,100
My wife and I have received care

542
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,820
from everyone for a long time.

543
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,780
We are truly grateful.

544
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,060
It should be us thanking you.

545
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,780
Calling me your wife now?

546
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,580
Everyone, don't be too polite.

547
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,540
Raise your glasses.

548
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:43,940
Today,

549
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,700
please drink

550
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,060
with us.

551
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,340
Enjoy the feast.

552
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,220
Alright.

553
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:56,340
I'd like to drink this toast with you both.

554
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,140
Wishing the Lord

555
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,940
and the Princess

556
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,300
years of flourishing flowers

557
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,780
and family reunions year after year.

558
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,980
Well said!

559
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,500
Good! Good!

560
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,220
To the Lord and the Princess.

561
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,340
Let's drink together.

562
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,340
Come on.

563
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,660
Let's drink.

564
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,980
I didn't know before

565
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,500
that you enjoy lively occasions

566
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,180
and can drink so well.

567
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,260
Housewarming

568
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,140
is to congratulate on the new home.

569
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,660
This isn't the Lord's mansion.

570
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,260
Where's your home?

571
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,220
A place of the heart.

572
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:37,740
Xingzhou,

573
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,100
you've changed.

574
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,140
You've become more amicable.

575
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,900
It seems Mother has read the letter.

576
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:49,900
She agreed.

577
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,220
If not,

578
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,220
would I come here for a drink?

579
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,700
You are Mother's only legitimate son.

580
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,700
In the end, she values you.

581
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:58,820
Tomorrow,

582
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:01,060
bring Princess Huaisang into the mansion.

583
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,860
Such days

584
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,860
won't come again, right?

585
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:20,140
In the future, neighbors will avoid me.

586
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,260
It will be quiet.

587
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,780
I never noticed you were

588
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:54,940
so childish before.

589
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,660
Let me tell you a secret.

590
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,740
What secret?

591
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,900
I'm afraid of the dark.

592
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,180
You're afraid of the dark?

593
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,140
When I was young, walking at night,

594
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,900
I always needed Uncle to follow me.

595
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,460
One time, Uncle scared me

596
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,420
and quietly left.

597
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,260
I turned around and no one was there.

598
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,260
I cried all night.

599
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,700
Later, in Mount Yang,

600
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,660
the nights there

601
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,380
were darker than anywhere I'd seen.

602
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,380
But I always had to walk at the back,

603
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:30,460
because I became a reliable person for others.

604
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,660
How long since we came back

605
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,860
from the banquet?

606
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,660
How could you cheat on me?

607
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:42,590
Nonsense.

608
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:44,130
That's just a mason repairing walls.

609
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,400
Repairing walls?

610
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,260
What wall fell that needed repair in the dark?

611
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:50,620
Is it the wall in my backyard?

612
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,940
It's the wall in the backyard.

613
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,820
Look at the Cui family next door.

614
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,420
Their wall was patched by the man.

615
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:57,100
- Praising me.
- And he's the Lord.

616
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:57,940
Unlike you,

617
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,180
staying at home every day.

618
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,420
You won't help with a bottle.

619
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,260
Yes, yes, yes.

620
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,860
Of course, he can do everything.

621
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,420
He's the Lord.

622
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,380
Yes, he's the Lord.

623
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,540
You must be scared out of your wits.

624
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,220
It's so late.

625
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,580
Are you going to let anyone rest?

626
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,700
Whose handkerchief is behind the wall?

627
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,940
Aren't you afraid of losing it?

628
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,180
Let's go check it out.

629
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,060
Who is it?

630
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,340
Who is it?

631
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:43,980
Isn't it your handkerchief?

632
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:44,820
No, no, no.

633
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,180
This isn't mine.

634
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,820
Where is your handkerchief?

635
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,420
Still denying it?

636
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,300
Did you climb the wall

637
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,780
to secretly meet that woman?

638
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,980
Explain yourself clearly.

639
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,500
Come with me. Let's go.

640
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,660
Suddenly, I have a feeling.

641
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:02,860
What feeling?

642
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,180
Cui Jiu

643
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,860
seems to have returned.

644
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,220
Let's go home.

645
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,660
Let's go.

646
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,460
Your Majesty.

647
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,220
Prince Lu

648
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,940
has just sent a wooden box.

649
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,580
Inside is the head

650
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,260
of Zhang Dingshen from the Ministry of War.

651
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,700
I am aware.

652
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,660
Have a grand burial for Mr. Zhang

653
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,620
and heavily compensate his family.

654
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,500
The rebels have advanced

655
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,340
into the neighboring county,

656
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,580
attacking the canal.

657
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,820
Your Majesty, regarding the canal transport,

658
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,820
we should send a good general to strategize.

659
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,980
Is there a candidate for the commander?

660
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,820
Minister Shi.

661
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:17,340
He has considerable prestige

662
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,820
in the army.

663
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:20,980
The rebels' marching routes

664
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,700
and the troops of Ji and Lu states

665
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,340
are also under his command.

666
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,820
We can concentrate these two armies

667
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,460
in the Hebei Camp.

668
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,820
However,

669
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,260
the day of confrontation with the enemy

670
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,380
will need to be delayed.

671
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:40,900
Zhenzhou.

672
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,220
Zhenzhou?

673
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,940
Lord Huaiyang

674
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:52,140
pacified the lords of Youzhou and Beizhou.

675
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,820
He has just returned to Zhenzhou

676
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:54,860
and is also injured.

677
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,340
I heard that Zhenzhou

678
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,780
is now decorated with lanterns and banners

679
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,020
celebrating the coming event.

680
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,540
If Your Majesty orders him to lead the army,

681
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,380
Zhenzhou might...

682
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,460
The rebels are going north.

683
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,620
They won't reach Zhenzhou.

684
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,580
Lord Huaiyang doesn't need defense.

685
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:11,140
Order Ji and Lu to support
and encircle the rebels.

686
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:14,420
Yes.

687
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,420
The Princess is bestowed by the Emperor,

688
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,070
proving our mansion's favor

689
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:20,730
remains strong.

690
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,820
Our second and third branches

691
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,540
also benefit from it.

692
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,900
Yes, yes.

693
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,380
The Lord and the Princess are a perfect match.

694
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,730
How could the Consort Dowager not be satisfied?

695
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:31,800
Indeed.

696
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,780
A pheasant thinks it's a phoenix

697
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:38,010
just because of a feather.

698
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,020
Once you pass this door,

699
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,300
there's no room for regret or fear.

700
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,700
Who is afraid?

701
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:56,900
Princess,

702
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,100
please.

703
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,340
The Lord has arrived.

704
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,020
Greetings, Mother.

705
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,620
Greetings, everyone.

706
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:22,540
I'm Liu Miantang. Greetings, Consort Dowager.

707
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,180
Greetings, elders.

708
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,500
Sorry to have worried you, Mother.

709
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,100
I'm doing well.

710
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,420
Not just well.

711
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,620
Xingzhou is now in the limelight.

712
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,940
As an aunt,

713
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,940
I feel honored.

714
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,380
Yes, our family could rise

715
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,180
largely thanks to my nephew Xingzhou.

716
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,620
The tea has gone cold waiting

717
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:57,300
for the guest from the capital.

718
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,140
You haven't married,

719
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,500
yet you kept your mother waiting.

720
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,620
Princess, serve tea

721
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,060
to the Consort Dowager

722
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,620
and apologize.

723
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,740
If it's troublesome,

724
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,460
then don't bother.

725
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,820
I'm a junior.

726
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:13,740
It's not troublesome

727
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:14,900
to serve tea to elders.

728
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,780
Consort Dowager, have some tea.

729
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,980
Princess, what do you mean?

730
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,980
Mother, are you alright?

731
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,420
Princess,

732
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,740
you're so careless.

733
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,300
Mother's hand is scalded.

734
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,700
She probably can't even lift her chopsticks.

735
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,700
It's not that serious.

736
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,620
I was careless.

737
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,980
Consort Dowager, please rest.

738
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,500
Let me serve you the dishes.

739
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,740
Consort Dowager, please enjoy.

740
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,380
Everyone, please take a seat.

741
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,380
I'm fine standing.

742
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,460
What do you mean by that?

743
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:24,060
If this gets out,

744
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:26,180
people will think I'm bullying you.

745
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,300
How are you bullying her?

746
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,140
You haven't hit or scolded her.

747
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,420
How is this bullying?

748
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,260
Would you guys say that my mother

749
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:34,500
is bullying her daughter-in-law?

750
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,620
That's not what I meant.

751
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,460
Mother, Mother.

752
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,740
I understand.

753
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,540
Miantang knows too.

754
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,100
She is filial

755
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,140
and worries about your hand.

756
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,260
Miantang,

757
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,220
you don't know

758
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,500
how much my mother suffered

759
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,660
from my grandmother.

760
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:53,900
When she was carrying me,

761
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:56,500
she went for morning
and evening greetings every day,

762
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,260
not daring to show any disobedience.

763
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,140
I've always heard the Lord talk

764
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,740
about your hardships.

765
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,460
As the saying goes,

766
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,860
hardships make a mother-in-law

767
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,290
who can enjoy peace.

768
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,620
Now my mother

769
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,860
has become a mother-in-law.

770
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,460
Relatives, bear witness.

771
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,070
I swear here

772
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,940
that I will not side

773
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,060
with my wife in the future.

774
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,460
I won't let my mother

775
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,140
suffer unjustly.

776
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,420
If I break this oath,

777
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,740
I'll ask for punishment.

778
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:29,820
I will follow your example

779
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,660
and respect you with morning
and evening greetings.

780
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,420
Mother,

781
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,300
I've found a good

782
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,700
daughter-in-law for you.

783
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,780
Even before marriage,

784
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,700
she already regards you as a model.

785
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,620
Why is everyone standing around?

786
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:56,100
It's my oversight.

787
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,340
Miantang

788
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,260
is the Princess.

789
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,060
She hasn't even sat down.

790
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,180
How can you all overstep the rules?

791
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:04,230
Come on.

792
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,020
Sit down, everyone.

793
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:11,470
Princess.

794
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,780
With the Emperor's conferment,

795
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:20,060
you must have notable officials in your family.

796
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,020
May I ask who your father is?

797
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,300
My parents passed away early.

798
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,020
My grandfather was an escort in Beizhou.

799
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,580
No one in my family is an official.

800
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:31,140
Without the protection
of your father and brothers,

801
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,820
having a supportive husband is the same.

802
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,980
As soon as Xingzhou was honored in Beizhou,

803
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:40,020
the decree
for the Princess's conferment followed.

804
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,260
Sister,

805
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,580
you truly have double happiness coming.

806
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,140
The Princess helped the Emperor.

807
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,940
It sounds from Aunt's words

808
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,580
as if all the rewards

809
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,260
were requested by me.

810
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,940
I only feel

811
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,740
that the Princess looks familiar.

812
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,060
I wonder

813
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,380
where we've met before.

814
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,220
Enough.

815
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:04,740
I haven't met Xingzhou

816
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,940
for a long time.

817
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,500
I remember now.

818
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,060
Princess, did you use

819
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,060
to do business in Lingquan Town?

820
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,820
I heard

821
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,220
in Lingquan Town,

822
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,220
the Lord had a...

823
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,060
Consort Dowager,

824
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:22,380
there are commoners outside
who wish to see the Princess.

825
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,700
Can't you see we're dining?

826
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,180
We won't see them.

827
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,260
Aunt, you should meet them.

828
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,260
The Princess is new to Zhenzhou

829
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,540
but popular among the people.

830
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,100
It's a blessing for our family.

831
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,420
If there's something urgent,

832
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:37,740
Xingzhou

833
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,500
can help decide.

834
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:59,500
Greetings, My Lord, Consort Dowager,

835
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,820
Princess.

836
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:04,500
The Princess is new to Zhenzhou,

837
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,660
and you're here for her.

838
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:09,340
Do you know her?

839
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,180
I do.

840
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:11,980
The Princess is Ms. Liu.

841
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,260
Presumptuous!

842
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,900
How dare you call her Ms. Liu?

843
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:18,980
What's your purpose in coming here?

844
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,460
Explain clearly.

845
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:21,860
I...

846
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,180
I'm here to thank

847
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:25,460
the Princess for saving my husband.

848
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,380
My husband

849
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:29,460
used to be a soldier under the Lord.

850
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,220
When Ms. Liu was trading

851
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,860
and supporting the Jinjia Pass,

852
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,420
she not only generously donated funds,

853
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,340
but also gave my husband life-saving medicine.

854
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:39,140
She even helped manage the Relatives' Village.

855
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,420
Without you,

856
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:41,380
my husband

857
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,460
would've been left to die in the wilderness.

858
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:45,260
Nonsense!

859
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:47,660
Throw this troublesome woman out!

860
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:49,820
How do you know she's talking nonsense?

861
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:53,120
You let her explain

862
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,340
but wanted to throw her out now.

863
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:56,620
The outsiders

864
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:58,260
might think the Lord's mansion belongs

865
00:42:58,540 --> 00:42:59,620
to the Lian family.

866
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,980
Hearing the Princess had arrived in Zhenzhou,

867
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:04,860
everyone

868
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:07,100
specially entrusted us to express their thanks.

869
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:08,700
The Lord and the Princess

870
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:09,940
are a perfect match,

871
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:11,220
one fighting in the front

872
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:12,980
and the other securing the rear.

873
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,260
We common people

874
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:16,420
have longed for such a Princess.

875
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:18,940
Come on, old lady.

876
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:20,700
Everyone, please rise.

877
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:21,540
Thank you, My Lord.

878
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:23,820
Miantang

879
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:26,420
has just done a small part.

880
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:27,780
Right, Miantang?

881
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:32,220
So, the Huaisang Princess and Xingzhou

882
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:33,900
have this kind of connection.

883
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,300
The Princess is so well-liked by the people.

884
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:37,620
You and Xingzhou

885
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:38,940
are truly a good match.

886
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:40,260
Listen.

887
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:41,860
Xingdi has said

888
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:42,940
we're a good match.

889
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:44,940
Today,

890
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,180
I'll take this opportunity

891
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:48,020
to arrange the wedding.

892
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:49,660
Next month,

893
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,420
we'll choose a date for the wedding.

894
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,060
Congratulations to the Lord.

895
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,540
