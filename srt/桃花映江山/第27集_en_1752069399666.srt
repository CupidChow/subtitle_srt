Episode 16

6
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Zhan Lu.

7
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
My lord.

8
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Go and keep an eye on Qing Feng in Mu Wuying's mansion.

9
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Get him here and interrogate him.

10
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Qing Feng?

11
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The blood marks on the scene of the crime

12
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
are the same as those of the Peach Blossom Blood Enforcer.

13
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I've disposed of it in Third Prince's mansion.

14
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's a custom-made item.

15
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Second Prince's death may be related to Third Prince.

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Qing Feng is Mu Wuying's confidant.

17
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
We must get rid of him.

18
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But I'm afraid that just by the blood marks...

19
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
That's enough.

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Meng Huarui's case is over.

21
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But Mu Wuying wants to use this to frame Fourth Prince.

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I have to settle it with him.

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Go.

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
On the night of Second Prince's death,

25
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
someone saw you enter the Spring Moon Tower.

26
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You've been hiding in the dark.

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
When Meng Huarui left,

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Second Prince was only injured.

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Third Prince arranged for you to kill him.

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I was right.

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
If you don't confess,

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Third Prince can afford to bear

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
the consequences of your death.

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm innocent.

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I really don't know.

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Prime Minister,

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I've lost my job.

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Qing Feng committed suicide.

39
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Qing Feng is dead.

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Only the heavens and the earth know about this.

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You know about it and I know about it.

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
How would Mu Wuying know about it?

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm innocent.

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm innocent.

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I didn't kill Second Prince.

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
He killed himself.

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm innocent.

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Meng Huarui.

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
First Miss,

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I beg you.

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I beg you.

52
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm innocent, First Miss.

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Please save me.

54
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'll be your mother's maid.

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I beg you.

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I beg you.

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I have my parents.

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Please save me, First Miss.

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
My father is weak and my mother is sick.

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
They can't let the people they love go to waste.

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
They're all members of the Meng family.

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I won't let them down.

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Don't worry.

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Thank you, First Miss.

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Thank you, First Miss.

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Thank you, First Miss.

67
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Brother,

68
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
the moon you saw that day

69
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
was as strange as tonight.

70
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Meng family is so big.

71
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It can't fill up as many lives as it can.

72
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
But it's very small.

73
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
When I saw you leave,

74
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I thought it was no longer home.

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I thought it was no longer home.

76
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But it's very small.

77
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I thought it was no longer home.

78
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I thought it was no longer home.

79
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Don't worry.

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You have to protect the Meng family even if you have to sacrifice your life.

81
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I will protect you to the end.

82
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Summon Meng Youxiang to the front.

83
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm not a good steward.

84
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You're so rude to the Meng family.

85
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
How dare you buy the exam?

86
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Please punish me.

87
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm willing to

88
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
resign myself to the position of chief examiner.

89
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'll retire and return to my hometown.

90
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'll retire and return to my hometown.

91
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'll retire and return to my hometown.

92
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I hope you can allow me.

93
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You said the same thing when Huaijin made a mistake.

94
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You said you would resign twice a year.

95
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I think you can't hold the official seal well.

96
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The Meng family is the first family in the Great Qi.

97
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
There are many people in the family.

98
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
There are inevitably some unfilial children.

99
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm old.

100
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I know I'm busy with official affairs.

101
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I will not be afraid of anything.

102
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yes.

103
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Your family is the first family in the Great Qi.

104
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
There are many people in the family.

105
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Officials climb up.

106
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
They can't avoid your family.

107
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
For a hundred years,

108
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
whoever is the king will depend on your family.

109
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I definitely dare not.

110
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Actually, it doesn't matter to you

111
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
if you're the first family in the Great Qi.

112
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
But have you ever thought

113
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
if you're no longer the first family in the Meng family,

114
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
do you think the Qin family and the Duan family

115
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
will let you rest in the future

116
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
or kill you

117
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
so that your family will have no chance to rise again?

118
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Meng Zhongyan,

119
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
so this Xiang Yin,

120
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
do you accept it or not?

121
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's up to you.

122
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Shen Zaiye,

123
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
you dare to arrest my people in broad daylight?

124
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Third Prince is the first son of the Great Qi.

125
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Third Prince, please calm down.

126
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
On the day of the second prince's death,

127
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
someone saw Qingfeng in Chunyue Brothel.

128
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
There are also Qingfeng's footprints in the secret room.

129
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Second Prince,

130
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm here to buy jade pendant.

131
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Get out.

132
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I know that jade pendant is a good thing.

133
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I also know that you've sold a lot of people.

134
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You...

135
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You have to sell it if you don't sell it today.

136
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'll see what you can buy.

137
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'll buy it.

138
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
The footprints left in the secret room

139
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
are also the same as Qingfeng's.

140
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
But please rest assured, Your Highness.

141
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Since Qingfeng is your confidant,

142
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I will treat him well.

143
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Treat him well?

144
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You're using torture, aren't you?

145
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Yes.

146
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Qingfeng knows a lot.

147
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You're really going to use torture?

148
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Whether it's going to use torture or not,

149
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
we both said it.

150
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
His Majesty said it.

151
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Since the crown prince fell off the horse,

152
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
His Majesty only has three princes.

153
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
If he knows that

154
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Third Prince killed the second prince

155
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
and then gave the fourth prince the throne,

156
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I wonder how cruel His Majesty is.

157
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You really want to go back on your word

158
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
and regret it

159
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
and let the peach blossom die?

160
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I did promise Meng family

161
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
not to pursue this case.

162
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
But I haven't said

163
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
my conditions to you.

164
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
What else do you want?

165
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I want Third Prince to

166
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
withdraw from the imperial examination.

167
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I thought you would continue

168
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
to ask me for the root solution.

169
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Do you have

170
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
such an important thing?

171
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
So,

172
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
you'd better do something

173
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
that you can do.

174
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Wenjin,

175
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
remove the ring from the fourth prince's ring.

176
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Continue to be the chief of the imperial examination.

177
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Your Majesty,

178
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
you asked the third prince

179
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
to be the chief of the imperial examination with the fourth prince.

180
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Now you want two chiefs to be the ministers.

181
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I forgot.

182
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Two chiefs in the imperial examination.

183
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
If the crown prince is to be the teacher,

184
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
it will be troublesome.

185
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Father, don't worry.

186
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I am willing to withdraw from this imperial examination.

187
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Withdraw?

188
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It's a good job

189
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
that many people can't expect.

190
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Why?

191
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Father,

192
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I was too confused before.

193
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I just

194
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
wanted to help you.

195
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Besides, you know

196
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm not here.

197
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And the fourth brother

198
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
is a little higher than me

199
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
in both academic and financial matters.

200
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Among many students,

201
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
he has a good reputation.

202
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It's right for the fourth brother

203
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
to be the official.

204
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It seems that the study is successful.

205
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I am very glad

206
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
that the world is not in a dispute.

207
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Father, you flatter me.

208
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I'll leave first.

209
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Your Highness.

210
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Qingfeng's spirit uncle

211
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
has been sent back to the mansion.

212
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Prime Minister has selected

213
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
the best official for him.

214
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Prime Minister asked me to

215
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
pay him a visit.

216
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Qingfeng's son

217
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
is also a little regretful.

218
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Shen Zaiye,

219
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
you blocked my way today.

220
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
In the future,

221
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I will make him

222
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
your sword.

223
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'll be back.

224
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
This is for you.

225
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Qingtai left Daqi Hospital.

226
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I don't know

227
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
if he is safe

228
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
to reach the star state of Beiyuan.

229
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Did you find Changjue?

230
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
How is Changjue doing?

231
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
How far is it

232
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
from the star state of Beiyuan?

233
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Not far.

234
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Just walk out of the desert.

235
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Is there a military camp

236
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
in Beiyuan nearby?

237
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I don't know.

238
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Don't worry, Your Highness.

239
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I will find Changjue.

240
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
If there is any change

241
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
in the valley,

242
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
it will become

243
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
the backbone and the backbone of Changjue.

244
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
If we can find out

245
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
the origin of the rain,

246
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
we may be able to

247
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
return to the main place.

248
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
But now there is no source of solitude.

249
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
We need to find an assistant.

250
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
The water is boiling.

251
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Why is Prime Minister Shen here?

252
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
The imperial examination is urgent.

253
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
If we don't pack up,

254
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
we may not make it in time.

255
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Besides, as an examiner,

256
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I can clean the place

257
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
and prevent people from

258
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
stealing the five coins.

259
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Thank you, Prime Minister Shen.

260
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It's my life's grace.

261
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

262
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You shouldn't be so cold.

263
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Gu Wu Xia,

264
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
don't just thank my brother.

265
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
This is the person

266
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
you should thank the most.

267
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,680
I'm relieved to see you safe and sound

268
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,680
Princess

269
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,520
You

270
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,960
You're still alive

271
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,680
Of course, Princess

272
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,240
I'm just pretending, okay?

273
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,080
But where have you been these days?

274
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,160
It's a long story

275
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,880
Don't ask so many questions here

276
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,840
You can't remember everything

277
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,600
We have something to do, right?

278
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,600
Let's go

279
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,840
Jiang Tau-hua, help my brother

280
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,440
How are you feeling after you went back that day?

281
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,960
I'm fine

282
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,240
Thank you for your concern

283
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,240
That's good

284
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,480
That's good

285
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,560
I have something to ask you to help me find out

286
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,920
What is it?

287
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,480
I overheard the Third Prince calling the Empress Lv as A'Hua

288
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,080
And the bracelet of the Empress Lv is also a treasure

289
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,440
I really don't understand the relationship between them

290
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,520
As far as I know, the Third Prince has never been out of the country

291
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,300
After the

292
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,560
Imperial Examination, she left the palace and moved to Shunjing Palace

293
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,800
I've never heard of a woman in the palace

294
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:18,960
When I was young, the Empress Lv had been in the North Court

295
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,960
She was in charge of the court

296
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,920
Since then, she should have no chance

297
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,040
to meet the Third Prince in the Great Qi

298
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,520
I sent a spy to investigate the Empress Lv secretly

299
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,920
Before she entered the palace in the North Court, she was so mysterious

300
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,280
She was a fraud

301
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,320
So I suspect that the Empress Lv was a member of the Great Qi Palace

302
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,160
I'll stay here during the Imperial Examination

303
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,520
But I'll send my men to investigate this matter carefully

304
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,800
Don't worry

305
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,680
No hurry. Thank you, Prime Minister Shen

306
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,200
After the Imperial Examination, I'll try to contact you

307
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,360
I'll leave now

308
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,280
What's going on between them?

309
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,280
Zi Yuan, don't listen to the court

310
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,040
My brother used so much effort to save you

311
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,040
You don't want to repay my brother

312
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,040
Do you have any conscience?

313
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,440
Do what you should do

314
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,840
I'll take care of the rest

315
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,840
I'll go back to the palace

316
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,840
I'll go back to the palace

317
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,840
I'll go back to the palace

318
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,840
I'll go back to the palace

319
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,840
I'll go back to the palace

320
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,360
Repay himер

321
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,520
warned

322
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,540
If this applies to one of my men,

323
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,560
you will have the best repayment

324
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,280
Prime Minister

325
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,560
Prime Minister

326
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,660
There's a big thing to find out about Doctor Bai

327
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,280
Be quick

328
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,840
which is extremely rare, yet bombastic

329
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,760
In fact, in daily consumption

330
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,300
it will only drop poison

331
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,600
and perish the toxic substance in the

332
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,960
windows around the date down

333
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,720
In my opinion, if the flower is poisoned

334
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,320
it may deliver a new life

335
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,620
Okay

336
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:21,920
Okay

337
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,600
Before you entered the palace

338
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,380
you had to wearactly

339
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,180
and

340
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,380
strictly check

341
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,380
there must be no fraud

342
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,380
in this case

343
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,380
If you find out

344
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,380
that Qin Hui is being bribed

345
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,380
you can tell me at any time

346
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,380
I have asked my father for the imperial edict

347
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,380
and found out that

348
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,380
the imperial edict was rejected

349
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:57,380
I think you all know

350
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,380
about the leak

351
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,380
in the previous examination

352
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,380
If this happens again

353
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,380
I have asked my father for the imperial edict

354
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,380
I will be the one

355
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,380
to give the question

356
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,380
You are wise, my Lord

357
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,380
Your Highness, you are a good lawyer

358
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,380
You are wise, my Lord

359
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,380
All the students, please enter

360
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,380
These Hanmen students

361
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,380
will be the future of our Qi

362
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,380
There will be no more

363
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,380
tragic events like Brother Jiao Han

364
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:41,380
in the future

365
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,380
The bright future

366
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,380
that Mr. Wei Ming expected

367
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,380
will come

368
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,380
You think he is your brother

369
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,380
Did he ever be close to you?

370
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,380
Although he is not

371
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,380
very close to me

372
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,380
he is not bad

373
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,380
in his daily life

374
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,380
It's normal

375
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,380
Are you serious?

376
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,380
Are you a child?

377
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,380
You are not young anymore

378
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,380
You should know your place

379
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,380
The one who takes the enemy

380
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,380
will never give up

381
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,380
until he is dead

382
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,380
If you don't give the order

383
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,380
you will be punished

384
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:39,380
Hua, you are so cruel

385
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,380
You are so cruel

386
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,380
You are so cruel

387
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,380
You are so cruel

388
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,380
You are so cruel

389
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,380
Hua, you are so cruel

390
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,380
I will not let you down this time

391
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,380
Go back to your home

392
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,380
Father, the park you saved

393
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,380
that year

394
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,380
is now in full bloom

395
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,380
In the future, Hanmen

396
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,380
will be the most important

397
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,380
in the court

398
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,380
Your wish

399
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,380
I have fulfilled

400
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,380
for you

401
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,380
One day

402
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,380
I will help the Xie family

403
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,380
Please rest assured

404
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,380
Go

405
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,380
Prime Minister

406
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,380
Prime Minister

407
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,380
During the period of the court's closing

408
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,380
You are so cruel

409
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,380
I played this song

410
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,380
for Mu Wu Xia

411
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,380
You are not qualified to listen

412
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,380
Shut your ears

413
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:07,380
Miss Qingying

414
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,380
Miss Qingying

415
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,380
Miss Qingying

416
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,380
During the period of the court's closing

417
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,380
You are playing music here

418
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,380
Is it inappropriate?

419
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,380
But I want to see you

420
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,380
You don't let me in

421
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,380
You have been working so hard recently

422
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,380
I can only play the zither outside

423
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,380
and let you relax

424
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,380
But

425
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,380
If you do this

426
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,380
you will disturb others

427
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,380
Okay

428
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,380
Wait a minute

429
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,380
How about this?

430
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,380
I will play a song with you

431
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,380
What do you think?

432
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,380
You can play the zither?

433
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,380
Okay

434
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,380
I will play a song with you

435
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,380
I will play the zither

436
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,380
Okay

437
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,380
I will play the zither

438
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,380
Okay

439
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,380
I will play the zither

440
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,380
Okay

441
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,380
I will play the zither

442
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,380
Okay

443
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,380
I will play the zither

444
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,380
Okay

445
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,380
I will play the zither

446
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,380
Okay

447
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,380
I will play the zither

448
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,380
Okay

449
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,380
I will play the zither

450
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,380
Okay

451
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,380
I will play the zither

452
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,380
Okay

453
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,380
Hey there

454
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,380
I'm here

455
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,380
Lord

456
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,380
People you asked to know

457
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,380
You have got some friends

458
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,540
was in the palace again

459
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,980
There was a maid by her side

460
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,060
Her name was Hua

461
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,860
Back then, the third prince

462
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,140
was killed by her

463
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,380
Princess Jinrong died of sudden illness

464
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:27,740
The servants

465
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,460
were unable to get close to her

466
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,060
Only Hua

467
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,220
was very different from the others

468
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,100
Get out

469
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,460
Get out

470
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,700
Why are you still here?

471
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:47,980
Your Highness

472
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,540
I'm here to take care of you

473
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,940
Sister takes care of me

474
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,300
What's your name?

475
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,900
My name is Hua

476
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:59,220
I don't know what that maid Hua is capable of

477
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,500
The third prince was unable to get close to her

478
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,740
But I don't know why

479
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,420
one day, she suddenly disappeared

480
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,900
There's another strange thing

481
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,180
When I was going to the Zongzheng Mansion

482
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,820
to check the records

483
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:18,060
I found that all the records about Hua

484
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,540
were missing

485
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:23,980
Thank you, Eunuch Wen

486
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,700
Shen Zaiye is so good

487
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,740
He's been in the dark for long

488
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,980
Who leaked the news about Hua?

489
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,060
Your Highness

490
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,660
I've been with you for years

491
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,140
I've never been betrayed by you

492
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,540
I can see it

493
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,940
These are the past between me and Hua

494
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,860
I've been hiding them for years

495
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,220
Hai Jue

496
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,940
Look here

497
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,460
Here

498
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:17,740
Thatbackground

499
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,220
It's not much

500
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,940
in the individual key

501
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,420
What is this?

502
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,620
How did Holy Master find out?

503
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:42,620
Could it be that Qing Feng told you before he died?

504
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:46,620
If Qing Feng told me about Hua before he died

505
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:51,620
Grand Master Shen wouldn't have let me quit the imperial examination.

506
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:57,620
Your Highness, do you still remember the fire at the Purple Garden?

507
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,620
Grand Master Shen came very quickly.

508
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,620
The peach blossoms haven't bloomed yet.

509
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:05,620
Does the peach blossoms know anything?

510
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,620
The peach blossoms...

511
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:20,620
If this peach blossom hadn't been for holding Shen Zai Yan back

512
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,620
I would have let him die.

513
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,620
Bring the peach blossoms here.

514
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,620
Yes.

515
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,620
I greet Your Highness.

516
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:45,620
Miss Mo'er, you haven't seen me in a few days.

517
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,620
You look so good.

518
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,620
With Your Highness's care,

519
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,620
the servants in the manor are all very good to me.

520
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:54,620
They are all very good to you.

521
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:57,620
So they let you roam around the manor.

522
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:01,620
So you know what you should know and what you shouldn't know.

523
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:04,620
You remember what you should remember and what you shouldn't remember.

524
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,620
Your Highness, how could you say that?

525
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:09,620
Mo'er and my brother's lives are in your hands.

526
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:13,620
Even if I remember anything, I will never betray you.

527
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:22,620
Your beautiful face is really like a ghost in my eyes.

528
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:27,620
If I slip up here and ruin your face

529
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:30,620
I will be the one who will be punished.

530
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:34,620
If I slip up here and ruin your face

531
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,620
do you think Shen Zai Yan will still love you and protect you?

532
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,620
What does Shen Zai Yan have to do with me?

533
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:46,620
I only pray that Your Highness can keep Chang Que and I safe for the rest of our lives.

534
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,620
If you want to save your life,

535
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:56,620
then use your own values

536
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,620
and let Shen Zai Yan be at ease.

537
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:03,620
Yes. I will go right now.

538
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:17,620
Your Highness, do you still believe him?

539
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:23,620
As long as the antidote and Jiang Chang Que are in my and A'Hua's hands,

540
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:28,620
then Jiang Tao Hua will never be able to turn into a wave.

541
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:33,620
He will always be Shen Zai Yan's weakness.

542
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:41,620
To avoid causing a disturbance, please stop investigating.

543
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,620
Does Third Prince suspect you?

544
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:48,620
Third Prince trusts me a lot now.

545
00:33:54,620 --> 00:34:00,620
By the way, did you receive the letter from Qingtai?

546
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:03,620
Qingtai? Didn't he go back to the North Campus to find his wife?

547
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,620
Why would he send a letter to the Prime Minister?

548
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:09,620
If he sent me a letter, he would only send it here.

549
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:15,620
He has already left Yue Yu, but there is no news of him.

550
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:19,620
I can take the letter for you, but you have to answer one question.

551
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,620
What is it?

552
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:23,620
What exactly did you ask Qingtai to do in the North Campus?

553
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,620
If you send her there to kill someone and set the fire,

554
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:29,620
I am not afraid of being implicated, but I need to be prepared.

555
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:34,620
I just asked Qingtai to help me go to the North Campus to find the whereabouts of Chang Que.

556
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,620
Please rest assured, Prime Minister.

557
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,620
Where is Chang Que?

558
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:42,620
This has nothing to do with you, right?

559
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:48,620
Speaking of Chang Que, I found a letter that he wrote to you.

560
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,620
I have put it back in its original place.

561
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,620
Do you still remember Ange?

562
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:08,620
It was Qingtai. Qingtai told me about it.

563
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,620
I am sorry.

564
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:18,620
If you want to find Chang Que,

565
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:22,620
maybe I can help you.

566
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,620
Dr. Bai is developing a method to reduce the number of bullets.

567
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:29,620
Once it succeeds, you will no longer be controlled by the bullet.

568
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,620
Thank you for your help, Prime Minister.

569
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,620
What do you want to write?

570
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:39,620
As the left prime minister,

571
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,620
I have all the wealth and fame.

572
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,620
What can I do?

573
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:47,620
How about we share a meal together?

574
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,620
What do you mean?

575
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,620
Nothing.

576
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,620
I just suddenly remembered

577
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:58,620
that we have never had a meal together without any thoughts.

578
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,620
Zhang Luo.

579
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,620
Prime Minister.

580
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,620
Inform the kitchen to prepare the ingredients.

581
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,620
I want to have some shrimps.

582
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:17,620
Prime Minister, do you want to steam them or sweet and sour?

583
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,620
I will inform them.

584
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,620
I will cook them myself.

585
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,620
I understand.

586
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,620
You did this for me.

587
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,620
I will taste it.

588
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,620
You are willing to cook with me?

589
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,620
You and I...

590
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,620
Prime Minister.

591
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,620
I can't smell the smoke.

592
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,620
Okay.

593
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,620
Wait for me here.

594
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:25,620
The leaves are in full bloom.

595
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,620
The flowers are blooming.

596
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,620
When the wind blows,

597
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:33,620
the flowers will be gone.

598
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,620
If so,

599
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,620
what will happen?

600
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,620
I don't know.

601
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:41,620
I don't know.

602
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,620
I don't know.

603
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,620
I don't know.

604
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,620
I don't know.

605
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:49,620
I don't know.

606
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,620
I don't know.

607
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,620
I will

608
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,620
send you out of the Bureau.

609
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:58,620
I will feel your love.

610
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:04,620
The moon and the sky are like a movie.

611
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,620
I want to be free.

612
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:13,620
No one can stop me.

613
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:18,620
Every year, you are by my side.

614
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:22,620
Time is short.

615
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:27,620
A momentary memory is like a long distance.

616
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:31,620
Your eyes.

617
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:35,620
The ink is like a knife.

618
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:39,620
It can cut through the black and white.

619
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:43,620
Even if it's a golden flower,

620
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:46,620
if you are by my side.

621
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:47,620
Zhang Lu.

622
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,620
Go to the Northern Plains and Xingzhou.

623
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,620
Find Qingtai and Changjue.

624
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,620
Qingtai is in the Northern Plains and Xingzhou?

625
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:56,620
Tao Hua sent Qingtai to find Changjue.

626
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:59,620
They are the two most important people.

627
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:02,620
There must be no accident.

628
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:04,620
But Prime Minister.

629
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,620
You have done so much for the princess.

630
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:09,620
She will not understand.

631
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,620
I don't need her to understand.

632
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:15,620
I will set out now.

633
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,620
Go.

634
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,620
Doctor Bai.

635
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,620
There is a miracle.

636
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:27,620
Prime Minister.

637
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:30,620
I use the acupuncture to reduce the toxicity.

638
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,620
I am taking the medicine to help with the blood.

639
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,620
One of the patients has not died for a month.

640
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,620
Where is it?

641
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,620
Take me to see.

642
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,620
Follow me.

643
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:41,620
The time is only the amount of the poison.

644
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:44,620
If you control the amount, you can use it to replenish the gas.

645
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:55,620
It seems that the acupuncture can only stop the time of the toxic gas.

646
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:59,620
Where is the toxic root of the peach-flavored elixir?

647
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,620
I will try another way.

648
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:05,620
I will go to the Northern Plains and Xingzhou.

649
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,620
I will try another way.

650
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,620
Doctor Bai.

651
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,620
I am developing the root of the peach-flavored elixir for you.

652
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,620
Once you succeed.

653
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:20,620
You will not be controlled by the peach-flavored elixir.

654
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:26,620
I can't give her hope and let her down.

655
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:27,620
I am sorry.

656
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,620
Good.

657
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:40,620
He is indeed a talented man.

658
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,620
What is your order?

659
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:53,620
Now the course is only waiting for the wind to come.

660
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,620
I am going to the Northern Plains.

661
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:59,620
If you go to the Northern Plains, it will take a long time.

662
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,620
What about your work?

663
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:04,620
I have asked His Majesty to give the work to the Minister's Office.

664
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:08,620
You have been in the court for many years and never asked for leave.

665
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:11,620
This time you are going to find the medicine for the princess.

666
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:14,620
I also want to see the future of Lv Hou.

667
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:18,620
The ups and downs that I and the science bureau have experienced are also related to her.

668
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,620
With her character.

669
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,620
She has experienced such a big mistake.

670
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,620
She will never give up.

671
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:26,620
Take care of Wu Xia while I am away.

672
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:29,620
Don't worry, I will always be on guard.

673
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:32,620
Don't worry, Tao Hua.

674
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:35,620
I will bring the antidote back from the Northern Plains.

675
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:51,620
The flowers bloom, you know nothing.

676
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:55,620
The beauty of the flowers can't be ignored.

677
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:58,620
The flowers fall, the north wind blows.

678
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:02,620
The city is in a state of panic.

679
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:05,620
The petals are wet with the rain.

680
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:09,620
My heart is with the knot.

681
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:13,620
The flowers fall, the tears are in the heart.

682
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:16,620
The eyes are full of tears.

683
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:18,620
The heart is full of thoughts.

684
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:22,620
There is nowhere to tell.

685
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:36,620
The wish is struggling in the mud.

686
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:43,620
Regret is killing in despair.

687
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:50,620
I still hope that she can hold the flowers in her arms.

688
00:42:50,620 --> 00:43:02,620
Even if I have to give the flowers to the song.

689
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:07,620
Who can take away the heart of the flowers?

690
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:11,620
Love and hate can only be taken away.

691
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:15,620
The flowers wither, the heart is broken.

692
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:18,620
There is no need to tell.

693
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:40,620
How can I still be crazy about him?

694
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:47,620
I'm not afraid to be underestimated

695
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:55,620
I'm just looking at what he said

696
00:43:55,620 --> 00:44:07,620
It turns out that he has the answer to his curiosity
