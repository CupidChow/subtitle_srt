=Episode 7=

18
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,180
(Shen Residence)

19
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,520
Lady Jiang is a heroine indeed.

20
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,760
You could actually be unfazed

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,520
at a place like Jinyin Gambling House.

22
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,440
Chancellor,
you're giving me too much praise.

23
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,000
I only got lucky

24
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,200
and used some tricks.

25
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,760
Lady Jiang, you're too humble.

26
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,080
I became an official at the age of 20.

27
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,330
I've been an official
for more than a decade

28
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,960
and I've seen all kinds of people.

29
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,800
However, I've never seen
someone like you, Lady Jiang.

30
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,720
You are a princess,

31
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,640
but you are humble,

32
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,440
wise,

33
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,600
and good at playing dumb.

34
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,160
You can't be beaten,

35
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,520
killed,

36
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,120
or imprisoned.

37
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,480
Since you know

38
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,120
I'm quite capable,

39
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,160
why not work with me, Chancellor?

40
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,760
What can you do?

41
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,480
The gambling house's layout,

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,720
its servants' and maids' shifts

43
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,600
and routine

44
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,560
are all in my head.

45
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,920
I can make a copy of them tonight

46
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,680
and hand it to you.

47
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,520
That's one thing.

48
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,200
Two,

49
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,440
you gambled tonight

50
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,440
not for the sake of gambling

51
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,880
but to investigate

52
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,520
the money given by the servants.

53
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,640
With your ability,

54
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,240
I'm sure you scouted the treasury,

55
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,320
but you didn't take action.

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,280
It seems like this is not a one-man job

57
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,960
and you need someone
to buy time for you.

58
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,280
This is risky.

59
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,000
You better think twice.

60
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,320
I'm not afraid of danger

61
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,560
as long as I can save Qingtai.

62
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,040
She is just a maid.

63
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,680
Is she worth doing that for?

64
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,080
Qingtai has never been a maid

65
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,320
but a family member

66
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,640
to me.

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,160
Do you know how to play Chupu?

68
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,560
I know the rules,

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,080
but I don't play it often.

70
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,720
Come to my study tomorrow.

71
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,560
I'll teach you.

72
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,640
(Throw)

73
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,600
Chupu has five throwing sticks.

74
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:09,800
(Groups)

75
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,720
(Names, Points)
Gamblers move their pieces

76
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,640
on the board
according to the points they get.

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,400
The person with a higher score wins.

78
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,520
I can tell you surely

79
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,320
that the owner of Jinyin Gambling House

80
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,760
is the heir.

81
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,160
If a lady

82
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,000
can cause trouble on his turf,

83
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,320
you will attract his attention
and let him duel you.

84
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,280
Then, everyone will only pay attention
to you two.

85
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,480
That is when
I can take a look inside the treasury.

86
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,280
Your turn.

87
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,440
You will surely lose this game.

88
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,360
Everyone has five dice.

89
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,980
I got three black dice
for my first three dice.

90
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,080
You have three white dice.

91
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,200
For the remaining two dice,

92
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,240
if I get Niu of the same color,

93
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,120
it's an all-black Lucai.

94
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,800
If I get two white dice,

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,680
it's still a three-black-two-white Zhicai.

96
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,760
They are all great groups.

97
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,080
One is worth 16 points

98
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,360
and the other is worth 14 points.

99
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,400
I can move very far ahead.

100
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,980
(Zhi, Du)

101
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,600
This is the worst situation.

102
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,720
However,
four black dice and one white dice

103
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,320
still make up a Saicai worth 11 points.

104
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,200
If you want to beat me,

105
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,800
you have to get a Lucai.

106
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,920
Although Lucai is worth many points,

107
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,890
the possibility
of getting one is extremely low.

108
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,640
No matter what you get,

109
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,320
I still have a higher chance of winning.

110
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:29,800
That's right.

111
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,160
Other people play Chupu

112
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,160
and think it's a game of luck,

113
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,240
but they don't know
you can analyze the result

114
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,160
of the previous round
before you throw the dice

115
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,560
and find out
the odds of throwing a certain group.

116
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,680
Lady Jiang, you have a good memory.

117
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,600
If you train more,

118
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,000
you will surely do very well

119
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,000
at the gambling house.

120
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:49,960
This time.

121
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,160
I'll throw five dice.

122
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,760
Let's increase our bet.

123
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,000
(Du)

124
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,840
It's Lucai?

125
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,720
You cheated?

126
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,120
Where's your proof?

127
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,120
I saw it just now.

128
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,560
You didn't get Lucai.

129
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,880
What you saw wasn't important.

130
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,520
The important thing

131
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,160
is what you see after the lid opens.

132
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,080
With your ability,

133
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,560
it's good enough to win against

134
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:50,920
ordinary gamblers.

135
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,200
But if you want to win against
the person we want to defeat,

136
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,400
it's still not good enough.

137
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,600
(Du)

138
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,680
(It's Lucai again?)

139
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,120
(If you want
to attract the heir's attention,)

140
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,950
(you must be able
to win and lose as you wish)

141
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,160
(just like me.)

142
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,640
(We can't afford to be late.)

143
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,000
(I want you to learn
how to control the dice in three days.)

144
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,360
(Combine it
with your card-counting skills,)

145
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,360
(you will be able to buy time for me)

146
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,400
(by delaying the heir.)

147
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:53,560
Continue.

148
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,520
Don't use strength.

149
00:08:16,112 --> 00:08:17,112
Relax your palm.

150
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,440
Leave some space for the dice.

151
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,880
However, you need to put strength
in the base of your palm and fingers.

152
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,160
Don't shake it simply.

153
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,240
Feel

154
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,400
how my hand is moving.

155
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,100
(Du)

156
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,760
I've found that feeling.

157
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,240
You're smart.

158
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,960
With your current level,

159
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,980
it's good enough
to win against ordinary gamblers.

160
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,280
However, there's a weakness

161
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,880
in your expression.

162
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,400
What weakness?

163
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,360
Think about the gambling house that day.

164
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,800
What did

165
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,120
the gamblers look like?

166
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,480
All of them wore masks.

167
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,920
I couldn't see them clearly.

168
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,640
Although they wore masks,

169
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,520
their eyes wouldn't lie.

170
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,120
Think about it carefully.

171
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,520
Big!

172
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,600
I'm betting on small!

173
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,920
I'm betting on small!

174
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,040
Open!

175
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:48,840
Big!

176
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:49,920
Big!

177
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,160
Small!

178
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,760
Open it!

179
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,280
I get it.

180
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,040
It's my gaze.

181
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,360
A real gambler

182
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,600
will not think about things carefully.

183
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,560
Their eyes were full of greed.

184
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,320
That's right.

185
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,960
An ordinary gambler

186
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,600
will not notice the weakness
on the other side of the table.

187
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,760
However, we are going against the heir.

188
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,760
He is paranoid,

189
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,480
cunning, and cutthroat.

190
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,040
A small flaw

191
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,960
will be enough to ruin the whole plan.

192
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,000
If I play like an expert

193
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,440
but have the gaze of a beginner,

194
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,240
he will surely be suspicious of me.

195
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,880
He is a gambling addict

196
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:30,920
and a pervert.

197
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,040
You can use

198
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,880
the trick you used on me

199
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,880
on him as well.

200
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,680
Chancellor Shen, are you saying

201
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,720
that I charmed you on purpose?

202
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,320
I have no interest in women

203
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,890
who have ill intent.

204
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,400
We share the same opinion.

205
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,320
I also try to stay away
from those who are scheming.

206
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,920
I'll end my training for today.

207
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,080
I'm heading back.

208
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,720
You should think twice.

209
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,580
Doing this will get you involved
in my conflict with the heir.

210
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,880
If you regret it,

211
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,800
you can leave now.

212
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,040
It's still not too late.

213
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,720
I don't regret it.

214
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,600
Let's go, then.

215
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,920
Why are we using the waterway this time?

216
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,620
This time, we are rich merchants
who just arrived at the capital.

217
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,000
We must enter through the front gate.

218
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,880
Moreover, they will change the method
of entering the gambling house

219
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,200
once every few months.

220
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,560
The gambling house itself

221
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,960
will also be renovated
and change its address sometimes.

222
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,560
It's grand,

223
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,320
but they can just
simply give up the place.

224
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,480
When you are in Beiyuan,

225
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,920
I'm sure you heard about Qi's wealth.

226
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,400
However, Qi's wealth
isn't with its people.

227
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,920
The nobles
are the ones who are wealthy.

228
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,440
Nobles have generations of wealth

229
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,920
and more than half of them
are related to Jinyin Gambling House.

230
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,880
That place contains the most money.

231
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,590
(Immense Wealth)
After we enter the gambling house,

232
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,240
I will inform you in secret.

233
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,160
There's news

234
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:21,000
that the heir has been visiting
the gambling house in recent days.

235
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,720
Your mission

236
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,800
is to keep winning

237
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,640
and force the heir

238
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,120
to gamble with you.

239
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,440
Huacai. Five steps.

240
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:31,920
What?

241
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,200
Huacai. Five steps.

242
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,640
The Horse is captured.

243
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,520
A pit kill.

244
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,040
I'm taking all your bets.

245
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,990
You can only win
if you throw the best combination.

246
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,600
Are you still going to play?

247
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,080
I surrender.

248
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,280
Let me do it.

249
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,140
(Zhi)

250
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,780
(Zhi)

251
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,840
Tacai. Five steps.

252
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,520
Are you still going to play?

253
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,240
Let me play.

254
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,280
Let me play!

255
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,120
- Let me!
- Let me!

256
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,800
Go away! Let me play!

257
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,600
- Let me play!
- Let me play!

258
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,720
This lady wins.

259
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:22,880
Thank you.

260
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,800
Owner, it's terrible.

261
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,600
A lady

262
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,120
came here tonight

263
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,880
and won eight games
of Chupu consecutively.

264
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:36,960
I know

265
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,440
you are great

266
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,560
at this game.

267
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,720
(A jade pendant?)

268
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,800
Why don't you try to defeat that lady?

269
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,320
Let's go and take a look.

270
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,400
He's here.

271
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,720
Is there anyone else
who wants to play with me?

272
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,200
Lady, you've won nine consecutive games.

273
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,120
No one dares to go up against you.

274
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,840
I'll just exchange my chips for money
and go home, then.

275
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,680
Let's go.

276
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:15,960
Hold it.

277
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,480
He has so many chips.

278
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,760
This must be an expert.

279
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,640
They say nine is the extreme number.

280
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,400
It seems like
your luck is coming to an end.

281
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,560
Let me try my luck.

282
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,280
Are you sure?

283
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:39,840
Why?

284
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,240
Are you afraid of losing?

285
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,360
Go ahead.

286
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,160
Chancellor.

287
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,840
Begin the plan.

288
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,120
Yes.

289
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,680
Wuyin,

290
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,640
you're great,

291
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,560
but your background is a little bad.

292
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,480
Your mother is just a maid.

293
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,360
Wugou will surely look down on you.

294
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,880
I am different.

295
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,200
Help me

296
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,280
and we can work together.

297
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,520
With the riches of the Qin family,

298
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,880
do you think I can't buy

299
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,160
the remaining officials
of the imperial court?

300
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,160
Wuhen.

301
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,160
I'll be honest with you.

302
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,800
I'm not interested in

303
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,640
the issue between you and Wugou.

304
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,120
Don't go!

305
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,240
I'm not done yet.

306
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:36,760
If you...

307
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,360
Your Highness,

308
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,800
Zhan Lu who serves Chancellor Shen
requests a meeting.

309
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,880
I should leave

310
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,960
if you are busy.

311
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,360
Sit down.

312
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,480
Sit down!

313
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,640
He serves Chancellor Shen.

314
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,560
Shen Zaiye is famous

315
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,280
for his integrity in the imperial court.

316
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,760
However, he is actually coming to me?

317
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,920
Let him wait.

318
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,000
Wuhen.

319
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,080
Didn't you say
you want to gain the officials' favour?

320
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,640
Chancellor Shen

321
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:07,640
is

322
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,240
the leader of the officials.

323
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:10,640
Right?

324
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,640
Yes.

325
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,560
You are right.

326
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,960
Ask him to come inside immediately.

327
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:18,680
Yes.

328
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,280
Wuyin,

329
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,840
I told you.

330
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,920
If we work together,

331
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,000
we will surely succeed.

332
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,160
Don't go.

333
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:31,640
Cheers.

334
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,520
Prince Wuhen.

335
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,360
Prince Wuyin.

336
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,080
The Chancellor asked me
to send you a message.

337
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,400
It's related to Prince Wugou.

338
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,560
- Say it.
- Don't say it.

339
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,520
Say it.

340
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,120
The Chancellor
has prepared a huge gift for you

341
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,360
at Jinyin Gambling House.

342
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,260
You can bring your men
to pick it up yourself.

343
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,040
Jinyin Gambling House?

344
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,440
Wuyin, come with me.

345
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,040
This is interesting.

346
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,840
This must be related to the heir.

347
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,720
When I have dirt on him in the future,

348
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,540
following me there
will be your contribution.

349
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,640
Did you hear what he just said?

350
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,840
Someone might accuse you
of protecting Wugou.

351
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,280
Let's go.

352
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,980
If I knew,
I wouldn't have been so greedy.

353
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,340
(Immense Wealth)

354
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,760
This is great.

355
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,320
Yes.

356
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,480
We have a good show now.

357
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,200
(Zhi)
Zhicai, 14 points!

358
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,200
- He's good.
- He's good.

359
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,960
(Du)
Lucai, 16 points!

360
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:00,840
Interesting.

361
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,440
Again.

362
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,400
(Holding the heir here
is just the first step.)

363
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,120
(The key thing)

364
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,560
(is getting the jade pendant on him.)

365
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,160
Saicai, 11 points!

366
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,280
What a pity.

367
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:22,960
Yes.

368
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,880
So close.

369
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,960
Juecai, three points!

370
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,440
Skip the Horse!

371
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,000
Pit kill.

372
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,520
I take all your chips.

373
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,200
Thank you.

374
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,600
She's invincible.

375
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,520
You are very lucky indeed, Young Lady.

376
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,360
I wonder where you come from.

377
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,320
Mister.

378
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,760
The rules of the gambling house

379
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,400
don't allow such questions.

380
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,560
Let's continue.

381
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,720
I'm already

382
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,960
sick of winning tonight.

383
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,000
If you want to play against me,

384
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,520
why not increase your wager?

385
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,440
What do you want me to wager?

386
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,040
You have a good eye.

387
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,000
This jade pendant is very valuable.

388
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,520
If you want my jade pendant,

389
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,520
I want to change the game.

390
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,600
I'm not good at other games.

391
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,800
Let's play something simple.

392
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:31,880
Big and Small.

393
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,280
This is good.

394
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,360
I'm sick of watching Chupu anyway.

395
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:38,880
Change a game.

396
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,080
Change a game.

397
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:45,320
- Change it!
- Change it!

398
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,080
Change the game!

399
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:46,760
(This is bad.)

400
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,360
(Shen Zaiye didn't teach me
how to throw dice.)

401
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,720
(Agree to his suggestion.)

402
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,960
(Next,)

403
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,760
(it's all down to my luck.)

404
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,280
Go ahead.

405
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,360
(Small)

406
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,320
Small.

407
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,920
One, one, three. Small.

408
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,800
She's good.

409
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,480
How could she guess it?

410
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,240
You're lucky.

411
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,520
I'll be the one guessing this time.

412
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,440
(This young lady has skin
as white as snow)

413
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,280
(and eyes
as bright as the stars and moon.)

414
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,440
(She's my type.)

415
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,200
(Here's my chance.)

416
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,720
- Small!
- Small!

417
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,040
- Big!
- Big!

418
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:06,680
- Small!
- Small!

419
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,360
It must be small!

420
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:07,960
It must be big!

421
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:08,840
- Big!
- Big!

422
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,520
- Big!
- Big!

423
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,920
- Small!
- Small!

424
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,800
- Big!
- Big!

425
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,000
Small!

426
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,280
You have a strong aura.

427
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,800
Can you help me light a fragrance
to calm me down?

428
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,240
Give it to her.

429
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,080
The fragrance is here.

430
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,280
Stop trying to be secretive.

431
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,480
Open it.

432
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,080
Are you betting on Big or Small?

433
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,000
I'm betting on Big.

434
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,680
Two, one, two. Small.

435
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,000
You are wrong.

436
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,840
(Bells?)

437
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,670
(It seems like
I can't touch these bells)

438
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,700
(and trigger the traps here
if I want to go through this place.)

439
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,480
Losers don't speak

440
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,640
and winners don't stop.

441
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,080
Let's continue.

442
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,800
I only need time

443
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,560
for a stick of fragrance to burn down
to search the treasury.

444
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,240
You must hold on before that.

445
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,680
(Shen Zaiye.)

446
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,840
(From now on,)

447
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,840
(I'll do my best to buy you time.)

448
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,800
(However, I can't hold on for too long.)

449
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:54,920
(So,)

450
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,040
(you must get it done quickly.)

451
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,120
I'm betting on Small.

452
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,800
Two, three, six. Big.

453
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:17,920
Again.

454
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,990
It seems like there's still someone
in Jinyin Gambling House

455
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,480
who can win against you.

456
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,640
Your turn.

457
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,200
Big.

458
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,000
One, two, two. Small.

459
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,480
It seems like this lady's luck

460
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,320
has run out.

461
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,000
Yes.

462
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,640
Have you decided?

463
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,160
I'm betting on Big.

464
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,880
Open it then.

465
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:19,680
- Open!
- Open!

466
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,640
Open it, quick!

467
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,480
Open!

468
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,040
(If I lose again,)

469
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,880
(I'll lose all my money.)

470
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,160
One, two, three. Small.

471
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,000
Are you still playing?

472
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,640
I think the match has been decided.

473
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,160
Why don't you admit your defeat?

474
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,760
Owner, it's terrible.

475
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,640
(Has Shen Zaiye)

476
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,680
(been exposed?)

477
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:02,880
What a pity.

478
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,120
I have something urgent to do.

479
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,880
If you don't want to gamble anymore...

480
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:07,640
Hold it.

481
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,000
One last bet.

482
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,600
You don't have enough chips.

483
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,160
What are you using to bet against me?

484
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,760
Myself.

485
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,320
Great.

486
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,920
You are pretty enough to wager yourself.

487
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:24,640
Tell me

488
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,360
how much you are worth.

489
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,280
500,000 taels.

490
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,280
500,000 taels?

491
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,640
Beiyuan's compensation

492
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,960
is only a million taels of silver.

493
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,280
If you agree to the bet,

494
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,440
her worth

495
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,880
will be equal to a city.

496
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,720
I'm talking about gold.

497
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,120
Gold?

498
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,680
Gosh.

499
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,920
How can he have so much money?

500
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,360
Winner takes all.

501
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,840
Winner takes all.

502
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,400
You're bold.

503
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,880
(Shen Zaiye, what are you doing?)

504
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,880
(I can't hold on anymore.)

505
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,920
Is this the show Chancellor Shen mentioned?

506
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,400
It's interesting indeed.

507
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,120
They say the Qin family

508
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,040
is the wealthiest noble in Qi,

509
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,440
but I don't think

510
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,520
you dare accept this bet, Wugou.

511
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,360
He doesn't have so much money.

512
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,680
You'll shake the dice.

513
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,120
I'll guess.

514
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:28,840
Go ahead.

515
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,720
(Darn it.)

516
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,400
(Shen Zaiye, why haven't you returned?)

517
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,240
Place your bet.

518
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:03,720
I...

519
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,640
I'll bet...

520
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,600
I'll bet on...

521
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:20,440
Big.

522
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,000
Big.

523
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,560
I'll bet on Big.

524
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,160
Open it.

525
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,040
Five, four, three. Big.

526
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,000
She wins again!

527
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,040
Amazing!

528
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:12,960
Incredible!

529
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,640
500,000 taels of gold.

530
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,240
This must be the biggest gamble

531
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,800
even for Jinyin Gambling House.

532
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,560
Yes.

533
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,160
I was told that someone
had broken into the treasury.

534
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,680
Looking at the time,

535
00:29:29,767 --> 00:29:31,767
it was not long
after we started gambling.

536
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,960
Now that I think about it,

537
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,320
are you

538
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,920
working together?

539
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,840
The heir?

540
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:45,520
Let's go!

541
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,080
The owner is the heir?

542
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:48,880
Catch them

543
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,040
and kill them!

544
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,160
Run!

545
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:58,880
Hurry!

546
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,920
Let's go!

547
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,000
Huaijin?

548
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,520
Why are you here?

549
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,800
Calm down, Your Highness.

550
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,720
There are many people here.

551
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,440
Let's talk when we're back in the room.

552
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,360
You must find them

553
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:29,400
even if you dig
three feet deep underground.

554
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,760
Calm down.

555
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,240
I know

556
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,600
that woman is related

557
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,840
to the treasury's intrusion.

558
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,720
However, I saw it clearly.

559
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,920
That woman

560
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,160
had a man helping her.

561
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,160
They must still be in the building.

562
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,880
I must find them!

563
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,800
They've captured me
for three to four days.

564
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,320
They won't interrogate me

565
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,360
or kill me.

566
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,560
Now, they put me
in another cell and starve me.

567
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,200
What are they doing?

568
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:26,960
Have a meat bun.

569
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,880
Meat bun.

570
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,320
Who are you?

571
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,360
It's me. Zhan Lu.

572
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,480
Zhan Lu.

573
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,920
Zhan Lu?

574
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,000
Brat.

575
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,200
You hit me

576
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,200
when I brought you food.

577
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,000
You're small but you're quite strong.

578
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,320
Then...

579
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,360
How do you know I'm here?

580
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,000
Master caused chaos in this place

581
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,180
so I could come all the way here
from the third floor.

582
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,440
How are you going to save me now?

583
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,040
I stole in during the chaos.

584
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,520
I only brought two.

585
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:11,560
Don't drop it anymore.

586
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,320
Thank you.

587
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,160
Order from the Owner.

588
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,600
Find a woman
with a blossom mark on her arm

589
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,360
and her companion.

590
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,680
Kill them when you find them.

591
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,080
Go.

592
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,160
Next.

593
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,640
Put your hands up! Line up!

594
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,040
Hold up your right arm!

595
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:44,480
Next!

596
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,200
Right arm!

597
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,480
Hold up your right arm!

598
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,040
Move! Put up your right arm!

599
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,600
Next!

600
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:52,760
Right arm!

601
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,600
Put up your arm!

602
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,560
They are looking for me.

603
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,360
Next!

604
00:32:57,334 --> 00:32:58,240
The manicure and tattoo

605
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,080
were drawn on,

606
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,000
but it's too late to wash them now.

607
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,440
Leave.

608
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,400
Think of a way to save me
after you leave this place.

609
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,680
Are you not afraid?

610
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,160
I am.

611
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,960
However, our fates are shared now.

612
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,320
You must escape.

613
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:21,840
Young Master,

614
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,320
you must escape.

615
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,640
Run!

616
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,480
Protect yourself first!

617
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,360
Go.

618
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,040
Let me lure them away.

619
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,600
With that vengeful nature of yours,

620
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,640
you might spoil my plan

621
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,840
if you are captured.

622
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:06,920
Come with me.

623
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,000
Hide first.

624
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,000
I hope my backup plan

625
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,113
ensures that it's not game over yet.

626
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,520
Backup plan?

627
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,800
That's right, Wuhen.

628
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,920
Aren't your men going to take action?

629
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,760
You might offend Chancellor Shen

630
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,160
and he might bite you back.

631
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,080
There's no rush.

632
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,920
Let them argue.

633
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,360
I hope it blows up

634
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,320
so I can reap all the benefits.

635
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,400
Search them both!

636
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,520
What are you doing?

637
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,720
What are you doing?

638
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,400
Next!

639
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,720
What are you doing?

640
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,080
Move!

641
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,080
Hurry!

642
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,080
Take them away.

643
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:11,880
Move!

644
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:16,760
Move!

645
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,040
Don't move.

646
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,640
What should we do?

647
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,200
I said I went back to my hometown.

648
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,600
If the general finds out,

649
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,880
he will beat us both to death.

650
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,400
Hide in the closet first.

651
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,280
Let's split up.

652
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,040
Go!

653
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,560
Go inside!

654
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:43,760
Hurry!

655
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,480
Marquis!

656
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,040
I'm scared!

657
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,040
Hide if you're scared.

658
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,120
Hurry up!

659
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,760
Marquis, save me!

660
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,840
Do you know who I am?

661
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,760
Marquis!

662
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,840
Marquis Xinyang.

663
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,240
I have no time
to care about your business.

664
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,160
If you dare say another word,

665
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,600
I don't mind

666
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,160
helping General Weiyuan

667
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,720
vent his anger!

668
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,880
Open all the closets.

669
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,320
Don't miss every spot.

670
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:23,944
