00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,560
Your Highness,

4
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,120
Shen Zai has indeed gone to the crime scene

5
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,280
and found a broken jade.

6
00:01:59,240 --> 00:01:59,920
Broken jade?

7
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,080
What is it?

8
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,560
A jade this size.

9
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,760
I see.

10
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,160
Thank you.

11
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,640
Go back and rest.

12
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:14,720
Yes.

13
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,400
When you mentioned the broken jade,

14
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,160
Your Highness's mood is a little tense.

15
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,320
Could it be that the crime scene

16
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,360
is related to Your Highness?

17
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,440
The missing part of the jade pendant

18
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,200
is actually connected to the broken jade

19
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,080
in the crime scene.

20
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,480
Your Highness,

21
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,160
is that you?

22
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,040
Your Highness,

23
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,800
Your Highness,

24
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,040
you're not asleep yet?

25
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,720
Who disturbed my dream?

26
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,520
Your Highness,

27
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,400
I was passing by just now.

28
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,880
I heard a sound in the bedroom.

29
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,760
Sound?

30
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,000
I didn't hear the sound.

31
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,600
But you disturbed my dream

32
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,800
and disturbed my dream.

33
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,800
Your Highness, please calm down.

34
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,200
I deserve to die.

35
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,800
You may leave.

36
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:02,220
The witch Trustee from the jade pendant,

37
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,460
what does she do?

38
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,000
Write it read.

39
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,720
and at the same time,

40
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,800
I want to help Qi Nian

41
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,640
take care in excess.

42
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,320
Krump,

43
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,080
I made a imperial decree

44
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:19,680
that there was a problem

45
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,100
in the 19th House at 9 o'clock.

46
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,140
AHow到

47
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,020
that case,

48
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:23,600
I just hung into...

49
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,720
the OurĩAntun 두 사람

50
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,920
No one has seen it.

51
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,880
It's so small.

52
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,320
Even if I have seen it,

53
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,920
I'm afraid I can't recognize it.

54
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,880
Qingtai.

55
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,560
Master Xiao.

56
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,680
Qingtai.

57
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,160
Master Xiao.

58
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,880
Qingtai is so small.

59
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,600
Did the princess find out something?

60
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,960
But it's hard to tell.

61
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,400
Brother.

62
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,040
Why don't you go to the investigation?

63
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,440
You've been waiting here.

64
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,080
Do you want to save Mu Wuxia?

65
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,000
Zhan Lu.

66
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,240
Send someone to send her back.

67
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,280
Brother, I won't go back.

68
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,240
What's this?

69
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,120
Miss.

70
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,320
It's a secret.

71
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,720
I'm afraid I can't tell you.

72
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,960
I'm afraid I can't tell you.

73
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,280
I'm afraid I can't tell you.

74
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:26,960
What's this?

75
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:27,920
Miss.

76
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,120
Don't break it.

77
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,320
There's an important clue.

78
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,280
Clue?

79
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,360
It's not a picture or a painting.

80
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,920
It's like a kind of text.

81
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:45,920
I see.

82
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,040
Prepare the horse.

83
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,480
Where are you going? Take me with you.

84
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,560
I'm going to meet His Majesty.

85
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,880
I'm Shen Zaiyi.

86
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,160
I want to see His Majesty.

87
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,040
Shen Zaiyi.

88
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,000
Didn't I tell you not to get involved in this?

89
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:00,880
What?

90
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,160
You want to be punished again?

91
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:02,920
Your Majesty.

92
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,720
I've already secured the head of His Majesty.

93
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,760
The second prince wasn't killed by the fourth prince.

94
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,680
Why are you so sure?

95
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,640
I'm bold.

96
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,680
May I ask you, Your Majesty?

97
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,600
This year's imperial examination

98
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,440
whether it is

99
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,440
to see the dead or not

100
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,520
and to do it on purpose.

101
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,840
How did you know?

102
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,520
I felt a call like this.

103
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:30,960
Your Majesty.

104
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,880
I so come out

105
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,400
to see the third prince.

106
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,880
He seems to have come to him

107
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,440
before.

108
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,920
Well,

109
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,160
I once thought

110
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,160
you have some strange friends.

111
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,960
I saw some friends

112
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,800
with mixed debating techniques.

113
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,240
There must be something

114
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,000
Your Highness,

115
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,760
let me ask you.

116
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,160
Do you have any evidence to prove

117
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,720
that the jade pendant is Wu Hen's?

118
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,600
He's already dead.

119
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,200
Don't make a fool of yourself.

120
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,320
Your Majesty,

121
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,720
before the Chief of Meng You,

122
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,160
the minister of Li State

123
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,840
is mostly a member of the Qin family.

124
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,040
If the jade pendant

125
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,080
isn't from the Second Prince,

126
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,120
it's from the Fourth Prince.

127
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,960
With the blood of the Fourth Prince,

128
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,600
do you really believe

129
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,880
he's a man who's been seeking death?

130
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,080
Your Majesty,

131
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,480
if the jade pendant

132
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,360
isn't from the Fourth Prince,

133
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,960
then the third person

134
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,440
might have been there.

135
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,120
Please accept my order, Your Majesty.

136
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,400
I will definitely

137
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,040
give you the truth.

138
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:55,880
Yes.

139
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:05,960
Prime Minister,

140
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,240
now that Her Highness is in the Third Prince's mansion,

141
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,880
she's so generous to send us the clue.

142
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,320
Who is she helping?

143
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,200
I can't explain it.

144
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,360
She helped me

145
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,520
and put herself in danger.

146
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,800
I have to persuade her

147
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,800
to support me.

148
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,240
Thank you, Your Majesty.

149
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,400
But now,

150
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,120
Her Highness is so cautious

151
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,960
about the Prime Minister's safety.

152
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,360
Can she listen to you?

153
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,120
Go find Jingtai.

154
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,120
Jingtai.

155
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,840
Jingtai.

156
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,640
Jingtai.

157
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,200
Didn't you say you were busy recently?

158
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,200
Why did you come to see me?

159
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,240
I have to visit you in the morning.

160
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,640
I bought this when I was passing by.

161
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,240
Have a try.

162
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,000
I forgot that you're here.

163
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,640
Greetings, Prime Minister.

164
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,200
Jingtai,

165
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,440
have you been out of the mansion today?

166
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,720
No.

167
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,280
No?

168
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,240
Then why did the doctor

169
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,480
come to see you at 4 p.m. today

170
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,560
and you weren't there?

171
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,400
There's no doctor at 4 p.m.

172
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,040
I just went out of the mansion.

173
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,600
So what?

174
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,920
I'm the princess' maid,

175
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,120
not the Prime Minister's prisoner.

176
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:36,800
So

177
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,400
you went to see the princess?

178
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,400
Did you

179
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,080
ask Tao Hua to give me the hairpin?

180
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,360
Why does he have a brain?

181
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,240
So fast.

182
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,680
He's so blind.

183
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,480
Tell Tao Hua

184
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,240
that thank you for helping him.

185
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,960
I told you

186
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,200
it had nothing to do with the princess.

187
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,600
Jingtai,

188
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,960
have you ever thought

189
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,600
that the princess risked her life to help the Prime Minister?

190
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,840
If someone is found out

191
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,800
around her,

192
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,240
who can guarantee the princess's safety?

193
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:10,960
Jingtai,

194
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,120
I know

195
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,920
you had a deep opinion of me in the past.

196
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,680
But for Tao Hua,

197
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:16,960
I think

198
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,600
we should let go of the knot.

199
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,080
Jingtai,

200
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,560
I was so worried

201
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,480
when you sneaked into the Third Prince's mansion last time.

202
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,280
Did you forget how I told you?

203
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,760
The princess said

204
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,040
she would come to me if something happened.

205
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,280
Then why didn't you listen to me?

206
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,400
The Prime Minister asked me to bring you a message.

207
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,600
What message?

208
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,240
The Prime Minister said

209
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,800
you can only be granted authority

210
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,600
if you are in the enemy camp.

211
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,960
Don't be afraid of being attacked

212
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,960
by the enemy.

213
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,680
I'm not afraid of being attacked.

214
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,800
I'm not afraid of being attacked.

215
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,800
I'm not afraid of being attacked.

216
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,800
I'm not afraid of being attacked.

217
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,400
Don't get involved in this again.

218
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,840
Thank you for your reminder, Your Grace.

219
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,880
But I did this

220
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,080
not for her,

221
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,680
but to save the Fourth Prince.

222
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,200
Your Grace,

223
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,920
I've been staying at the Prime Minister's mansion for a while.

224
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,280
I feel that the Prime Minister is not that bad.

225
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,920
He wanted to save you and the Fourth Prince

226
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,400
on the day you fell off the cliff.

227
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,760
Your Grace,

228
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,240
why didn't you want to make up with him?

229
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,120
Qingtai,

230
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,640
I've actually

231
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,720
remembered it.

232
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,040
Your Grace, you...

233
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,640
Don't tell anyone.

234
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,800
You can't reveal

235
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,840
any good things

236
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,880
in front of him.

237
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,640
But Your Grace,

238
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,040
what kind of feelings

239
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,560
do you have for him?

240
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,440
Although you are cold and heartless to him,

241
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,240
you always have him in your heart.

242
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,040
Although the Prime Minister is tough,

243
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,640
he still misses you.

244
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,640
You miss each other so much.

245
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,640
Why do you have to torture each other?

246
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,840
Shen Zaiye and I

247
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,640
are naturally opposite.

248
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,640
He didn't know my true feelings before.

249
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,840
We were forced to stay at the Prime Minister's mansion

250
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,240
and fight against each other.

251
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,240
Now,

252
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,840
he knows that I'm a spy.

253
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,240
We are both the masters.

254
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,040
It's impossible for us to be together.

255
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,240
I'm in love with him.

256
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,440
Since I've left,

257
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,040
let's be happy.

258
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,040
Your Grace,

259
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,840
I just think

260
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,040
you might miss

261
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,840
something important.

262
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,840
How about you?

263
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,040
How's your wound?

264
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,040
Let me see.

265
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,040
It's all healed.

266
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,040
Don't worry, Your Grace.

267
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,840
Qingtan,

268
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,040
I'm fine.

269
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,040
I'm fine.

270
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,040
I'm fine.

271
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,040
I'm fine.

272
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,640
There's something

273
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,040
I've been thinking about for a long time.

274
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,840
Now you're recovered.

275
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,840
I think it's a good time.

276
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,240
I can come back

277
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,440
to protect you at any time.

278
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,240
I know.

279
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,040
But

280
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,040
I want you to leave Daqi.

281
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,840
Your Grace,

282
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,040
you don't want me anymore?

283
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,040
We are masters,

284
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,040
but in my heart,

285
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,240
you're my sister.

286
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,640
How can I abandon you?

287
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,040
Your Grace,

288
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,240
since the first day I saw you,

289
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,440
I've said that

290
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,240
my mission is to protect you.

291
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,640
You are...

292
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,240
You can't eat this flower.

293
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,240
It will break your stomach.

294
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,440
Sister.

295
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,240
Master is here.

296
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,040
I left it for Changjue.

297
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,040
Here you are.

298
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,440
This is for you.

299
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,440
Master.

300
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,440
Why are you here?

301
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,440
Your Grace,

302
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,040
His Highness and your friends

303
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,840
need someone to take care of them.

304
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,640
I picked a little girl for you.

305
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,040
She's good at martial arts

306
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,440
and is honest.

307
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:46,840
From now on,

308
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,040
she will be with you.

309
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,240
Qingtai.

310
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,440
It's you.

311
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,440
I, Qingtai,

312
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,640
greet you.

313
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,040
I will protect you.

314
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,240
I won't let you suffer again.

315
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,640
I only have

316
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,640
one family in this world.

317
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,440
Can you

318
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,840
not abandon me?

319
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,640
How can I abandon you?

320
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,440
Now,

321
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,640
I've gained

322
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,040
His Highness's trust.

323
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,840
So I want to stay here

324
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,040
and find the antidote.

325
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,640
I want you to help me find Changjue.

326
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,440
I'll go find His Highness.

327
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:30,840
Before,

328
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,040
our every move

329
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,040
was controlled by Lv Houchi.

330
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,240
If there's a slight movement,

331
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,640
it will involve Changjue.

332
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,240
But this time,

333
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,440
you escaped from it.

334
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,240
You got rid of her control.

335
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,440
Now,

336
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,440
only you can help me find Changjue.

337
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,040
I only trust you.

338
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,840
After you find Changjue,

339
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,240
we'll go far away

340
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,440
to find a quiet place

341
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,240
and stop living in the same place.

342
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,240
As long as I can be with Her Highness,

343
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,040
I'm willing to do anything.

344
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,440
But

345
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,040
where should I find His Highness?

346
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,640
In Changjue's family book,

347
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,640
it was mentioned that

348
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,640
near the military camp where he is,

349
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,240
there's a sea of sand.

350
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,240
So I guess

351
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,040
his camp

352
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,640
should be near the north of the north star.

353
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:21,840
Okay.

354
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,240
I'll set off tomorrow.

355
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,440
Qian Mochen also said that

356
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,240
the north of the north star

357
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,440
is full of yellow sand

358
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,640
and few people.

359
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,840
I think the camp

360
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,840
is the most secret place.

361
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,840
It's not easy to find Changjue this time.

362
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,440
Even if I dig up all the sand in the star,

363
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,240
I'll definitely find His Highness.

364
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,840
Then promise me

365
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,840
that everything will be fine.

366
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,640
Don't worry, Your Highness.

367
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,840
I'll protect His Highness and father.

368
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,240
By the way,

369
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,640
don't tell Shen Caiye about this.

370
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,840
Qingtan

371
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,240
Why hasn't Qingtan come back yet?

372
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,240
Xiang Yan, you've been tired all day.

373
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,240
You should go back and have a rest.

374
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,240
I'll wait for Qingtan.

375
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,440
Qingtan, what's wrong with you?

376
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,440
You cried?

377
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,440
Thank you for your time.

378
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,640
You've given me freedom.

379
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,240
I'll set off tomorrow

380
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,440
to find my relatives in the north yard.

381
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,040
You have a lot of work to do.

382
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,040
I'll leave tomorrow.

383
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,440
You're leaving?

384
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,040
Zhan Lu,

385
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,240
if you want to go with Qingtan,

386
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,640
I'll let you go.

387
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,240
I won't go.

388
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,040
Then you'll regret it in the future.

389
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,040
No.

390
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,640
Xiang Yan,

391
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,240
what do you think the princess is thinking?

392
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,240
She wants to

393
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,240
cut off all ties with me.

394
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,840
That's good.

395
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,240
She's out of the picture.

396
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,240
Tell her

397
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,040
to search for the Jiuyi soldiers in the city.

398
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,640
The situation should be bigger.

399
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,240
Remember,

400
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,840
the clues of the jade pendant

401
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,240
are not given by the peach blossom.

402
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,840
We interrogated them from the soldiers.

403
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,640
Xiang Yan,

404
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,440
why did you do that for the princess?

405
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,440
Meng family is a cunning man.

406
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:54,440
Get out!

407
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,840
Your Highness,

408
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,840
I know the jade pendant...

409
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,040
The date of the jade pendant is coming.

410
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,640
I beg you to give me the medicine.

411
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,040
I heard that Prime Minister Shen

412
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,440
is searching for the Jiuyi soldiers in the city.

413
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,840
He wants to comfort Mu Wu Xia.

414
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,040
But I won't allow that to happen.

415
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,640
I can give you the antidote anytime.

416
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,040
But you can't take it for free.

417
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,840
Miss Mu Er,

418
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,240
do you know what you should do?

419
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,040
Last time I used Xiang Qingying to get involved in this matter.

420
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,440
I shouldn't have caused Prime Minister Shen's suspicion.

421
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,240
If you don't mind,

422
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,840
I'm willing to do anything for you.

423
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,440
Go ahead.

424
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,640
I heard that he is in Zhuo Yufang, south of the city.

425
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,240
Yes, Your Highness.

426
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,640
Shen Zaiye,

427
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,040
when the woman you love is in love,

428
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,040
can you still be a good man?

429
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,640
Prime Minister, the princess is here.

430
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,440
It seems that you don't know what is called

431
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,040
being alone and being alone, right?

432
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,040
I just want to help you with the case.

433
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,640
In that case,

434
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,840
why don't we split up and get some time?

435
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,440
I don't know.

436
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,840
But why do I only ask you?

437
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,040
I don't know.

438
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,640
Is the Second Prince

439
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,440
a regular guest in your inn?

440
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,040
The dishes in my inn are very similar to the Second Prince's.

441
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,840
He is lucky to have a private room

442
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,640
and spend time here all year round.

443
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,240
Spend time here all year round,

444
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,440
but you are the only one who is alone.

445
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,040
You are so beautiful and moving.

446
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,440
It is hard for a man not to fall in love with you.

447
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,840
But I found a very coincidental thing.

448
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,440
Look at the accounts.

449
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,040
Recently, there are always people who order two dishes,

450
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,640
Erbie Pao Gao and Hancaigu.

451
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,640
If you are a guest with a present,

452
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,240
you can know the fortune at the same time.

453
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,640
It's strange.

454
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,440
The guests here

455
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,440
seem to have no problems.

456
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,840
There is a man who says

457
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,040
whenever a guest orders two dishes,

458
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,040
you will take over and take the responsibility.

459
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,440
Then the maids will take the guests away.

460
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,240
And what's more,

461
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,840
after the Fourth Prince left,

462
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,240
someone else ordered these two dishes.

463
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,640
Unexpectedly,

464
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,640
you took this man away.

465
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,240
Helping Xie Lu to solve the problem

466
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,640
is enough to kill the Lian Jiuzong.

467
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,840
If you tell me about the person you saw that night,

468
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,040
I will make sure you don't die.

469
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,640
If I were you,

470
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,240
since it has happened,

471
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:12,440
I will do whatever I can to save my family.

472
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,040
I know everything.

473
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,040
Mo Huai Rui.

474
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:19,640
Zhan Long,

475
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,440
send someone to kill Mo Huai Rui.

476
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,440
Yes.

477
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:31,840
Tang Mei,

478
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,640
you came here alone.

479
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,640
Why didn't you bring a maid?

480
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,040
Are you leaving the Garden?

481
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,640
My mother and mother's uncle are ill.

482
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,240
They came to see me.

483
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,240
So your parents

484
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,040
left first.

485
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,240
Tang Mei,

486
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,440
I'm in a hurry.

487
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,840
If it's possible, I'll...

488
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,640
Okay.

489
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,640
Huai Rui.

490
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:58,640
Father.

491
00:25:59,240 --> 00:25:59,840
Mother.

492
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,640
I didn't scare her.

493
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,040
I just pushed her lightly.

494
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,040
Her Highness fell to her death.

495
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,040
It's okay.

496
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,440
I'll go to the Chunyue House to buy a test.

497
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,040
Who knows

498
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,640
I had a fight with Her Highness before I came in.

499
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,840
Don't let her anger

500
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,840
get to me.

501
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:23,840
Your Highness,

502
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,040
a guest wants to see you.

503
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,840
I'm Mo Huai Rui.

504
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,040
Greetings, Your Highness.

505
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,040
Meng family.

506
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,840
Can anyone come in here?

507
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,840
Your Highness,

508
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,240
don't push the business

509
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,040
outwards.

510
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,040
I've seen all the children of the Xiao Ru family.

511
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,640
Nothing has ever happened before.

512
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,240
Nothing has ever happened before.

513
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,440
Since you're behind me,

514
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,640
don't tell me you have nothing to do with it.

515
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,440
Your Highness,

516
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,040
I have nothing to do with it.

517
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,640
I'm here to buy the jade pendant.

518
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,240
Meng family is a cunning man.

519
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,440
Get out.

520
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,640
Your Highness,

521
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,440
I know the jade pendant is a test.

522
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,640
I know you've sold a lot of people.

523
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:33,840
You...

524
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,240
You're not selling a little today.

525
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,640
I'll see what you can do.

526
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:53,840
Your Highness.

527
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,040
Your Highness.

528
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,840
Your Highness.

529
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:28,840
Tao Mei.

530
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:30,840
Your Highness.

531
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:33,240
I told you the truth.

532
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,040
I just pushed her aside.

533
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,240
Who would have thought she was so weak?

534
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,440
I...

535
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:40,840
Your Highness.

536
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,240
If I hadn't been a human,

537
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,440
I would have been killed.

538
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,840
You know I'm a filial son.

539
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,240
Now my parents are all in your hands.

540
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,040
How could I lie again?

541
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,040
I'm loyal to God.

542
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,840
If I dare to lie again,

543
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:57,840
I'll...

544
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,640
I'll kill my parents.

545
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,240
Shen Zaiye is here to investigate it.

546
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,440
If you get the truth,

547
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,040
what will you say?

548
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,640
I...

549
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,440
I'll tell you the truth.

550
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,240
I'll listen to God.

551
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,640
Your Highness.

552
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,240
Why are you so angry?

553
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,240
I beg you to let my father go.

554
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,040
Your Highness.

555
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,440
If I ask you again,

556
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,040
if I find out the truth,

557
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,240
how will you answer me?

558
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,240
I...

559
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,440
Wait.

560
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,040
Your Highness.

561
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,440
I'll do whatever you ask me to do.

562
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,040
Please let my parents go.

563
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,040
I beg you.

564
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,040
Your Highness.

565
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,240
Your Highness.

566
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,240
As long as Meng Huai Rui is caught,

567
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,640
the Fourth Prince will be saved.

568
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,240
That's right.

569
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,640
There are two more details.

570
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,040
It's very strange.

571
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,840
What details?

572
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,240
One is

573
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,040
the blood vessels on the table

574
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,240
are not connected.

575
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,040
It also needs to be confirmed

576
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,040
if the shape of the wound

577
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,040
is in line with the shape of the table.

578
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,440
What about the second one?

579
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,040
Have you seen any misunderstanding?

580
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,240
It's the shape of lotus.

581
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,240
Lotus?

582
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,240
I once saw a pattern

583
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,040
of a lotus on the window sill.

584
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,240
It's more than two inches.

585
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,840
What's wrong?

586
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,240
It's a bad omen.

587
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,640
I have to go back.

588
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:31,840
Goodbye.

589
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,840
Miss Huai Rui.

590
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,440
Jiang Dahuo.

591
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,440
Jiang Dahuo.

592
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,240
The pattern of the lotus

593
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,640
is a symbol of poison.

594
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,240
If my moon doesn't meet the antidote,

595
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,240
it will be blood-sucking.

596
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,240
If I die,

597
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,640
I'll be dead.

598
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,040
I'll die.

599
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,040
I'll die.

600
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,240
I'll die.

601
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,240
I'll die.

602
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,240
I'll die.

603
00:30:59,040 --> 00:30:59,640
Guards.

604
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,640
Get the carriage ready.

605
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,240
So, Jiang Dahuo killed himself.

606
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,440
On the day when the Fourth Prince found out

607
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,440
that the exam question was leaked,

608
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,440
he went to the Second Prince for a reason.

609
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,240
Later, Meng Huai Rui and the Second Prince

610
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,840
were upset about this.

611
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,840
Then the tragedy happened.

612
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,840
I've reminded Second Brother

613
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,440
not to go out and look for flowers all day long.

614
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,240
Be strong and strong.

615
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:32,840
Otherwise,

616
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,640
he wouldn't have died so badly.

617
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:35,640
Your Highness.

618
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,240
We heard from the bamboo jade workshop.

619
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,840
They said that Miss Mo'er had poison.

620
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,640
It's just a chess piece that's broken.

621
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:47,640
It's okay.

622
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,240
Go on.

623
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,040
Your Highness.

624
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,040
Your Highness.

625
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,040
Now, Shen Zaiye is investigating the jade general.

626
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,440
I'm afraid that the jade general

627
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,040
is recommended by Meng family.

628
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,040
Yes.

629
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,640
The jade general comes from your family.

630
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,440
Meng Huai Rui also comes from your family.

631
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,840
I think

632
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,440
Meng Huai Rui was trying to get a name

633
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,640
and collude with my second brother for fame.

634
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,640
But the incident happened in the Eastern Window.

635
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,840
There was a dispute.

636
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,040
He didn't do well.

637
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,040
It has nothing to do with us.

638
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,040
I wonder if you

639
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,040
are willing to abandon your family.

640
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,240
Meng Huai Rui is not dead.

641
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,240
What I'm worried about is

642
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,640
whether Shen Zaiye will get married

643
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,240
or get married without any care.

644
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,840
Find out more.

645
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,040
If so,

646
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,240
let's make it clear.

647
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,840
He is my son.

648
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,240
What are you afraid of?

649
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:48,840
Come.

650
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:49,840
Doctor Bai.

651
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:50,840
Help.

652
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,040
Your Highness, this way.

653
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:52,840
Doctor Bai.

654
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:53,840
How is the antidote?

655
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,840
Your Highness, the antidote is still in the process.

656
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,840
According to the current condition of Madam,

657
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,040
I can only give her a painkiller

658
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,240
to ease the symptoms.

659
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,240
Okay, Mr. Lu.

660
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,240
Follow me.

661
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:13,840
Your Highness,

662
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,240
the antidote is ready.

663
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,240
It's ready.

664
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:17,840
Prime Minister,

665
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,440
there is a wolf's den in Meng Huai Rui's house.

666
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,440
We didn't find him.

667
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,040
Meng Zhenzhen wants to see you.

668
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,840
If she says she won't see you, you'll regret it.

669
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,240
You stay at the door.

670
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,240
If anything happens to her,

671
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,040
report to me at any time.

672
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:27,840
Yes.

673
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,640
It's just a theme.

674
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,640
What are you doing here?

675
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,840
Long time no see.

676
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,840
I'm here

677
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,840
to make a deal with you.

678
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,440
For Meng Huai Rui?

679
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,640
It's just a matter of time before we catch her.

680
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,040
Meng family can let you deal with Meng Huai Rui.

681
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,840
You can kill her.

682
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,840
But we can't get Meng family involved

683
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,640
until it's over.

684
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,640
Why?

685
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,640
Because of the life of Taohua.

686
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,840
I heard she's poisoned now.

687
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,440
She must be in great pain now.

688
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,640
It seems that the Meng family

689
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,640
has allied with Mu Wuyin.

690
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,040
It's meaningless to say more.

691
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,640
Do you want the antidote or not?

692
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,240
Whether it's destroyed

693
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,640
can be determined by your words.

694
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,240
How do I know

695
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,440
whether the antidote is real or not?

696
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,040
How do you want me to prove it?

697
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,040
Test the antidote.

698
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,240
If anything happens to Jiang Taohua,

699
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,640
I'll test you.

700
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,640
The antidote works.

701
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,840
I'll give Meng Huai Rui to you.

702
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,640
I don't want the antidote.

703
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,040
I want the antidote.

704
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,440
Give me the antidote.

705
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,240
I'll let your family go.

706
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,640
Why didn't you tell me

707
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,240
before you took the antidote?

708
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,240
It's you

709
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,240
who wants to make a deal with me.

710
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,040
I've never given you any conditions.

711
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,840
To be honest,

712
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,840
I don't have the antidote.

713
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,440
I just want to know

714
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,840
if you want to kill her.

715
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,640
I don't have the antidote.

716
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,640
I only have these two antidotes.

717
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,240
If you agree,

718
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,240
I'll give you all the antidotes.

719
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,040
If you don't agree,

720
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,240
Jiang Taohua will be poisoned next time.

721
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,640
She may not meet you again.

722
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,040
Leave the antidote.

723
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,040
Arrange for Meng Huai Rui to live in the Imperial Prison.

724
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,640
This time,

725
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,440
I'll let you go.

726
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,040
I'll let you go.

727
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,240
Don't worry, Your Grace.

728
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,040
I'll arrange for it.

729
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:08,640
Zhang Long.

730
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,440
Yes.

731
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,840
Tell Imperial Physician Bai

732
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,640
to break the root system immediately.

733
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,840
You've let Meng Jian go.

734
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,440
Imperial Physician Bai

735
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,440
will find a way to break the root system.

736
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,440
You can rest in peace.

737
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:27,840
Your Grace.

738
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,840
This is for the two-month period.

739
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,040
Thank you, Your Grace.

740
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,840
I have to go back to the Third Prince's Mansion.

741
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:44,840
Okay.

742
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,040
The Lotus Seal.

743
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,440
Why is the blood of Jiang Taohua

744
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,040
exactly the same as the crime scene?

745
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,840
Or is it that

746
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,040
the blood of the man in the Third Prince's Mansion

747
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,840
is exactly the same?

748
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:47,160
luggage from the palace

749
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,840
The flower is withered, the heart is broken

750
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,840
No need to tell me

751
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,840
How to love, love crazily like him

752
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,840
How to love, love crazily like him

753
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,840
How to love, love crazily like him

754
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,840
How to love, love crazily like him

755
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,840
How to love, love crazily like him

756
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,840
How to love, love crazily like him

757
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,840
