The Long Ballad

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Episode 18

3
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The Long Ballad

4
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Your Highness, what's going on?

5
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Li Jiao Han, why did you die?

6
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Li Jiao Han

7
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Li Jiao Han

8
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I am Li Jiao Han

9
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What's your name?

10
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
My surname is Mu

11
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
My surname is Mu

12
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Mr. Wei Ming is lighting up hope for us

13
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
If we can find the one that Jiang Kun wants in the book

14
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Everyone will find the one that is not easy to find

15
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Although the Peach Blossom Garden in Jiang Kun's heart is difficult to find

16
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But if there is something that he is concerned about when he is writing the book

17
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What's the difference from now?

18
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I should use my own power like Jiang Kun

19
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
To build a way for the Han disciples

20
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Xing Ke Jue

21
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The foundation of a country is talent

22
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The Han family's feast is a great honor for the Han family

23
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
This is the Han family of the country

24
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Only Xing Ke Jue can increase the ability of the imperial court

25
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The people will learn from the Han family

26
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The Han family will be loyal and filial to the country

27
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
This is a big matter

28
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
We will discuss it later

29
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Dismiss

30
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Dismiss

31
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I am willing to die to see you again

32
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Xing Ke Jue's behavior is not a monochrome way

33
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It will hurt the country's reputation

34
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
If the family is too big, the power will be destroyed

35
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The Han family will be in danger

36
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
If we don't use Xing Ke Jue to break the family's rules

37
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Long time ago, the imperial court's loss will hurt the foundation of the country

38
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The foundation of a country is to help the king and his father

39
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Xing Ke Jue will be famous and famous

40
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
He will be famous

41
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's cold and cold

42
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Your Highness, please go back

43
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Your Highness, please go back

44
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I will go back

45
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I will go back

46
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Your Highness, you haven't been on your knees for so long

47
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Will you be soft and answer Xing Ke Jue?

48
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Sounds good

49
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
He is a wolf's heart

50
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
He just wants to fight for power

51
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Second Prince is wise.

52
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
She's still kneeling outside?

53
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yes.

54
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Your Majesty, it's cold and cold outside.

55
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You should let Wu Xia return to the manor first.

56
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Don't make her fall ill again.

57
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I didn't ask her to kneel.

58
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
She can kneel if she wants to.

59
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
If she's cold, she can just pull her out and bury her.

60
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Zuo Xiang, look.

61
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Her Highness is kind and kindhearted.

62
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's rare to see Fourth Prince being so kind.

63
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
But I think His Majesty is right.

64
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
She can kneel if she wants to.

65
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Don't bother about her.

66
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Why?

67
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Your Highness, Fourth Prince is kneeling for the imperial examination.

68
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
He's kneeling to punish His Majesty.

69
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Because of the death of Li Jiao Han,

70
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
the people are angry.

71
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Many Han scholars are willing to hold the imperial examination.

72
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
If he's able to stand up,

73
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
it's equivalent to agreeing to hold the imperial examination.

74
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
But the imperial examination is a big matter.

75
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The imperial family will be in danger.

76
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The imperial family will be in danger.

77
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
The imperial family will be in danger.

78
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's better to deal with those scholars

79
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
to appease the imperial family.

80
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But Your Majesty,

81
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
should we do this secretly?

82
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
After all, the Northern Courtyard is still here.

83
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
The Northern Courtyard is still here.

84
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
We can't let the other countries laugh at us.

85
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Some people are making fun of us.

86
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's really hard to see the people making trouble.

87
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I don't think so.

88
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
But if we start this imperial examination...

89
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
If we start this imperial examination,

90
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
the imperial family will be against it.

91
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
If we start this imperial examination,

92
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm afraid Your Majesty will be in a hurry.

93
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm afraid Your Majesty will be in a hurry.

94
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
My country

95
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
is afraid that they won't succeed.

96
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What can I do

97
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
if I have to agree to this imperial examination?

98
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

99
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Your Majesty is a man of open mind.

100
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You have never lost a battle.

101
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm sorry for my words.

102
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Of course.

103
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Even if the imperial examination is opened,

104
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
they are against it.

105
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
They are just a few scholars

106
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
and they can't be counted as anything.

107
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Yes.

108
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
But the scholars have been in the imperial examination for many years.

109
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
What do you think

110
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
about this?

111
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
How about

112
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
letting the scholars

113
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
and the officials of the imperial family

114
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
take the imperial examination together

115
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
and strictly control the imperial examination?

116
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
This will not only save the face of the imperial family,

117
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
but also the hearts of the people.

118
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
What do you think?

119
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Very good.

120
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You are very thoughtful.

121
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'll give you my order.

122
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
After the Spring Festival next year,

123
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
we will hold a class.

124
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Qin Mian and

125
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Prince IV Mu Wu Xia will be the examiners.

126
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You will be

127
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
the supervisor.

128
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

129
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I've seen it.

130
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Let's go drink some wine.

131
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Your Highness, why is there a man out there?

132
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Your Highness.

133
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
By the will of Heaven,

134
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
the emperor has decreed

135
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
that the country will be prosperous and the people will be rich.

136
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It is decided that

137
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
the class will be held the day after tomorrow.

138
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Prince IV Mu Wu Xia

139
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
will be the supervisor.

140
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
The left-hand man, Shen Zai Ye,

141
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
will be the supervisor.

142
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
The right-hand man, Jin Zi.

143
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Your Highness.

144
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Brother Jiao Han,

145
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
did you hear that?

146
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
In the world,

147
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
do you have to see him?

148
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
My Lord,

149
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
everything is going as planned.

150
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
We are not bad.

151
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
His Majesty is holding a class.

152
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Prince IV will be the supervisor.

153
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You will be sent to all parts of the country.

154
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You must spread the three systems

155
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
and make the country prosperous.

156
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Do you understand?

157
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Yes.

158
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yes.

159
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
This time, the class will be held.

160
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I know that

161
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Prince IV is very important.

162
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
He came here with Bai Yi

163
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
to fight against Feng Xue.

164
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I want to have a different world

165
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
and make a fake story about him.

166
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I want to show those officials

167
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
what is called a good chance.

168
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Brother Jiao Han,

169
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
will the class be held the day after tomorrow?

170
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
The class will be held the day after tomorrow.

171
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
If you are there,

172
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
you must be a helper.

173
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It is the persistence of the Mo Wu Xia

174
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
and the day of your death

175
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
that I have.

176
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It would be great if you were still here.

177
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I should have gone to Gui City.

178
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I should have gone to Heaven

179
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
if I knew I would die.

180
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Wu Xia,

181
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
whether it is my father,

182
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
your mother,

183
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
or Li Jiao Han,

184
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
they would not have sacrificed their lives in vain.

185
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
This time,

186
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
we must remove the Ji Bi

187
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
and start a new chapter.

188
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm afraid that it will be a problem for us on our future journey.

189
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
A'Hua, I can explain to you.

190
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm not good at listening to explanations.

191
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Moreover, you are not the only brother of Mu Wu Xia.

192
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Am I right?

193
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Mu Wu Xia is not a brother of Mu Wu Xia.

194
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
He is a brother of Mu Wu Xia.

195
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
He is a brother of Mu Wu Xia.

196
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
He is a brother of Mu Wu Xia.

197
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Mu Wu Xia is a brother of Mu Wu Xia.

198
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm sorry.

199
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I was too indecisive.

200
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
As long as you agree,

201
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I will not let you down

202
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
with the plan I have made this time.

203
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I will not let you down

204
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
with the plan I have made this time.

205
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Okay, I promise you.

206
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I promise you.

207
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
A'Hua.

208
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
A'Hua.

209
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'm waiting for your good news in the North Campus.

210
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Third Brother, don't let me down this time.

211
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
What's the matter?

212
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Why are you holding the social security equipment?

213
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It has nothing to do with the Gra Fry Pan.

214
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
The U hiss at me

215
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
is only because I was worried.

216
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Then I didn't understand it.

217
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Is it the Fourth Prince?

218
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
No.

219
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
He's weak-minded.

220
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
He can't be so heartless.

221
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Then who could it be?

222
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Shen Zai Yin.

223
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
This matter

224
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
is in line with his usual behavior.

225
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
But what I don't understand is

226
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
why he...

227
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's good if it's him.

228
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's fine if it's not him.

229
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Once the trap is opened,

230
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm afraid he'll think of the Yellow River.

231
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
If he wants to stop it,

232
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
he can't.

233
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Once the imperial decree is issued,

234
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
the imperial examination will be held.

235
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Master.

236
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
The Third Prince asked the First Miss to come here.

237
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Please.

238
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
This is a good chance to get rid of him.

239
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It seems that the Third Prince

240
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
is also worried about the imperial examination.

241
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Why don't you cooperate?

242
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
The imperial examination

243
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
is about to begin.

244
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I'm afraid that

245
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
the imperial examination is about to begin.

246
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's settled.

247
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
If you want to turn the game around,

248
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
you need to clear the obstacles.

249
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Your Highness and my Meng family's goal are in line.

250
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Shen Zai Yin.

251
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Mu Wu Xia.

252
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
With you,

253
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I won't lose this time.

254
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Your Highness.

255
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:36,140
The

256
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
First Miss.

257
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Why are you here?

258
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
The imperial examination is about to begin.

259
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'm here to pay my respects to you

260
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
and ask for your advice.

261
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Ask for advice?

262
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Meng Huai Run.

263
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
How did you get here?

264
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
We know it well.

265
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Last time, the poor scholar

266
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
was here.

267
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
How could you ask for help in the imperial examination?

268
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I advise you to give up early.

269
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Don't be so self-conceited.

270
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You'll lose the reputation of the Meng family.

271
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm sorry.

272
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You're too modest.

273
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
You're a traitor.

274
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You're a traitor.

275
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You're a traitor.

276
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I won't bother you.

277
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
If I'm in danger,

278
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
the Meng family will welcome me.

279
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'll leave now.

280
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
You're so stupid.

281
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Send someone to keep an eye on him.

282
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Yes.

283
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Miss.

284
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Why are you here?

285
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
There seems to be something wrong.

286
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Is there someone inside?

287
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
No.

288
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Let me see.

289
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
The Prime Minister said

290
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
you're not allowed to enter Zhang Chun Pavilion.

291
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Why?

292
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
If you want to enter Zhang Chun Pavilion,

293
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
you must get the Prime Minister's approval.

294
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
My brother?

295
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You want to harm me?

296
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
What?

297
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
What?

298
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
My brother seems to be fine.

299
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
But as long as I mention the Jiang Tao Flower,

300
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
he'll be in trouble.

301
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
The Prime Minister is busy with

302
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
the related business of the imperial examination.

303
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
He's really angry.

304
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I've heard about it from the Prime Minister.

305
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Okay.

306
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I'll leave my brother alone.

307
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Don't follow me.

308
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Miss, you're quite mischievous.

309
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
This stove wants to fool me?

310
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I want to see

311
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
what you're up to.

312
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Qingtai?

313
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Didn't she disappear with Jiang Tao Flower?

314
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Why is she here?

315
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Where is she going?

316
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
No.

317
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I have to follow her.

318
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Why is this

319
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
the direction of Third Prince's Mansion?

320
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Who is it?

321
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Miss Qingying.

322
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Qingtai.

323
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Why are you here?

324
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I came with you.

325
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Since you're still alive, what about Jiang Tao Flower?

326
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Is she alive?

327
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
This way.

328
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Stop.

329
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Jiang Tao Flower?

330
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You're really alive?

331
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Why are you here?

332
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Why are you in Third Prince's Mansion?

333
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Why didn't you tell us that you're alive?

334
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
My brother didn't let me mention you.

335
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Zhan Lu said that my brother was angry because of the Prime Minister.

336
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
But I know that he did it for you.

337
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
The Prime Minister knows that I'm in Third Prince's Mansion.

338
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
What?

339
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
What?

340
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I was wrong

341
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
after I was hurt.

342
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I can't remember

343
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
what happened in Qi.

344
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Princess,

345
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
you still can't remember?

346
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Princess, why don't you just leave with us?

347
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It's not safe here.

348
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Qingtai, listen to me.

349
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You can't stay here for long.

350
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
If Third Prince knows that you're still alive,

351
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
he won't let you go.

352
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
You're still alive.

353
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Leave now.

354
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Qingtai's life?

355
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Qingtai, you're hurt?

356
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I'm almost recovered.

357
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I was just worried about Princess's safety

358
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
when I was taken in by that evil spirit.

359
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
That's good.

360
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
But don't talk about this.

361
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Can you just mind my brother's business?

362
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Qingtai, you're crazy.

363
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Actually,

364
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
since you disappeared,

365
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
my brother's condition has been bad.

366
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
At first,

367
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
he just sat in the Zhenchun Pavilion

368
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
and drank all night.

369
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Otherwise,

370
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
he just stayed in his room and looked up at the sky.

371
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
He didn't say a word to anyone.

372
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It's even more horrible now.

373
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I can't sleep or eat

374
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
or sleep

375
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
because of my work.

376
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Prime Minister,

377
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
you haven't eaten all day.

378
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Eat something.

379
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Everyone else said

380
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
he worked hard

381
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
to get the imperial examination.

382
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
But only I know

383
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
he didn't want to let himself

384
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
think of you.

385
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Shen Zaiye,

386
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
why are you like this?

387
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
You're not a good person.

388
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
You're not a good person.

389
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Why are you like this?

390
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Miss Meng'er,

391
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
this is the dried fruit that Third Prince ordered.

392
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Thank him for me.

393
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Yes.

394
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I'll put it here.

395
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Brother, Zhan Lu told me

396
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
you haven't eaten well for a long time.

397
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
This is not the place you should come.

398
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Go back.

399
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
You're hungry.

400
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Anyway, I don't care.

401
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I prepared so much food.

402
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Even if it's for me, you have to eat it all.

403
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I'm leaving.

404
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'm leaving.

405
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I'm leaving.

406
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Those memories are in the past

407
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
They last forever

408
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
My heart is filled with feelings

409
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
It's so cruel

410
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
You're back.

411
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Miss Meng'er,

412
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
His Highness came.

413
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

414
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I'm afraid you're not willing to leave the house.

415
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,160
You're so weak.

416
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:57,640
I wonder if you can continue to serve me in the future.

417
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,240
Of course.

418
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,000
Please tell me.

419
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,240
I want you to see Prime Minister Shen.

420
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,120
See Prime Minister Shen?

421
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,280
He's busy with work these days.

422
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,120
He seems to be not so sad about you.

423
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,520
Your Highness,

424
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,200
to be honest,

425
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,560
to be honest,

426
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,880
since you told me the truth last time,

427
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,400
I've been swearing that

428
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,560
I won't let you do anything wrong again.

429
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,000
So,

430
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,920
if he thinks so,

431
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,440
it's good.

432
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,160
I know you hate him.

433
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,240
You want to make it clear.

434
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,640
But now,

435
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:40,520
you're busy with work these days.

436
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,520
As a prince,

437
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,760
I should care about you.

438
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,000
I'm thinking about it.

439
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,360
Please go to see Prime Minister Shen.

440
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,400
So that he can work together.

441
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,840
Am I right?

442
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,120
The jade deer soup in Jinxiu Restaurant is good.

443
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,200
Please go to see him.

444
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,440
Your Highness,

445
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,760
what do you want to know?

446
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,320
I just need to see you more.

447
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,560
Yes, I understand.

448
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,200
Although the son of the Magistrate is partial,

449
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,040
he's the one who's holding Shen Zaiye's

450
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,360
whole chessboard.

451
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,520
Is he asking me to hold Shen Zaiye?

452
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,960
I can't let him be the prey for nothing.

453
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,800
I need to think of a way.

454
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,320
Please come in, Miss.

455
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,080
Miss Mo'er,

456
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,240
His Highness asked me to be gentle to you.

457
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,680
After all, you need to be a good maid.

458
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,280
I see.

459
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,920
In case you're suspicious,

460
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,760
I'll be waiting at the entrance.

461
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,040
If you need anything,

462
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,720
just tell me.

463
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,560
He sent Qingfeng to keep an eye on me.

464
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,320
It seems that this matter is of great importance to His Highness.

465
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,920
So I can't just sit and watch.

466
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,960
I don't know what he and Marquis Lv are up to.

467
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,520
Since their purpose is to hold Shen Zaiye,

468
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,040
I need to do something.

469
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,040
What are you thinking about?

470
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:47,400
So

471
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,480
Prime Minister Shen

472
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,160
Recently, Qingtai has Carter πε uncomfortable

473
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,760
at the Prime Minister's house

474
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,160
I have Zhan Lu to take care of me every day.

475
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,640
You can rest assured.

476
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,120
Qingtai has been with me for many years.

477
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,200
He has always been worried about me.

478
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,720
Now I can finally understand his feelings.

479
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,520
It's really a long journey.

480
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,720
Since you care so much,

481
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,360
why don't you come back with me?

482
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,460
Let's moisten our love by your sake!

483
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,920
I will read mother's favor to you!

484
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,300
Awesome!

485
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,960
Crown Prince,

486
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,100
please keep your position of Qingtai a secret.

487
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,020
After all, in the eyes of others,

488
00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:00,920
Qingtai is already a dead man.

489
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:05,120
But the person you forget is not important.

490
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,000
Have you ever thought that

491
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,400
even if Qingtai comes to tell me

492
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,240
that you are telling the truth,

493
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,120
I might just want to listen to the story of others

494
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,040
and not be able to feel it.

495
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,000
In this world,

496
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,800
only love can be forced.

497
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,400
It's getting late.

498
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,640
I have to go back.

499
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,280
Third Prince will be worried.

500
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,760
Miss Mo'er.

501
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,200
Miss Mo'er, please wait.

502
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,560
What's the matter?

503
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,520
I finally got the trust of Third Prince.

504
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,960
If there is nothing important...

505
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,080
What's important?

506
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,240
Qingtai.

507
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,360
And?

508
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:29,880
Nothing.

509
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,680
Shen Xiang.

510
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,840
Let's say goodbye.

511
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,720
Shen Zaiye.

512
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,400
Our position is different.

513
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,080
We are destined to be wronged.

514
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,800
It's better to take this opportunity

515
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,240
to return to the mortal world

516
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,080
and live in peace.

517
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,080
Jiang Taohua.

518
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,000
Why are you so determined?

519
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,880
Is it that in the future,

520
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,840
I can only watch you walk away step by step

521
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,920
and never look back?

522
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,680
In the end,

523
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,360
we are still the children of Xingcha Tazo.

524
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,400
After drinking this farewell wine,

525
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,840
in this life and this world,

526
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,960
we will never meet again.

527
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,080
Why can't I get through

528
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,800
the door of the world's women?

529
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,120
We are just strangers.

530
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,720
Why should I hate you?

531
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,160
Jiang Taohua.

532
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,320
Say that I regret it.

533
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,560
I regret that I didn't love you at first.

534
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,920
I regret it.

535
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,760
I love you.

536
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,680
You can look back

537
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,600
and see me.

538
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,920
Prime Minister.

539
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,720
It's late.

540
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,720
You should rest early.

541
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,080
You have been working hard

542
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,400
for the imperial examination.

543
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,160
If you continue like this,

544
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,520
you will not be able to eat.

545
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,880
Prime Minister.

546
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,320
Why do you do this?

547
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,760
There are so many good women in the world.

548
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,280
You...

549
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,440
You...

550
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,720
Some people

551
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,080
areцы nominee.

552
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,480
You should be impressed.

553
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,840
I have been thinking

554
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,840
Shen Zaiye.

555
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,840
The End

556
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,160
Jiang Dahuang,

557
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,760
you've already chosen your own path.

558
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,120
I won't force you anymore.

559
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,080
But the path you chose is too hard to walk.

560
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,840
I will

561
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,520
protect you from your back.

562
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,840
Your Highness has a long-term plan.

563
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,560
His Majesty only sent Minister Qin to be the examiner.

564
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,880
Your Highness and the Qin family

565
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,720
are more close than ever.

566
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,440
You don't need to be married.

567
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,840
My second brother

568
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,920
is greedy and greedy.

569
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,880
He's a great talent.

570
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,520
Such a fat piece of flesh is in front of him.

571
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,080
How can he not be married?

572
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,480
Your Highness,

573
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,560
what should we do next?

574
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,880
You shouldn't ask us what to do.

575
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,040
It's my second brother.

576
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,000
What should we do next?

577
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,000
Since you're thinking of a way

578
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,320
to sell the exam,

579
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,840
I understand.

580
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,480
I will send someone to keep an eye on his master.

581
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,920
When the time comes,

582
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,600
the master will come out to testify.

583
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,800
Then,

584
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,600
there will only be witness

585
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,160
but no evidence.

586
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,400
I won't easily make a charge for my second brother.

587
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,720
I...

588
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,560
I heard that your Meng family

589
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,920
once hired a craftsman

590
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,440
to carve out a close-up of me

591
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,040
on a small fruit shell.

592
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,560
Miss Meng,

593
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,440
why don't you

594
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,720
recommend this craftsman to my second brother?

595
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,920
Your Highness is so cunning.

596
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,840
I'll send someone to find craftsmen.

597
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,040
I won't let you down.

598
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,600
This bird's name is so annoying.

599
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,680
What a good bird.

600
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,560
Qing Feng,

601
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,680
I remember that there are two birds

602
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,440
in the test field.

603
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,600
Go and do something for me.

604
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,440
Leave.
