(Adapted from the novel "Peach Blossoms
Reflecting the River and Mountains")

00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:40,980
(by Bai Lu Cheng Shuang)

17
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,900
=Episode 35=

18
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,680
Have you heard about His Majesty?

19
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,760
I know he has passed.

20
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,680
Since you already know,

21
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,760
there's something important

22
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,800
I must give you.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,520
What is that?

24
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,720
The late Emperor's edict
to pass the throne to Changjue

25
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,480
is in my residence.

26
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,080
Your Majesty,

27
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,680
Empress Lv

28
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,080
lost her life
to the fire in the Qi palace.

29
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,480
There is unrest in the palace.

30
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,560
Please help stabilize the situation.

31
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,280
A nation cannot
go a day without its ruler.

32
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,720
Otherwise, Beiyuan will plunge
into chaos.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
My health

34
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,120
is failing me.

35
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,880
How can I lead?

36
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:35,840
Your Majesty,

37
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,080
Prince Changjue

38
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,800
has come back to Hao City.

39
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,160
Right.

40
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,880
I still have a son.

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,920
He

42
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,720
can be the regent.

43
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,280
If you do not pass the throne to him,

44
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,160
his leadership will be met
with difficulties.

45
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,720
Empress Lv's remaining followers
will give him trouble.

46
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,120
But how can I retire

47
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,320
in peace if I pass
the throne to him now?

48
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,200
Your Majesty,

49
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,680
why don't you pen an edict,

50
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,640
stating that only upon your demise

51
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,440
that the throne will be passed
to His Highness.

52
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,000
Okay.

53
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,320
Eunuch Yu at Imperial Study

54
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,160
can bring me the heirloom seal.

55
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,280
You...

56
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:46,880
Your Majesty,

57
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,920
I am a person of providence.

58
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,040
We wouldn't want anyone to persuade you
into penning another edict.

59
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:59,640
Now that the heirloom seal is broken,
this is the only edict you leave behind.

60
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,760
It is no longer safe for me to keep it.

61
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,600
Please come with me.

62
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,280
Your Highness, we can't trust him.

63
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,400
I know I have failed both you

64
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,520
and Empress Helan.

65
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,160
You may kill me now

66
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,760
and I will not protest.

67
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,800
So why didn't you

68
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,280
find a way to give Changjue the edict?

69
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,240
Instead, you went into hiding.

70
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,040
Cui Wei kept a tight watch
on the imperial palace.

71
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,040
He only left last night in a hurry.

72
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,680
I took a risk and snuck into the palace.

73
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,320
Then, I made His Majesty pen the edict.

74
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,640
I tried to find Changjue after

75
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,800
but he is nowhere to be found.

76
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,640
Your Highness, you know

77
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,240
very well what awaits you

78
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:47,800
and Changjue

79
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,320
once Empress Lv accedes to the throne.

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,360
Fine.

81
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,600
I'll come with you.

82
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
Don't pull any dirty tricks.

83
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:01,800
Or

84
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,320
you'll taste my blade.

85
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,640
After you, Your Highness.

86
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,400
Your Highness,

87
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,280
are we truly following him?

88
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,520
If this is a trap,

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,200
we will be walking into a trap.

90
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,480
Qingtai,

91
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,960
we've known each other for a while.

92
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,720
If I truly wanted to hurt Her Highness,
I would've done it much sooner.

93
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,280
Chancellor,

94
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,120
Zhan Lu reported that Her Highness

95
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,200
and her attendants went
to meet with Qian Mochen.

96
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,120
Tell everyone to head
to State Preceptor's Residence.

97
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,200
Understood.

98
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,360
I shall meet with you later.

99
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,600
Sir.

100
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,840
Why would you put the edict
in this kind of place?

101
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,160
Your Highness, please be reassured.

102
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,240
Your Highness,

103
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,080
the edict is inside.

104
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,320
As it is an important item,
only you should go inside.

105
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,440
You still think it's a trap.

106
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,080
There's always a catch
behind every sweet promise.

107
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,520
You taught me this back then.

108
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,560
I also taught you that you don't
earn anything

109
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,000
without giving something else away.

110
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,560
Okay.

111
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:55,840
I'll go inside.

112
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,600
Your Highness!

113
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:58,840
Qingtai,

114
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,840
you'll wait for me here with Zhan Lu.

115
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,160
(This is)

116
00:07:28,141 --> 00:07:28,760
(the edict.)

117
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,320
(A contraption.)

118
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,440
(The arrow is aiming at...)

119
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,480
What is the meaning
of this, State Preceptor?

120
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,120
Your Highness,

121
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,320
in life,

122
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,560
you cannot have everything.

123
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,880
Take the edict

124
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,400
and the old woman will be killed
by the contraption.

125
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,560
Save her and the edict will
drop into the bonfire and turn to ashes.

126
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,120
So will Changjue's future.

127
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,200
No need to hesitate.

128
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,040
She is but an old peddler by the street.

129
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,960
She is gravely ill
and her days are numbered.

130
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,640
Her life may yet prove some worth

131
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,600
if she can help you get the edict.

132
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,200
Your Highness,

133
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,040
what's taking you so long?

134
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,000
Kill a gravely ill woman

135
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,600
and you'll get the edict

136
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,800
to help Changjue achieve his dream.

137
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,280
Why save me?

138
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,960
To the common folks,

139
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,600
the edict is just a paper.

140
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,120
No life should be sacrificed for it.

141
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,200
Are you all right?

142
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,440
I'm fine.

143
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,920
But the elderly woman inside is weak.

144
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,080
She needs help.

145
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,320
State Preceptor,

146
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,560
what makes you think you can

147
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,640
dictate the life of a commoner?

148
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,490
Why didn't you pick
the edict, Your Highness?

149
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,720
Won't you regret it

150
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,040
if your decision costs Changjue

151
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,240
his future?

152
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:21,960
I won't.

153
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,760
I have ways

154
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,320
to make Changjue the next
emperor without the final edict.

155
00:10:48,525 --> 00:10:50,340
(Edict)

156
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,200
The final edict.

157
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,800
The final edict
can only be given to someone of integrity.

158
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,400
It was a test.

159
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,240
I wanted to know

160
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,040
that after all this hardship,

161
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,240
is there kindness in you still?

162
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,660
Will you be able to prioritize
your subjects

163
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,920
before absolute power?

164
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,480
Your Highness,

165
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,920
you've always done well.

166
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,160
And today,

167
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,600
you didn't let me down.

168
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,080
What happened to the heirloom seal?

169
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,160
Speak.

170
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,800
Who damaged such a vital artifact?

171
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,440
Forgive me, Your Highness.

172
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,440
Mercy, please.

173
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:45,800
His Majesty...

174
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,330
His Majesty asked me to bring
the heirloom seal to his chamber.

175
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,440
But what for?

176
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,040
Was there someone else in his chamber?

177
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,800
I wondered too.

178
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,920
I eavesdropped for a while
outside the chamber

179
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,360
and heard someone like State Preceptor.

180
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,880
State Preceptor?

181
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,760
Your Highness,

182
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,000
remember to lay low.

183
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,800
After all, you are easily outnumbered.

184
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,160
Perhaps I should be the one

185
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,120
to locate Changjue.

186
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,560
What if Empress Lv finds out?

187
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:26,880
I was worried

188
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,920
that Empress Lv might find out
and thus, my plan might fail.

189
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,520
But now that you have the final edict,

190
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,600
nothing holds me back anymore.

191
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,800
State Preceptor, why

192
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,360
did you help my brother and I?

193
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,360
I have never been loyal to Empress Lv.

194
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,840
Yet I was made to make

195
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,720
difficult choices.

196
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,720
I once told you

197
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,600
that right and wrong are nothing

198
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,960
before survival.

199
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,080
I did what I did

200
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,320
to keep you both alive.

201
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,320
I want to thank you,

202
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,120
but I can't find sincerity in my words.

203
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,160
Perhaps I will never understand

204
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,440
your rationale and sacrifice.

205
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,440
(Imperial Edict)

206
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,640
Looking at this edict,

207
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,560
I cannot say I am genuinely
grateful for my father.

208
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,960
He doted on Empress Lv so much

209
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,960
that he neglected Changjue and me.

210
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:28,920
His Majesty

211
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,520
harbored guilt toward you both

212
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,520
and the late empress.

213
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,560
Thank you for the white lie,
State Preceptor.

214
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,120
I know full well what kind of person

215
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,240
my father was.

216
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,480
Anyone there?

217
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,400
Open the gate.

218
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,760
Her Highness
needs to see State Preceptor.

219
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,600
Open up.

220
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,990
Chancellor, I found Zhan Lu's mark
inside the State Preceptor's Residence.

221
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,320
There's a hidden door behind.

222
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,040
We can sneak in there.

223
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,080
I ask for your patience.

224
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,720
Let me inform State Preceptor at once.

225
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,280
Inside!

226
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,920
Her Highness wants State Preceptor.

227
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,640
Your resistance will be met with death.

228
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,400
Her Highness wants Qian Mochen.

229
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,400
Don't give your life away for nothing.

230
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,320
They're here for me.

231
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,480
I'll have someone take you
to the secret passage.

232
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,720
What about you?

233
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,440
There are contraptions here.

234
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,720
We'll regroup later.

235
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,680
There's a hidden room.

236
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,480
Go inside.

237
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,360
Come. Over there.

238
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,280
Zhan Lu, where's Taohua?

239
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,600
Taohua.

240
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:36,560
Zaiye,

241
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,080
you're here.

242
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:39,960
I'm late.

243
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,200
Chancellor Shen, you came all the way
to Beiyuan for Her Highness.

244
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,720
You impressed me.

245
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,480
You flatter me, State Preceptor.

246
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:57,720
Zaiye,

247
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,120
State Preceptor got this edict

248
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,720
addressed to Changjue from my father.

249
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,160
Let's leave now.

250
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,720
I'll tell you everything once we're out.

251
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:07,680
Okay.

252
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,760
Qian Mochen,

253
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,520
all your attendants have been captured.

254
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,640
If you want to save them,

255
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:14,880
show yourself.

256
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,760
(An Chu, Qian Mochen's Confidante)
What do we do now, sir?

257
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,560
Take Her Highness
and Chancellor Shen away.

258
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,320
Remember what I told you.

259
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,080
State Preceptor.

260
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,600
My attendants followed me
for many years.

261
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,680
I won't leave them to die.

262
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,000
Don't worry.

263
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,040
All these years, Empress Lv trusted me.

264
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,800
I have ways to convince her.

265
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,880
I'll contact you once I'm safe.

266
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,400
State Preceptor, show yourself now

267
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,480
or these people will die.

268
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,640
Don't force my hands.

269
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,400
Are you sure you can escape?

270
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,880
Chancellor Shen, you too

271
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,240
have flirted with death many times
over the years.

272
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,080
Take care, State Preceptor.

273
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,120
Farewell.

274
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,040
An Chu,

275
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,080
Cui Wei is a ruthless man.

276
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,080
Let's take the old woman with us.

277
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,040
Okay.

278
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,560
State Preceptor's Residence
is connected to Beiyuan palace.

279
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,960
Qian Mochen is cunning.

280
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,960
Empress Lv could have never imagined

281
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,600
that we fled here.

282
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,800
Your Highness, this is...

283
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,160
The cold palace

284
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,120
Changjue and I grew up in.

285
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,280
Where was the secret passage built?

286
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,690
After Your Highness and Prince Changjue
became his students.

287
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,760
To avoid Empress Lv's detection,

288
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,640
he came
via this secret passage to tutor you.

289
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,880
And despite this passage,

290
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,440
he allowed Changjue and I

291
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,120
to be hunted

292
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,760
like prey

293
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,440
in the palace.

294
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:28,800
Your Highness,

295
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,320
State Preceptor is sorry
for what he did in the past.

296
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,880
But he did it to save you.

297
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,520
Empress Lv wanted to kill you
when she learned that you were escaping.

298
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,190
Had State Preceptor not feigned loyalty,

299
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,000
you and Prince Changjue
would have been dead.

300
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,390
Then why did he force Her Highness
to take the Jiangtao pill?

301
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,520
Every month, Her Highness endures
toxic pain.

302
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,400
State Preceptor

303
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,760
merely wanted to buy time.

304
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,280
Had he known that there is no antidote,

305
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,720
he wouldn't have done the same.

306
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,200
What?

307
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,080
There is no antidote?

308
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,800
Indeed.

309
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,500
(Mei Ling, Plague Doctor)
I am Mei Ling,

310
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,280
maker of Jiangtao pills.

311
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,240
You work for Empress Lv?

312
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,360
After Empress Lv went missing,

313
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,600
State Preceptor ran into

314
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,920
Physician Mei, who faked her death
to get out of the palace.

315
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,160
He took her into his residence

316
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,080
and interrogated her.

317
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:14,920
She claimed

318
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,880
that there is no antidote
of Jiangtao pill.

319
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,040
He ran into me?

320
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,720
He planned it.

321
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,720
If there is a monthly relief,

322
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,040
why isn't there a cure?

323
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,720
Who are you?

324
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,280
Who should I tell you?

325
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,720
You faked your death to flee.

326
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,840
That means you don't like Empress Lv.

327
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,160
Enemy of my enemy

328
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,360
is my friend.

329
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,000
I seek your help, Physician Mei.

330
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,480
Since you saved me twice,

331
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,320
I'll help you.

332
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,320
The monthly relief you take

333
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,440
cannot remove the toxin.

334
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,760
It merely suppresses it.

335
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,080
You took the Jiangtao pill
more than two years ago.

336
00:19:59,240 --> 00:19:59,960
Your Highness,

337
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,400
your days are numbered.

338
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,280
I hate owing someone favors.

339
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,960
I will try to find a cure for you.

340
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,600
Please, Physician Mei.

341
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,920
To make Jiangtao pills,

342
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,400
a poisonous flower must be present.

343
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,320
It is a rare flower

344
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,720
called Yinghuo.

345
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,800
Without the flower,

346
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,320
we can only dream of finding a cure.

347
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,880
What does it grow?

348
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,840
According to the records,

349
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,800
it grows in the desert.

350
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,920
Only Empress Lv

351
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,400
knows the exact location.

352
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:57,960
Zaiye,

353
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,560
it's okay.

354
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,720
We still have time.

355
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:30,720
Physician Mei,

356
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,720
this shall be your apothecary
for the moment.

357
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,920
Is that okay with you?

358
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:34,920
Yes.

359
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,280
Do you need

360
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,520
anything else?

361
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,440
Just speak frankly.

362
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,280
Do not beat around the bush.

363
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,160
As you wish.

364
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,840
Physician Mei,

365
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,600
is there truly

366
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,120
no cure

367
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,360
without the flower?

368
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,120
You are keen to search for the cure.

369
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,680
Who is Her Highness to you?

370
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,560
She is my wife,

371
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,000
the person I cherish the most.

372
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,680
We're running out of time,

373
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,080
and it's unsure if we can locate
the Yinghuo flower.

374
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,000
Please let me know

375
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,440
if there's any alternative.

376
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,680
I promise to save her, and so will I.

377
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,480
You don't have to beg me.

378
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,200
I have devised some ways
in the past years

379
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,480
to fight toxin with toxin.

380
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,400
But without Yinghuo flower,

381
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,120
I cannot know how effective it is.

382
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,120
Also, it is possible

383
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,320
to die from the poison

384
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,120
due to the exposure to various toxins.

385
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,600
It's better than waiting around.

386
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,560
Find me some willing testers then.

387
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,000
Where can we

388
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,760
find these people on short notice?

389
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,880
I can be your tester.

390
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,400
Chancellor!

391
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,360
I made the Jiangtao pill.

392
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,760
Once you take it,
it will take effect immediately.

393
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,120
Have you thought this through?

394
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,000
This is the best solution

395
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,480

don't do this.

Your Highness,

456
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,480
Deputy Chief Yue often told me

457
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,920
that his biggest regret

458
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,000
was failing to protect you
and Prince Changjue.

459
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,990
That's why both of you
had to seek refuge outside.

460
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,520
Now that His Highness has returned,

461
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,400
he would do anything

462
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,440

463
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,280

465
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,440
Your Highness, I am ashamed to admit

466
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,640
that I failed to carry out
my master's order

467
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,680
and protect His Highness.

468
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,040

472
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,560
Oh, Your Highness,

473
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,640
His Highness and I once agreed
to hide in a secret abode

474
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,680
if something happened.

475
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,980
I shall wait for His Highness there
in the days to come.

476
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:59,280
Empress Lv is searching for Changjue
everywhere in the city.

477
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,800
He probably cannot travel easily.

478
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,400
We should search around the secret abode

479
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,360
to take him in.

480
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,560
Yes, Your Highness.

481
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,720
Lift his head.

482
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,440
What did you do?

483
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,680
How could you torture

484
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,520
our handsome State Preceptor?

485
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,720
Rinse him.

486
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,000
You have fine humor, State Preceptor.

487
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,000
You find joy under these circumstances.

488
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,680
How admirable.

489
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,000
Unfortunately for you,

490
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,240
you pledged your loyalty

491
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,760
to the wrong person.

492
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,120
The poison will trigger
in a few days.

493
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,040
Give me the final edict

494
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,440
and I shall give you the cure
to Jiangtao pill.

495
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,920

496
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,600
there was a cure.

497
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,120

498
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,680
I am as good as dead.

499
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,990
I don't need to act
in front of you anymore.

500
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,960
Since you refuse to cooperate,

501
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,760
I'll just have to use you

502
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,280
as the bait.

503
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,880
What are you going to do?

504
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:36,520
Cui Wei,

505
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,520
put up notices in the city.

506
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,640
Tell them Qian Mochen will be beheaded
in three days.

507
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,360
Then, leak the information
that he is kept in the imperial prison.

508
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:49,640
Noted.

509
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,080
State Preceptor,

510
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,600
you know Jiang Changjue
better than I do.

511
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,240
If he was kind enough to help
the incriminated children in Luocheng,

512
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,000
perhaps he'll come to save you,

513
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,040
since you were his tutor,

514
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,320
and you got the edict

515
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,400
for him.

516
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,680
Once I get rid of him,

517
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,560
the edict is but a paper.

518
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,000
I despise you.

519
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,600
(Notice)
State Preceptor committed treason

520
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,680
by colluding with the enemy
and insulted Her Highness.

521
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,760
He will be beheaded in three days.

522
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:23,920
What?

523
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,840
How could this be?

524
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,520
He is such a kind official.

525
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,280
What happened to him?

526
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,160
Why?

(Notice)

528
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,160
Disgusting.

529
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,160
He is a traitor.

530
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,080
He deserves it.

531
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,200
Insulting Her Highness

532
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,440
shows that he is not a traitor.

533
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,680
He is a good person.

534
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:41,760
Are you crazy?

535
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,640

536
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:43,640
turn over.

537
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:44,880
I'm talking to you.

538
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,400
Stay there.

539
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,800
Nowhere to run now.

540
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,360

Your Highness,

You have finally returned.

546
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,040
Your Highness, I'm so happy you're safe.

547
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,080
My people, Father wrote his last edict

548
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,400
before he passed away

549
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,800
to pass the throne to Changjue.

550
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,920
Once we reclaim the imperial palace,

551
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,160
Changjue

552
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,800
will be Beiyuan's rightful ruler.

553
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,440
Yes!

554
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,760
- Greetings, Your Majesty.
- Greetings, Your Majesty.

555
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,520
At ease.

556

00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,520
Let me look at you.

561
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,640
Are you hurt?

562
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,280
Worry not, Taohua.

563
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,920
I am a tough guy.

564
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,480
I am fine.

565
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,120
Taohua,

566
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:21,960
what's with

567
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,400
this final edict?

568
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,320
Our tutor

569
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,240
gave it to us.

570
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:29,960
Qian Mochen?

571
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,760
Doesn't he work for Empress Lv?

572
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,080
He has been working

573
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,840
with Deputy Chief Yue in secret

574
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,080
to help you.

575
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,120
And those officials that you contacted

576
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,800
were paths paved by him.

577
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,920
And he obtained this edict

578
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,880
from Father.

579
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:50,920
I see now.

580
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,480
No wonder there's a notice on the street

581
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,160
saying that he will be beheaded
in three days.

582
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,000
Empress Lv is killing him?

583
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,880
What's the matter, Taohua?

584
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,760
I'm fine.

585
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,320
Why do you bear such a mark, Taohua?

586
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,000
I found this mark

587
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,120
on Empress Lv's death warriors
in Luocheng.

588
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,320
It means the poison is taking effect.

589
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,320
You were poisoned by Empress Lv.

590
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,680
You were a death warrior.

591
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,160
That Empress Lv!

592
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,920
Isn't it enough to marry you off
to a faraway nation?

593
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,080
Does she have no heart?

594
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,960
This edict is not important

595
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,600
as your life, Taohua.

596
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,080
I will raid the palace,

597
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,560
capture Empress Lv,

598
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,960
and get the cure for you.

599
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,000
Changjue,

600
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,000
do not be rash.

601
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,320
Do you know?

602
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:55,920
I thought

603
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,640
I had a miserable life

604
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,160
in Luocheng.

605
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,600
But compared to you,

606
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,000
my suffering is nothing.

607
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,840
Changjue,

608
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,080
I am leading a comfortable life in Qi.

609
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,320
Although I have this poison in me,

610
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,720
I ingest

611
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,520
a herbal relief every month.

612
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,640
Empress Lv and we are sworn enemies now.

613
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,840
They won't give us the relief anymore.

614
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,040
I still have some leftovers.

615
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:30,920
Show me.

616
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,240
I don't have them with me right now.

617
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,280
Taohua,

618
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,320
if you're lying to me,

619
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,800
I'll head straight to the palace

620
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,040
and get Empress Lv
to give you the antidote.

621
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,200
Changjue,

622
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,980
I don't have
the herbal relief with me anymore.

623
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,560
Taohua.

624
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,880
My days are numbered,

625
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,680
but our tutor is in danger.

626
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,880
We can't leave him to die.

627
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,760
But...

628
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,240
Changjue.

629
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:18,600
My friends,

630
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,160
I have news of the State Preceptor.

631
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,360
Your Highnesses,

632
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,950
I discovered
that prior to the execution,

633
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,960
State Preceptor
will be held in the imperial prison.

634
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,760
Taohua,
we must save him as soon as possible.

635
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,000
Your Highnesses,

636
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,000
if I may be frank,

637
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,040
my master once told me

638
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,720
that should Empress Lv capture him,

639
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,660
both of you were to not risk your lives
for him.

640
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,440
That's because

641
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,000
he's about to die too.

642
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,360
How come?

643
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,720
To obtain Empress Lv's trust,

644
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,240
he volunteered
to take the Jiangtao pill.

645
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,080
I have never been loyal to Empress Lv.

646
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,560
Right and wrong

647
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,160
are nothing before survival.

648
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,160
I did what I did

649
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,200
to keep you both alive.

650
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,440
Farewell.

651
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,520
Take care, State Preceptor.

652
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,280
At ease.

653
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:31,840
To us,

654
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,040
he is our mentor.

655
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:36,800
To the nation,

656
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,080
he is an important official.

657
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,840
If he dies to Empress Lv,
that will sow fear to other officials.

658
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,120
And then,

659
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,960
no one will dare defy Empress Lv.

660
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,200
Beiyuan will fall into tyranny.

661
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,560
Therefore,

662
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,040
we must save him.

663
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:53,480
Yes.

664
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,400
We must save him.

665
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,800
- We must save him.
- We must save him.

666
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,800
- Patience, please.
- We must save him.

667
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,800
We need a plan.

668
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,520
You must be Chancellor Shen.

669
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,960
We're not at Qi at the moment.

670
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,480
You'd be wise to stay out of this.

671
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,680
How did you find out
that State Preceptor

672
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,000
was held in the imperial prison?

673
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,840
A friend in the imperial prison told me.

674
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,320
Two days ago,

675
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,720
Cui Wei escorted State Preceptor
to the prison in secret.

676
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,040
Can he be trusted?

677
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,960
I trust him. We have been friends
for ten years.

678
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,240
Okay.

679
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,880
Can you do me a favor?

680
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,080
The food is here.

681
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,080
Give me some rice.

682
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,480
- Give me more.
- Give me more.

683
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,640
Do not fight.

684
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,980
I saw State Preceptor in the prison
with my own eyes.

685
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,760
I couldn't take a good look,

686
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,560
but he looked like State Preceptor
as shown in the portrait.

687
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,960
I suppose we must break into the prison.

688
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,080
What's the matter, Zaiye?

689
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:08,800
Tell me everything

690
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,640
you saw in great detail.

691
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,640
He was held in a solitary cell.

692
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,160
His meal was made privately.

693
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,400
He was eating?

694
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,360
Did you see how he ate?

695
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,480
Just like a normal person.

696
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,120
He held a bowl with his left hand,
and chopsticks with his right.

697
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:26,840
No.

698
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,680
He usually holds chopsticks
with his left hand.

699
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,860
The man in the cell
is not State Preceptor.

700
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,480
It's a trap then.

701
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:39,800
That means

702
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,200
Empress Lv is using State Preceptor

703
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,800
as bait to lure Changjue out.

704
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,200
I apologize.

705
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,240
Were it not for both of your

706
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,200
keen sense,

707
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,720
we would have all fallen
for Empress Lv's trap.

708
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,560
If

709
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,080
he isn't in the imperial prison,

710
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,120
where could he be?

711
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,160
All of you have fought Empress Lv
for many years.

712
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,800
What would you say is her biggest trait?

713
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,520
She's megalomaniac.

714
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,520
Distrustful,

715
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,080
and cruel.

716
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,320
I have a plan.

717
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,240
She doesn't know Taohua and I

718
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:24,880
are at Hao City.

719
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,040
Imagine that she knows

720
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,560
that we're here,

721
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,120
yet we haven't sent in anyone
to save State Preceptor.

722
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,360
Instead,

723
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,800
we try to buy time outside
of the imperial prison,

724
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,080
what will she think of it?

725
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,280
She'll assume

726
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,920
that we know

727
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,360
State Preceptor's whereabouts.

728
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,600
She'll have someone check on him,

729
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,960
or even check on him personally.

730
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,280
We just have to tail them

731
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,760
to find out where he is.

732
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,280
Good.

733
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,960
But this is a dangerous plan.

734
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,320
We are easily outnumbered
by her people.

735
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,080
Be very cautious.

736
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,136
- Yes.
- Yes.

737
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,160
Whatever it takes,

738
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,880
we have to rescue him tomorrow

739
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,320
and capture Empress Lv.

740
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,480
Then, we force her
to surrender the antidote.

741
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,360
Let me warn you

742
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,560
that this is a potent poison.

743
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,760
Are you sure about it?

744
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:47,640
Chancellor,

745
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,360
can we do this
after we rescue State Preceptor

746
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,040
and capture Empress Lv tomorrow?

747
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,560
Perhaps we can get the Yinghuo flower

748
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,760
from her.

749
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,640
We have a tough fight tomorrow.

750
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,190
Rescuing State Preceptor
is already a tremendous task.

751
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,880
If we fail to capture Empress Lv

752
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,200
and find the Yinghuo flower,

753
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,520
having another day

754
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:06,800
to test

755
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,920
the antidote might expedite
Physician Mei's

756
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,320
research.

757
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,360
Chancellor.

758
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,400
Chancellor!

759
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,680
Physician Mei, did we fail again?

760
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,920
Another failed attempt.

761
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,260
I am unable to find a replacement
for the Yinghuo flower.

762
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,720
I will find the flower.

763
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,160
Please don't give up, Physician Mei.

764
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,160
Let's continue.

765
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,680
There are too many toxins in your body,

766
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,440
not to mention the toxin
from Jiangtao pill.

767
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,160
You might die anytime soon,

768
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,000
let alone testing another poison.

769
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,560
Chancellor,

770
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,560
is she truly worth

771
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,560
your life?

772
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,160
Yes.

773
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,480
(Empress Lv,)

774
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,560
(for the pain you inflict on us both,)

775
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,080
(I will make you pay,)

776
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,400
