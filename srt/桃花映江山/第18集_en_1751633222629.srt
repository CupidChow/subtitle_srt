00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,760
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,040
Episode 37

3
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,680
Just now

4
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,080
I have lactate control

5
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,280
Just now

6
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:24,400
I just

7
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You dare to do that?

8
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,240
I dare not.

9
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,320
But there are many people here.

10
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,080
If I do it here,

11
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,240
I'm afraid Shen Zaiye will find out about the Blue Wings Pavilion soon.

12
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,680
If the Blue Wings Pavilion is destroyed,

13
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,320
Her Highness will suffer a lot in the Great Qi for years.

14
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,960
She will be in a loss.

15
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,360
It's not worth it to pay such a painful price

16
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,840
for a fourth prince.

17
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,360
Mo accidentally killed you?

18
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,520
Yes.

19
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,160
You mean

20
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,920
you have other ideas?

21
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,480
Unfortunately, its incense was just lit for a moment

22
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,240
and naturally很 degree before it extinguished

23
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,480
ają Leave Shen Zaiye nine years ago Patchouli Islands

24
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,960
Why don't we keep doing our job today?

25
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,440
it will kill you.

26
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,440
Don't worry, Qing.

27
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,720
This incense is just a little bit.

28
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,720
It won't affect its toxicity.

29
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,280
It's best to do this.

30
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,440
I'm usually very careful.

31
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,080
I'll stay outside the door today

32
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,400
and wait for the incense to burn out.

33
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,920
I'll wait for you.

34
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,120
Prime Minister,

35
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,480
Wang Xi just reported that

36
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,200
Fourth Prince asked the princess to leave the mansion.

37
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,360
There was an accident on the way

38
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,480
and he lost his shadow.

39
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,880
It happened so suddenly that Wang Xi was afraid...

40
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,160
Where is the princess?

41
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,640
She went out of the mansion and went to the teahouse.

42
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,320
And Yan Wanqing is also there.

43
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,240
Prime Minister,

44
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,800
our people are ready.

45
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,920
But the princess promised

46
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
to leave as soon as she goes.

47
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,560
It's time to burn the incense.

48
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,360
The toxic gas in here

49
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,360
is enough to kill the fourth prince.

50
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,600
Now Qing is relieved.

51
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,120
This time, I finally didn't let you down.

52
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,520
Don't worry.

53
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,560
I'll give you a reward.

54
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,320
The peach blossom seed money failed.

55
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,600
This time, I'll atone for my crime.

56
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,960
I don't dare to give you a reward.

57
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,720
Your Highness always

58
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,720
gives rewards and punishments.

59
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,760
If you do it right, you should get a reward.

60
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,120
But if

61
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,400
I don't hear Mu Wuxia's death message tomorrow,

62
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,400
you'll be the one who gets into trouble again.

63
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,720
I'll report to you.

64
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,960
Since you and Cheng Jue are together,

65
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,960
I don't need to say more.

66
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,720
Don't worry.

67
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,520
Your Highness.

68
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,320
Your Highness.

69
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,280
Your Highness.

70
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,040
Wake up.

71
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:26,840
Your Highness.

72
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,400
Your Highness, add more flour.

73
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,000
Or the toxic gas will be too strong.

74
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,080
No.

75
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,760
Yao Wanqing is a cautious person.

76
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,760
If there's too much flour, he'll find out.

77
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,960
Only by doing this,

78
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,600
can we hope to deceive the country.

79
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,080
It's okay.

80
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,080
Recently,

81
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,120
we'd weather lots of harvest.

82
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,160
So I'll save the loot.

83
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,040
Naturally,

84
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,320
push whom to refrigerator.

85
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:17,440
You should broil the

86
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,440
My cousin is a genius.

87
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,440
He's also someone I've been chasing all my life.

88
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,440
I wonder where he is now.

89
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,440
He's long gone.

90
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:32,440
Could it be that Shen Zai is also the cousin

91
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,440
that Prince IV has been talking about?

92
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,440
Having been called so wetly,

93
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:54,440
will he still possess the same opportunities as inside your heart?

94
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,360
What's wrong with you?

95
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,060
You're going to spear their head?

96
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,560
Your Highness.

97
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,320
Are you talking to철?

98
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,000
Your Highness.

99
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,760
Your Highness.

100
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,560
My Lord, it's Duan Hun Xiang.

101
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,440
Take Fourth Prince back to treat him.

102
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,040
Yes.

103
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,360
Duan Hun Xiang.

104
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,280
When can you save him?

105
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,600
Since you've decided that I'm going to harm him,

106
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,600
why bother to waste your breath?

107
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,600
Take him away!

108
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,440
Jiang Tao Hua.

109
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,360
You said you wouldn't hurt Fourth Prince.

110
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,640
Tell the people behind me

111
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,840
that I won't save him today.

112
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,920
I said I was saving someone,

113
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,760
but you locked me in the prison.

114
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,240
Is this what you said to believe me?

115
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,480
Duan Hun Xiang is stable and has a soul.

116
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,360
Now Fourth Prince is in a coma.

117
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,040
He's been stabbed in the neck.

118
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,200
You're holding a knife in one hand.

119
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,640
Tell me how to believe you.

120
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,720
If that's the case,

121
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,040
even if I tell the people behind me,

122
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,240
won't you suspect

123
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,640
that I'm doing this to save him?

124
00:09:48,680 --> 00:10:09,880
I've still written it.

125
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,520
Who's behind all this?

126
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,320
Who's behind this?

127
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,720
I'm afraid you'd better think it over before you answer.

128
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,520
I've thought it over.

129
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,280
I and Prime Minister

130
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,240
will never trust each other in this life.

131
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,640
If that's the case,

132
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,480
it's better to make it clear earlier.

133
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,040
If you want to torture me,

134
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,280
please do it yourself.

135
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,640
Do you think I dare not?

136
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,440
Why?

137
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,360
Why is it the Fourth Prince?

138
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,880
Don't you know how he treats you?

139
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,440
Is your heart made of iron?

140
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,120
You should have known it earlier.

141
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,920
A person like me,

142
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,720
as long as I'm alive,

143
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,640
I can say anything.

144
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,400
I can scare anyone.

145
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,040
What a game someone can play!

146
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,720
Compared with that you're dead and won by my hands.

147
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,640
Can't this be done for any дост没有 Robertson?

148
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,080
Of course.

149
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,680
I lost my life for tryna do something.

150
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,800
Anyhow,

151
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,040
at least they won't do me harm now.

152
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,480
We can agree on one thing.

153
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,480
Losing your life is no surprise.

154
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,720
In the hunting ground,

155
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,520
didn't you also count your own life?

156
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,880
Didn't you say that the arrow came in a strange way?

157
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,640
But there are only blood and those medicines.

158
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,920
If you didn't prepare it earlier,

159
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,280
how did the arrow come in a strange way?

160
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,800
I just kept the porcelain in front of my chest.

161
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,320
Prime Minister thought that I was trying to get close to you.

162
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,800
But I'm sorry that I've never met anyone

163
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,720
who truly treats you in this life.

164
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,780
Don't you loss your control and hurt each other

165
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,640
I was so happy that I lost.

166
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,440
I have so many feelings for you.

167
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,160
A single face.

168
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,440
Maybe I can make something with you.

169
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,560
A life ça pink...

170
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,400
is falling apart from you.

171
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,320
If you granted me this gift nostalgic,

172
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,580
You are installation and

173
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:07,260
you are an ex liberator?

174
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:12,880
Stop acting rashly on it!

175
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,920
You are.

176
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,580
No one can betray me for love.

177
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,080
If I let you,

178
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,800
I'll say goodbye.

179
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,000
I have only hair and blood to afford.

180
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,480
and our love.

181
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:32,800
Prime Minister.

182
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,720
How is Fourth Prince?

183
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,000
The doctor said that he was not poisoned much.

184
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,120
He'll wake up after a few days of sleep.

185
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,240
We'll see how he is in a few days.

186
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,520
Send out the message to him.

187
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,960
Fourth Prince will go to

188
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,000
Shangjing Mountain and do some work tomorrow.

189
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,160
You want to lure the snake out of the cave?

190
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,280
It's better to leave the thief for a few days.

191
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,880
You'll take someone to do the packing tomorrow.

192
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:50,960
Understood.

193
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,080
Prime Minister.

194
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,560
He didn't say anything.

195
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,880
We had to use the whip.

196
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:04,600
Stop!

197
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,440
Prime Minister.

198
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,960
Take her back to Chengchun Pavilion.

199
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,880
I'll bear it myself.

200
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,280
Your Highness.

201
00:14:59,200 --> 00:14:59,960
I'll go find the medicine.

202
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,640
No need.

203
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,640
I've already taken care of it.

204
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,560
I'll kill you

205
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,000
if you keep acting like this.

206
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,680
Qingtan.

207
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,720
You should take the revenge

208
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,160
if you make a mistake.

209
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,680
Can we stop the bet?

210
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,320
I don't want you to get hurt again.

211
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,200
It's not the time to cry.

212
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,000
We have more important things to do.

213
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,040
How is Fourth Prince?

214
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,960
You haven't come back.

215
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,480
So I went out to find out the news.

216
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,640
I heard that Fourth Prince is fine.

217
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,400
He'll go to Shangjing Mountain tomorrow

218
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,600
to relax.

219
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:53,800
Impossible.

220
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,720
Although I've changed the incense,

221
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,640
he still needs to sleep for at least one day and one night.

222
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,800
Shen Zai must have released fake news on purpose

223
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,720
to lure the snake out of the hole.

224
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,680
This is a turning point.

225
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,880
I'll take the opportunity.

226
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,760
I have to go out to find Yang Wanqing.

227
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,080
But if he knows that

228
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,760
we're going to find Yang Wanqing now,

229
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,760
I'm afraid that

230
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,720
he and I

231
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,280
will never see the future.

232
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,080
The best place to kill

233
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,400
is the mountain road of Mount Yuguishan.

234
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,440
They will never miss this opportunity.

235
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,000
Don't worry, Prime Minister.

236
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,440
We've finished our deployment.

237
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:43,880
Prime Minister.

238
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,040
A letter from Zhengchun Pavilion.

239
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,240
Prime Minister.

240
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,360
Prime Minister, the action is urgent.

241
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,440
We'd better not take any more chances.

242
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,880
I want to see

243
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,320
what he's going to do.

244
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,640
Do as I say,

245
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,800
and I hope you can give us an account.

246
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,680
There's a medicine in my mouth.

247
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,320
Please be careful, Princess.

248
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,000
The sa Erfolgol's elixir

249
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,600
She should arrive any moment now

250
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,240
Doctor

251
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,480
Catch it

252
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,480
Jiang Tphu

253
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,000
This is what you want to say to me

254
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,000
Don't go

255
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,080
Don't go

256
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,300
Although we are on the road,

257
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,120
as long as we're together

258
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,620
for 영상,

259
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,800
we're okay, all right?

260
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,140
I get it now.

261
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,140
родни tar,

262
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,600
The more you grow,

263
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,060
you get publicity and attention.

264
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,040
You can't leave product after product.

265
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,720
I understand.

266
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,880
I'm sorry to hear you say that.

267
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,280
You don't need toыв

268
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,280
And it's Seventh Prince, blown away by the lava at the base of the river.

269
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,380
You two are the only good bros.

270
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,920
This is another one of my mockery.

271
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,100
Are you lying to me?

272
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,480
An怎麼樣道 нак STRoughing that message?

273
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,760
Great 오혁 Barcelona is 1975.

274
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,280
Before the old life,

275
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,140
with all the ummah and lands,

276
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,260
a young noble farmer

277
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,540
I will leave the country

278
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,260
and I will be punished for it.

279
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,500
You want to be together forever,

280
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,860
so you leave here.

281
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,140
Don't think about it.

282
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,780
It's because I have no name in my life.

283
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,220
So I have to be together.

284
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,860
In case I will be involved in the banquet.

285
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,780
You are thinking about me.

286
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,420
You can save me with your hands.

287
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:27,260
If you can save me with your hands.

288
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,340
Always loveliest

289
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,300
Go

290
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,540
Now it's time.

291
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,980
Do you remember the first time we met?

292
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,580
Then why did we meet?

293
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,460
It's

294
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,300
the one thing

295
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,500
we two want.

296
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,900
Yet there is nothing

297
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,300
I'm sorry

298
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,300
for marrying you

299
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,300
I'm sorry

300
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,300
Although the chess game is over

301
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,300
I have no regrets

302
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,300
Do you remember

303
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,300
the days in Tianshui Village?

304
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,300
Although it's only a few days

305
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,300
it's the happiest time of my life

306
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,300
If possible

307
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,300
I'd like to give up everything

308
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,300
and find a quiet place

309
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,300
plant fields and plant cloth every day

310
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,300
raise chickens and ducks

311
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,300
Such days

312
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,300
are still worth it

313
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,300
How happy you are!

314
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,300
You've ruined my life

315
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,300
Now you just leave

316
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,300
and want to find a quiet place

317
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,300
and live a peaceful life

318
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,300
Jiang Dahuang, remember

319
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,300
I'm not the one you

320
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,300
want to marry

321
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,300
You asked for this marriage

322
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,300
Even if you die

323
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,300
you have to walk with me

324
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,300
Get out

325
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,300
It's more painful

326
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,300
to live with the one you don't trust

327
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,300
day by day

328
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,300
You've already

329
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,300
checked it, haven't you?

330
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,300
I'm sorry

331
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:59,300
After drinking this farewell wine

332
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,300
we can't forget

333
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,300
this life and this world

334
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,300
I don't care

335
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,300
if you want to live a peaceful life

336
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,300
I won't

337
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,300
I won't

338
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,300
I won't

339
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,300
I won't

00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,300
I won't

341
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,300
I won't

342
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,300
I won't

343
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,300
I won't

344
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,300
I won't

345
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,300
I won't

346
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,300
I won't

347
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,300
I won't

348
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,300
I won't

349
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,300
I won't

350
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,300
I won't

351
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,300
I won't

352
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,300
I won't

353
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,300
I won't

354
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,300
I won't

355
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,300
I won't

356
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,300
I won't

357
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,300
I won't

358
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,300
I won't

359
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,300
I won't

360
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,300
I won't

361
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,300
I won't

362
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,300
I won't

363
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,300
Zhang Lu

364
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,300
Premier

365
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,300
Your token

366
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,300
Leave it

367
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,300
We follow the plan

368
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,300
and kill all those who want to kill the Fourth Prince

369
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,300
What if

370
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,300
there's a princess among those who go up the mountain?

371
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,300
Those who go up the mountain

372
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,300
will be killed

373
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,300
What if

374
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,300
there's a princess among those who go up the mountain?

375
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,300
Those who go up the mountain

376
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,300
will be killed

377
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,300
by the four-th prince

378
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,300
Yes

379
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,300
Princess, you're so bold

380
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,300
You dare to come here

381
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,300
Sister Qing

382
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,300
Let's talk inside

383
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,300
It's fun

384
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,300
Please spare me

385
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,300
Yesterday, Shen Zai Ye came suddenly

386
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,300
and saved my life

387
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,300
Princess is smart

388
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,300
and has a good sense of humor

389
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,300
I'm not as good as her

390
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,300
But a fool has his own way

391
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,300
I'll see the result without you

392
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,300
Yesterday

393
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,300
no matter how the treacherous Prime Minister

394
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,300
was beating me

395
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,300
I didn't tell the truth

396
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,300
Today I got the chance

397
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,300
and came to report to you

398
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,300
I just want to atone for my crime

399
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,300
I and my brother

400
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,300
are at the mercy of the Empress

401
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,300
I dare not have any second thoughts

402
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,300
Today

403
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,300
the five-th prince will go to the mountain

404
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,300
Tao Hua

405
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,300
Please help me

406
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,300
If the third prince knows

407
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,300
the mistake he made that day

408
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,300
wasn't the fourth prince's

409
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,300
can he

410
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,300
take the blame?

411
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,300
One more thing

412
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,300
Tao Hua wants to ask for forgiveness

413
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,300
I know who did this

414
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,300
when Eunuch Ren died

415
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,300
Nonsense

416
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,300
I had no intention to pretend to be down

417
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,300
I was so scared

418
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,300
that I didn't dare to admit it

419
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,300
These days

420
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,300
I've been assigned

421
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,300
to assassinate Mu Wu Xia

422
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,300
I guess

423
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,300
it's related to Eunuch Ren's death

424
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,300
I've been thinking for a few days

425
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,300
The person you trust

426
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,300
should be the one I love

427
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,300
I'm willing to do anything for him

428
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,300
I didn't mean to

429
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,300
disobey you

430
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,300
Please tell me

431
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,300
to kill the royal family

432
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,300
and make a big deal out of it

433
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,300
You can take the long-term plan

434
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,300
and make sure it's done

435
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,300
Do what you should do

436
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,300
Don't say anything you shouldn't say

437
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,300
Princess

438
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,300
I know you and Mu Wu Xia

439
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,300
are like brothers

440
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,300
But Mu Wu Xia must die today

441
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,300
Otherwise

442
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,300
Chang Jue will be the one who dies

443
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,300
I understand

444
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,300
Please forgive me

445
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,300
I was not good at my job

446
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,300
I shouldn't have trusted him that day

447
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,300
But if

448
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,300
what Jiang Taohua said was true

449
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,300
then we still killed Mu Wu Xia

450
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,300
If the situation is in chaos

451
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,300
will it ruin the big event of the empress?

452
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,300
The crown prince has been demoted

453
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,300
We three are left

454
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,300
My brother is depended on the Qin family

455
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,300
We can't kill him for now

456
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,300
I thought my brother

457
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,300
would stay in the palace for a long time

458
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,300
and no one would care about him

459
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,300
But I didn't know

460
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,300
he and Shen Zaiye were so close

461
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,300
In this case

462
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,300
what Jiang Taohua said

463
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,300
was true

464
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,300
or false

465
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,300
It doesn't matter at all

466
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,300
What matters is

467
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,300
my brother

468
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,300
must die

469
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,300
Your Highness, you are awake

470
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,300
I'm fine

471
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,300
I'm fine

472
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,300
I'm fine

473
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,300
What's wrong with me?

474
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,300
It's still that Jiang Taohua

475
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,300
He wanted to harm you

476
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:37,300
and set up the broken incense for you

477
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,300
We are wrong

478
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,300
Fortunately, you came in time

479
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,300
and saved you

480
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,300
Come

481
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,300
Your Highness, stop talking

482
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,300
Don't let your throat

483
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,300
get sick

484
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,300
Take a rest

485
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,300
I'll get the doctor for you

486
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,300
Your Highness

487
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,300
Wake up

488
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,300
Your Highness

489
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,300
It's good that you are fine

490
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,300
I remember Jiang Taohua

491
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,300
What are you doing?

492
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,300
I'm saving people

493
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,300
I'm going to find the Prime Minister

494
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,300
Your Highness

495
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,300
Flowers are on sale

496
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,300
Fresh flowers

497
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,300
Come and have a look

498
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,300
Fresh flowers

499
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,300
Come and have a look

500
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,300
Come and have a look

501
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,300
Come and have a look

502
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,300
Look at my flowers

503
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,300
Do you like them?

504
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,300
Take care

505
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,300
Your Highness

506
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,300
Go

507
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,300
Come, Qian

508
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,300
Don't worry

509
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,300
I won't use my life

510
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,300
as a bet

511
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,300
There won't be any mistakes

512
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,300
Please have a look

513
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,300
The mountain of Yuguishan

514
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,300
is steep and steep

515
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,300
The top of the mountain is dangerous

516
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,300
The abyss is deep

517
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,300
The bottom is the water of the Pond

518
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,300
Once it falls

519
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,300
Even the most solid rock

520
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,300
will fall to the ground

521
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,300
If it falls down

522
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,300
even if it doesn't die

523
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,300
it will be crushed by the rocks

524
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,300
and broken by the branches

525
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,300
I don't need to analyze

526
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,300
the recent events

527
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,300
for you

528
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,300
I understand

529
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,300
It's important

530
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,300
If there is any accident

531
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,300
please be careful

532
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,300
and be careful

533
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,300
We have the same goal

534
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,300
It's natural

535
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,300
Shen Zai wants to pretend

536
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,300
to lure the snake out of the cave

537
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,300
We'll do it in order

538
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,300
I'll go

539
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,300
and lure Yang Wanqing out

540
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,300
to kill him

541
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,300
It can relieve the trouble of the Fourth Prince

542
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,300
and ask him later

543
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,300
We can also

544
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,300
put this matter on Shen Zai

545
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,300
There is a dangerous road

546
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,300
on the mountain

547
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,300
I'll do it here

548
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,300
When I go to Yang Wanqing

549
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,300
you go and change the carriage

550
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,300
and wait for me

551
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,300
here

552
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,300
in the secret place

553
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,300
If I succeed

554
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,300
I'll send a signal

555
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,300
You need to meet me

556
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,300
after receiving the signal

557
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,300
Otherwise

558
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,300
I'm afraid the carriage man

559
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,300
will harm me

560
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,300
Princess

561
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,300
Can't I stay with you

562
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,300
in the carriage?

563
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,300
Yang Wanqing doesn't believe me

564
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,300
If you are here

565
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,300
he won't go with me

566
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,300
Sister Qing

567
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,300
We need to go faster

568
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,300
I'm afraid Mu Wuxia

569
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,300
has reached the top of the mountain

570
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,300
Go faster

571
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,300
Hurry up

572
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,300
I didn't expect

573
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,300
you would do it

574
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,300
for Mu Wuxia's safety

575
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,300
If it weren't for

576
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,300
the Third Prince's warning

577
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,300
you would have been

578
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,300
harmed today

579
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,300
Don't think that

580
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,300
you are the smartest person

581
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,300
You think that

582
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,300
everyone is playing with you

583
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,300
in the valley

584
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,300
With Shen Zai's

585
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,300
strictness

586
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,300
he just found out

587
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,300
Mu Wuxia

588
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,300
is in danger in the tea house

589
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,300
He is not afraid

590
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,300
of you

591
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,300
How could you

592
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,300
let him out

593
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,300
You even asked me

594
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,300
to come here

595
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,300
to talk to me

596
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,300
Isn't it more strange?

597
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,300
Fourth Prince

598
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,300
Fourth Prince

599
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,300
What did you do to him?

600
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,300
Why is he here?

601
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,300
You can lure the snake out of the cave

602
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,300
I can't stay here

603
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,300
and wait for the rabbit

604
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,300
This silly boy

605
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,300
hasn't got over

606
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,300
the spirit-shedding incense

607
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,300
yet he wants to

608
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,300
make your wish come true

609
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,300
He was caught by

610
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,300
our men

611
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,300
directly

612
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,300
Good

613
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,300
And your maid

614
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,300
is called Qingtai

615
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,300
She also understands

616
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,300
the secret of

617
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,300
the secret of the mechanism of our North Court

618
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,300
So I asked someone

619
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,300
to do the same

620
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,300
The North Court's

621
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,300
spy Jiang Taohua

622
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,300
tried to kill the Prince of Qi

623
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,300
and was found by

624
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,300
the Prime Minister of Qi, Shen Zai

625
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,300
He was caught on the spot

626
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,300
This story

627
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,300
that Lan Yi Pavilion

628
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,300
didn't take part in

629
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,300
sounds very complete

630
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,300
What do you think?

631
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,300
Your Highness

632
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,300
Your Highness was wronged

633
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,300
He didn't want to kill the Fourth Prince

634
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,300
Let me go

635
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,300
If he was wronged

636
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,300
he shouldn't have

637
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,300
appeared here

638
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,300
Let me go

639
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,300
Let me go

640
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,300
