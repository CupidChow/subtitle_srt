1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,360
The wind and rain scatter and the clouds are still.

2
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,120
How can I live my life

3
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,480
as long as I can?

4
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,400
If I could stay with you for the rest of my life,

5
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,040
if you could understand my true feelings,

6
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,520
I would be in a state of silence

7
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,840
and have no memories.

8
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,080
Even if I can hold on to you

9
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,240
for the rest of my life,

10
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,200
I would be in a state of silence

11
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,600
and have no memories.

12
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,200
Even if I can hold on to you for the rest of my life,

13
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,400
if you could understand my true feelings,

14
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,440
I would be in a state of silence

15
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,920
and have no memories.

16
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,480
Even if I can hold on to you for the rest of my life,

17
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,840
I would be in a state of silence

18
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,880
and have no memories.

19
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,440
Even if I can hold on to you for the rest of my life,

20
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,360
I would be in a state of silence

21
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,640
and have no memories.

22
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:52,240
Even if I can hold on to you for the rest of my life,

23
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,080
if you could understand my true feelings,

24
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,880
what should we do?

25
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,160
We can't sit here and wait.

26
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,480
Jiang Taohua.

27
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,800
Where did he learn those tricks?

28
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,760
How many days has he been in the manor?

29
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,560
Why is the Prime Minister so patient?

30
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,920
Taohua just said he would be a man of love.

31
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,640
You don't have to be so serious.

32
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,320
I have to be serious.

33
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,560
I'm a man of love.

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,280
I'm the most favored man in the manor.

35
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,480
You're the target of everyone's jealousy.

36
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,560
You're targeting everyone.

37
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,160
You're really smart.

38
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,640
There will be many more things like this in the future.

39
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,960
You'll get used to it.

40
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,440
And the Prime Minister has occupied Taohua's bedside Where can I sleep?

41
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,440
If Mrs. Jiang thinks you're sleepy,

42
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,560
you can come upstairs anytime.

43
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,800
I'm going to wait.

44
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,000
No need.

45
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,760
is this some case of two men for Alwaysage astringency god,

46
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,600
Wen cyberlayer Zhang Zining.

47
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,580
I really don't want the public to know

48
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,780
he is the man.

49
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,180
Your Royal Highness.

50
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,040
I'm well beings of vegetables.

51
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,960
Please forgive me.

52
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:11,820
Little sister.

53
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,280
예요

54
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,920
Yes.

55
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,240
Prime Minister.

56
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,480
What did those people outside say?

57
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,360
You heard it.

58
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,280
They said that I'm a princess

59
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,720
and I didn't even get married.

60
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,560
They said that I'm self-righteous

61
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,040
and I'm a country bumpkin.

62
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:46,580
I'm a

63
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,820
I'm not good enough for you.

64
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,820
Do we have to make a fuss over some false names?

65
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,140
It's not a false name.

66
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,220
It's attitude.

67
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,020
What did you tell me last night?

68
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,860
You said that even if I wanted the moon on the horizon,

69
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,140
you would take me there.

70
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,340
And we don't have

71
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,540
so many bad rules in the Northern Courtyard.

72
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,380
I only know that

73
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,580
the one who is in love

74
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,820
must be boldly

75
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,620
tell the emperor.

76
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,660
No.

77
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,860
Since I couldn't accept it at that time,

78
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,540
why did I get married?

79
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,780
Now the rain is heavy.

80
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,100
And the wedding is in the face of Meng Family.

81
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,860
They say that the children in the Northern Courtyard

82
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,020
are kind and warm-hearted.

83
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,340
They are brave and hateful.

84
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,060
I've seen it today.

85
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,220
Sister Jiang is not a crazy person.

86
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,700
Today, she asked for it.

87
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,700
It means that

88
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,020
she really cares about you.

89
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,580
You love him so much.

90
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,020
I'm too happy to be here.

91
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,820
How can I feel ashamed?

92
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,220
Sister Meng said so.

93
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,420
If you keep being a hindrance,

94
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,500
don't tell me

95
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,020
about love and affection in the future.

96
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,220
You are virtuous and willing to be a good person.

97
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,220
What can I say?

98
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,980
Sister Meng,

99
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,060
you just said

100
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,980
you don't mind to dress Tao Hua up.

101
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,020
Is it true?

102
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,980
Sister Jiang is a beautiful woman.

103
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,300
If it weren't for the coincidence,

104
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,500
I wouldn't be the princess's sister.

105
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,900
Prime Minister, when can we have dinner?

106
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,740
Is that I know?

107
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,100
No more.

108
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,780
Here's new stuff from Zhuangzi this morning.

109
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,180
Let me have a taste.

110
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,780
Lady Jiang is from the North.

111
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,980
Do you know how to eat shrimp?

112
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,540
I don't know how to eat it.

113
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,300
I just don't want to eat it.

114
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,700
But...

115
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,700
The reason is very childish.

116
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,180
I can't say it out.

117
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,540
Tell me.

118
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,420
When I was young,

119
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,860
my father would personally

120
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:35,620
peel the shrimp for my mother.

121
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,140
At that time,

122
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,740
the peach blossoms were deeply moved

123
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,740
by their deep love.

124
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,660
So I made up my mind

125
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,260
to eat shrimp in the future.

126
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,140
If my husband didn't ask me to do it,

127
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,860
I would never eat it.

128
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,100
I think you

129
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,100
can't eat shrimp in your life.

130
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,340
How can you have the chance

131
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,100
to eat shrimp in the daytime?

132
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,900
I'm not afraid of you.

133
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,660
The shrimp my husband peeled

134
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,340
is really delicious.

135
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,900
The peach blossoms want to eat one more.

136
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,300
If my mother knew it,

137
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,500
she would be happy for me.

138
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,780
I found a man

139
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,380
who is as good as my father.

140
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,460
Respect.

141
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,980
I also have one.

142
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,980
General.

143
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,640
Call the kitchen

144
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,220
to cook for one more.

145
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,100
What's your plan?

146
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:10,460
I want you to make it for me.

147
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,420
Don't push me.

148
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,860
You said last night

149
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,780
that no matter how the peach blossoms are made,

150
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,340
they will be destroyed now.

151
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,020
Then I...

152
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:27,700
Stop talking.

153
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,540
I'm sorry.

154
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,060
Tell the back door to prepare the shrimp.

155
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,340
It's just a show.

156
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,180
Don't tell me you really want me to cook.

157
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,820
Prime Minister,

158
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,740
last time I made shrimp for the peach blossoms,

159
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,980
it was my mother.

160
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,380
You're so nice.

161
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,460
Let go.

162
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,540
Someone is here.

163
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,140
If you don't let go,

164
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,900
how can I cook?

165
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,540
Fish..

166
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,720
Mulberry

167
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,720
I heard that Northeastern people love to eat beef and mutton.

168
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,720
They use the food to make it fresh.

169
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,720
If you eat it like this,

170
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,720
you won't be used to it.

171
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,720
Let go.

172
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,720
I made this for you.

173
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,720
You must finish it.

174
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,720
Someone...

175
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,720
You drank all night long.

176
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,720
Are you a water tank?

177
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,720
I'll try it.

178
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,720
I didn't expect you to be a good cook.

179
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,720
It's not a big deal.

180
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,720
I'm not from a noble family.

181
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,720
You're a little bastard.

182
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,720
Peel the shrimp for me.

183
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,720
I'll beat you to death.

184
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,720
Peel it.

185
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,720
Today's show is good.

186
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,720
Can the value of peach blossoms be shown

187
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,720
to you?

188
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,720
I'm not a smart person like you.

189
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,720
I'm not a coward.

190
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,720
Thank you.

191
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,720
Just buy it.

192
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,720
Don't let others find out.

193
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,720
The ability of this Jiang Taohua to make a show is really amazing.

194
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,720
What he says and does

195
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,720
can't be believed.

196
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,720
As long as you give me a chance,

197
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,720
I'll make you believe me.

198
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,720
I'm sorry.

199
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,720
This painting is just a normal picture.

200
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,720
Where is the mystery?

201
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,720
The whole family is watching me.

202
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,720
The Prime Minister is watching me.

203
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,720
The painting is not stable even if I put it for a day.

204
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,720
Then I'll give you a chance to arrange a wedding.

205
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,720
The staff is busy.

206
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,720
I can give the painting to the Crown Prince.

207
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,720
He can study it by himself.

208
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,720
But the Prime Minister is strange to you.

209
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,720
What if he is watching you?

210
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,720
If I don't make a mistake,

211
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,720
will he let us go?

212
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,720
We used Madam Jiang to hide in the study.

213
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,720
Even if it's the trap left by the Prime Minister,

214
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,720
we have to do it.

215
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,720
This is a good plan.

216
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,720
Don't worry. I know what to do.

217
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,720
The painting is good.

218
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,720
Don't let others find out.

219
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,720
Yes.

220
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,720
The painting is good.

221
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,720
I'll go to the Crown Prince's mansion.

222
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,720
I'll wait for him to come.

223
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,720
Yes.

224
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,720
What about Madam Jiang?

225
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,720
She is a cunning girl.

226
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,720
Keep an eye on her wedding.

227
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,720
She can't be caught by the sun.

228
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,720
Yes.

229
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,720
I'll go to the Crown Prince's mansion.

230
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,720
I'll wait for him to come.

231
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,720
I'll wait for him to come.

232
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,720
Don't let her catch you.

233
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,720
Yes.

234
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,720
I heard that Madam Jiang has entered the city.

235
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,720
Do you want to inform her about the wedding?

236
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,720
Qingying is a mischievous girl.

237
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,720
Send someone to keep an eye on her.

238
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,720
Don't let her get confused.

239
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,720
Yes.

240
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,720
Who's son is this?

241
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,720
He is ill and is a hero.

242
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,720
He is so poor.

243
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,720
Did you hear that someone is out of the city?

244
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,720
I know.

245
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,720
They sell young girls in Liang's family.

246
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,720
Then they sell them to the brothel.

247
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,720
I heard that one was forced to go crazy the other day.

248
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,720
Look at your daughter.

249
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,720
Don't go out recently.

250
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,720
It's too dangerous.

251
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,720
It's so messy.

252
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,720
I'll go back and talk to him.

253
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,720
I'll take care of this kind of thing.

254
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,720
I'm coming.

255
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,720
I'm coming.

256
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,720
I'm coming.

257
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,720
I'm coming.

258
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,720
I'm coming.

259
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,720
I'm coming.

260
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,720
Don't be so careless.

261
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,720
You're a coward.

262
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,720
Stop.

263
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,720
Help.

264
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,720
Someone is here.

265
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,720
Help.

266
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,720
You...

267
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,720
You come down.

268
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,720
They are criminals.

269
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,720
Go and report them.

270
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,720
What criminals?

271
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,720
Everyone, I'm really sorry.

272
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,720
This is my sister.

273
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,720
She's not very smart.

274
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,720
Please forgive her.

275
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,720
Who is your sister?

276
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,720
I'm your sister.

277
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,720
Everyone believes her.

278
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,720
She's a criminal.

279
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,720
What are you looking at?

280
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,720
What can you see?

281
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,720
Go.

282
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,720
Hurry up.

283
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,720
What can you see?

284
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,720
Go.

285
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,720
Come down quickly.

286
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,720
Did you hear me?

287
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,720
Hurry up.

288
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,720
What are you looking at?

289
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,720
Look at the eyes.

290
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,720
Look at the eyes.

291
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,720
Miss.

292
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,720
I was passing by here.

293
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,720
You blocked me with a stone.

294
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,720
Why are you so polite

295
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,720
instead of apologizing to me?

296
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,720
Sir.

297
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,720
I apologize on behalf of my sister.

298
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,720
You two, let her come down.

299
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,720
I'll go to the hospital

300
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,720
and explain it to her.

301
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,720
Sir.

302
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,720
My sister is not very smart.

303
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,720
Please forgive her.

304
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,720
I think she's clearly a fraud.

305
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,720
You two are brothers.

306
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,720
You can only protect her

307
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,720
and harm her.

308
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,720
Do you know that?

309
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,720
Help.

310
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,720
Someone is going to rob you.

311
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,720
Help.

312
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,720
Hurry up.

313
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,720
Help.

314
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,720
Run.

315
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,720
Sir.

316
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,720
I was in a hurry.

317
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,720
I'm sorry.

318
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,720
Episode 2

319
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,720
My stomach hurts.

320
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,720
My mouth is hurting.

321
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,720
My feet are hurting.

322
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,720
My back is hurting.

323
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,720
My stomach hurts.

324
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,720
My stomach hurts.

325
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,720
Please tell me.

326
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,720
Please tell me.

327
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,720
I want to continue.

328
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,720
Bad news.

329
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,720
The lady is back.

330
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,720
The lady is back.

331
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,720
Welcome back, Lady.

332
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,720
I'm back.

333
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,720
You are the princess

334
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,720
who is absent-minded in the mansion.

335
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,720
I heard that you

336
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,720
made my brother

337
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,720
dizzy and fainted.

338
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,720
No one in the back yard

339
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,720
was disturbed by his favor.

340
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,720
But you are so weak

341
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,720
and so powerful.

342
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,720
You are the sister

343
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,720
that Mr. Xiang mentioned, right?

344
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,720
Peach blossoms are deeply wounded.

345
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,720
It's not convenient to stand up and greet.

346
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,720
Please forgive me.

347
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,720
But my brother

348
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,720
will like you.

349
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,720
What?

350
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,720
Pretending?

351
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,720
My princess doesn't pretend.

352
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,720
But your Mr. Xiang pretends a lot.

353
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,720
Who are you?

354
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,720
My princess's personal maid,

355
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,720
Jingtai.

356
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,720
You are the girl

357
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,720
that Zhan Lu mentioned

358
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,720
who has good martial arts.

359
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,720
I always want to compete with Zhan Lu.

360
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,720
But he always

361
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,720
gives me

362
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,720
some reasons.

363
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,720
You can get his praise.

364
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,720
Your martial arts is good.

365
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,720
How about a competition with me?

366
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,720
Come on.

367
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,720
Come on.

368
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,720
Stop.

369
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,720
How dare you be so disrespectful

370
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,720
to the eldest sister.

371
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,720
You...

372
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,720
Brother,

373
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,720
it's not what you see.

374
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,720
It hurts.

375
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,720
I'm afraid the wound will crack.

376
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,720
Help me to apply the medicine.

377
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,720
Brother,

378
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,720
why is your concubine so pretentious?

379
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,720
So arrogant.

380
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,720
You are talking about others.

381
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,720
Look at you.

382
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,720
You are so arrogant.

383
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,720
I'll send you back to your room for three days.

384
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,720
What arrogant?

385
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,720
Zhan Lu, take her back.

386
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,720
Mr. Xiang,

387
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,720
you are so good at making troubles.

388
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,720
You made troubles as soon as you came back.

389
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,720
Qingying is impulsive

390
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,720
and good at being righteous.

391
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,720
If she really makes troubles,

392
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,720
then it's good for us.

393
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,720
That's the best.

394
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,720
The first book is the end of the book.

395
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,720
The two books are the same.

396
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,720
The second book is the end of the book.

397
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,720
The two books are the same.

398
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,720
The third book is the end of the book.

399
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,720
The couple is in charge of the engagement.

400
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,720
You are so good at making troubles.

401
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,720
You are so beautiful.

402
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,720
You can read it twice.

403
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,720
Where did you learn to ride a horse?

404
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,720
You have the same face everywhere.

405
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,720
This wedding is much better than the previous one.

406
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,720
This is the wedding that suits the princess.

407
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:43,720
The guests are just a little less.

408
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,720
It doesn't matter.

409
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,720
The purpose of this wedding is not here.

410
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,720
Although Mr. Xiang's words are hard to hear,

411
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,720
he is right.

412
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,720
I'm just using some values.

413
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,720
So this time,

414
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,720
I must get the date and time

415
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,720
before he does.

416
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,720
Only in this way

417
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,720
can he sit down and talk to me.

418
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,720
It's easy to talk.

419
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,720
You must be careful tonight.

420
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,720
Don't worry, Master.

421
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,720
Peach blossoms are in full bloom.

422
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,720
You deserve your name.

423
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,720
Thank you, Mr. Xiang.

424
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,720
But in your garden,

425
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,720
you don't need me.

426
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,720
It's because I don't need you.

427
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,720
So I have no reason to lose you.

428
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,720
Today, you should sing this opera honestly.

429
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,720
Don't be so serious.

430
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,720
I want to keep you safe.

431
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,720
But you only have this chance.

432
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,720
If you fail this time,

433
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,720
don't blame me.

434
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,720
I won't tell you my name.

435
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,720
Yes.

436
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,720
I won't tell you

437
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,720
the secret of Peach Blossom.

438
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,720
Good.

439
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,720
Your Highness.

440
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,720
Your Highness.

441
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,720
It's so nice to see you.

442
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,720
It's been a few days.

443
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,720
You look more beautiful.

444
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,720
I was so happy

445
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,720
when I saw you

446
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,720
in the Green Garden.

447
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,720
I'm so happy.

448
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,720
I'm so happy.

449
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,720
I'm so happy.

450
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,720
I'm so happy.

451
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,720
I'm so happy.

452
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,720
I'm so happy.

453
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,720
The incident of the incident

454
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,720
caused me a serious illness.

455
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,720
I had to be in a critical situation

456
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,720
to let me lose my sense of propriety.

457
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,720
I can forgive you for once.

458
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,720
But after today,

459
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,720
if you dare to be rude to me again,

460
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,720
and put our seven kings

461
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,720
under our feet,

462
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,720
it will be a little

463
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,720
uncomfortable.

464
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:08,020
A

465
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:08,720
delirious apartment.

466
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,600
Hello you.

467
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:13,620
Hi,

468
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,620
Hi,

469
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,620
How are you?

470
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,820
I will come back tomorrow.

471
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,300
乾 lough.

472
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,900
Prime Minister Shen is not lacking anything.

473
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,380
So I asked someone to get a good Penglai red

474
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,420
which is the best in the East Sea.

475
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,660
Put it in the room and get some good luck.

476
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,180
Cousin, you're here.

477
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,100
It's just a sword.

478
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,820
Why are you so generous?

479
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,260
It's a wedding dress.

480
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,580
Of course I need to give something with weight.

481
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,660
Otherwise, people will laugh at me.

482
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,100
It can only be used at scholars too,

483
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,020
let alone for a juniper!

484
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,620
You're used to clutching not fighting.

485
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:17,580
Keep an eye on it.

486
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,540
Don't give it a bad opportunity.

487
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,500
I'm here to discuss the deal

488
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,380
between me and Shen Zai Yin

489
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,780
in the Luye Court.

490
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,260
I'll get you the order later.

491
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,660
Don't worry, Your Highness.

492
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,540
I won't let anything bad happen to Second Prince.

493
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,020
Prime Minister.

494
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,380
Your Highness.

495
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,820
Did you see Third Brother?

496
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,300
Third Prince is the most annoying

497
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,980
in this kind of service.

498
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,340
He won't attend the banquet.

499
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,420
I thought you and Second Brother won't come.

500
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,980
So I went to beg Third Brother

501
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,260
and asked him to attend the banquet.

502
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,020
Fourth Prince is really

503
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,980
very sad for Madam Jiang.

504
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,820
You don't have to be so angry.

505
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,740
Her Highness is a good person

506
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:03,900
and she is kind.

507
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,460
I can't stand her being bullied.

508
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,100
The auspicious time has arrived.

509
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,700
Congratulations, Prime Minister.

510
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:26,020
The princess is so beautiful.

511
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,140
Congratulations, Prime Minister.

512
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,980
Congratulations, Prime Minister.

513
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,740
You are so lucky.

514
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,380
Congratulations, Prime Minister.

515
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,820
The ceremony is over.

516
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,420
Congratulations, Prime Minister.

517
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,180
Third Brother.

518
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,180
Don't make a fuss

519
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,380
on the day of Prime Minister's wedding.

520
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,260
It's a great blessing

521
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,660
that I'm giving you this wedding dress.

522
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,020
Third Brother.

523
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,740
As a prince,

524
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:23,540
you díao a chat with her

525
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,100
after serving Five Sisters for half a month,

526
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:25,940
how Nonchalant are you!

527
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:28,660
Big Brother,

528
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,540
I am asking you

529
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:31,300
if you dare to

530
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,780
make trouble in the main hall

531
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,020
so as not to ruin your trying life,

532
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,820
talking nonchalantly with him as you.

533
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:40,100
Well, who is more absurd?

534
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,660
Prime Minister Shen,

535
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,140
are you satisfied with my wedding dress?

536
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,540
I'm a commoner.

537
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,580
I don't know music.

538
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,380
But I can tell it's the North Emperor's style.

539
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,260
Thank you for your concern.

540
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,820
I'm very satisfied.

541
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,740
But I don't have anyone to support me.

542
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,380
Your Majesty.

543
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,620
I'm lucky to have you

544
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,620
to show me your respect.

545
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,500
Thank you very much.

546
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:25,660
Please.

547
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:28,420
Brother San,

548
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,380
where did you learn

549
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,140
the music of the North Emperor?

550
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:36,300
Whether it's the Northern Qi or the Northern Yuan,

551
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,580
the music

552
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,140
is always the same.

553
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,420
Your Highness,

554
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,380
I'm here to see you.

555
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,300
Come in, Qingying.

556
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,220
I've ordered some food for you.

557
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:53,220
I didn't expect you to let me out.

558
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:54,500
Come in.

559
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,900
You're the most beloved sister of the Prime Minister.

560
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,420
How can you learn such a happy day?

561
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,220
It's because of Jiang Taohua.

562
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,300
He's good at pretending.

563
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,980
I was punished by my brother

564
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:06,980
when I just got back.

565
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:09,820
I'm sorry.

566
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,380
I'm sorry.

567
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:10,980
I'm sorry.

568
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,500
I'm sorry.

569
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,100
I'm sorry.

570
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:12,700
I'm sorry.

571
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,300
I'm sorry.

572
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,700
Lady Jiang is different from us.

573
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,380
A few days ago,

574
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:19,460
the Prime Minister cooked for her.

575
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:22,460
It shows that he loves her very much.

576
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,660
What?

577
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,980
My brother cooked for that Lady Jiang?

578
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,100
Damn it.

579
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,060
I've never eaten food cooked by my brother.

580
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,380
Why does he have to see me?

581
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,980
You've never eaten food cooked by a lady.

582
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:33,940
Neither our madam

583
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,260
nor the ladies in the mansion

584
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,820
have seen him in the kitchen.

585
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,300
Yue Tang,

586
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:38,340
shut up.

587
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,140
Don't think too much.

588
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,140
Today is a happy day.

589
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,020
If you talk too much,

590
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,780
it will make you unhappy.

591
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,260
I'm unhappy, too.

592
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,220
Your Highness, please stay.

593
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,580
Your Highness.

594
00:32:58,580 --> 00:32:59,620
Your Highness, don't be so polite.

595
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,100
You didn't have a chance to visit me

596
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,540
when you left that day.

597
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,060
How is your injury?

598
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,260
I'm fine now.

599
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,020
Thank you for your concern.

600
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,060
I'll be grateful.

601
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,300
I wonder what kind of

602
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,540
atmosphere this North Court is.

603
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,500
How could Lady Jiang

604
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,380
make fun of other men at the wedding?

605
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,380
Okay.

606
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,060
Lady Jiang.

607
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,420
I offended you a few days ago.

608
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:37,860
You don't know martial arts.

609
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,180
I don't bully you.

610
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,380
They say that a man who knows the enemy

611
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,380
is a man of great skill.

612
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,180
We drink in the competition.

613
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,660
If we drink too much,

614
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,300
we will become a friend.

615
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,500
You are beaten so hard.

616
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,620
Why are you here?

617
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,300
Are you here to

618
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,700
settle the score because I hit you last time?

619
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,900
You are too narrow-minded.

620
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:00,540
Lady Jiang,

621
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,180
you hit me.

622
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,740
You are saying that I'm narrow-minded?

623
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,340
Don't get me wrong.

624
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,300
This is the Fourth Prince,

625
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,460
Mu Wuxia.

626
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,660
The Fourth Prince?

627
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,340
Mu Wuxia?

628
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,300
Isn't he the one who wanted to

629
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,580
grant you the marriage?

630
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,660
Don't guess too much.

631
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,540
I'm a gentleman.

632
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,140
Amabou.

633
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,820
The infamous girl.

634
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,380
Take them to the escaped castle.

635
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:13,720
Yes!

636
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:16,980
Go one by one.

637
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:18,340
Everyone,

638
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,820
take them to the secret door fourteen times

639
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,380
at nine a.m.

640
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,140
Ready?

641
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,140
Go!

642
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:32,700
Wait.

643
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:37,700
It's better to call the imperial guard before ekip our troops.

644
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,500
We gotta leave now.

645
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,260
What's wrong with you?

646
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,660
Don't hurt He Qi.

647
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,260
Sorry.

648
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,020
I've disturbed your happiness.

649
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,140
I'm going to change my clothes.

650
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,940
Take the Crown Prince to the guest room to change.

651
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:53,900
Yes.

652
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,420
Insane.

653
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,500
I'm afraid we have to act on the spot.

654
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:01,180
We have to get someone to keep an eye on him.

655
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,860
Crown Prince, this way, please.

656
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,340
Your Highness,

657
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,140
I've arranged everything.

658
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,140
The Crown Prince will surely capture the statue

659
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,780
and let Madam Mo send the painting out.

660
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,900
I can still drink.

661
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,660
Okay, okay, I know.

662
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,740
I'll tell you later.

663
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,020
I think you have to accompany me.

664
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,460
Let go!

665
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,380
Help!

666
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,300
Let go!

667
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,060
Let go!

668
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:32,940
Let go!

669
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,780
Let go!

670
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:34,540
Let go!

671
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,260
Let go!

672
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,060
Let go!

673
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:36,860
Let go!

674
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:37,580
Let go!

675
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,420
Let go!

676
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,260
Let go!

677
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,100
Where did you get the painting?

678
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:41,660
Help!

679
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,580
I'll beat you to death!

680
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,380
Let go!

681
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,260
Help!

682
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,340
Insane!

683
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,620
How dare you do such a thing

684
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,020
in my house!

685
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:50,900
Help!

686
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:52,940
Zhan Lu,

687
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,100
ask Eunuch Wen to come here.

688
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:54,620
Let go!

689
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,580
Go to the Master of the Yan clan.

690
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:56,420
Yes.

691
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,020
Let go!

692
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,140
Help!

693
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:01,980
Who are you?

694
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,100
Who do you think I am?

695
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,900
I beat you up!

696
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,500
Let go!

697
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,420
Stop!

698
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,740
You can't let go of me.

699
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:09,900
You're the Crown Prince.

700
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:10,900
Let go of me!

701
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:11,900
Crown Prince?

702
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,420
What do you mean?

703
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,380
You're a traitor!

704
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:14,980
Stop!

705
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:16,420
Brother!

706
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:17,820
Brother!

707
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:19,860
Don't talk.

708
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,180
The Young Master is reckless.

709
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,140
If he hits you,

710
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,100
please forgive him.

711
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:28,940
I'll

712
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,540
apologize on his behalf.

713
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,380
She's the younger sister of Prime Minister Shen.

714
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,340
I thought she was an assassin.

715
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,580
It's a serious crime to assassinate the Crown Prince.

716
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,420
She's supposed to be put in the Zhao family.

717
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:46,180
But she's the younger sister of Prime Minister Shen.

718
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:49,100
I can't do anything about it.

719
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:08,460
Your Highness.

720
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,180
I saw Yue Tao going out.

721
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,180
What should we do?

722
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,820
Prime Minister Shen is my wife.

723
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:25,820
He's the Prime Minister.

724
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,460
He'll treat me the same.

725
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,220
He won't take the blame

726
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,940
for his sister's mistake.

727
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,220
Here comes the opportunity.

728
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:02,580
Your Highness.

729
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,420
Your Highness.

730
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,180
Your Highness.

731
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:04,940
Your Highness.

732
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:05,620
Your Highness.

733
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,420
Your Highness.

734
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,260
Your Highness.

735
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,180
Your Highness.

736
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,180
Your Highness.

737
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,180
Your Highness.

738
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,180
Your Highness.

739
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,180
Your Highness.

740
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,180
Your Highness.

741
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,180
Your Highness.

742
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,180
Your Highness.

743
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,180
Your Highness.

744
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,180
Your Highness.

745
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,180
Your Highness.

746
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,180
Your Highness.

747
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,180
Your Highness.

748
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:21,180
Your Highness.

749
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,180
Your Highness.

750
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,180
Your Highness.

751
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,180
Your Highness.

752
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,180
Your Highness.

753
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,180
Your Highness.

754
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,180
Your Highness.

755
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,180
Your Highness.

756
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,180
Your Highness.

757
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,180
Your Highness.

758
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,180
Your Highness.

759
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,180
Your Highness.

760
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,180
