1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,280
The wind and rain scatter and the clouds are still.

2
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,040
How can I live with the life

3
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,360
and the fates?

4
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,280
If I can stay with you in my life,

5
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,960
if you understand my true feelings,

6
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,560
I will go through all the hardships

7
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:54,760
without regret.

8
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,080
Even if I miss you in this life,

9
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,040
hold me tight.

10
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,280
I will go through all the hardships in my life.

11
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,680
The unwavering struggle for destiny

12
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,280
has touched the cause and the effect of life.

13
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,320
Fate is a world of mistakes.

14
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,360
We have loved and hated before.

15
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,520
Please don't blame me for my mistakes.

16
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,920
I will be the most beautiful flower in the world.

17
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,520
Don't be afraid of waiting for the flowers to bloom.

18
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,560
The assezlover

19
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,080
Season 2

20
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,680
Chase after them.

21
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,140
peppers

22
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,340
the

23
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,880
morning

24
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,640
water

25
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:21,140
water

26
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,180
steal

27
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,720
steal

28
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,840
Jin Mi.

29
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,240
Jin Mi.

30
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,240
Hobbyist.

31
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,400
Why are you evidently frowning?

32
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,200
From space?

33
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,480
Was it prepared by the 230M helm for 200 years?

34
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,120
They

35
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,800
will be impermanent.

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,080
Its essence

37
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,760
can not be Islandid.

38
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,040
Let go of my mother!

39
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,320
A'Zi, get out of here!

40
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,680
Your Highness, please save my mother!

41
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,120
It's your fault.

42
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,800
You're sitting in a place you shouldn't be.

43
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,560
If I don't get rid of you,

44
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,080
how can I become the ruler of the harem?

45
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,840
In this world,

46
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,560
the strong survive,

47
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,200
and the weak are eliminated.

48
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,720
Mother!

49
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,480
Taohua!

50
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,080
Mother!

51
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,960
Mother!

52
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,520
Listen to me.

53
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,280
Changjue...

54
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,240
Taohua,

55
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,520
I'm leaving.

56
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,360
Your and Changjue's life

57
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,520
will be very difficult.

58
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,240
No one can believe it.

59
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,880
Jian Chu,

60
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,320
if you're in danger,

61
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,000
you must ask for help.

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,040
You must ask for help!

63
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,720
I...

64
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,440
am incompetent.

65
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,840
This time,

66
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,600
I can't ask for help.

67
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,920
I...

68
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,200
am incompetent.

69
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,960
This time,

70
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,760
I can't ask for help.

71
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,440
This time,

72
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,040
I can't ask for help.

73
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,760
This time,

74
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,240
I can't ask for help.

75
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,920
This time,

76
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,400
I can't ask for help.

77
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,200
This time,

78
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,720
I can't ask for help.

79
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,320
This time,

80
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,880
I can't ask for help.

81
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,040
Three, two, one...

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,960
I don't know.

83
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,480
This is the weak.

84
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,340
On this fr sosome night

85
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,100
Sister, you are finally awake

86
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,660
Where is this?

87
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:47,660
It seems that the spy knew that the villagers had reported him,

88
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,660
so he prepared in advance.

89
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:53,660
He asked his brother, who was a sword-layer, to search this old house

90
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,660
and hide from everyone.

91
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,660
I still don't understand

92
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,660
whether he's a good or bad person.

93
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,660
But he seems to be very good to you.

94
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,660
He has been watching you since he carried you here.

95
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,660
Madam Jiang said that she wanted to cooperate with me.

96
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,660
How come I have to go and save her?

97
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:38,660
In fact, Madam Jiang has already owed me two lives.

98
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,660
Young Master,

99
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,660
how do you want me to repay you?

100
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,660
Get better soon.

101
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,660
Then,

102
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,660
double the money you owe me.

103
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,660
Then,

104
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,660
double the amount of money you gave me.

105
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,660
Come and help me!

106
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,660
I'm in the middle of searching for my grandma!

107
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,660
What's going on?

108
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,660
Grandma!

109
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,660
Grandma!

110
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,660
Grandma, wake up!

111
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,660
Grandma!

112
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,660
Grandma, wake up!

113
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,660
Grandma, wake up!

114
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,660
Grandma, wake up!

115
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,660
I told you to bring my grandma back!

116
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,660
Why is my grandma hurt?

117
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,660
It's not their fault.

118
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,660
Grandma wanted to go back by herself.

119
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:01,660
I didn't expect to see those cowards on the bridge.

120
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,660
Grandma!

121
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:10,660
They tried their best to get me out.

122
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:18,660
That's why I could see my grandson.

123
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,660
The last month.

124
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:27,660
Xiaolian, I'm fine.

125
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,660
You only have your brother.

126
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:34,660
You must wait for him to come back.

127
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,660
Don't cry.

128
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:39,660
Don't cry, my child.

129
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,660
Grandma!

130
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:45,660
Grandma!

131
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,660
Grandma!

132
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,660
Grandma!

133
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,660
Wake up!

134
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,660
Xiaolian!

135
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,660
Grandma!

136
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,660
Let go of me!

137
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,660
Let go of me!

138
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,660
Let go of me!

139
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,660
Let go of me!

140
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,660
Grandma!

141
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,660
Grandma!

142
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,660
Grandma!

143
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,660
Grandma!

144
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,660
Let go of me!

145
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,660
If it weren't for you, how would I become like this?

146
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,660
How would I die?

147
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,660
Xiaolian, wake up!

148
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,660
Xiaolian, wake up!

149
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,660
Grandma!

150
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,660
Xiaolian!

151
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,660
Xiaolian!

152
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,660
Xiaolian!

153
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,660
Grandma!

154
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,660
Don't kill my grandma!

155
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,660
Xiaolian was right.

156
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:26,660
It was my fault.

157
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:30,660
I thought I could control the people.

158
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,660
But today, Xiaolian's grandma died.

159
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,660
I'm just like 20 years ago.

160
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,660
I can't do anything.

161
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:44,660
Thank you for protecting the country.

162
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:47,660
We'll find out the truth.

163
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,660
aroma

164
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:04,660
deepest 2011

165
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,660
Don't respirate your breath.

166
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,660
This is tea.

167
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,660
It's just spicy tea.

168
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,660
OurÛŒ

169
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:17,660
Red gourd

170
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,660
I'm sorry.

171
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,660
I'm sorry.

172
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,660
From now on,

173
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,660
you're the real one.

174
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,660
And I'm Xie Jing'an.

175
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,660
Young Master,

176
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,660
now,

177
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,660
you're the only one in the Xie family.

178
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,660
You can take care of us.

179
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,660
You can live with our lives.

180
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,660
Xiaolian, don't worry.

181
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,660
I'll make Master,

182
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,660
Meng Jiang,

183
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,660
pay the price

184
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,660
for the killers

185
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,660
who killed the Operas.

186
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,660
rhythm

187
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:51,100
I'm innocent?

188
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,160
What's wrong?

189
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,440
The molehead has already been discovered.

190
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,780
It's a crime against the high princess's reprieve,

191
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:10,960
and he will be charged to prison in court tomorrow.

192
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,640
After Ã¼ unevenly depending on lady's disappearance,

193
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,800
here has been taken down without a trace.

194
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,580
What should we do?

195
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:20,580
If I hadn't been so stubborn and insisted on keeping them,

196
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,580
how could those evil people have found their place of origin?

197
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,580
What Shen Xiang said is right.

198
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,580
Now the village is heavily damaged.

199
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,580
Grandma died miserably.

200
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,580
It's all because of me.

201
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,580
I'm sorry to them.

202
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,580
I'm sorry to the villagers.

203
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,580
I'm sorry to Grandma.

204
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,580
I'm even more sorry to Xiaolian.

205
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,580
How could you be blamed?

206
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,580
If it weren't for those evil people,

207
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,580
even if we didn't go to find Zhou Yu to report,

208
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,580
they would have other ways to deal with it.

209
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,580
I was taught a lesson.

210
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,580
But the consequences were made by the innocent.

211
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,580
Mu Wu Xia,

212
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,580
those evil people are the ones who are hurting people.

213
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,580
We should cheer up

214
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,580
and be good to the evil.

215
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,580
With your current state,

216
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,580
those evil people will be more at ease to see.

217
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,580
It's all settled.

218
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,580
Cry or not,

219
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,580
it's up to you.

220
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,580
I'm sorry.

221
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,580
I'm sorry.

222
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,580
I'm sorry.

223
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,580
I'm sorry.

224
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,580
I'm sorry.

225
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,580
I'm sorry.

226
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,580
I'm sorry.

227
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,580
I'm sorry.

228
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,580
I'm sorry.

229
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,580
Wu An.

230
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,580
The child's mouth is not heavy.

231
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,580
Such a deep wound,

232
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:31,580
I'm afraid it's going to leave scars.

233
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,580
That's good.

234
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,580
You don't have to blame yourself anymore.

235
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,580
You've tried your best to get it back.

236
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,580
I believe that Grandma's spirit in heaven

237
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,580
knows all this.

238
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,580
She won't blame you.

239
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,580
As for Xiaolian,

240
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,580
she will eventually understand.

241
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,580
Didn't you ask me before?

242
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,580
Why did you get rid of the killer's pursuit

243
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,580
and choose to come back to save you?

244
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,580
Because there was a person

245
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,580
who wanted to save

246
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,580
but didn't.

247
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,580
Let's have a game of chess.

248
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,580
If you win,

249
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,580
I'll take revenge for you.

250
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,580
But if you lose,

251
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,580
you'll forget your past.

252
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,580
When your brother comes back,

253
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,580
we'll live a good life together.

254
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,580
What do you think?

255
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,580
You're a crook.

256
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,580
I don't believe you.

257
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,580
I can swear.

258
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,580
Let's have a game.

259
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,580
I'm not going to be a crook.

260
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:14,580
I don't believe you.

261
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:16,580
I'm going to win.

262
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,580
I'm going to win.

263
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,580
You have someone who wants to save

264
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,580
but can't.

265
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,580
I'm not going to be a crook.

266
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,580
Xiao Lian, Xiao Lian.

267
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,580
I'm here to help you.

268
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,580
I'm here to help you.

269
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,580
Let's help her play together.

270
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,580
Xiao Lian, get close.

271
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,580
Get close.

272
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,580
Come help her.

273
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,580
Everyone, help her.

274
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,580
Xiao Lian, get close.

275
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,580
Hurry up.

276
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,580
Hurry up.

277
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,580
Hurry up.

278
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,580
Hurry up.

279
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,580
Hurry up.

280
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,580
Hurry up.

281
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,580
Hurry up.

282
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,560
Get him.

283
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:25,340
Little Lian Prince is the first winner!

284
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:27,720
piano

285
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,000
Great, little Lian Prince wins!

286
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,080
big

287
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,580
Little Lian Prince wins!

288
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,140
why did you change it,

289
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,700
or you knew a secret barrel?

290
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,940
I have not been sekali sister for so long.

291
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,080
By now,

292
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,100
the rest of the brothers

293
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,680
and sister are ready to leave.

294
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,260
So,

295
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,220
listen to my advice.

296
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,200
We sugar fartin coping with Yu Yan

297
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:42,060
Elder Brother, you're a brilliant reload.

298
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,300
You can capture the rest of thewarlords in one sweep.

299
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:54,200
The head of the ram's headed right here.

300
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,340
If the Prince didn't have to surprise us,

301
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,120
perhaps then we'd have cowered what would

302
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,740
be our source of illegal gold throughout the course of our escape.

303
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,220
But this is northwest,

304
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:07,100
so the people around here have nowhere to go.

305
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,180
Yan siao

306
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,660
Rest assured

307
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,300
I should go him

308
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,940
give the massage

309
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:12,980
No

310
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:13,380
No

311
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,360
keeper

312
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:16,860
Management Wake, guard the dedicated guests

313
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,900
Yes

314
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,260
Moon Lady

315
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,820
Ja, let's go

316
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,700
Yes

317
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,260
I'm thinking

318
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,860
if this place is related to the Sunbeam Wind Map.

319
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,580
I know.

320
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,460
Follow me.

321
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:02,620
Here.

322
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,140
No.

323
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,460
I can do it myself.

324
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,100
Don't you think this place looks familiar?

325
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:18,860
Familiar?

326
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,780
I'll give you a sword.

327
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:37,220
punto

328
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,260
Right.

329
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:06,260
Although it should be the Sunlight Wind Token drawn here.

330
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,260
Although it is the Sunlight Wind Token,

331
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:15,260
it looks like it's actually connected to the seven mountain winds.

332
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,260
The Seven Stars of Pei Dou.

333
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:25,260
The most beautiful of the Seven Stars of Pei Dou is the Jade Heng Wei.

334
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:29,260
So it should be this mountain wind.

335
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:37,260
But this mountain wind has a sharp peak and steep slope.

336
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:40,260
It's not a place to live.

337
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:46,260
Xue Ran Zhao drew this painting before he came here.

338
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,260
He didn't seek revenge.

339
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:51,260
He must have set his life on the ground.

340
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:55,260
The sun and the moon are turning, the earth and the stars are turning.

341
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:58,260
If you turn this painting over...

342
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,260
The mountain wind has become the mountain oar.

343
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,260
The mountain oar has become the mountain wind.

344
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,260
If it's connected to the Seven Stars of Pei Dou,

345
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,260
the location will be completely different.

346
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,260
Among the Seven Stars, the Jade Heng is the brightest.

347
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,260
It's like the world's minister revolving around the Lord.

348
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:17,260
The Seven Stars of Pei Dou also revolve around the Purple Star.

349
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:20,260
And here is exactly the same as the white of the sky.

350
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:25,260
But what does the white of the sky mean?

351
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,260
I know.

352
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,260
Let's go to the Cloud Tower.

353
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:58,260
The King of the Wang family has set up a hunting ground.

354
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,260
It's indeed like that.

355
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,260
And when I was investigating,

356
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,260
I saw a horse cart out of the hunting ground.

357
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,260
Yes.

358
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,260
Stop.

359
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,260
Stop.

360
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:18,260
It seems that this is how they got the money.

361
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,260
What's the origin of this hunting ground?

362
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,260
Five years ago, the Crown Prince declared that

363
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,260
he got a few rare blood-stained horses.

364
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,260
He built a hunting ground for the Wang family here.

365
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,260
No wonder.

366
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:30,260
A daily horse cart is only disguised as goods and materials.

367
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,260
Who dares to investigate?

368
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,260
And who dares to suspect the Wang family?

369
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,260
No wonder a hunting ground

370
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:39,260
has to be guarded by three layers of layers.

371
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:42,260
Let's go back to the capital and prepare early.

372
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,260
His Majesty has strictly investigated this matter.

373
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,260
If we act rashly,

374
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,260
it will only add to the trouble.

375
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,260
The more they are nervous,

376
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:53,260
the more we are getting closer to the truth.

377
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,260
Not bad.

378
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:27,260
You believe that what I gave you is the truth?

379
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,260
Princess, you're back.

380
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,260
You're chasing after the water.

381
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,260
You scared me to death.

382
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,260
By the way, Princess,

383
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:53,260
did Shen Zai also arrange for you to fall into the water on purpose?

384
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:56,260
He took you out and then put you in danger.

385
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,260
Qingtai.

386
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,260
When I was a child, when I was in danger,

387
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,260
no one would risk their lives to save me.

388
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,260
But that day,

389
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,260
he had already escaped from the chase,

390
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,260
but he turned back for me.

391
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:11,260
He saved me out of his own safety.

392
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,260
If that's the case,

393
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,260
is he a good person or a bad person?

394
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,260
In this world,

395
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,260
it's not a black and white.

396
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:23,260
I might have only known him in the past.

397
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:26,260
He just has what he wants to do

398
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:28,260
and doesn't want to explain.

399
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,260
If that's the case,

400
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:33,260
this person looks a bit like Princess.

401
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,260
He and I are not of the same kind.

402
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:41,260
I just want to be able to spend the rest of my life with Changjue in peace.

403
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,260
Princess is right.

404
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:46,260
This is a very complicated plan.

405
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,260
I didn't expect that this evil money

406
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,260
has something to do with the Sun and Wind Map

407
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,260
that the Marquis of Lu is looking for.

408
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:53,260
It's a big deal that it involves

409
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,260
the Qi State and the Northern Courtyard.

410
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,260
We must be careful.

411
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:03,260
Find a chance to send the news to Qingtai these two days.

412
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:06,260
Tell her that I've found the painting.

413
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,260
Okay.

414
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:16,260
Qingtai, this is the painting that Her Highness wants.

415
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,260
This painting doesn't look like it's made.

416
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:27,260
Do you know the meaning behind this painting?

417
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:32,260
I don't dare to guess the meaning behind this painting.

418
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:48,260
Next, Her Highness wants you to solve the mystery in the painting.

419
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:51,260
This place is related to Her Highness's grand plan.

420
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,260
Find out where this is.

421
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:59,260
I don't know what Her Highness is talking about.

422
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,260
You don't need to worry about that.

423
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:04,260
As long as you know where this is,

424
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,260
it's in this painting.

425
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,260
I understand.

426
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:12,260
It's just that I'm too stupid to be afraid of delaying Her Highness's grand plan.

427
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,260
You don't need to be so self-conceited.

428
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:20,260
Her Highness said that you haven't had time to look for the painting these days.

429
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:23,260
You have time to travel around with that Prime Minister.

430
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,260
You've gained a lot of knowledge.

431
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,260
I know that I've delayed the mission this time.

432
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:34,260
But I'm in the Prime Minister's Manor and I have no choice.

433
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,260
I shouldn't delay it like this in the future.

434
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:39,260
I didn't mean to delay it or you have other intentions?

435
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,260
You know what you're thinking.

436
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:48,260
I'm afraid that you'll be in danger if you stay in the manor.

437
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:52,260
Your every move will be a failure.

438
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,260
I won't do it anymore.

439
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,260
I won't do it anymore.

440
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,260
If you do it again,

441
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,260
I won't do it anymore.

442
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,260
you will never be able to get away.

443
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,260
This is a flower bouquet from the North Court.

444
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,260
I'm sure that you'll like it.

445
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:14,260
Your Highness said that as long as you're obedient,

446
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,260
we have plenty of such flowers.

447
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,260
My dear son,

448
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,260
please don't drink too much.

449
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:33,260
You're always thinking about what you want to eat.

450
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,260
I'll make you some food.

451
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,260
I'll make you some food.

452
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,260
I miss you every day.

453
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:41,260
I'm so worried.

454
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:43,260
I've been training my limbs

455
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,260
to move my body.

456
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:51,260
I'm fine in the military camp.

457
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:54,260
I'm also a member of the imperial guards.

458
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:56,260
I can rest assured.

459
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:01,260
Every time I'm alone in the state of Qi,

460
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,260
I feel worried.

461
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,260
I'm healthy.

462
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:10,260
I'm worried about whether you really love me.

463
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:13,260
I hope you'll take good care of yourself.

464
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:15,260
Don't think about me.

465
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:19,260
I know that even if the world is broken,

466
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,260
there will be a reunion.

467
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:24,260
I hope you'll come back soon

468
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,260
and we can part ways.

469
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,260
I'm sorry for my mistakes.

470
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,260
I'm sorry for my mistakes.

471
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,260
Take care of yourself.

472
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:38,260
I'll be waiting for you.

473
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:46,260
Princess, are you okay?

474
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,260
Come on, get up.

475
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,260
Get up.

476
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:58,260
Prince Changjue sent a letter.

477
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:02,260
But he said he was not doing well in the army.

478
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,260
He said he was fine.

479
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,260
Why is the princess still in a bad mood?

480
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:14,260
He said he was doing well.

481
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:20,260
He followed the general's camp

482
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:23,260
and made a lot of decorations.

483
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,260
He also decorated a lot.

484
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:29,260
Why is the princess so sad?

485
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,260
This seal

486
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,020
is crooked and

487
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,260
withered.

488
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,260
It means that the man who could have signed it

489
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,260
was injured.

490
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:42,260
He felt bad.

491
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,260
I feel so bad for him.

492
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,260
That's true.

493
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,260
I wonder how much he suffered

494
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,260
in the army.

495
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,260
Empress Lv asked Yang Wanqing

496
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,260
to give me Changjue's letter.

497
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,260
She wanted to threaten me

498
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,260
with Changjue's safety

499
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,260
and let me finish the task soon.

500
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,260
The more anxious they are,

501
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,260
the more important it is

502
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,260
to them.

503
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:14,260
I'm afraid that the day I finish the task

504
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:17,260
is the last day for Changjue and me.

505
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,260
What should we do?

506
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,260
The antidote is still in their hands.

507
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,260
Now the most important thing

508
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:28,260
is to figure out what they want to do.

509
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:37,260
Go and clean the clothes of Lord Xiang.

510
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,260
I'll return them to him.

511
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,260
Yes.

512
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:58,260
Lord Xiang,

513
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,260
the scout is here to report.

514
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,260
No wonder Lord Xiang

515
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,260
would stop me from investigating the money.

516
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,260
It turns out that he used the

517
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,260
shanguan of Xushan's dam

518
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,260
to make a deal with the Meng family.

519
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,260
It's a good deal.

520
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,260
It's just a pity that

521
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,260
the information we've checked

522
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:27,260
is not enough.

523
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:29,260
It's just that it can't cover me.

524
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,260
The Meng family

525
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,260
can stop me from investigating the money.

526
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,260
So naive.

527
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,260
Brother.

528
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,260
Brother.

529
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,260
You promised to take me to hunt.

530
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,260
You took me to hunt.

531
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,260
Why did you restrict my freedom today?

532
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,260
You didn't allow me to go out.

533
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,260
If you don't take me,

534
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,260
I'll take you to hunt.

535
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:55,260
Brother.

536
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,260
Lord Xiang, it's...

537
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,260
Stop it.

538
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,260
It's enough.

539
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,260
Brother.

540
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,260
Miss.

541
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,260
Be careful.

542
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,260
Put the sword down.

543
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,260
Be careful.

544
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,260
Put the sword down.

545
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,260
Chunli, I'm going to

546
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:23,260
cut them into four.

547
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,260
Miss, stop it.

548
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,260
Be careful.

549
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,260
I'm going to shoot.

550
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,260
Little peach.

551
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,260
Are you okay?

552
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:45,260
I'm okay.

553
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,260
I'm not careful.

554
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:49,260
What's the hunt you just mentioned?

555
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,260
It's an event

556
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:53,260
held by the Wang family of Qi.

557
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,260
Every year, there are many

558
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,260
Shi family members to participate in the hunt.

559
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,260
If the performance is good, the Lord will reward them.

560
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,260
It's a big party.

561
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,260
I'll go find my brother.

562
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,260
You little peach.

563
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,260
Why do you always say no?

564
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,260
Lord Xiang doesn't allow you to go.

565
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,260
You'd better be obedient and go back to the yard.

566
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,260
No. Give it back to me.

567
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,260
Give it back to me.

568
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:23,260
Give it back to me.

569
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:25,260
Little peach, give it back to me.

570
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,260
Little peach, give it back to me.

571
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,260
Lord Xiang ordered

572
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,260
to ask you to go back.

573
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,260
I don't want it.

574
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,260
Little peach, I'm not good enough for you.

575
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,260
Qingying.

576
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,260
Don't worry.

577
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,260
I'll find a way to let your brother take you to the hunt.

578
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,260
I'm a dog if I believe you.

579
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,260
Lord Xiang's clothes

580
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,260
have been cleaned by the peach flower.

581
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,260
It's quiet now.

582
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:13,260
Lord Xiang's head hurts.

583
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:19,260
How do you know?

584
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,260
The silver elixir plant in the incense.

585
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:25,260
If you don't mind,

586
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,260
I'll give you some massage

587
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,260
to relieve your headache.

588
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:35,260
It's not a big deal.

589
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:37,260
I'll do it.

590
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,260
Qingying said

591
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,260
she's going to prepare a spring hunt.

592
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,260
Are you here to say thank you to her?

593
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:01,260
What's wrong?

594
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,260
I'm busy this year.

595
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:05,260
I'm going to come back to you.

596
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,260
Qingying is a lively person.

597
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,260
If we all leave,

598
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,260
she can stay at home alone.

599
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,260
It's better to take her with you.

600
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,260
That's more assured.

601
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,260
Let me think about it.

602
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,260
I'm curious about one more thing.

603
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,260
Is the spring hunt

604
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,260
in the west mountain?

605
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,260
It used to be in the west mountain.

606
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,260
You mean...

607
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,260
If so,

608
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:47,260
we have to plan it well.

609
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,260
We have to lure them

610
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,260
and attack them.

611
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,260
You lead the army to the west mountain.

612
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:59,260
outfits in the west mountain

613
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,600
bibi

614
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,260
No matter where the castle is,

615
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,300
it can't be Ãªtre

616
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,260
You also outer feature

617
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,640
removed in the mountain

618
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,260
and blocked on cast go

619
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,260
is impossible

620
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,260
So you told me

621
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,680
you ask me

622
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,260
TO trip

623
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,880
and

624
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,480
become a host

625
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,980
.

626
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:25,980
I know what you mean.

627
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,740
When we were in Tianshui Village,

628
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,540
Lady Jiang and Prime Minister were different.

629
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,180
You couldn't have told her

630
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,180
such an important plan.

631
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,180
Now you...

632
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,180
Now we have nothing.

633
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,580
Send someone to the North Campus to investigate Jiang Taohua.

634
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,180
Her life is still a mystery.

635
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,980
I want to know everything.

636
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:47,980
I want to know everything.

637
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:49,980
I want to know everything.

638
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,380
I want to know everything.

639
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:52,980
I want to know everything.

640
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:53,980
I want to know everything.

641
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:55,180
Yes.

642
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,980
What's wrong with you again?

643
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:24,980
I'm fine.

644
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:31,580
Every year, we go to Xishan Lietang every spring.

645
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,580
But this year,

646
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,580
my father chose my place.

647
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:37,980
Do you think

648
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,180
it's Shen Zaiye?

649
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:41,980
I don't think so.

650
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:44,580
Shen Zaiye is just a prime minister.

651
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,980
He's not enough to change his mind.

652
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,580
He doesn't have the ability.

653
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,180
But he has the ability.

654
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,180
I told my father

655
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,180
that I have a batch of blood-soaked horses

656
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,180
that are very good at picking.

657
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,780
They are very talented.

658
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,580
Then my third brother pushed them to help.

659
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,380
He was very interested in Princess Lan.

660
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,980
My father said that

661
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,980
he would set the place on my Lietang.

662
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:10,580
Why would the third prince be involved in this?

663
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,580
Second brother told him

664
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,780
that my place

665
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,580
is the place where the holy god was born.

666
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,580
My second brother

667
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,580
is not as capable as the other two.

668
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:24,380
He can lure everyone into the trap.

669
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,180
I'm afraid that

670
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:29,180
Shen Zaiye's men are not enough.

671
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,380
Normally,

672
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,180
Shen Zaiye and my second brother

673
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,580
are just ordinary people.

674
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:35,380
Do you think

675
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,580
they are the ones

676
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:38,980
who are pulling the third brother down?

677
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:45,380
My father has noticed it before he left.

678
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:46,780
He suspects that

679
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:47,780
someone is deliberately

680
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,180
targeting the crown prince

681
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:51,580
in every single place.

682
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,580
He wants us to be careful.

683
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:54,980
Huaijin,

684
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,380
I have been

685
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,180
trying to prove myself.

686
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,780
If the evil spirit is exposed,

687
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,180
I will be doomed.

688
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:09,780
Cousin,

689
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,580
help me.

690
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:16,580
Don't panic.

691
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,980
I'll embroider a letter to my father.

692
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,380
Dong,

693
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:21,580
draw a map.

694
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:22,580
Yes.

695
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:25,580
From now on,

696
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:26,980
close the mine

697
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,980
and seal the gate.

698
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,380
Take everyone out.

699
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,780
And manage it with the Yan Sect.

700
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:34,380
There must be no leak.

701
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:47,780
Madam,

702
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,380
the prime minister said that the Spring Hunting is coming.

703
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,380
He has been comforting you for a long time.

704
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:52,980
If you are well-rested,

705
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,180
you can go out and relax.

706
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:57,380
Okay.

707
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:58,780
I got it.

708
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:12,580
Madam,

709
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:13,780
the eldest son has sent a letter.

710
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:15,580
What letter?

711
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:16,780
The second son has sent a letter.

712
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:23,780
Madam,

713
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:24,980
what does it say?

714
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:27,580
My brother said

715
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,180
there is an important matter.

716
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:30,980
Tomorrow at the hunting ground,

717
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:32,580
I have to keep an eye on the Prime Minister.

718
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:45,380
How is it?

719
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:48,180
I have prepared everything.

720
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:50,180
Don't worry.

721
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,180
Okay.

722
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:54,980
This time, Shen Zai Yi and his concubine

723
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:57,180
will be back.

724
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:18,580
The flowers bloom, but you don't know

725
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:21,580
The beauty of the flowers can't be lost

726
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:25,780
The flowers fall, and the north wind blows

727
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:29,180
The city is in a state of panic

728
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:33,380
The petals are withered

729
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:36,780
The heart is with the knot

730
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:40,380
The flowers fall, but you don't know

731
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:43,780
The beauty of the flowers can't be lost

732
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:48,180
The flowers fall, and the north wind blows

733
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:53,780
The city is in a state of panic

734
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:06,180
The wish is growing in the mud

735
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:13,380
Regret is killing in despair

736
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:20,980
The flowers are withered

737
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:25,180
The flowers fall, but you don't know

738
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:32,780
The beauty of the flowers can't be lost

739
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:46,580
Who will lose the heart of flowers?

740
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:49,780
Love and hate can only be eaten

741
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:53,780
The flowers withered, the white snow is falling

742
00:45:53,980 --> 00:46:00,180
No more notice

743
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:06,380
How to love?

744
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:11,780
Love crazyly

745
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:18,780
Not afraid to be surprised by the world

746
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:25,780
Listen to what he said

747
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:37,780
It turns out that he has the answer of love
