00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The Long Ballad

4
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Episode 16

5
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
This person is not the daughter of Meng family.

6
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Who is this person?

7
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I ask you to explain.

8
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
This woman is the queen of the North Courtyard.

9
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Queen?

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Ridiculous.

11
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Ridiculous.

12
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Since the third prince is kind,

13
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
how can the queen of the North Courtyard become the queen of our Qi?

14
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Third Prince, please give us an explanation.

15
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yes.

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Give us an explanation.

17
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Yes.

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Give us an explanation.

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Give us an explanation.

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Give us an explanation.

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What is it?

22
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What is not?

23
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
No matter what kind of identity Hua used to be,

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
from now on,

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
she is my only wife.

26
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
She is also the queen of Qi.

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The queen of Lv is a poisonous killer.

28
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
She is a woman who knows no evil.

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
She is full of selfish desires.

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
She does not care about blood, blood, and whip.

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
She poisons the people.

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Such a vicious person.

33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You said no matter what identity she used to be,

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
she is my only wife.

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
She is my only wife.

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
How dare you slander Hua?

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Come.

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Kill her.

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yes.

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Wait.

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I have something to say.

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Before, you once told the world

43
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
that you would marry Meng's legitimate daughter.

44
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But in the end, you are the queen of Lv.

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I am taking you all to talk.

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Please give us an explanation.

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yes.

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Give us an explanation.

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
An explanation.

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Today is my enthronement and the wedding day.

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
This is the first day you want me to explain.

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
From now on,

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I will not let you do the job.

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Do not misunderstand our intentions.

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Do not talk about this woman's identity.

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But talk about her age.

57
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It is not enough to be a match.

58
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Your Highness, please explain it to the Wu party.

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yes.

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yes.

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That's right.

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Do not make it difficult for the Third Prince.

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The relationship between him and Lv Hou

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
is not a one-off.

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Lv Hou was a maid in the Qi Palace.

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
She has been taking care of the Third Prince.

67
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So it is normal for the Third Prince to love her.

68
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Moreover,

69
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
the Third Prince has been walking

70
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
from a young man to now.

71
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
He cannot leave Lv Hou's side.

72
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
He is a man of great virtue.

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
He has been walking

74
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
from a young man to now.

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
He cannot leave Lv Hou's side.

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
He used poison to control the Lord.

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
He killed the Second Prince and framed the Fourth Prince.

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
The Crown Prince was killed.

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Not only the Third Prince

80
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
can do all these.

81
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Shameless.

82
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Such a thing is happening in our Qi.

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I will not agree to this marriage.

84
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yes.

85
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yes.

86
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
We will not agree to this marriage.

87
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
We will not agree to this marriage.

88
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
We will not agree to this marriage.

89
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Disagree?

90
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Good.

91
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Good one.

92
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
If so,

93
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I will see

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
how long you can be tough

95
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
to these old things.

96
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You.

97
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Disagree.

98
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You are going to die.

99
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Do you want it now?

100
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Ah Zhi.

101
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Miss.

102
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Ah Zhi.

103
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Open the gate quickly.

104
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Miss.

105
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Don't stop.

106
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Shen Cai is leading the army of the Jingji Army to the west gate.

107
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Turn around and wait.

108
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
If we open the gate now,

109
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
we will lose the whole army.

110
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Meng Zhi.

111
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Seeing the master is like seeing the master.

112
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
The Third Prince ordered me to go to Qingxiu Temple tomorrow

113
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
to watch over the master.

114
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Father, do you have any doubts?

115
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Tomorrow is the grand ceremony of the Imperial Guards.

116
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It is also your wedding.

117
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I am not in the palace.

118
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I am worried about you.

119
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I will give you this seal.

120
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
After you enter the palace,

121
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
you can contact Meng Zhi with this seal

122
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
and you will act.

123
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Open the gate quickly.

124
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Yes.

125
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Open the gate.

126
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
How dare you.

127
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Who allowed you to open the gate?

128
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Greetings, General.

129
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
General Meng.

130
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
General Meng.

131
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Who allowed you to open the gate?

132
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
General Qi just ordered us to strengthen the defense

133
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
and go to the Third Prince's residence.

134
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Come.

135
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Take Meng Zhi down.

136
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yes.

137
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Kill him.

138
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Who else is against it?

139
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
After dragging for so long,

140
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I don't know how things are outside.

141
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
After the Third Prince succeeds,

142
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I am afraid it will be too late.

143
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Shen Zaiye,

144
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
you must hurry up.

145
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Continue to collect the seal.

146
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Who said I would come up?

147
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Take down Zhang Taohua.

148
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Take down Zhang Taohua.

149
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Take down Zhang Taohua.

150
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Take down Zhang Taohua.

151
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Take down Zhang Taohua.

152
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Princess Chengping is in my hands.

153
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Shen Zaiye, you go down.

154
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
The brave traitor Mu Wuyin

155
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
imprisoned his father

156
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
and tried to rebel.

157
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Everyone should be punished.

158
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Yes.

159
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Stop them.

160
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Those who rebel with the traitor Mu Wuyin

161
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
should be killed.

162
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
If you want to escape,

163
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
you can be exempted from death.

164
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Soldiers, listen to my order.

165
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Arrest the traitor.

166
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
If you want to escape,

167
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
His Majesty will be punished.

168
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Retreat.

169
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Retreat.

170
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Retreat.

171
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Retreat.

172
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Retreat.

173
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I want to confess.

174
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Are you okay?

175
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
They ran away.

176
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Come with me.

177
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Hua, go.

178
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Your Highness.

179
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Now you lost the battle.

180
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Do you have a way out?

181
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
If not,

182
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I still have some hidden weapons in Yujin.

183
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Maybe I can start over.

184
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I've killed your people.

185
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Where can I find hidden weapons?

186
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
There are three caves on the corner.

187
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
How can I put people

188
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
in the blue cave?

189
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
If so,

190
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Shen Zai,

191
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
how can you

192
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
stay with me for so long?

193
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
The situation in the countryside is critical.

194
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Even if you don't believe me,

195
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
we can't just sit here

196
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
and wait.

197
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Hua,

198
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
we can't escape.

199
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Father won't forgive me.

200
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Shen Zaiye and others

201
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
will come to us.

202
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I won't.

203
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Why should I die here with you?

204
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Hua,

205
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
do you recognize this place?

206
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
This is the tomb

207
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I chose

208
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
for us.

209
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Look at that bed.

210
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
When I was a kid,

211
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
you used to coax me to sleep here.

212
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
And

213
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
at that time,

214
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
we used to sing the same song.

215
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
For so many years,

216
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I've been keeping

217
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
everything here.

218
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Hua,

219
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
do you know

220
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
this is

221
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
the happiest place

222
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I've ever been?

223
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
This is the place

224
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I hate the most.

225
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I've been here

226
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
for days.

227
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm not as happy as I was before.

228
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And you

229
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
are the person I hate the most.

230
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I wanted to be a maid

231
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
and live a stable life.

232
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
But you made me

233
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
a target

234
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
and made me suffer from humiliation.

235
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I finally escaped.

236
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I could have achieved great things,

237
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
but you,

238
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
a useless woman,

239
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
made me fail repeatedly

240
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
and even decided to

241
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
take me back to Qi State.

242
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I had a dream

243
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
of a country being ruled by a country.

244
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You're so funny.

245
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You gave me all of this.

246
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Now I have nothing.

247
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I can't live with you.

248
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Don't ever think that I'll stay with you.

249
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Hua,

250
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'm sorry.

251
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Don't leave me, okay?

252
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I only have you.

253
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Don't leave!

254
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You want to kill me?

255
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Come on.

256
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Kill me.

257
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I knew it.

258
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You're always like this.

259
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Hua.

260
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Hua.

261
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Hua.

262
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Hua.

263
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Hua.

264
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Hua.

265
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Hua.

266
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Hua.

267
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Hua.

268
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You want Shan He,

269
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
but I've been working hard to get it.

270
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,800
I'd rather be a

271
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
help to Xi Qiang.

272
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You take me as your wife,

273
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'll be your ancestor.

274
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Hua,

275
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
you want Rong Hua,

276
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
and San Lang,

277
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
give them to me.

278
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Today, I've lost my husband.

279
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I've lost my power.

280
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
You owe me a heart forever.

281
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
My mother died.

282
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
My mother died.

283
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Why did she die?

284
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
She met Mu Wu Yin here,

285
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
and buried herself here with her.

286
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It's like

287
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
they're on the same page.

288
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
She killed my mother,

289
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
and even killed Immortal God Army.

290
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It made me feel so sad.

291
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Over the past ten years,

292
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I've been hating her every day.

293
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
But now,

294
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
seeing her die in the sea of flowers,

295
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I can't lose her.

296
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Now that Lv Hou is dead,

297
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
everything is over.

298
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
A man who's hated for more than ten years,

299
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
suddenly died in the hands of someone else,

300
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
but the hatred is still there.

301
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
But there's nothing to hate anymore.

302
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Do you understand

303
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
this feeling?

304
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I think I'll understand soon.

305
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Cousin.

306
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Are you and the Princess all right?

307
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
We're fine.

308
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Third Brother, he...

309
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Lv Lv Hou was killed in the sea of flowers.

310
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I wonder if you regret

311
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
what you did before he died.

312
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
It's not easy to be a man of many people.

313
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It's a disaster.

314
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
He's the one who did all this.

315
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I have my own way.

316
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Bad news! Bad news!

317
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Water is coming from the palace!

318
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Go... Go put out the fire!

319
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Lv Hou and His Highness are all burned to death!

320
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Leave some people here!

321
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Others, follow me!

322
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Yes!

323
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
You just said that His Highness was burned to death!

324
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Answer me!

325
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Who is His Highness?

326
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I didn't go in.

327
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Don't let me in!

328
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
No way!

329
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Then tell me who is His Highness!

330
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Qingying.

331
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Your Highness.

332
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
What's wrong with your hand?

333
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
It's fine. It's just a small wound.

334
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
You've been hurt so much.

335
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
It must be a small wound.

336
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It's really fine.

337
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Qingying.

338
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Don't cry.

339
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Look at you.

340
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
You're hurt so badly without me by your side.

341
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Do you know that

342
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I just woke up in the mansion

343
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
and there was no one else but me?

344
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
No one told me anything.

345
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'm just like an outsider.

346
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
A useless person.

347
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Qingying.

348
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Qingying, you...

349
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Don't cry, okay?

350
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Qingying.

351
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Didn't you push me away?

352
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Why did you push me away?

353
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Did I hurt you?

354
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Let me see.

355
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I promise you.

356
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I won't push you away again.

357
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Qingying.

358
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I want you to stay with me forever.

359
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
What did you say?

360
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I said

361
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I won't push you away again.

362
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I want you to stay with me forever.

363
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
When I was saving my father in Qingxiu Temple,

364
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I was so lucky that you didn't come.

365
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Because it was really dangerous there.

366
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
But when I was in danger,

367
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I was thinking

368
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
if I really died,

369
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I wouldn't even see you for the last time.

370
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I would have been so regretful.

371
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
So this time,

372
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I won't push you away again.

373
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I want you to stay with me.

374
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I love you.

375
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Then,

376
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
for the sake of your sincerity,

377
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I'll forgive you.

378
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
If you dare to push me away again,

379
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I won't let you go.

380
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Your Highness, please.

381
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Princess Lan.

382
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Wu Xia is here.

383
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Come and sit.

384
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Father called me to the palace.

385
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I won't disturb you.

386
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I'll go to the palace.

387
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Your Highness.

388
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I won't disturb you anymore.

389
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Where is Father?

390
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
His Majesty is resting.

391
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
He asked me to take care of him.

392
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Come and sit.

393
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Come.

394
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Try these desserts first.

395
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Is Father still well?

396
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Since the imperial physician prescribed the medicine,

397
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
the amount of the medicine has been reduced by half.

398
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
It's just that his health is not as good as before.

399
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
It's hard for you to have this filial piety.

400
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I hope His Majesty won't be harsh on you.

401
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
It's also my duty to share my worries for Father.

402
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Try this.

403
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
This is a special recipe from my mother's family.

404
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
How is it?

405
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
It's very delicious.

406
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Look at you.

407
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
You're eating like a child.

408
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Don't mind it.

409
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I just pity you.

410
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
You didn't have a mother to take care of you since you were young.

411
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
The Meng family has love.

412
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Although my mother's family is not as good as the three major families,

413
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
it can also be called the Wang family.

414
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
If there are children in the West,

415
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I won't be able to forget about his birth.

416
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Princess Lan, this...

417
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Just chat.

418
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Even if it's time,

419
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I should go serve His Majesty to take the medicine.

420
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
In the future,

421
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
you can come and sit here often.

422
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I'll go.

423
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I'll go.

424
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I'll go.

425
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I'll take my leave.

426
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Father, Mother,

427
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Meng Zhouyan is not a good person.

428
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
He's now in prison for a crime.

429
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
I should immediately push the case of the Wugu case to be reopened.

430
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
But Taohua...

431
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
If he doesn't return to the North Court to seek the antidote,

432
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I'm afraid he'll have too much time.

433
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Father, Mother, don't worry.

434
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
When I come back,

435
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I'll restart the case

436
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
and clear the Xie family.

437
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,500
As for such matters,

438
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I'd like you to wait for the Optional Lady's collapse.

439
00:27:48,000 --> 00:28:07,780
I'll

440
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
be right back.

441
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,760
Wait for me.

442
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:19,840
Wu Xiang,

443
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,160
I've decided to go to the North Court

444
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,360
with Peach Blossom tomorrow.

445
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,400
When I come back,

446
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,520
I'll go with you

447
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,000
to pay respects to my aunt and Xie family.

448
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,040
Did something happen?

449
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,080
Today, Father summoned me to the palace.

450
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,320
But Princess Lan came to see me.

451
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,960
She mentioned

452
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,840
that her mother was a virtuous woman.

453
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,040
If she had a son,

454
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,160
she wouldn't have been as good as her mother.

455
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,040
His Majesty wants you to die

456
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,200
under Princess Lan's name.

457
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,080
But if that's true,

458
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,760
my mother, Princess Shu,

459
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,720
will be killed by Uncle Shi.

460
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,200
From now on,

461
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,320
there will be no one like her.

462
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,560
His Majesty wants you to be the crown prince.

463
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,520
I have to make you a good start.

464
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,520
It seems that ordinary cases

465
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,800
are not allowed to be repeated.

466
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:21,840
Cousin,

467
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,160
go to the North Court with the princess.

468
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,600
I can do it myself.

469
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,000
Now the sword is in the hand,

470
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,320
we have to take action.

471
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,280
But the princess...

472
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,360
Don't worry.

473
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:33,840
I'll arrange it for you

474
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,040
at Peach Blossom.

475
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,480
Okay.

476
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,000
Cousin,

477
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,840
we two

478
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,160
work together

479
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,720
to make the truth

480
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,800
known to the world.

481
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:56,680
Hurry up.

482
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:57,920
Hurry up.

483
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,720
Move.

484
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,200
Move.

485
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,360
Hurry up.

486
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:05,520
Keep up.

487
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,320
Go.

488
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:09,560
Move.

489
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,320
Chu Shan has ordered

490
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,960
the Dachao family

491
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,040
to take the crown prince and Princess Shu

492
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,480
to frame the Wugu case

493
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,920
and deceive His Majesty.

494
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,840
The suspect has been convicted.

495
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,600
The Xie family is beheaded.

496
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,040
Don't let anyone go.

497
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,000
Yes.

498
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,200
Go.

499
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,960
Prime Minister, we searched everywhere

500
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,360
but we didn't find Chen Qingshu.

501
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,240
Go look for him again.

502
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,040
Yes.

503
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,240
Miss Leng,

504
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,000
how is it going?

505
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,520
Meng family's assets are all confiscated.

506
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,000
We have nothing to do.

507
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,400
Besides, the place of exile is far away.

508
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,080
It's convenient

509
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,960
to pick up the goods.

510
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,840
What if I can make the family's wealth

511
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,960
free from the hardship of exile?

512
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:48,240
enh

513
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,320
Master Meng,

514
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,000
how are you?

515
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,780
We hit one more than usual.

516
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,560
Ms. Xia.

517
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,480
Re staan w RS W

518
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,280
How should we thank You for this?

519
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,480
You wouldn't know

520
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,260
that I was a death.

521
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,320
I was free.

522
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,120
I know

523
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,360
You're kind whom I know very well.

524
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,360
Delete it.

525
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:31,960
Go.

526
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,680
I'm telling you doesn't matter.

527
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,440
The corresponds to me was before all these years.

528
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,200
Take it away.

529
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,800
I don't want to be courteous.

530
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,160
Xie's men are everywhere!

531
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,240
What's your relationship with him?

532
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,240
Before I became Shen Zaiye,

533
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,760
I had another name.

534
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,360
Xie Jing'an.

535
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,120
You planned the case of Wugui

536
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,160
and detained my father's love letter,

537
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,440
framed my family

538
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,040
and Princess Shu.

539
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,600
You ruined my family.

540
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:16,880
Meng Zhongyan,

541
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,200
do you admit your crime?

542
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:22,880
Yes.

543
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,400
I did it.

544
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,040
But what can it be?

545
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,480
The evidence was

546
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,400
set by His Majesty.

547
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,600
The evidence is solid.

548
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,200
It's been 18 years.

549
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,320
It's been a long time.

550
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,320
No.

551
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,600
As long as you confess your crime,

552
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,400
this case can be investigated.

553
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,400
Your Highness,

554
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,780
I really can't tell

555
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,880
if you've confessed or not.

556
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,520
How late have we been?

557
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,040
I will be willing to

558
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,720
let the subject-principal

559
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,840
be disappointed later.

560
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,040
I was planning to

561
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,040
HT the crimes of the entire clan.

562
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,680
Why should I give you

563
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,680
my consent?

564
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,160
and made the whole clan suffer.

565
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,160
Of course I regret it.

566
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,160
Not only regret,

567
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,160
I also regret that I wrote Mu Wuyin wrongly.

568
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,160
I even regret that

569
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:34,160
I didn't kill you back then.

570
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,160
You're so stubborn.

571
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,160
But fortunately,

572
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,160
your Meng family is still smart.

573
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,160
Aren't you curious

574
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,160
why the gate was suddenly opened

575
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,160
when we broke into the palace?

576
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,160
Miss Meng did it.

577
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,160
With this credit,

578
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,160
she has already made up for the mistake.

579
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,160
According to the law,

580
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,160
your Meng family's women

581
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,160
can be exempt from death,

582
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,160
but not from the crime of living.

583
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,160
If you don't do it,

584
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,160
you'll be punished.

585
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,160
But the crime of living

586
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,160
is between us.

587
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,160
You mean

588
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,160
Mu Wuyin will be able to succeed in his life

589
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,160
because Meng Zhenzhen

590
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,160
released you into the palace in advance?

591
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,160
Impossible.

592
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,160
Absolutely impossible.

593
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,160
Chen Zhen.

594
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,160
How could Chen Zhen betray me?

595
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,160
I want to see him.

596
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,160
I want to see him.

597
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,160
It just so happens

598
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,160
that he also wants to see you.

599
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,160
The rest,

600
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,160
you can tell him.

601
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,160
You ordered the gate to be opened?

602
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,160
Yes.

603
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,160
The palace is ruined

604
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,160
because of you.

605
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,160
My efforts are in vain.

606
00:36:44,160 --> 00:37:02,840
Father was

607
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,160
But now,

608
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,160
where can our Meng family

609
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,160
get better?

610
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,160
Hundreds of years ago,

611
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,160
our ancestors

612
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,160
also started from the white clothes.

613
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,160
Now we are still alive.

614
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,160
Meng's women will also live.

615
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,160
Meng's family

616
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,160
will have a future.

617
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,160
Please, father,

618
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,160
for the future of Meng's family,

619
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,160
write a letter of confession.

620
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,160
For the future of Meng's family,

621
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,160
I will do everything for you.

622
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,160
