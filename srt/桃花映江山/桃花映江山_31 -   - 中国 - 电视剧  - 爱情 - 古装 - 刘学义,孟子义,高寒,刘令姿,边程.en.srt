return to Luocheng?

Your Highness.

but tell him that you lost the antidote.

00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,280
He did this for me.

29

I dragged him down.

Father gave me.

109
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,680
I'm full. You should eat them.

00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,960

111
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,320
what happened afterward?

112
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,720
You dared to steal Prince Wuyin's lunch?

113
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,800
I won't do it again.

114
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,520
Hit her!

115
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,280
We must teach her a proper lesson!

116
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,320
I'll drown you!

117
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,080
The Qi Palace, to me,

118
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,680
is nothing but humiliation.

119
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,400
I'm sorry.

120
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,320
I didn't think it through.

121
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,760
You are just a child spoiled
by your father.

122
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,320
How could you truly

123
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,120
understand my pain?

Let me make it up to you.

127
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,000
I will give you everything I have.

128
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,880
You once told me

129
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,560
you would offer up Qi with both hands.

130
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,880
I believed it, time and time again.

131
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,960
Yet, I received only disappointment.

132
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,240
Hua,

133
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,880
I promise you,

134
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,800
this time,

135
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,280
you will have everything you want.

136
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,960
But this time,

137
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,920
I will do it my way.

138
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,440

139
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,760

140
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,000
(In return,)

141
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,560
(you must give me what I want.)

142
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,800
Wu Jiang will escort you

143
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,040
back to the capital.

144
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,160
Thank you, Chancellor Shen.

145
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,600
After this farewell,

146
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,280
who knows when we'll meet again?

147
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,680
Chancellor Shen.

148
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,760
Is there anything else?

149
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,400
Yes.

150
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,160
Although Mu Wuyin's fate is uncertain,

151
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,200
he colluded with Empress Lv
to harm Your Highness.

152
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,800
He has committed treason.

153
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,520
When you return,

154
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,120
report his crimes to His Majesty
as soon as possible.

155
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,080
If that happens,

156
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,760
then Wuyin may

157
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,200
lose his life.

158
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,000
Your Highness is compassionate,

159
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,360
but when facing injustice,

160
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,920
you must sometimes act with force.

161
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,920
I understand what you mean.

162
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,720
Sometimes, I have to strike like
a warrior attacking bandits.

163
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,960
I must be ruthless.

164
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,280
Is there

165
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,000
anything else?

166
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,280
No, that's all.

167
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,840
I will remember your teachings.

168
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,080
Please take care, both of you.

169
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,720
Zaiye, take care of yourselves.

170
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,160
Jiang Taohua.

171
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,040
I'll entrust my brother to you.

172
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,520
Take good care of him.

173
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,200
I'm the one taking care of her.

174
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,280
Qingying, don't worry.

175
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,720
Travel safe.

176
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,560
I take my leave.

177
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,640
Take care, everyone.

178
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,920
The conflict between noble families

179
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,080
and rising commoners
at court hasn't settled.

180
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,720
Do you trust him that much?

181
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,200
I realized long ago

182
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,600
that you are his cousin.

183
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,520
I saw both of you carrying
identical handkerchiefs.

184
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,400
You are sharp.

185
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,960
It makes sense that you discovered it.

186
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,280
Since Mu Wuxia passed the exam,

187
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,400
he has faced many challenges.

188
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,680
I believe

189
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:00,920
he is no longer

190
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,400
the naïve boy he once was.

191
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,480
As for me,

192
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,840
I can finally have some peace.

193
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,120
You promised to help me recover.

194
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,160
Don't go back on that.

195
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,520
Of course.

196
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:43,880
What's wrong?

197
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,040
Do you not recognize my face?

198
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,200
I felt a little dazed.

199
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,840
All of this

200
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,120
felt so surreal.

201
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,360
Do you remember

202
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,080
I once told you that

203
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,800
if I made it through this safely,

204
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,800
I'd have so many things to tell you?

205
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:13,880
In the past,

206
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,520
I always hesitated.

207
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,080
I always avoided it.

208
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,720
I feared that my suffering

209
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,720
would become your burden.

210
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,920
But I never realized

211
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,520
that this torment

212
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,440
would only cause more harm.

213
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,800
Only today

214
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,200
did I realize how deeply I regret it.

215
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,960
I never shared
my true feelings with you.

216
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,240
When I saw you alive,

217
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,480
I thanked the heavens

218
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,200
for not forsaking me.

219
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,760
Even if Empress Lv uses
the pill to control me,

220
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:46,880
does it matter?

221
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,640
A life of forced compromise

222
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,440
can last a hundred years

223
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,440
and never bring me the joy
of spending a day with you.

224
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,520
Look.

225
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,200
The hairpin you gave me.

226
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,720
I've kept it.

227
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,200
Your Highness, be careful!

228
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:37,640
Censor Liu,

229
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,840
is this really safe?

230
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:44,720
Be careful!

231
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,160
Your Highness.

232
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,280
After a thorough investigation,

233
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,880
this is the last barrel

234
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,560
of bitumen and saltpeter in the city.

235
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:57,880
Everyone,

236
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,280
well done.

237
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,280
That's great news!

238
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,960
We finally found it!

239
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,840
We owe it to Your Highness's courage.

240
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
We recovered all the barrels.

241
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,520
Otherwise, all of us

242
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,680
would've stayed on edge day and night.

243
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,920
- That's right.
- Exactly!

244
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,480
I couldn't have done it alone.

245
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,200
After this citywide catastrophe,

246
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,320
we still need everyone

247
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,800
to work together as one.

248
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,040
That's right!

249
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,000
We'll help!

250
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,920
Let's get back to work.

251
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,640
- Yes, sir!
- Yes!

252
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,320
Let's get to it!

253
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,160
Back to work!

254
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:25,800
Let's go.

255
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,320
Chancellor.

256
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,480
You don't have to join them.

257
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,480
I already asked Changjue

258
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,360
to handle the city's reconstruction.

259
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:53,760
By the way...

260
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:56,800
Look.

261
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,280
What is this?

262
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,920
This is called vinegar fruit.

263
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,960
Changjue mentioned this sour fruit

264
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,720
in the letter he sent to me.

265
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,240
This area is so barren.

266
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,800
This is the only fruit
we could find nearby.

267
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,920
Changjue has endured a lot.

268
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,320
Chancellor.

269
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,240
I'm truly glad that you treat Changjue

270
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,920
like a younger brother.

271
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,000
So,

272
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,040
now that Changjue is safe,

273
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,200
why don't we head
to Hao City right away?

274
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,520
Go to Hao City?

275
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,920
If we find the root cure
for the Jiangtao pill,

276
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,520
we can finally have peace.

277
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:44,720
Great.

278
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,320
In the past,

279
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,120
I never once thought
about what the future might be like.

280
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:49,800
But now...

281
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,280
Chancellor!

282
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,640
Chancellor, the scout has returned.

283
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,400
Empress Lv and Mu Wuyin
returned to Yujing.

284
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,040
Why would she go to Yujing?

285
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,920
She may be helping Mu Wuyin
fight for the throne.

286
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,560
Prince Wuxia could be in danger.

287
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,080
We need to return to Yujing.

288
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,800
Don't worry.

289
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,840
As long as we capture Empress Lv,

290
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,480
we will easily get the cure.

291
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,640
Where's the medicine?

292
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,520
Quick, bring me Wuyin!

293
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,000
- Your Majesty!
- Bring Wuyin to me now!

294
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,080
Did you ask for me, Father?

295
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,720
Greetings, Consort Lan.

296
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,600
I came to bring Father his medicine.

297
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,120
Father.

298
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,720
What happened to you?

299
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:34,480
Wuyin.

300
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,400
Are you feeling unwell?

301
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,920
Give me the medicine.

302
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:37,920
The medicine!

303
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:38,720
Hurry!

304
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:41,800
Father.

305
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,160
It's really unfortunate.

306
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,600
A few days ago,
my men mishandled things.

307
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,320
It blew up the cauldron.

308
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,080
We're still repairing it.

309
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,520
However,

310
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,920
I found this half a pill

311
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,040
in the ruins.

312
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,120
Take it for now, just in case.

313
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:03,800
Here.

314
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,640
How did that happen?

315
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,360
Didn't you say

316
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,080
your temple had
plenty of pill cauldrons?

317
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:26,800
Father.

318
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,600
Those cauldrons are
still making medicine.

319
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,840
They need more time.

320
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:32,720
Father.

321
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,240
I was thinking.

322
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,440
Why don't you

323
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,240
move to my temple?

324
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,760
Once the pills are ready,

325
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,880
you can take them immediately.

326
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,720
Wonderful.

327
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,320
Make the arrangements.

328
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,200
Your Majesty.

329
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,520
Right Chancellor.

330
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:03,880
Your Highness.

331
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,800
Does His Majesty suspect anything?

332
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,120
Those who are addicted

333
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,440
care about nothing

334
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,000
but the pills.

335
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,000
Then it seems

336
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,560
now is the time

337
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,600
to send Shen Zaiye

338
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,360
and Mu Wuxia on their way.

339
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,760
I'll leave it to you.

340
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,400
Have you secured the Palace Guards?

341
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,880
General Qi of the Palace Guards
has always been loyal to me.

342
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,720
So there shouldn't be

343
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,520
any problems.

344
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,320
It's just...

345
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,640
Now that it's actually happening,

346
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,040
I still have some concerns.

347
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,520
Do tell.

348
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,560
Once Your Highness takes the throne,

349
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,200
how can I ensure that

350
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,360
the Meng family

351
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,080
will remain the top family
in the Qi State,

352
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,640
and not be demoted

353
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,840
or destroyed?

354
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,280
Unless...

355
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,120
Unless we become one family.

356
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,280
I understand your concern,
Right Chancellor.

357
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,440
Your daughter and I
grew up knowing each other.

358
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,600
She is wise, gracious,
and well-educated.

359
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:32,960
Right Chancellor.

360
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,480
I am willing to marry
into the Meng family.

361
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,320
That way,

362
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,920
we will be family.

363
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,320
Right Chancellor.

364
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,360
Is that enough for you?

365
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,200
I am honored.

366
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,320
Thank you for accepting.

367
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:57,880
The Meng family will pledge our lives
to Your Highness.

368
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,280
That would be unnecessary.

369
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,560
I still need your help
with so many matters,

370
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,400
Father-in-law.

371
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:10,260
(Meng Residence)

372
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,520
Father, take back your decision!

373
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,360
Absolutely impossible.

374
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,480
Prince Wuyin has already agreed to this.

375
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,280
I'll speak to Prince Wuyin myself!

376
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:21,840
You dare?

377
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,960
During the tea gathering,

378
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,280
I made up my mind.

379
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,480
I won't live as a man's appendage.

380
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,520
All this time,

381
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,880
I have worked tirelessly.

382
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,920
Has any other Meng family member

383
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,520
done as much as I have?

384
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,320
The men can earn titles and ranks.

385
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,120
They can strengthen
our family's power at court.

386
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,440
Can you?

387
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,800
Don't think getting close
to Prince Wuyin

388
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,680
makes you so special.

389
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,080
What he values
is the noble family behind you,

390
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,200
not you yourself.

391
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,920
A woman's greatest worth

392
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,760
lies in forming alliances
through marriage.

393
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:10,920
Father,

394
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,840
do you want Prince Wuyin as your ally?

395
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,920
When he asked for your help
with the Palace Guards,

396
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,080
he was already losing.

397
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,320
If the Meng family becomes his in-laws,

398
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,640
we'll be too powerful to control.

399
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,680
We'll end up as expendable pawns.

400
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,120
Father, your plan

401
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,480
is not very wise after all.

402
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,920
Enough.

403
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,200
If you won't obey,

404
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,400
the Meng family has many daughters.

405
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,880
I won't hesitate

406
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,520
to raise more Meng Huairui.

407
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,320
Everything about Huaijin

408
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,160
can be replaced.

409
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,160
Even the name itself

410
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,960
can be erased from the family records.

411
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,080
So Empress Lv has already gone to Qi?

412
00:22:59,440 --> 00:22:59,920
Changjue.

413
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,160
Come back to Qi with us.

414
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,800
With Chancellor there,
he'll keep you safe.

415
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:08,760
Taohua.

416
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,920
I know you made this plan

417
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,360
to be safe

418
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,560
and foolproof.

419
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,120
However,

420
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:17,800
I can't go with you.

421
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,240
Why not?

422
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,160
With Empress Lv in Qi,

423
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,640
I can return to Hao City

424
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,080
and eliminate her faction.

425
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,160
This is our best chance
to restore the Jiang family's rule.

426
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,040
Taohua,

427
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,520
I'm not doing this just
for selfish reasons.

428
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,400
Empress Lv has
abused her power for years.

429
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,240
She brought suffering
to the people of Beiyuan.

430
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:43,680
Changjue.

431
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,520
You really have grown up.

432
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,520
As members of the royal family,

433
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,920
we do have a duty
to care for the people.

434
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,360
I didn't think it through.

435
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,400
Taohua.

436
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:58,960
Do you

437
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,560
still remember
what you told me as a child?

438
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,520
You said,

439
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,520
"Higher position comes with

440
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:06,760
greater burdens

441
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,200
and responsibilities.

442
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,360
Never forget it."

443
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,640
Qian Mochen taught me that.

444
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,040
He should be in Hao City.

445
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,960
If you go back,

446
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,000
please be cautious.

447
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,720
Don't worry.

448
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,320
I'm no longer the boy

449
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,040
who only hid behind you

450
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,040
for your protection.

451
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,360
As for Qian Mochen,

452
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,480
I will play it by ear.

453
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,720
If he's willing to help me,

454
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,920
I won't let hatred cloud my judgment

455
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:43,920
and make him an enemy.

456
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,360
But if

457
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,600
he refuses to help,

458
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,120
I'll settle old and new scores together.

459
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,040
All right.

460
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,240
If this is the path you've chosen,

461
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,960
I will give you my full support.

462
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,080
Thank you, Taohua.

463
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:03,920
Between you and me,

464
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,360
there's no need for thanks.

465
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,280
As the heir apparent,

466
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,640
you care about the refugees.

467
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,400
You worked

468
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,440
to free them from slavery.

469
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,560
Benevolent.

470
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,320
You risked your life
in a fire to save lives.

471
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,480
Courageous.

472
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,760
You surrendered willingly,

473
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,760
and to save others.

474
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,160
Honorable.

475
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,160
You helped rebuild their homes.

476
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,360
Wise.

477
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,240
It seems that Qi now has

478
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,600
a new rival.

479
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,360
Chancellor Shen, don't worry.

480
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,680
Without war,

481
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,520
the people live in peace.

482
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:38,920
Beiyuan

483
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,240
and Qi

484
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,160
can end the fighting for good.

485
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,880
That has always been my wish.

486
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,160
Changjue,

487
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,960
promise to write
and tell me you're safe.

488
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,080
Of course.

489
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,080
Then...

490
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,720
I'll leave my sister to you.

491
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:58,920
Don't worry.

492
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,680
Once we settle things in Qi,

493
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,240
we'll visit you together.

494
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:03,600
Good.

495
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,520
When that time comes,

496
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,200
I'll prepare a warm welcome.

497
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,000
Taohua,

498
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,480
there's no time to waste.

499
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,840
I'll start preparing.

500
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,240
Go ahead.

501
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,320
We should get going too.

502
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,320
All of a sudden,

503
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,640
I feel a little reluctant to leave.

504
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,800
Once we capture Empress Lv

505
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,720
and find the true cure
for the Jiangtao Pill,

506
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:36,920
we'll come back.

507
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,400
Stay as long as you like.

508
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,520
Yes.

509
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:53,180
(Shunjing Residence)

510
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,320
Hua.

511
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,640
Hua.

512
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,680
Time to change fresh dressing for a wound.

513
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,720
I will give you everything
you ever wanted.

514
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,080
But this time,

515
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,960
I will do it my way.

516
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:25,180
(Wedding)

517
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:50,800
Don't be afraid.

518
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,040
Wuyin.

519
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,000
You've always done what I asked.

520
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,760
Why did you suddenly bring me to Qi?

521
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,200
Hua.

522
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,560
I'm going to fulfill my promise to you.

523
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,960
Qi will soon

524
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,560
fall into my hands.

525
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,640
Don't you want
to see it happen for yourself?

526
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,400
Hua.

527
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,360
Soon,

528
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,840
I will throw you a grand,
magnificent wedding.

529
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,080
I will let the whole world see

530
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,320
that you and I

531
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,120
will rule the land together.

532
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,440
Hua.

533
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,320
After all these years,

534
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,480
our dream is finally coming true.

535
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,200
I'm so happy.

536
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,920
Aren't you?

537
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,680
Of course I am.

538
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,120
But look at my ankle.

539
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,840
It's hideous.

540
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:22,240
It will ruin our perfect wedding.

541
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,360
I remember the head of Lan Boutique

542
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,920
is a master at treating wounds.

543
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,320
How about

544
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,000
you bring him here?

545
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,720
Why do you want him?

546
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,200
I want him

547
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,520
to remove my scar.

548
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,000
Only then can you and I

549
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,000
have a flawless wedding.

550
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,960
Do you want a flawless wedding?

551
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:45,680
Yes.

552
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:48,720
Hurry up.

553
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,680
Go bring him here.

554
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,000
Hua.

555
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,120
Unfortunately, you're too late.

556
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,000
He's dead.

557
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,200
Dead?

558
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:10,920
Yes.

559
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,280
I killed him myself.

560
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,200
And not just him.

561
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,320
I also killed every single spy
from Beiyuan you left in Qi.

562
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I wiped them all out, one by one.

563
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,760
Do you know how long I've planned this?

564
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,040
Of course I do.

565
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,560
You spent so much effort
setting this all up.

566
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,560
Of course I also know

567
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,680
that if they were still alive,

568
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,680
you would have something
to fall back on.

569
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,160
But in your heart, there is

570
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,160
never a place for me.

571
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,000
Hua.

572
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,760
I will break your wings.

573
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,520
Only then

574
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,000
will you stay by my side forever.

575
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,680
Only then

576
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,880
will you willingly

577
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,720
become my wife.

578
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,400
You want me to be your pawn?

579
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,240
Keep dreaming.

580
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,280
I will never marry you.

581
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,560
Whether you marry or not,

582
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,240
it's not up to you.

583
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,300
(Wedding contract)

584
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:41,960
Mu Wuyin!

585
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,440
I hate being controlled and manipulated.

586
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,800
You might as well kill me.

587
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,360
You've gone mad.

588
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,920
How do you know I've gone mad?

589
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,240
You drove me mad!

590
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,760
The moment the gates closed in my face,

591
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,760
I finally understood.

592
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,800
Only by standing on top

593
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,560
can I have you.

594
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,320
Hua.

595
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,040
Even if you die,

596
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,920
five days from now,

597
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,840
I'll still marry your corpse
in a wedding ceremony.

598
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,000
I want the whole world to know

599
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,480
that you are mine,

600
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,120
and mine alone.

601
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,120
I, Li Dian,

602
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,360
request to see His Highness.

603
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,120
Your Highness.

604
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,400
The Chancellor sent me
to deliver a message.

605
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,560
Mu Wuyin and Empress Lv
returned to the residence.

606
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,240
The Chancellor and the Princess
are heading to Yujing.

607
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,320
I must enter the palace
and see Father first.

608
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,360
Not now.

609
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,760
His Majesty hasn't held court for days.

610
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,000
The Palace Guards
were constantly reassigned.

611
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,160
Prince Wuyin and Chancellor Meng
control the court.

612
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,040
All of Yujing

613
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,800
is under their control.

614
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,280
If you enter the palace alone,

615
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,720
you'll walk into a trap.

616
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,200
We were only away for days.

617
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,120
Yujing's already become a dragon's den.

618
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,520
You are absolutely right.

619
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,240
The Chancellor said

620
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,320
Your Highness can take refuge
at my place.

621
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,280
Once he returns,
you can plan your next move.

622
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,480
So be it.

623
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:33,800
Go.

624
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:34,800
Hyah!

625
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:35,760
Hyah!

626
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,160
Don't mind them.

627
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:41,920
This is bad.

628
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:42,760
It's a trap.

629
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,380
(Shunjing Residence)

630
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,040
Right Chancellor.

631
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,120
Your Highness.

632
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,480
My men came up empty.

633
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,560
Shen Zaiye escaped.

634
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,720
What about Mu Wuxia?

635
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,120
He still hasn't returned to Yujing.

636
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,120
Then, we can stop giving my father

637
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,000
his precious medicine.
