=Episode 28=

18
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,320
Li Dian!

19
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,200
Li Dian.

20
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,640
No.

21
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,040
Mr. Li, congratulations.

22
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,400
You're the top scholar.

23
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,440
I'm the top scholar?

24
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,000
Why is Your Majesty so happy today?

25
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,040
Let me tell you.

26
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,960
I just received

27
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,600
this year's top scorer, Li Dian.

28
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,440
This man is truly full of knowledge.

29
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,640
Moreover,

30
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,560
his insights on politics
are sharp and deep.

31
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,920
This time,

32
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,840
Wuxia really made the right choice.

33
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,480
He truly found a man of talent.

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,640
In the past,

35
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,600
I always thought this child

36
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,120
was too honest

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,320
and lacked tact
in handling people and matters.

38
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,080
Seems like I was arbitrary.

39
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,920
You're harsh
because you care deeply about him.

40
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,200
Genuine fatherly love
isn't considered arbitrary.

41
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,600
Fatherly love?

42
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,680
Well said.

43
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,280
However,

44
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,520
I still think

45
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,880
he lacks decisiveness.

46
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,400
I fear he can't keep them in line.

47
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,080
You need not worry.

48
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,840
Let Wuxia gain some real experience.

49
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,480
He will surely have great potential.

50
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:18,800
Yes.

51
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,440
He really must gain more experience.

52
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,120
(Shunjing Residence)

53
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,720
Your Highness.

54
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,040
No need to dwell on it.

55
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,080
Since His Majesty agreed
to Prince Wuxia's exam,

56
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,520
he had to give face.

57
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,520
That's why
he made Li Dian the top scorer.

58
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,120
Why do you think

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,960
Li Dian would bother me?

60
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,600
You're worried
Prince Wuxia might gain favor

61
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,040
for recommending him.

62
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,680
I couldn't care less

63
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,400
what they do.

64
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,440
Check again

65
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,920
if Hua has replied.

66
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:57,760
Your Highness.

67
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,200
Since you quit the exam

68
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,040
and sent the letter to Her Highness,

69
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,360
I check it several times a day

70
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,480
as per your instructions.

71
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,000
There's still no reply
from Her Highness.

72
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,280
She must resent me.

73
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,480
I'll go check again.

74
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,120
Your Highness.

75
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,840
Our informants report

76
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,000
that Qi State's imperial exam
have concluded.

77
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,960
(Cui Wei)
Mu Wuxia won Emperor Qi's favor

78
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,420
(Head of Empress Lv's Shadow Guards)
and the scholars' support

79
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,680
because of this.

80
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,600
Noble clans of Qi are playing safe.

81
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,200
None dare act recklessly.

82
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,440
The entire Qi

83
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,120
seems peaceful.

84
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,760
This matter still vexes me.

85
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,720
I devised such a brilliant plan,

86
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,640
yet Mu Wuyin ruined it.

87
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,320
He can't do anything right.

88
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,880
Your Highness, Prince Wuyin
sent an urgent letter.

89
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,760
(Shen Zaiye is investigating Hua)

90
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,240
Shen Zaiye, you again.

91
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,760
How dare you come after me?

92
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,480
Looks like you have a death wish.

93
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:34,920
Your Highness.

94
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,360
All these years,

95
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,160
we've tried to strike him.

96
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,760
But even now,

97
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,440
we still don't know
how many shadow guards

98
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,360
he has around him.

99
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,400
Trying to attack him
in Qi State's Yujing

100
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,200
is far too difficult.

101
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,520
If Yujing isn't ideal,

102
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,520
lure everyone out.

103
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,240
That eyesore, Jiang Taohua,

104
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,920
is bound to interfere again.

105
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,120
That Mu Wuxia

106
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,520
also opposes me at every turn.

107
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,520
I want them to know

108
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,000
that whoever defies me

109
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,080
will meet their doom.

110
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,520
You're wise, Your Highness.

111
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,760
But how do we get them to leave Yujing?

112
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,320
Emperor Qi currently favors Mu Wuxia.

113
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,640
From what I know of him,

114
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,600
if he wants to make Mu Wuxia his heir,

115
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,760
he'll pave the way for him.

116
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,360
My spies

117
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,520
near Qi State's border

118
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,560
can now be put to use.

119
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,120
Qi State's border?

120
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,080
It's near Beiyuan's Luocheng.

121
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,680
Luocheng is just lis away.

122
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,600
Have them pose as bandits

123
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,560
and stir up trouble.

124
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,720
You're wise, Your Highness.

125
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,800
How's Jiang Changjue?

126
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,280
Over in Luocheng,

127
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,320
Commandant Deng watches him closely.

128
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,800
Nothing's gone wrong.

129
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,120
Seems like our light restraints

130
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,600
aren't causing enough misery.

131
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,200
Time to go all out.

132
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,780
(Luocheng,
Exile Region on Beiyuan's Border)

133
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,440
Hurry.

134
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,440
Hurry.

135
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,440
Move!

136
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,360
Hurry.

137
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,800
(Jiang Changjue, Beiyuan Prince)

138
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,120
(Jiang Changjue, Beiyuan Prince)
Hurry.

139
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,940
Don't slack.

140
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,576
Hurry.

141
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:29,720
Hurry.

142
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,080
Hurry.

143
00:07:32,632 --> 00:07:34,600
- Hurry.
- (Of the camps near Beiyuan's border,)

144
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,160
(only Luocheng hasn't been searched.)

145
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,960
(Prince Changjue might be here.)

146
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:41,760
Hurry.

147
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,200
Hurry up.

148
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,520
Hurry up!

149
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,400
Liu, you're slacking off again.

150
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:52,800
Stop!

151
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:54,880
Get lost!

152
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,240
His Highness.

153
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,840
Jiang Changjue,

154
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,440
mind your own business.

155
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,280
How dare you disobey me?

156
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,080
I'll report this to Commandant Deng.

157
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,400
Do as you wish.

158
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,640
You... Just wait.

159
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,280
Boys, watch Jiang Changjue.

160
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,800
- Your Highness.
- Are you hurt?

161
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,960
(Turns out His Highness)

162
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,423
(can't come and go freely here.)

163
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,000
Her Highness told me

164
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,120
not to be impulsive.

165
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,960
Censor Liu, let me help you to rest.

166
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,160
Sure.

167
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,080
Come on.

168
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,920
(Seems I must follow
His Highness secretly.)

169
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:45,944
Be careful.

170
00:08:45,944 --> 00:08:48,820
(Liu Jian'an, Beiyuan's Imperial Censor)

171
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,960
Jiang Changjue.

172
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,160
Commandant Deng summons you.

173
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,200
Your Highness.

174
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,000
Quit dawdling. Hurry.

175
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,280
I'll be fine.

176
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,840
Commandant Deng, Jiang Changjue is here.

177
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,040
What are you doing?

178
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,240
Let me go!

179
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,200
Jiang Changjue,

180
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,960
you're a real troublemaker in my camp.

181
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,360
Why say that?

182
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,200
I oversee a place of exile.

183
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,000
(Deng Xiao,
Defending General of Luocheng)

184
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,640
Not a charity.

185
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,746
This place is full

186
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,200
of vicious exiled criminals.

187
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,400
But you?

188
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,200
You're busy doing charity.

189
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,440
You even helped
exiled ministers' children

190
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,120
escape slavery.

191
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,000
Do you admit

192
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,440
all this?

193
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,600
I do.

194
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,240
But the ones I helped

195
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,880
aren't vicious exiled criminals.

196
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,360
Empress Lv framed them...

197
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:03,880
Silence!

198
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,240
Someone wants

199
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,000
a piece of your flesh.

200
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,520
I'm His Majesty's son.

201
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,200
You wouldn't dare.

202
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,240
I doubt His Majesty even remembers

203
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,200
he has a son like you.

204
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,400
You didn't even make a sound.

205
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,920
You're a real man.

206
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,960
Take him away.

207
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,040
Guard him closely.

208
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,200
Without my orders,

209
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,520
no one

210
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,960
is to release him.

211
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:43,741
- Yes.
- Yes.

212
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,760
Deng Xiao,
you're disloyal to the royal family!

213
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,800
You side with Empress Lv.

214
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,840
One day, you'll reap what you sow.

215
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,600
(Do Good Deeds)

216
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,280
Your Highness.

217
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,600
Her Highness has replied.

218
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,920
Summon Jiang Taohua.

219
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,400
Yes.

220
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,080
Your Highness.

221
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,200
What do you need?

222
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,200
I've just acquired something.

223
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,360
Miss Meng,

224
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,080
please take a look.

225
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,800
Look closely.

226
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,800
Miss Meng,

227
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,360
this item looks familiar, right?

228
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,320
Changjue.

229
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,200
Watch the fire.

230
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,240
Don't let it go out.

231
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,840
I'll fetch more charcoal.

232
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,560
Changjue, what's wrong?

233
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,480
What happened?

234
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,640
How did you get burned?

235
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,960
I tried to guard the fire.

236
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,400
I was afraid the wind would put it out.

237
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,840
It's my fault.

238
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,200
It's my fault.

239
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,280
Changjue.

240
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,280
What did you do to Changjue?

241
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Why so nervous?

242
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,320
Jiang Changjue's still alive,

243
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,520
but he doesn't have much time left.

244
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,400
I just heard

245
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,200
that he's
going to receive military punishment.

246
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,000
Military punishment?

247
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,080
That's right.

248
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,400
He broke military rules in Beiyuan.

249
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,920
He wished to see you before his death.

250
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,280
Since you share
a deep bond with your brother,

251
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,080
why don't I send you to meet him?

252
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,760
Where is he?

253
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,160
Luocheng, the place of exile.

254
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,640
Why are you so kind?

255
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,840
You don't have to trust me.

256
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,040
You can wait and see.

257
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,960
See if Jiang Changjue loses his head.

258
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,600
Speaking of,

259
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,640
it's dangerous

260
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,840
for a lady like you to travel alone.

261
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,080
How about asking
Shen Zaiye to go with you?

262
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,480
Shen Zaiye?

263
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,280
If Chancellor Shen goes with you,

264
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,760
you won't die alone.

265
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,560
(So they were targeting)

266
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,160
(Shen Zaiye all along.)

267
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,240
I've prepared a fast horse for you.

268
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,920
The journey is far.

269
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,680
If you keep delaying,

270
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,160
your brother will be dead.

271
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:28,920
Chancellor.

272
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,480
Horses and supplies are ready.

273
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,840
We're heading to Beiyuan

274
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,960
with 30 shadow guards

275
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,280
at your command.

276
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,520
I'll go
to Prince Wuyin's residence first.

277
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,960
Then, we'll depart immediately.

278
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,040
Chancellor.

279
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,600
Her Highness hurriedly rode out

280
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,800
of Prince Wuyin's residence.

281
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,000
She's heading to North Gate.

282
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,240
(Why would Prince Wuyin let
Jiang Taohua leave?)

283
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,880
(Something must've happened.)

284
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,080
Jiang Taohua!

285
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,680
(Shen Zaiye.)

286
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,520
Why are you here?

287
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,960
Have you had people watching me?

288
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,200
Something happened?

289
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,480
Prince Wuyin sent me on a mission.

290
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,040
Where are you going?

291
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,600
None of your concern.

292
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,800
Please mind your own business.

293
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,560
No matter how important or urgent
your affairs are,

294
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,760
I will take care of them.

295
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,440
If Chancellor Shen goes with you,

296
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,440
you won't die alone.

297
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,520
(Since they're after Shen Zaiye,)

298
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,080
(things could take a different turn)

299
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,600
(if he doesn't go.)

300
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,320
Shen Zaiye.

301
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,680
From the moment we met,

302
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,000
I knew you were coldhearted.

303
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,600
You tormented,

304
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:29,840
humiliated,

305
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:30,960
distressed,

306
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,000
hunted

307
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,040
and tortured me.

308
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,640
There was never trust or affection
between us.

309
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,560
I've always thought
this is the real you,

310
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,840
yet you keep clinging to me.

311
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,680
You keep pretending

312
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,360
to seem affectionate.

313
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,960
Don't you think it's ridiculous.

314
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,720
You remember everything.

315
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,920
The moment you saved me from that lake,

316
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,800
I remembered everything.

317
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,920
So you've been hiding

318
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,080
the truth from the start.

319
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,680
You and I are strangers now.

320
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,480
There's nothing to hide.

321
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,560
I simply don't want to explain.

322
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,840
I don't believe you.

323
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,960
What will it take for you to let me go?

324
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,400
Jiang Taohua.

325
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,880
We kept testing each other

326
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,200
and guarding against one another

327
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,800
that we ended up like this.

328
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:25,880
Now,

329
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,480
I want to hear your pain.

330
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,320
I want to fight your battles.

331
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,280
Do you trust me?

332
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,560
Shen Zaiye,

333
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,320
our fate has run its course.

334
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,880
Why force it?

335
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,880
I'm in a hurry. I must go.

336
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,760
Is it Qingtai or Changjue?

337
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,600
Changjue's in trouble?

338
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,400
It's none of your concern.

339
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,800
Beiyuan is far away.

340
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,000
Did Mu Wuyin give you the antidote?

341
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:00,960
He did.

342
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,040
Impossible.

343
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,280
Jiang Taohua.

344
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,400
If I don't go with you,

345
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,760
you can't save Changjue.

346
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,000
If I can't save him,

347
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,440
it's our fate then.

348
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,680
I want nothing more to do with you.

349
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,640
I don't want to owe you anything either.

350
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,960
I've never met Changjue,

351
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,400
but I've always considered him family.

352
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,640
I, Shen Zaiye,

353
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,000
am only a wandering lonely soul.

354
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,480
I have few close relatives.

355
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,320
If Changjue is in danger,

356
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,120
how can I turn away?

357
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,861
♪Become clear over time♪

358
00:18:36,946 --> 00:18:39,480
♪The long night passes in a flash♪

359
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,320
We'll head toward
Beiyuan's Xingzhou first.

360
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,800
Have Wu Jiang catch up to us.

361
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,400
Yes.

362
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,960
(How can I get rid of him?)

363
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,200
Your Highness.

364
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Just as you predicted,

365
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,840
they're headed to Beiyuan.

366
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,440
Your Highness.

367
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,800
What's our next move?

368
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,360
Time to whisper in Father's ear

369
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,520
and send Wuxia on his way.

370
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:11,640
Yes.

371
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,120
Father.

372
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,560
I've brought your pills.

373
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,680
Hand them over immediately.

374
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,400
Hurry.

375
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,640
Wuyin.

376
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,160
This is really your forte.

377
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,400
I lack the skill to rule.

378
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,480
I only wish to seek
immortality and enlightenment.

379
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,520
You're my son

380
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,440
and a prince of Qi.

381
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,880
How can you be so unambitious?

382
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,280
You know me well.

383
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,600
I've always been this way.

384
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,640
Please don't be offended.

385
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,560
Father.

386
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,120
Don't worry.

387
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,640
You still have Wuxia.

388
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,320
Wuxia cares for the people
and is capable.

389
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,200
Please train him well.

390
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,800
Brotherly harmony

391
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,320
is a blessing for the royal family.

392
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,360
Very good.

393
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,560
Father.

394
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,440
I have one more thing

395
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,120
to remind you.

396
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,160
Go ahead.

397
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,680
I overheard

398
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,000
some noble families say
Wuxia is too gentle.

399
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,840
They speak with disdain.

400
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,360
Wuxia is a good scholar,

401
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,600
but he does lack in combat skills.

402
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:55,580
(Dingyuan Prefecture's Bandits)

403
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,720
Summon Wuxia to the palace.

404
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,080
Yes, Your Majesty.

405
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,000
Father.

406
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,960
Are you saying

407
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,200
you want me to handle the bandit threat
at the border?

408
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:13,880
Are you afraid?

409
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,640
But I

410
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,840
have only read military books.

411
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,360
I worry

412
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,720
that talking strategy

413
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,800
will only make me a joke

414
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,120
and humiliate you.

415
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,280
Knowing strategy is enough.

416
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,440
They're just bandits.

417
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,920
What's there to fear?

418
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:32,960
I've issued a decree.

419
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,000
Commander Dong Lang at the border

420
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,400
will assist you.

421
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,440
He has fought countless battles

422
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,440
and is experienced
in commanding an army.

423
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,400
By then,

424
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,320
learn all you can from him.

425
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:47,960
Wuxia,

426
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,080
you've picked many fine talents

427
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,600
for me and Qi

428
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,000
in this imperial exam.

429
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,400
Your contribution is undeniable.

430
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,120
I hope you keep working hard

431
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,640
and not fail

432
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,440
the effort I've invested
in nurturing you.

433
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,200
When you

434
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,480
return in triumph,

435
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:09,840
I'll

436
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,200
entrust you with greater duties.

437
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,840
I accept.

438
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,480
I won't fail you.

439
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,520
Get prepared then.

440
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:30,880
Yes.

441
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:32,960
I will now leave.

442
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,360
Letting Wuxia handle the bandits

443
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,680
will help him earn military merit.

444
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,840
Leave everything

445
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,960
to Dong Lang.

446
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,760
You think of everything.

447
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,240
Deliver this secret letter to Dong Lang.

448
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,920
Once he reads it,

449
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,840
he'll understand my intentions.

450
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

451
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:16,760
Mu Wuxia.

452
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,600
Why is a scholar like you

453
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,480
holding a broadsword?

454
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,360
Are you planning to be an executioner?

455
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:26,560
What?

456
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,720
Do you think

457
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,120
this blade doesn't suit me?

458
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,720
With your looks,

459
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,920
a sword suits you best.

460
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:35,600
See?

461
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,120
I use a sword myself.

462
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,440
Swords are weapons used on foot.

463
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,080
On horseback,

464
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,560
a blade works better.

465
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,440
So you're riding and wielding a blade?

466
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,560
Where are you going?

467
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,480
Father sent me to the border
to fight bandits.

468
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,960
Fight bandits?
Why didn't you say so earlier?

469
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,560
How about I become your strategist

470
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,560
and bodyguard?

471
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:57,920
No.

472
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,760
I'm going to fight bandits.

473
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,120
How can I bring you along?

474
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,240
You can go when you can't fight.

475
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,320
Why can't I?

476
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,480
No one can beat me.

477
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,840
Except Zaiye,

478
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:09,880
Zhanlu

479
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:10,880
and Qingtai.

480
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,440
So I'm the fourth best.

481
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,400
No means no.

482
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,840
Fighting bandits is no child's play.

483
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,000
Besides,

484
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,440
if anything happens to you,

485
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,960
how do I explain to Chancellor Shen?

486
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,200
How dare you say I'm playing?

487
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,360
I'll kill you.

488
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,480
Even if you kill me,

489
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,040
I still can't take you.

490
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,060
(Qi, Yujing)

491
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:08,860
(Qi, Yujing)

492
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,120
The fish are moving.

493
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,520
That small Luocheng

494
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,400
is about to get lively.

495
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:36,800
Your Highness.

496
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:02,340
(Beiyuan's Capital, Hao City)

497
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:04,680
Your Highness.

498
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,600
As you predicted,
Jiang Taohua and Shen Zaiye

499
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,280
are on their way to save Jiang Changjue.

500
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,520
Prince Wuyin

501
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,280
had Mu Wuxia sent to the border too.

502
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,360
We're just waiting
to wipe them all out in one go.

503
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:17,600
Cui Wei.

504
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,840
Take men to the border

505
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,760
and stir up chaos.

506
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,480
Lure Mu Wuxia into Luocheng.

507
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,640
Luocheng's warden, Deng Xiao,

508
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,040
was once His Majesty's confidant,

509
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,440
but he's still not one of us.

510
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,240
We mustn't trust him easily.

511
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,840
You must handle it yourself.

512
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,240
Understood.

513
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,220
(Luocheng)

514
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:36,760
Go.

515
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,200
Go.

516
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:39,560
Hurry!

517
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:40,600
Keep up!

518
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,240
Peasants captured at Qi's border

519
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:43,800
are all here.

520
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,880
Don't worry, General.

521
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,600
Our men are disguised as bandits.

522
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,440
No one knows we're Beiyuan soldiers.

523
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,400
Good.

524
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,840
We'll now wait for Mu Wuxia.

525
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,420
(Inn at Qi's Border)

526
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:28,560
Enter.

527
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,720
Your Highness, a letter from the border.

528
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,080
(Bandits have fled
toward Beiyuan's Luocheng.)

529
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,400
(They must be caught before crossing)

530
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,200
(Beiyuan's border.)

531
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:45,520
Wang Xi.

532
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,040
Yes.

533
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,400
Alert everyone

534
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,480
to depart at once.

535
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,000
Yes.

536
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,120
The bandits have fled toward Beiyuan.

537
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,240
Wang Xi, pass the order.

538
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,280
From today on,

539
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,480
they can only rest
from the Hai hour to the Yin hour.

540
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,480
We must intercept them

541
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,400
within Qi territory.

542
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:00,760
Yes.

543
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,400
Let's go.

544
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,440
Your Highness.

545
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,680
Your Highness.

546
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:06,960
One more person.

547
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,240
Mu Wuxia.

548
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,440
I already explained to you.

549
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,800
Fighting bandits

550
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,840
is no child's play.

551
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,360
You...

552
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,760
What if you get hurt?

553
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,520
Mu Wuxia.

554
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,680
Stop looking down on me.

555
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,720
When I roamed the world,

556
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,000
you were still wetting the bed.

557
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,520
Miss Qingying.

558
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,040
Mind your words.

559
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,240
Wang Xi.

560
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,600
No choice.

561
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,120
Mu Wuxia.

562
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,040
Don't be mad.

563
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,960
I'll head back myself.

564
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:18,760
Xiang Qingying.

565
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:23,920
I command you

566
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,920
to be my personal guard.

567
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,160
Stay close and protect me.

568
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,280
Will you?

569
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,160
Yes.

570
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,460
(Luocheng)

571
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,040
Commandant Deng.

572
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,280
You knew Her Highness

573
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,240
kept Jiang Changjue
for greater purposes.

574
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,680
How dare you
pretend to obey but defy her

575
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,080
and let him escape?

576
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,480
Do you think Hao City is too far

577
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,920
for her power to reach here?

578
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,200
But Her Highness

579
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,560
isn't so easily deceived.

580
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,640
Commandant Deng.

581
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,720
A great storm is coming.

582
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,240
Taking both sides

583
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,480
will make you lose your footing.

584
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,440
I dare not lie to you

585
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,880
nor to Her Highness.

586
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,200
I'll send my men to find him now.

587
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,000
I'll bring

588
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,280
Jiang Changjue to you within three days.

589
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,200
Three days?

590
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,720
If you fail to hand him over

591
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,480
before nightfall today,

592
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,120
you'll take on

593
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,960
a different role here.

594
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,040
Zhan Lu, you follow me all day.

595
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:05,920
Can you stop already?

596
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,320
I won't go easy on you
if you keep following me around.

597
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,160
No.

598
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,320
Do you think
I wanted to go through all this trouble

599
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,120
just to find you?

600
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,560
Just tell me where His Highness is.

601
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,560
I'll leave immediately.

602
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,000
I've told you countless times.

603
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,240
His Highness is missing.

604
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,160
Why won't you believe me?

605
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,360
Because you lie all the time.

606
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,960
How is saying I'm returning to Beiyuan
to find my family a lie?

607
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,520
He's Her Highness's brother,

608
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,760
so he's my family too.

609
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,400
I don't believe it.

610
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,760
Stop following me.

611
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,280
Can you cut it out?

612
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,080
Heaven help us!

613
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,600
You're picking
on a helpless widow like me.

614
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,320
What a bitter life.

615
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,400
What do I do?

616
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,520
This is top-grade leather.

617
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,880
Madam, I'm so sorry.

618
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,960
It's fine. I'll pay for the lambskin.

619
00:31:59,240 --> 00:31:59,800
Sorry.

620
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:00,720
You'll pay?

621
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,400
Alright, hand over the money.

622
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,800
Why are you smiling? Pay up!

623
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:08,680
Madam.

624
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,640
Are you and your wife from the south?

625
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,840
Buy her a few more.

626
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,200
Otherwise, your wife

627
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,960
can't handle Beiyuan's weather.

628
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,640
Madam, we aren't...

629
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,920
Miss, you must be newlyweds.

630
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,880
When I just got married,

631
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,120
I was even more shy than you.

632
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,600
I didn't even dare enter the room.

633
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,560
Zhanlu, don't run!

634
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,840
Luocheng isn't far from here.

635
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:40,801
Don't worry.

636
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,360
Before we reach the city,

637
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,600
Changjue will be safe.

638
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,200
Here.

639
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:06,640
Thank you.

640
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:15,920
(He's done a lot)

641
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,720
(to help and take care of me
on this journey.)

642
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,520
(He's sincere.)

643
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,960
(It's exactly why)

644
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,960
(I can't let him risk himself for us.)

645
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,040
(He should grow old peacefully)

646
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,680
(in Yujing.)

647
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,560
Rest here for a while.

648
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,680
I'll gather some firewood.

649
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,840
(She took all the horses.)

650
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,840
(Is she that afraid I'll catch up?)

651
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:48,580
(Luocheng)

652
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,120
Commandant, Princess Chengping is here.

653
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,320
The princess?

654
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,880
Rumor said she died
falling from a cliff in Qi.

655
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,720
Are you sure?

656
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,560
The gate guard
served at the palace before.

657
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,920
Her presence here

658
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,800
must be related to Jiang Changjue.

659
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,640
Follow Her Highness.

660
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,320
If Jiang Changjue appears,

661
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,440
report immediately.

662
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:35,800
Yes.

663
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,280
(Good timing.)

664
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,160
(I can wipe them out in one sweep.)

665
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,560
(You're not)

666
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,400
