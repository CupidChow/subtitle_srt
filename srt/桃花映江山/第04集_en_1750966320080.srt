1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I will never forget your kindness

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I will never forget your kindness

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I will never forget your kindness

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I will never forget your kindness

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I will never forget your kindness

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I will never forget your kindness

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I will never forget your kindness

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I will never forget your kindness

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I will never forget your kindness

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I will never forget your kindness

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I will never forget your kindness

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I will never forget your kindness

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I will never forget your kindness

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I will never forget your kindness

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I will never forget your kindness

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I am from the Little Silly Valley

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Since I was a child

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
on the way to Peach Blossom

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I have never had any water

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You don't say you want to prepare some snacks

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
but this mouthful of water

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
will make you feel dizzy

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This time I went to the wildland

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and gathered wild animals

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I used all the food I could find

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Is it convenient to go to the wildland?

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I am a man, so I have no fear

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The Crown Prince's banquet

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
is full of wine and wine

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's not convenient for you to go there

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The scenery is beautiful

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I came here to enjoy the fish and wine

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
If you want to go there

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
you can go around

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I am tired on this journey

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I can't do it again

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Can I rest with Qingtan?

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
As you wish

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Even if you are a man

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
you can't escape from death

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Enjoy the view

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
How can Shen Zaiyi

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
have such a good mood?

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
This time I came alone

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Is it a trap set by me?

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The sun is shining

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
No one dares to move

48
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
even if the incense is lit

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The tea for the morning tea

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
is prepared by the master

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
for the princess

52
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Please enjoy

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Safe

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The tea for the morning tea

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
is really good

56
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The crab cake is sweet and salty

57
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's delicious. Princess, try it

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You can't drink it

59
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
What's wrong?

60
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I suddenly remember

61
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
the time when I was twelve

62
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I was in the palace

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
with my sister

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I was in the palace

65
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
with my sister

66
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
and my brother

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I was in the palace

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
with my sister

69
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
and my brother

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I was in the palace

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
with my sister

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
When I was twelve

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I got a box of crab

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
from the merchant

75
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Xishu gave it to me

76
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The crab was delicious

77
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
But I ate it for a few days

78
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I almost died

79
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Then you can't touch it

80
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I thought

81
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
it was the crab

82
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So I went to my father

83
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and cried

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I was grounded for a long time

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
He said I made trouble

86
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Then

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
a little eunuch from the south

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
saw me and told me

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
that the crab was fine

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
But if you eat it with the morning tea

91
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
you will have a fever

92
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I knew it

93
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I didn't poison the crab

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I didn't poison the crab

95
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
No wonder

96
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
we went out so early

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
and the water was not given

98
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I am from the north

99
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
and I am the princess

100
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Even if I have eaten crab

101
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I am served by the workers

102
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I won't know these cold-blooded things

103
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
But

104
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
why did the eunuch want the princess to vent his anger?

105
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So

106
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
you have checked

107
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
the things in the study

108
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The crown prince's banquet

109
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
According to the etiquette

110
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
the princess should go with you

111
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You are careful

112
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I am more assured

113
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
The crab and the morning tea

114
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
were prepared by the princess

115
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
He wants to kill me

116
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
with the crown prince's hand

117
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Your highness

118
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Wan Niang sent the food

119
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Tell Wan Niang

120
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
not to leak the food

121
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
He won't kill me before the crown prince comes

122
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
He wants to kill me

123
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
after I have the crab

124
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
after the banquet

125
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
and bury me to the crown prince

126
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
But the princess has just seen the fire

127
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
How dare he?

128
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
He is the crown prince

129
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
At that time

130
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
the crown prince and the princess

131
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
are the most important

132
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
to the prince

133
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And Shen Zaiye

134
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
The concubine he married

135
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
was killed by the crown prince

136
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The prince said he would compensate her

137
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's a wonderful thing

138
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Princess

139
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I will protect you and kill you

140
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
We can't leave the country

141
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
No

142
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Changjue is waiting for me

143
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
What should we do?

144
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
We can't sit here and wait

145
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Premier

146
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Wan Niang reported that the princess had been poisoned

147
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
According to the plan

148
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
it will take a while

149
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Why is it happening now?

150
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Maybe the princess

151
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
is not well

152
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
The plan is to let Wan Niang

153
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
kill the crown prince now

154
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
When the crown prince comes

155
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
he will find a bucket

156
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
and change his clothes

157
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Then the dead

158
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
and the crown prince

159
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
will be killed

160
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I see

161
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I came too soon

162
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I don't know when

163
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I can go to such a place

164
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Don't worry

165
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
We can come together

166
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
The staff of the palace

167
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Take care

168
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Princess

169
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Shen Zaiye is soujeombive

170
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,220
Liutai afraid that you could kill him.

171
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:32,900
The

172
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:39,120
eliful

173
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,220
쟈,

174
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,420
Those blind servants

175
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,500
should chop off one hand

176
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,020
and be more obedient in the future

177
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,500
It's a pity that I'm a doctor

178
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,100
You don't have to worry about this

179
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,340
I'll accompany you

180
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,340
after you change your clothes

181
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,740
I'll drink three cups

182
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,300
Si Bolt

183
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,660
Shi Siqin

184
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,500
Nothing happens

185
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,660
Wan Niang

186
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,460
TKA It's really him?

187
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,500
Do you know who ends up India?

188
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,340
King of Jingāo?

189
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,300
careful

190
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,300
Yes.

191
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,380
If Lady Jiang escapes from Luyanyuan,

192
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,100
what should we do?

193
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,140
They are all on their own.

194
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,380
They will definitely seek His Majesty's protection.

195
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,940
We must stop them before they enter the city.

196
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,460
Yes.

197
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,260
What about the Crown Prince?

198
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,660
I'll go and stop him.

199
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,580
Yes.

200
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,620
Not anymore.

201
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,260
Go back to report to the Prime Minister

202
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,900
that the Princess has been discovered.

203
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:05,740
Yes.

204
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,540
Princess, where should we go?

205
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,900
He has moved the heart of the kill.

206
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,220
He can't avoid it.

207
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,900
Now there is only one person

208
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:15,860
who can save our lives.

209
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,460
Qingtan.

210
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,140
You must help me get out of the chase.

211
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,940
Before I find the person who saved my life,

212
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,420
I need a plan.

213
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:30,940
Plan?

214
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:31,820
Yes.

215
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,540
To fight that person's plan.

216
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,100
Princess, don't worry.

217
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:37,860
Princess.

218
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:40,020
Even if you put on the mirror,

219
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,380
I won't waste my time.

220
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,340
Today I bought this full-fledged pig's leg

221
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,620
and this pig's blood.

222
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,540
We must

223
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,980
have a feast in the city.

224
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:57,700
Okay.

225
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,460
Go.

226
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:07,740
Come on.

227
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:27,660
Oh no.

228
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:28,860
It's stuck.

229
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,260
Who is it?

230
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,540
Coming.

231
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,780
Yes.

232
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,020
When being taken to the Forbidden City by Jiang brother,

233
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,620
looked at each of them in wonder,

234
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,100
this person lost consciousness without question.

235
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,700
As the well-established Princess Hier territorial ventilation office was built,

236
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,540
isn't it

237
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,420
a great reaction now?

238
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,780
I'm afraid that I'll call him to rest after I give you the weapon

239
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,580
Fine

240
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,700
I'm looking for you today

241
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,540
I have something else to do

242
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,140
Your Highness, the emergency came up

243
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,380
I think we can only have the dinner here

244
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,340
Wait

245
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,140
It took me an hour to come here

246
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,020
Prime Minister Shen is so generous

247
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:40,300
I have to leave without saying a word

248
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,620
It's urgent

249
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,020
Please forgive me

250
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,820
What if I don't want to forgive you?

251
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,020
Then I'll let you go

252
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,500
You bitch

253
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:06,260
You don't deserve to be punished

254
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,060
Let me go

255
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,060
Your Highness, the emergency came up

256
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,060
We have to do something to deal with Prime Minister Shen

257
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,660
Let him suffer

258
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,060
Your Highness

259
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,700
You're right

260
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,180
Shen is so ungrateful

261
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,340
I don't have to bother to test him

262
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,900
If he wants to investigate the money

263
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,340
let him do it

264
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,540
When he finds out that he has no way out

265
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,820
he will commit suicide

266
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,020
Yes

267
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,780
Xiaolian, I'm righteous

268
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:02,180
Don't treat the green card of Qiao's Manor as Mrs. Jiang

269
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,180
I'm sorry

270
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,180
I didn't stop her

271
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,180
Please punish me

272
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,300
I underestimated her

273
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,980
She went to the city

274
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,980
but she didn't see the Lord

275
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,980
Who else will help her in the capital?

276
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,260
Young Master

277
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,980
I finally found you

278
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,980
My fourth prince asked you to come to my mansion

279
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:27,780
Young Master

280
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,820
It's reallyThe Lord

281
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,700
It turns out that the 4th Prince assigned是 Billie forjuvy

282
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,780
Can you see it clearly?

283
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,220
Do you still distinguish me?

284
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,500
I'm not good at medicine.

285
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,980
I can only put the princess's blood on it.

286
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,660
If you want to cure her,

287
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,140
I need to take a pair of anesthetic.

288
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,180
It will heal the wound.

289
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:10,140
Why are you smiling

290
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,380
after the princess is so badly injured?

291
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,980
I just remember

292
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,300
when I was young,

293
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,580
I was hurt every time.

294
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,700
I was afraid that

295
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,540
my brother would be worried about me.

296
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,420
I have no relatives or friends in Qi.

297
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,460
I feel so close to

298
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,980
the princess.

299
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,380
Be careful.

300
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,380
Yes.

301
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,140
I have three brothers in my name.

302
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,460
But I grew up in the palace.

303
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,980
I haven't had much fun since I was young.

304
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,780
The family is so close.

305
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:55,860
It's rare for the princess to have such a brother.

306
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,940
It's fate

307
00:17:58,740 --> 00:17:59,820
to have a brother and sister.

308
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,500
It's also a choice.

309
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,980
The Sui Meng House was in trouble.

310
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,300
Everyone was angry with me.

311
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,660
It was you who

312
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,820
saved my life.

313
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,380
I was caught in a storm again.

314
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,500
It was you who saved me.

315
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,260
Your kindness

316
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,780
is my pleasure.

317
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,700
You don't have to be polite.

318
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,460
I just did it on purpose.

319
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,460
But

320
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,060
why are you so badly injured?

321
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,940
Today, the Prime Minister

322
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,300
and the Crown Prince

323
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,100
met in the Luye Garden.

324
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,740
They took me there.

325
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,580
But they met an assassin.

326
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,100
I couldn't find the Prime Minister.

327
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,900
I didn't expect it.

328
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,060
It's not easy for you to be alone outside.

329
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:55,100
If you don't mind that I'm not a man,

330
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,820
you can find me if you have any problems.

331
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,700
Thank you, Your Highness.

332
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,140
Maid.

333
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:06,860
Maid.

334
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,620
Is the medicine ready?

335
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,500
No, Your Highness.

336
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,340
My wound is not easy to get rid of.

337
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,580
You'd better go back and handle it yourself.

338
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,180
Are you not a man

339
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,100
or are you afraid of being a man

340
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,540
because of the air?

341
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,340
My Lord.

342
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,660
You're used to it, aren't you?

343
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,060
You broke into someone else's house

344
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,620
and entered your own house.

345
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,340
I heard that you were here

346
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,020
and wanted to find someone.

347
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,940
If you have any offense,

348
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,980
please forgive me.

349
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,500
If you have enough trouble,

350
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,340
you can go back with me.

351
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,140
I'll go back with you.

352
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,420
My Lord.

353
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,100
She's injured so badly.

354
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,740
You don't have to care about her.

355
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,980
Can't you just let her heal?

356
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,620
Don't worry, Your Highness.

357
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,540
Jiang Taohua.

358
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,220
You can fool others

359
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:22,700
but not me, who was born in the wild.

360
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,220
The blood is so thick.

361
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,540
It's not human blood.

362
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,220
In the eyes of Lord Xiang,

363
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,900
Taohua is no longer a human.

364
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,380
What else can I say?

365
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,580
Shen Zaiye.

366
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,340
You're a minister.

367
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,340
You've been a minister

368
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,820
and you've been in the court

369
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,020
to kill people.

370
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,260
You're a man

371
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,500
and you're so careless.

372
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,500
What right do you have

373
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,340
to treat the princess now?

374
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:54,940
You...

375
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,100
Taohua thought

376
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,860
the killer in the wild

377
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,380
was coming for Lord Xiang.

378
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,700
I'm just a fish in the water.

379
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,980
Now it seems

380
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,140
Lord Xiang wants Taohua's life.

381
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:28,980
So,

382
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,660
I'll take it.

383
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,380
Shen Zaiye.

384
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,220
Maybe others are afraid of you.

385
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,900
But I'm not afraid.

386
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,140
I'll take care of

387
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:40,980
the assassination of the princess.

388
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,720
She's skilled.

389
00:21:50,980 --> 00:22:02,540
I know

390
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,460
that it won't be easy

391
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,100
to trick a croc,

392
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,020
so I'll spare myself

393
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,580
and fight him.

394
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,100
I want to see how you can kill me

395
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,100
in your dream.

396
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,100
Prime Minister,

397
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,100
you are the princess.

398
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,100
I shouldn't have done that.

399
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,100
But I can't

400
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,100
avoid the danger today.

401
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,100
I'm asking you,

402
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,100
does the assassination

403
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,100
have anything to do with you?

404
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,100
I hope you can think it over before you answer.

405
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,100
Don't use that trick

406
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,100
to trick me again.

407
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,100
Yes.

408
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,100
I really regret that

409
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,100
I was able to

410
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,100
make up his mind

411
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,100
and let him marry you.

412
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,100
I thought that

413
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,100
a princess would be willing to be a concubine

414
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,100
and you would be more considerate.

415
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,100
But I didn't expect that

416
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,100
you would use those tricks

417
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,100
against the court

418
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,100
on a woman

419
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,100
for your own benefit.

420
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,100
You are really...

421
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,100
You are really a coward.

422
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,100
Your Highness,

423
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,100
everything in the world

424
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,100
is not black and white.

425
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,100
Sometimes,

426
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,100
you make the wrong decisions

427
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,100
for the right reasons.

428
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,100
I admire your

429
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,100
determination to make a son.

430
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,100
But even if you want

431
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,100
to do something good,

432
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,100
you can't keep

433
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,100
the peach blossom

434
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,100
in your mansion for the rest of your life.

435
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,100
If you want to

436
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,100
take her back,

437
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,100
you must make a promise to me

438
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,100
that you will protect her well.

439
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,100
Remember,

440
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,100
no matter what happens to her,

441
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,100
I can count on you.

442
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,100
If you don't take her back,

443
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,100
I am also

444
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,100
my father's biological son.

445
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,100
Even if I risk my life,

446
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,100
I won't let you live well.

447
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,100
What are you laughing at?

448
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,100
Nothing.

449
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,100
I just remembered.

450
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,100
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

451
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,100
I was unwilling to

452
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,100
take the anesthetic.

453
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,100
I can't do anything

454
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,100
if I don't

455
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,100
take the peach blossom

456
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,100
in a clear state.

457
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,100
You can cure the wound

458
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,100
after taking the peach blossom?

459
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,100
Yes.

460
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,100
I'll go then.

461
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,100
You don't want to

462
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,100
play any tricks again, do you?

463
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,100
Didn't Your Highness

464
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,100
say that

465
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,100
if there is a

466
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,100
three-time

467
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,100
or two-time

468
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,100
peach blossom,

469
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,100
I will take it all.

470
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,100
Now,

471
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,100
I am the one

472
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,100
who is most afraid of her death.

473
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,100
Besides,

474
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,100
it's too late

475
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,100
for you to take the peach blossom.

476
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,100
Otherwise,

477
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,100
you can do it yourself.

478
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,100
I'll let you try.

479
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,100
I'll ask you one last time.

480
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,100
Are you sure you don't need the anesthetic?

481
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,100
No.

482
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,100
Since you chose to take the peach blossom,

483
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,100
then you can take it.

484
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,100
Tell me.

485
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,100
How did you know?

486
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,100
I was just a nobody.

487
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,100
I was just...

488
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,100
You are lucky.

489
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,100
If I were really lucky,

490
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,100
I wouldn't be lying here.

491
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,100
Qi is so powerful

492
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,100
that it's so dangerous.

493
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,100
Why did you

494
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,100
ask for help from the Fourth Prince?

495
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,100
I was just trying to bet.

496
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,100
If I dare to go to the palace today,

497
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,100
I will be in a difficult situation.

498
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,100
I might as well take the risk.

499
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,100
If I win,

500
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,100
I will win.

501
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,100
Take a break.

502
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,100
No need.

503
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,100
It's easy to pass out

504
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,100
after a short break.

505
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,100
So what?

506
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,100
Prime Minister,

507
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,100
you know me well.

508
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,100
It's easy to pass out.

509
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,100
Can you still wake up?

510
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,100
You don't need the anesthetic

511
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,100
because you are afraid of your own life.

512
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,100
I'm afraid that

513
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,100
I might poison you again.

514
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,100
You are the princess of the North Court.

515
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,100
But you are still living

516
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,100
in the forest.

517
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,100
It's really not easy.

518
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,100
If it weren't for that,

519
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,100
how could I

520
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,100
be alive

521
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,100
in the death of the wolf and the tiger?

522
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,100
Lord Shen,

523
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,100
will you really...

524
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,100
I will.

525
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,100
I just think that

526
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,100
your angry face

527
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,100
is worse than your

528
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,100
angry face

529
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,100
when you took the gun away.

530
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,100
You look much more handsome.

531
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,100
I've loved and hated all my life.

532
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,100
But I can't help missing you.

533
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:09,100
You are the most beautiful flower in the world.

534
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:12,100
I don't know when I will bloom again.

535
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,100
I'd rather wait for the moon to come.

536
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,100
Then I will

537
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,100
get better sooner.

538
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,100
After all,

539
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:57,080
I will give the dead a

540
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,100
I can only look at this place.

541
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,100
I can't scare others.

542
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,100
You don't have to be so happy.

543
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,100
I have promised the fourth prince

544
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,100
to keep you safe.

545
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,100
Sleep for a while.

546
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,100
I think Qi Feng is the right match for her.

547
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,100
I didn't expect that she is the princess of Northland.

548
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,100
Lord Shen,

549
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,100
Lady Jiang has been in a coma for a long time.

550
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,100
Should I

551
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,100
go to see a doctor again?

552
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,100
No need.

553
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,100
She is fine now.

554
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,100
She will recover in a few days.

555
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,100
Besides,

556
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,100
during her recovery,

557
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,100
all the expenses

558
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,100
should be paid by the Zhengchun Pavilion.

559
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,100
Anyone in the mansion should be responsible

560
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,100
for the treatment.

561
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,100
I understand.

562
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,100
Don't go.

563
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,100
Mother.

564
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,100
Don't go.

565
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,100
Mother.

566
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,100
It's spicy.

567
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,100
This is our Haodu's wine.

568
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,100
You can drink this.

569
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,100
It's delicious.

570
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,100
Mother.

571
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,100
Don't go.

572
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,100
I'm sorry.

573
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,100
I'm sorry.

574
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,100
I'm sorry.

575
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,100
I'm sorry.

576
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,100
Don't go.

577
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,100
Mother.

578
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,100
Don't go.

579
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,100
Mother.

580
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,100
Take the lake water as wine

581
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,100
drift in the flat land

582
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,100
and cool the land

583
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,100
When you grow up, you will know

584
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,100
She is better than those

585
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,100
wine in our palace

586
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,100
Mother, so beautiful

587
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,100
Want to

588
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,100
But father said

589
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,100
Girls shouldn't touch these

590
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,100
How to sell this

591
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,100
This one, don't sell

592
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,100
She is the heaven

593
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,100
See that bell

594
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,100
As long as you shoot it

595
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,100
This is yours

596
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,100
Mother, so far

597
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,100
I can't see clearly

598
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,100
Can you shoot

599
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,100
Boss, lend me a sword

600
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,100
Mother, so great

601
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,100
Men are the bear and eagle in the sky

602
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,100
Women are also the horses on the grass

603
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,100
No one is inferior to anyone

604
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,100
Remember

605
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,100
What you want to do

606
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,100
There is nothing you can't do

607
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,100
In mother's heart

608
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:50,100
You are the bravest

609
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,100
The most helpful baby

610
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,100
Yue Tang

611
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,100
You have accompanied me to the divine palace for a few years

612
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,100
Have you ever seen the gentleman?

613
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,100
Don't think too much

614
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,100
We just took the lady to the study

615
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,100
to see her

616
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,100
After a few days, she was badly injured

617
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,100
It's strange

618
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,100
I understand

619
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,100
Lady Jiang was injured

620
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,100
She must have something to do with you

621
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,100
But what I see today

622
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,100
You are not

623
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,100
thinking about the lady

624
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,100
Our lord

625
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,100
is really born to be an official

626
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,100
What about love?

627
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,100
Be his way

628
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,100
Everyone has to die

629
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,100
Then we should

630
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,100
send the thing out as soon as possible

631
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,100
Otherwise, the lord will find out

632
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,140
The

633
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,140
evil Prime Minister's attitude towards the princess has changed

634
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,140
Is he planning

635
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,140
some new conspiracy?

636
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,140
It's not a long-term relationship

637
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,140
to see the thing out as soon as possible

638
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:08,140
I have to think of a way

639
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:10,140
to stop him

640
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,140
I have to think of a way

641
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,140
to stop him

642
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:16,140
to make him be passive

643
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,140
to make him be passive

644
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,180
But the poison in the princess's body

645
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,180
is about to start again

646
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:22,180
The most important thing now is to get the antidote

647
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,180
Should we send the thing out as soon as possible?

648
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:40,180
I will write them out now

649
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,180
I will write them out now

650
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:20,180
I will write them out now

651
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:36,180
Give this to Yang Wanqing

652
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,180
It's said that

653
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,180
it's all the date and wind map

654
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:41,180
that the queen of Lv wanted

655
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,180
But the ban of Feng Mansion

656
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,180
hasn't been lifted yet

657
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,180
Now no one can leave the mansion

658
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:50,180
You didn't say that you won't let anyone in, right?

659
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:52,180
Although I didn't say that

660
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,180
no one can enter the mansion recently

661
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:58,180
I didn't say that

662
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,180
Anyway

663
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,180
If you want to open a window in the room

664
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:04,180
you have to let people believe

665
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,180
that you want to break the roof

666
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,180
Let me out

667
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,180
Let me out

668
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,180
Why don't you let me out?

669
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,220
Why don't you let me out?

670
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,220
Who gave you the order?

671
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,220
Miss Qingtai

672
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,220
Miss Qingtai

673
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,220
Don't make it difficult for me

674
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,220
The prime minister has ordered

675
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,220
that no one can leave the mansion

676
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,220
My princess is seriously injured

677
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,220
She misses her hometown

678
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:30,220
and wants to eat the snacks of the North Campus

679
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,220
Can't you be satisfied with such a small thing?

680
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,220
The prime minister said

681
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:36,220
that he would take care of our princess

682
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,220
You are pushing each other

683
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,220
Aren't you afraid that

684
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,220
the prime minister will punish you?

685
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,220
Let me out

686
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,220
Let me out

687
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,220
Sister Jiang

688
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,220
Sister Jiang

689
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,260
I can't make decisions about leaving the mansion

690
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:50,260
You can order me to cook whatever you want

691
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:52,260
The snacks of the North Campus

692
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,260
Can you cook well?

693
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,260
She is a princess

694
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,260
The prime minister just ordered

695
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:01,260
and she made such a fuss for food

696
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,260
She has no sense of propriety

697
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,260
It's so embarrassing

698
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:07,260
I feel so depressed

699
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:10,260
after escaping from the Peach Blossom Temple

700
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,260
I can't help missing my family

701
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,300
I am so embarrassed

702
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,300
I can't even give you food

703
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,300
How can you say that

704
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,300
you are the fairy of the Zhengchun Pavilion?

705
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,300
Qingtan

706
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,300
It's not that you don't understand

707
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,300
It's because a thief stopped us

708
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,300
and broke into our mansion

709
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,300
What do you mean?

710
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,300
I am just following the order

711
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,300
Whose order?

712
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,300
The prime minister said

713
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,300
if you are rude, you will be punished

714
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,300
Xiang Taohua

715
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,300
Don't think that you have left

716
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,340
a few drops of blood

717
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,340
You

718
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,340
Princess

719
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,340
Why did you hit her?

720
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,340
What are you doing?

721
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,340
It's your wife

722
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,340
who hit herself

723
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,340
What are you talking about?

724
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,340
I saw it with my own eyes

725
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,340
It's her fault

726
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,340
Stop talking nonsense

727
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,340
Enough

728
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,340
Don't hurt our sister

729
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,340
Go tell the prime minister

730
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,340
to make a decision

731
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,340
Since she has a private affair

732
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,340
we should let her go

733
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,340
But it's impossible to go out

734
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,340
We can find someone to send her

735
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,340
The other ladies agree

736
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,340
We need to find a wife

737
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,340
to accompany her

738
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,340
I understand

739
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,340
Prime Minister

740
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,340
Since she was attacked

741
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,340
she has changed a lot

742
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:35,340
What?

743
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,340
She has changed a lot

744
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,340
She has changed a lot

745
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,340
What?

746
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,380
What?

747
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,380
It's just that the fox's tail

748
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,380
can't be hidden

749
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,380
It's just a prototype

750
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,380
I didn't want to find her

751
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,380
but she hit herself

752
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,380
Then help me

753
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,380
to be the bait for her

754
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,380
Stop

755
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,380
What are you doing?

756
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,380
I'm here to deliver food

757
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,380
What do you need?

758
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,380
I can't let anyone

759
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,380
miss out

760
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,380
Madam, please

761
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,420
Thank you

762
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,420
Thank you

763
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,420
I should be fine

764
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,420
I should be fine

765
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,420
Give her the food

766
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,420
Don't let her in

767
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,420
Yes

768
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,420
Madam

769
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,420
It was the Prime Minister's trick

770
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,420
He has suspected me

771
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:39,420
Now he doesn't want to trick me

772
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,420
and get me into trouble

773
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,420
It's not important

774
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,420
and we can't be safe

775
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,420
But now

776
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:46,420
we can't get out of here

777
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,420
We need to find another way

778
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:50,420
Since he has suspected us

779
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,420
we can just let it go

780
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,420
No

781
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,420
You and Meng family are the same

782
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,420
I can't risk it

783
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,420
You should

784
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,420
think about your future

785
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,460
Your Majesty

786
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,460
I can see

787
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,460
your love for the Prime Minister

788
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,460
But if you succeed

789
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,460
you and the Prime Minister

790
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,460
will be doomed

791
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,460
In the future

792
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,460
I'm the eldest daughter of Meng family

793
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,460
Meng family

794
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,460
only has Meng family

795
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,460
I can't have Meng Zhenzhen

796
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,460
I have to

797
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,460
find a way to send it out

798
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,460
This is

799
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,460
the picture of the sun and the wind

800
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,460
If what you said

801
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,460
is made by the Prime Minister

802
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:44,460
Xue Ran

803
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,460
the picture of the sun and the wind

804
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,460
is definitely suspicious

805
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,460
But

806
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:09,460
these paintings are different

807
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,460
not by one person

808
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,460
I'm afraid it's the picture

809
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,460
that was made by someone

810
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,460
and put in the study

811
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,460
to lure the snake out of the hole

812
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,460
What do you mean

813
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,460
You don't have to worry

814
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,460
Shen Zai did the same

815
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,460
which means he doesn't have the painting

816
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,460
Please tell the Empress

817
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,460
that I'm not the one

818
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,460
who made the painting

819
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,460
I'm not the one

820
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,460
who made the painting

821
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,460
I'm not the one

822
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,460
who made the painting

823
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,460
I'm not the one

824
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,500
Please tell the Empress

825
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,500
to be patient

826
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,500
I'll help Shen Zai

827
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,500
find the painting

828
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,500
You always praise the princess

829
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,500
for being smart

830
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,500
It seems so today

831
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,500
But the princess

832
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,500
you don't need

833
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,500
so many little smarts

834
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,500
After all, this antidote

835
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,500
can only be used for one month

836
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:03,540
We can't

837
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,540
pass the exam like this

838
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:05,540
next time

839
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:06,540
Please rest assured

840
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,540
I know what I'm doing

841
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,540
You're quite serious

842
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,540
At such a good time

843
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,540
you didn't take action

844
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,540
You just

845
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,540
show off your painting and play the zither

846
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:20,540
and play the zither yourself

847
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:21,540
If she doesn't take action

848
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,540
we can't take action

849
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,540
It's quite tough

850
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,540
Please inform the emperor

851
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,540
that the peach blossom is pregnant

852
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:27,540
and is also very considerate

853
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,540
I'm very worried

854
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,540
Let her in

855
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:33,540
Come

856
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:39,540
Thank you

857
00:41:58,540 --> 00:41:59,540
The shopkeeper said

858
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,540
the peach blossom

859
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:02,580
is the most popular style

860
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,580
among the noble women

861
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,580
in the capital

862
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:06,580
Take a look, sir

863
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,580
Is it good?

864
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,580
Ten taels of gold and a piece of cloth

865
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,580
You

866
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,580
really don't take yourself as an outsider

867
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:17,580
After I finish

868
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,580
you may feel

869
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,580
it's cheap

870
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,580
You seem

871
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,580
to be different today

872
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:28,580
You seem to have more

873
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,580
confidence

874
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:32,580
I just know

875
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,580
a little secret of you

876
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:37,580
Knowing my secret

877
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:40,580
is not a good thing

878
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:43,580
These days

879
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:44,580
the peach blossom has been self-sufficient

880
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:46,580
What did you do

881
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:48,580
that made you want to kill me

882
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,580
After thinking about it

883
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,580
it should be that day

884
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:55,580
you broke into the study

885
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:58,580
and broke the pot

886
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,580
that you were going to use

887
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:00,580
to fish

888
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:02,580
Not only that

889
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:04,580
What you heard

890
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:05,580
is what you said

891
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:08,580
The matter of the seal

892
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:10,580
should be that someone

893
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:12,580
took away the flowers that you wanted

894
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:17,580
What is it?

895
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:19,580
The little silk that was given

896
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:21,580
by the peach blossom

897
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:22,580
can be found out by the master

898
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:24,580
But the strange thing is

899
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:25,580
after he died

900
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:27,580
there was no movement in the house

901
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:30,580
It means that the person behind

902
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:32,580
is someone

903
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:33,580
who doesn't want to move

904
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:35,580
or who can't move

905
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:38,580
Jiang Peach Blossom

906
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:40,580
You were born in the palace

907
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:42,580
You should know

908
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:44,580
the more curious you are

909
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:46,580
the faster you die

910
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:50,580
Of course I know

911
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:52,580
But I am a weak woman

912
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:53,580
I live in a foreign country

913
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:55,580
If I want to live

914
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:57,580
I can only cooperate with you

915
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:58,620
If the peach blossom

916
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:00,620
can help you find that painting

917
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:02,620
can you agree

918
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,620
to protect me?

919
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:09,620
You want to cooperate with me?

920
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:12,620
It's not easy to have more helpers

921
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,620
Niu Yang will form a group

922
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:20,620
and I

923
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:22,620
will be used to being alone

924
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:28,620
Jiang Peach Blossom

925
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:30,620
You are clever

926
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:33,620
and you are brave

927
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:36,620
So what?

928
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:38,620
You are a princess

929
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:41,620
but you are hurt

930
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:43,620
You are a concubine

931
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:46,620
and you want to be a prostitute

932
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:52,620
I have been in the palace

933
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:54,620
for a few days

934
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:55,660
I have seen the situation

935
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:57,660
and you and Madam

936
00:44:58,660 --> 00:44:59,660
have made a deal

937
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:01,660
She doesn't take the painting

938
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:03,660
and you can't get it

939
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:04,660
But I

940
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,660
have a way to break the game

941
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:10,660
I am willing to die for you

942
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:13,660
I don't know if you are willing

943
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:16,660
to give me a chance to go with you

944
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:55,660
The wind blows

945
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:58,660
The city is in a mess

946
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:02,660
The petals are gone

947
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:06,660
The heart is broken

948
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:09,660
The tears are falling

949
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:13,660
There is nowhere to go

950
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,700
The wind is broken

951
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:19,700
Dew and snow Investigate left and right

952
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:24,000
Hope

953
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:26,660
Wish

954
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,700
additional leads can grow

955
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,700
Regret

956
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:38,700
Death in despair

957
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:12,200
Love and hate can only be eaten

958
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:16,200
Flowers wither, the heart is broken

959
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:23,200
No need to tell me anymore

960
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:34,200
Waiting for the sea to be crazy like him

961
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:41,700
Not afraid to be misunderstood

962
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:49,200
Listen to what he said

963
00:47:49,200 --> 00:48:00,200
It turns out that he has a heart of gold
