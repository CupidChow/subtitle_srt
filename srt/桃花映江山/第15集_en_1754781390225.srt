00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,510
(Adapted from the novel "Peach Blossoms
Reflecting the River and Mountains")

16
00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:40,980
(by Bai Lu Cheng Shuang)

17
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,900
=Episode 15=

18
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,600
Lady Jiang
has been recovering well recently.

19
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,560
Don't worry.

20
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,360
Don't call her Lady Jiang anymore.

21
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,720
What should I call her?

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,360
She's the princess of Beiyuan.

23
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,320
You should call her "Your Highness"

24
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,600
like Qingtai.

25
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,640
Yes.

26
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,890
What has Madam been
doing these past few days?

27
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,480
Meng Huaijin has just passed.

28
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,800
She returned home for mourning.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,560
Keep an eye on her and the Meng family.

30
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,600
The Mengs have lost their heir.

31
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,600
They surely won't relent so easily.

32
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,520
Understood.

33
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:29,340
(Meng Residence)

34
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,240
Huaijin!

35
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,240
Huaijin!

36
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,320
Huaijin!

37
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,600
Huaijin!

38
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,280
Madam.

39
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:50,960
Huaijin!

40
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,240
Huaijin!

41
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:52,760
Madam.

42
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:53,680
Come.

43
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,440
Calm down.

44
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,600
Madam.

45
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,040
Huaijin was

46
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,840
a convicted man.

47
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,440
To be buried intact
in a coffin is already

48
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,720
His Majesty's grace.

49
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,880
With such conduct,

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,320
do you still intend

51
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,920
to bring more trouble
upon the Meng family?

52
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,600
The dead are gone like a snuffed lamp.

53
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,920
Huaijin died for the sake
of the entire Meng clan.

54
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,000
Father, would you not
allow me to grieve?

55
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,840
I wish to speak with Zhenzhen.

56
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,320
You may all leave.

57
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,520
I know you hold resentment in you.

58
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,440
But for the sake
of the entire Meng family,

59
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,520
we had no choice

60
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,520
but to give up your brother.

61
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,080
Huaijin was the legitimate heir
I raised with my own hands.

62
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,600
But now,

63
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,440
I must send off my own son.

64
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,080
The pain in my heart...

65
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,640
is greater than yours.

66
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,840
If not for

67
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,400
that cursed Shen Zaiye,

68
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,200
how would our family

69
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,320
end up in this predicament?

70
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,480
Though His Majesty
did not hold us accountable,

71
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,520
at this moment,

72
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,480
the Meng family line

73
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,480
is already far from what it once was.

74
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,680
Those who came to mourn today

75
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,600
were none but those
with the Meng surname.

76
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,840
Not a single outsider showed up.

77
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,560
You and Shen Zaiye

78
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,280
have been married for many years.

79
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,840
When he struck against
the Meng family so ruthlessly,

80
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,440
did he not even spare a single thought

81
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,000
for the bond you two shared
as husband and wife?

82
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,400
Meng Huaijin!

83
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,480
Your own blood brother,

84
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,440
my only heir!

85
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,120
If you must hate,

86
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,360
then hate him.

87
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,920
You can't swallow this anger,

88
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,760
but neither can I!

89
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,480
Now that he has rendered great service,

90
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,360
he's now at the height of his power.

91
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,040
What use is it if you can't let this go?

92
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,440
At the height of his power?

93
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,040
You call that the height of his power?

94
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,480
He is nothing but a treacherous man.

95
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,560
He rose to power overnight.

96
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,640
And now he seeks

97
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,480
to wipe out the Meng family at its root.

98
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,880
He has humiliated our family

99
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,160
so thoroughly.

100
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,800
Should we not

101
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,120
avenge this?

102
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,400
There is something

103
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,280
I must entrust to you.

104
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,000
This item

105
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,680
is tasteless and odorless.

106
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,200
Ingesting it causes instant death.

107
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,880
Let Shen Zaiye

108
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,440
pay with his life for your brother.

109
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,120
Father,

110
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,760
you want me to poison him?

111
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,800
You are his wife.

112
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,120
You have plenty of chances.

113
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,840
Have you ever thought, Father,

114
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,640
what will happen to me

115
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,040
if I fail this mission?

116
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,720
Do it for your brother.

117
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,040
For the Meng family.

118
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:20,540
(Meng Residence)

119
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,600
The young master has only just passed.

120
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,960
Yet, Master wants you to take a life.

121
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,600
The risks aside,

122
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,760
just the fact that
you still love the Chancellor...

123
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,480
(When you see this letter,
I am already gone.)

124
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,680
Master should not...

125
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,780
(Farewell, Meng Huaijin.)

126
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,360
Father has always been this way.

127
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,120
Otherwise Huaijin wouldn't have...

128
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,480
Has the Chancellor made a move lately?

129
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,480
What moves could there be?

130
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,160
He just goes to Zhengchun Boudoir
every single day.

131
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,800
I also heard that

132
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,680
the Chancellor went
to the palace himself

133
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,720
to request princessly
privileges for her.

134
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,320
He even plans to take her

135
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,760
to Consort Lan's tea banquet.

136
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,040
Bringing a concubine
to a palace banquet?

137
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,400
Outrageous.

138
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,880
He doesn't care for your dignity.

139
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,320
Now that Huaijin is gone,

140
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,520
there is no one left

141
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,880
who will put me first anymore.

142
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,280
Neither my husband's side
nor my own family.

143
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,640
Who would care about
the dignity of an unloved wife?

144
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,820
(The Chancellor promised to take care
of you. Farewell, Meng Huaijin)

145
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,200
Among the maids
we placed in the Heir's Residence,

146
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,360
was there an obedient one?

147
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,840
There is one named Nanli.

148
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,320
She signed a death contract.

149
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,590
After the incident with the Heir,

150
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,440
she went into palace service.

151
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,180
The Meng family has
trained her for years.

152
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,560
It is time for her to be of use.

153
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,600
Madam, do you mean to...

154
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,440
If there is no way to have both,

155
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,000
then I will be the one to choose.

156
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,560
It should be me who steps aside.

157
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,580
So no one will be caught in between.

158
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,880
No one speaks well of me anyway.

159
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:41,920
Yes.

160
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,860
It has come to this bitter end

161
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,720
for you and me.

162
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:07,700
(Shen Residence)

163
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:08,680
Zhan Lu.

164
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,560
During Her Highness's recovery,

165
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,980
she likely can't leave her chambers.

166
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,680
Prepare more silk pillows
made of Su satin,

167
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,680
and flowers and fruits.

168
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,000
Chancellor.

169
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,160
You've never shown
such concern for anyone.

170
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,400
It is not like you.

171
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:24,880
She isn't

172
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,640
just anyone.

173
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,400
Since that is the case,

174
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,880
why not show it yourself, Chancellor?

175
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,720
Are you saying
Her Highness is slow-witted

176
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,680
and even such thoughts

177
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,640
must be explained to her by me?

178
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:42,750
I wouldn't dare.

179
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,280
You and Her Highness are both brilliant.

180
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,680
You are truly a perfect match.

181
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,200
How could Her Highness
not understand your thoughts?

182
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,420
(Xie)

183
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,000
Zhan Lu.

184
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,920
What are you doing?

185
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,280
This was prepared for you to attend

186
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,120
the tea banquet.

187
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,400
Your Highness,

188
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,720
look at this embroidery.

189
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,640
It is even finer
than what Lan Boutique offers.

190
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,920
The Chancellor petitioned His Majesty

191
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,480
and requested palace embroiderers
to make it for you.

192
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,040
The standards
of these ornaments and garments

193
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,590
are beyond even what the official wife
in the household may wear.

194
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,640
I am only a concubine.

195
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,190
This doesn't seem appropriate.

196
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:57,960
The Chancellor says

197
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,480
that for this tea banquet,

198
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,200
you will be attending
as Princess Chengping.

199
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,120
So these garments and accessories

200
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,600
must come from the palace

201
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,040
to befit your status.

202
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,680
You...

203
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,140
What did you just call me?

204
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,280
The Chancellor says

205
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,480
that from now on,

206
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,800
everyone here
is to address you as Your Highness.

207
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,240
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

208
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,000
Anyone who disrespects you

209
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,440
disrespects the Chancellor,

210
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,280
and will be dealt with
under household law.

211
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:55,760
Chancellor.

212
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,320
Reporting in.

213
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,800
Madam hasn't left her quarters
since her return.

214
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,840
But her maid, Yuetao,

215
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,160
secretly went to the palace

216
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,240
to meet a young maid, Nanli.

217
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,320
She used to serve
in the Heir's Residence.

218
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,520
Keep watch on those

219
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,560
in the palace.

220
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,000
Yes.

221
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,820
(Shen Residence)

222
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,200
Place these

223
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,120
in that carriage.

224
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,720
Put those by the side

225
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:31,980
in the one at the back.

226
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,640
Be careful with everything.

227
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,280
Her Highness has arrived.

228
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,800
Greetings to Princess Chengping.

229
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,460
- Greetings to Princess Chengping.
- Greetings to Princess Chengping.

230
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,800
At ease, everyone.

231
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,240
Zhenzhen, please rise.

232
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:38,960
Your Highness, wait.

233
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,440
The journey is tiring.

234
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,160
I'm sure it will lift
the Chancellor's spirits

235
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,560
to have you by his side.

236
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,560
I'll switch places with you

237
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,160
and ride in the one at the back.

238
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:54,800
Your Highness.

239
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,720
Zaiye, the palace banquet is boring.

240
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,960
I'll hang out with Mu Wuxia.

241
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,040
Not bad.

242
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,480
At last, you look a bit like a princess.

243
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,280
Usually,

244
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,160
just having your favor

245
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,560
was already enough to stir resentment.

246
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,160
And now,

247
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,920
you are using my title as a princess.

248
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,360
Who knows
what you are planning this time?

249
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,160
You'll find out soon enough.

250
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,920
Always so secretive.

251
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,960
- Great!
- Yeah!

252
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,680
- Brilliant!
- Great!

253
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,720
One more!

254
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,640
- Amazing!
- Great!

255
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,800
- Impressive!
- Good!

256
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,000
Splendid!

257
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,320
One more!

258
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,360
- Great!
- Yeah!

259
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:44,800
Great!

260
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,520
One more!

261
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,760
Chancellor Shen has arrived.

262
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,280
This way, Chancellor.

263
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,780
- Greetings, Chancellor Shen.
- Greetings, Chancellor Shen.

264
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,000
Right Chancellor.

265
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,700
Right Chancellor.

266
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,480
Your seat is over there.

267
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,160
Father.

268
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,160
Your seat has quite the view.

269
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,760
I'd like to sit with you.

270
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,400
Official Qin.

271
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,720
This way, please.

272
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,790
Congratulations on your promotion
to Minister-in-Chief, Official Qin.

273
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,120
The Minister-in-Chief is
a pillar of the court.

274
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,560
You have the support of all,
Official Qin.

275
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,920
Congratulations, it is well deserved.

276
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,240
You flatter me.

277
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,040
This is retribution.

278
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,640
No fortune lasts forever.

279
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,640
The Heir was deposed,
Meng Huaijin took his own life.

280
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,400
The Meng family has suffered
a heavy blow this time.

281
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,920
Everyone here is sharp.

282
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,560
Naturally, you all know

283
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,320
that the title of First Family

284
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,280
now belongs to the Qin family.

285
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,600
The Right Chancellor seems

286
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,800
to have planned this all along.

287
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,440
Will the Meng family rise again?

288
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,520
A dynasty lasts a hundred years.

289
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:07,990
A noble clan endures for a thousand.

290
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,880
All these years,

291
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,240
the Meng family's power in court
has grown deep roots.

292
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,000
They will not fall so easily.

293
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,380
But if they wish to rise to power again,

294
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,400
I won't give them the chance.

295
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,320
His Majesty has arrived.

296
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,480
We welcome His Majesty.

297
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,680
Rise.

298
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,200
- Greetings to Your Majesty.
- Greetings to Your Majesty.

299
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,440
At ease, my loyal officials.

300
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,920
Today is a family banquet.

301
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,080
Let us be at ease.

302
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,040
Be seated.

303
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,540
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

304
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,320
His Majesty, acknowledging
the efforts of the officials,

305
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,920
has arranged this tea banquet.

306
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,480
Fine tea is now served.
May all of you enjoy it

307
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,960
and bask in His Majesty's grace.

308
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,800
Chancellor Shen, Your Highness,
enjoy the tea.

309
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:31,720
Wait.

310
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,080
There is no harm
in drinking this tea a bit later.

311
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,320
(He looks so calm and composed.)

312
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,400
(He must have known
about the tea beforehand.)

313
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,280
Your Majesty.

314
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,440
I've recently acquired a rare treasure.

315
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,000
It suits this banquet

316
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,680
perfectly.

317
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,400
I'd like to present it.

318
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:06,640
If it has caught Chancellor Shen's eye,

319
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,920
then it must be extraordinary.

320
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,680
Let us have a look.

321
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:10,440
Yes.

322
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,880
Is that not just a glazed cups?

323
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,400
The palace often uses
glazed cups for tea.

324
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,320
Nothing special.

325
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:20,740
Your Highness.

326
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,880
This glazed cup is unlike the others.

327
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,800
Its greatest difference

328
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,760
is that when it touches poison,

329
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,560
the clear wall of the cup
will turn cloudy.

330
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,640
You and His Majesty
are of peerless prestige.

331
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,480
If you use this cup to drink tea,

332
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,360
it will surely be much safer.

333
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,480
Present it.

334
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,720
Come, my consort.

335
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:45,840
Your Majesty.

336
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:46,960
I've prepared

337
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,760
more of this glazed cup.

338
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,360
If Your Majesty doesn't mind,

339
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,080
why not use these
for today's tea banquet?

340
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:55,880
Your Majesty.

341
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,200
These cups are indeed finely crafted.

342
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,880
They might even bring out
better color in the tea.

343
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,720
Since my consort says so,

344
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,800
then so be it.

345
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,480
My dear officials.

346
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,520
For today's tea,

347
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,160
we shall all use these cups.

348
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,240
(So the Chancellor)

349
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,560
(has turned the trap back onto them.)

350
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,480
(I shall act accordingly.)

351
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,400
You...

352
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,080
Foolish.

353
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:29,920
Pour it.

354
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,000
Pour it.

355
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,520
(It really is the Meng family.)

356
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,320
(What is Meng Zhenzhen's role)

357
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,040
(in this plot?)

358
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:52,920
You may go.

359
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,400
Right Chancellor, what is this?

360
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,480
Today, we are not in the court.

361
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,040
There is no need to be
bound by our official titles.

362
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,360
Or is it that

363
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,640
because of what happened

364
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,000
with the Heir,

365
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,440
you now wish to
draw a clear line between us?

366
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,990
Not at all, Father-in-law.

367
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,720
I only feel

368
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,500
guilt toward your family

369
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,640
because of what happened to Huaijin.

370
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,640
I didn't dare approach and disturb you.

371
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,360
It seems

372
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,280
I have misunderstood.

373
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,120
As for the matter of the Heir,

374
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,520
the verdict is final.

375
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,240
I hope you will let it end there.

376
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:39,320
Come.

377
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,560
I offer tea in place of wine.

378
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,400
All that happened

379
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,680
and all past grievances

380
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,320
shall be written off.

381
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,040
Pour the tea.

382
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,720
This tea has gone cold.

383
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,240
Brew a fresh pot.

384
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:08,760
Yes.

385
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,520
Wait.

386
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,080
But I feel

387
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,800
this tea is just the right temperature.

388
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,640
Why go to the trouble?

389
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:24,920
Pour the tea.

390
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,160
Allow me.

391
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,320
Right Chancellor Meng.

392
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,800
What is the matter?

393
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,320
An old ailment has flared up.

394
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,200
I lost my composure.

395
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,560
Please forgive me.

396
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,560
Jiang Taohua, what is wrong?

397
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,400
Jiang Taohua?

398
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,760
Princess Chengping?

399
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,160
Princess Chengping?

400
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,280
Minister Shen.

401
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,760
What is wrong with Princess Chengping?

402
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:32,670
Your Majesty.

403
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,200
Princess Chengping fainted.

404
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,520
Someone must have poisoned
the tea at this banquet

405
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,680
to harm me.

406
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,160
Please investigate.

407
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,360
Summon the physician.

408
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:00,600
Your Majesty.

409
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,760
Examine the cups of tea
before Princess Chengping.

410
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:03,520
Yes.

411
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,600
Escort the Consort back to her chambers.

412
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,560
Your Majesty.

413
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,400
It's fine.

414
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,200
Your Majesty.

415
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,080
I have thoroughly examined the matter.

416
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,680
There was poison in the tea cup
on Chancellor Shen's table.

417
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,760
Fortunately, Princess Chengping
only drank a small amount.

418
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,920
She is not in serious danger.

419
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,990
- Your Majesty, please calm your anger.
- Your Majesty, please calm your anger.

420
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,640
Wretched maid.

421
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:50,960
Speak.

422
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,720
Who ordered you

423
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,400
to poison the drinks at my banquet?

424
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,360
Spare me, Your Majesty.

425
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,680
It was Ms. Meng.

426
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,360
She told me to do it.

427
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,880
She gave me the poison.

428
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:01,880
Miss!

429
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,400
Miss, say something!

430
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,080
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

431
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,880
I acted alone in this matter.

432
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,490
The others are innocent.

433
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,160
Lady Meng.

434
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,440
You are Chancellor Shen's rightful wife,

435
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:33,040
the legitimate daughter of the family.

436
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,280
How did it come to this?

437
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,720
Shen Zaiye harmed my brother.

438
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,680
He dotes on a concubine.

439
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,880
Does he even care

440
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,260
about my place as his lawful wife?

441
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,160
Your Majesty tells me to consider
our bond as husband and wife.

442
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,840
But has he ever
shown me the same regard?

443
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,680
Insolence!

444
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,480
As a noble lady,

445
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,680
how could you be so vicious?

446
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,120
You should be caned to death
as a warning to others.

447
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,400
Your Majesty, wait.

448
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,200
This is outrageous!

449
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,440
Calm down, Your Majesty.

450
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,160
My daughter has committed
an unforgivable crime.

451
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,440
It is my failure as a father.

452
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,280
Whatever punishment you deem fit,

453
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,600
I shall have

454
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,160
no objections.

455
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,360
However,

456
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,360
I have only just laid my son to rest.

457
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,320
Now I have only this daughter left.

458
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,280
I am

459
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,680
willing to step down from office.

460
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:40,680
I will offer

461
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,920
the seat of Right Chancellor

462
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,480
in exchange for my daughter's life.

463
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,780
Chancellor Shen,

464
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,120
in your opinion,

465
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,000
how should this matter be handled?

466
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,680
I beg Your Majesty for mercy.

467
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,680
Ms. Meng has always
been virtuous and kind.

468
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,520
She is generous.

469
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,280
Her actions today

470
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,440
are out of character.

471
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,320
(It seems)

472
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,600
(she has taken a desperate gamble today)

473
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,960
(and made herself a discarded piece)

474
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,320
(just to find closure.)

475
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,000
There must be more to this.

476
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,760
We need your judgment.

477
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,760
I too ask for Your Majesty's mercy.

478
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,160
It was my fault for being favored

479
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,120
and becoming arrogant.

480
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,360
I've shown misdemeanor in the family.

481
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,480
That must have caused her
to lose her reason,

482
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,800
and commit this crime.

483
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,120
Sister only acted out of impulse.

484
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,320
She deserves mercy.

485
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:39,990
I beg Your Majesty

486
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,560
to show mercy.

487
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:43,880
What happened today

488
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,560
all stemmed from me.

489
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,000
If I hadn't neglected her,

490
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,040
Lady Meng would never have
committed such a grave mistake.

491
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:53,520
Today,

492
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,080
I wish to ask Your Majesty

493
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,520
to grant me

494
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,120
and Lady Meng a divorce.

495
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,680
We'll go our separate ways,

496
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,880
seeking our own peace.

497
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:06,780
Chancellor Shen,

498
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,080
have you made up your mind?

499
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,800
I have.

500
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,750
When I return to the manor,

501
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,400
I shall also send away

502
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,560
Lady Qin

503
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,560
and Lady Duan.

504
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,560
Today, Princess Chengping

505
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,960
was nearly poisoned.

506
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,200
It was

507
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,320
caused by the disorder in my household.

508
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,400
Over this recent period of time,

509
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,320
my bond with Princess Chengping

510
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,360
has grown ever deeper.

511
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,120
We are each other's

512
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,000
love of a lifetime.

513
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,560
If unresolved,

514
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,040
someone might attempt to murder
the princess again.

515
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,600
Chancellor Shen,

516
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,760
wives and concubines

517
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,800
need not resort to ruin or conflict.

518
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,940
Lady Meng made a mistake,

519
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,440
but that does not mean my daughter
would do the same.

520
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,680
Chancellor Shen,

521
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,840
you are worrying over nothing.

522
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:48,640
Exactly.

523
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,280
Yunxin has always been

524
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,320
gentle and considerate.

525
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,320
She would never commit
such a vicious act.

526
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,120
My lords,

527
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,520
Lady Qin and Lady Duan

528
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,240
are both my concubines.

529
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,720
By propriety,

530
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,520
I have the right to divorce them.

531
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,900
But since trouble has arisen today,

532
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,680
I may as well explain it

533
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,400
to all of you.

534
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,920
Lady Qin and Lady Duan

535
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,000
are both virtuous.

536
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,200
They have done nothing to wrong me.

537
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,120
Rather, it is I who have wronged them.

538
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,990
Daughters of noble families
can always find suitors.

539
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,800
If they remarry in the future,

540
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,120
I shall regard them both

541
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,240
as dearly as younger sisters.

542
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:25,940
Your Majesty,

543
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,920
if Princess Chengping

544
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,240
were ever harmed again

545
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,080
because of family matter,

546
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,740
it'd be hard to explain

547
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,600
to those from Beiyuan.

548
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,400
Very well, then.

549
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,360
We'll proceed as you proposed.

550
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,880
I shall show mercy.

551
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,620
- Thank you for your mercy.
- Thank you for your mercy.

552
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:52,940
Right Chancellor Meng.

553
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,600
Take your daughter home,

554
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:55,720
and discipline her well.

555
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,880
Thank you, Your Majesty.

556
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,560
As for this maid,

557
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,720
death by caning.

558
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,120
Have mercy, Your Majesty.

559
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,120
I'm sorry!

560
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,560
Spare me, Your Majesty. I'm sorry!

561
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,120
Father.

562
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,360
Enough.

563
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,720
Everything you did today

564
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,680
was understandable.

565
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,720
I should not have forced you.

566
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,240
Father,

567
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,240
I have burdened you.

568
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,120
It is only a job.

569
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,520
Your safety matters more.

570
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,480
You and Huaijin

571
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,280
are both my children.

572
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,200
Huaijin gave his life

573
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,920
to protect the family.

574
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,360
With his last breath,

575
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,400
he still thought of you.

576
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,720
You acted for yourself.

577
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,160
Call it selfish,

578
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,440
yet it is not wrong.

579
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,000
Even so,

580
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,520
what is done is done.

581
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,120
Come home.

582
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,160
From now on you and I

583
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,320
will only have each other.

584
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,000
Master.

585
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,840
Judging by what happened,

586
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,000
His Majesty didn't mean to punish her.

587
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,800
Why give up your post?

588
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,800
Did you not see
how today's seating was laid out?

589
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,920
If His Majesty hadn't agreed to it,

590
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,680
who would dare put the Meng family last?

591
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,280
The Meng family

592
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,720
has never suffered such humiliation.

593
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,800
With His Majesty's view of us now,

594
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,080
the Chancellor's title

595
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,480
is just an empty shell.

596
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,080
It's better to step back for the moment

597
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,720
to leave a good impression
on His Majesty,

598
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,160
and keep

599
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,880
some leverage for our comeback.

600
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,240
Besides...

601
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,560
I'm getting old,

602
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,280
and Huaijin is gone.

603
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,960
You both have my thanks.

604
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,400
No need to thank me.

605
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,280
I know none of this was your choice.

606
00:38:59,040 --> 00:38:59,880
You're no fool.

607
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,160
Without your family pushing you,

608
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,880
you'd never pull

609
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,360
a stunt that harms everyone.

610
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:06,840
Still,

611
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,480
you chose your path.

612
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,760
From now on,

613
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,240
we walk separate paths.

614
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,200
No need for more questioning.

615
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:14,640
It's better

616
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,480
this way

617
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:16,600
for us both.

618
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:20,680
Take care.

619
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:29,960
Ms. Meng,

620
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,960
may I have a word?

621
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,840
You still call me Ms. Meng.

622
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,680
After all that happened today,

623
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,240
are you finally freed
from your shackles?

624
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,000
It will.

625
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,680
Thank you, Your Highness.

626
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,240
I hope that once the burden is gone,

627
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,240
you can truly feel at ease.

628
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,200
Did you know

629
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,720
from the first day you came,

630
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,040
I've done many things to harm you?

631
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:06,200
I made trouble for you
on the wedding day,

632
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,000
lured you to the study,

633
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,960
planted discord
between you and the Chancellor,

634
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,560
and I even tried to poison you.

635
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,080
Knowing all of this,

636
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,080
why are you still willing to help me?

637
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,800
You acted only for your family.

638
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,440
As the first daughter
of the Meng family,

639
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,440
every word and deed of mine

640
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,240
can never follow my own wish.

641
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,440
Though in name
I am your lady of the house,

642
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,320
I actually envy you a lot.

643
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,720
Envy me?

644
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,760
We haven't known each other long,

645
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,480
yet in my heart,

646
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,400
I always felt you and I are alike.

647
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,320
I was born a Meng,

648
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,120
so from the start, my life was bound

649
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,000
by family and status.

650
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,560
You journeyed to another land,

651
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,160
free from the restraints of your family.

652
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,840
You follow your own heart,

653
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,720
and do what you wish.

654
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,040
Such a free life

655
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,360
is exactly what I long for.

656
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,760
So you let the whole plot unfold

657
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,640
on purpose?

658
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,720
That maid confessed without hesitation,

659
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,120
which must have been in your script.

660
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,200
You truly have a sharp mind.

661
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,640
Most of my life

662
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,560
has been out of my hands.

663
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,080
Yet today,

664
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
between myself and my family,

665
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,960
I made a selfish choice.

666
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,600
In the end,

667
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:50,880
you,

668
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:51,760
I,

669
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:52,880
and the Chancellor

670
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,400
all think with clear heads.

671
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,720
We weigh our choices, not our feelings.

672
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,640
We always keep our composure.

673
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,160
Fortune didn't favor me.

674
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,160
So between my husband and family,

675
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,960
I could keep only one.

676
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,480
May luck treat you

677
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,240
better than it did me.

678
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,360
Take care.

679
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,280
You do not know

680
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,320
I am only another soul in Qi,

681
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,280
as powerless as you.

682
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,680
Where is the Chancellor?

683
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,600
The Chancellor left.

684
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:03,280
He ordered us
to see Your Highness home.

685
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,040
The weather is pleasant today.

686
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,880
I would like a walk.

687
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,320
You may return.

688
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:20,500
(Shen Residence)

689
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,560
Duan Yunxin?

690
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,680
Why so downhearted?

691
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,360
Do you miss Ms. Meng?

692
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,320
Or is it the Chancellor
you can't let go?

693
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,120
I don't think

694
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,640
we're that close.

695
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,320
We kept our distance
because each of us had a role to play,

696
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,040
minding our own interests,

697
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:57,940
which made us rivals.

698
00:43:58,680 --> 00:43:59,920
From today on, though,

699
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,480
we are sisters for real.

700
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,990
Come to the Qin Residence
whenever you have time.

701
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,920
Are you not sad in the least?

702
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,440
A noblewoman

703
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,760
has no say in her marriage.

704
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:13,560
Therefore,

705
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,200
she must protect herself first.

706
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,160
In this world,

707
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,800
the one who should love you most

708
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:22,880
is you.

709
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:26,720
Lady Qin,

710
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,080
the carriage is ready.

711
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,440
Don't call me Lady Qin.

712
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,360
Call me Ms. Jieyu.

713
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:33,680
Yes,

714
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:34,640
Ms. Jieyu.

715
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:35,160
