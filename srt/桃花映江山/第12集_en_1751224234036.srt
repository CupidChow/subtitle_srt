1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,280
The wind and rain scatter and the clouds are still.

2
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,120
How can I live my life

3
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,360
as the scene of destiny?

4
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,280
If I can stay with you in my life,

5
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,960
if you know my true feelings,

6
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,560
I will go through all the hardships

7
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,800
without regret.

8
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,160
Even if I am locked in this life,

9
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,040
I will go through all the hardships.

10
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:15,900
The unproven

11
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:50,300
Come and get them, Hailu Path

12
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,180
Great

13
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,300
Need to make Shen Zaiyi and her concubine

14
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,940
sit with on adjcia

15
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,900
Often force me to follow my own dream

16
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,440
Think diferente

17
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,020
öfr Tell me

18
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,740
Simoten

19
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,660
Xia

20
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,900
Time flies

21
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,940
Fourth prince it seems that his feeling for you is unfavorable

22
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,840
It's just he is blinded by the officials and limited inner feelings

23
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,940
They all forth with the rumor

24
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,820
I just want to say hello to you.

25
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,540
By the way,

26
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,700
my father ordered

27
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,580
a water-drying business.

28
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,100
If it's possible,

29
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,260
how about I drink with you

30
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,340
on the river?

31
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,060
Thank you for your kindness.

32
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,660
Thank you for your kindness.

33
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,780
But Jiang's family hasn't taken a bath and changed their clothes.

34
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,540
I'll take her back to the camp to rest.

35
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,340
Thecr ан Sisters of Qin

36
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,720
iseser,

37
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,380
you'rePhone Yes,

38
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,100
which is you shouldn't be so boring.

39
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,020
Walk.

40
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,060
Name you complement to me.

41
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,140
You don't want to be in the way?

42
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,820
The pot is fine, too.

43
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,020
Yicun, it's your turn.

44
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,700
Okay, you win.

45
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,180
You're so boring.

46
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,820
This is the first one.

47
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,660
I don't need you to give way.

48
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,060
Why do you have to compete with me?

49
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,100
You...

50
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,740
Just let me read the book quietly,

51
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,300
okay?

52
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,940
I haven't seen you move the book for a long time.

53
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,060
It's the same as

54
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,500
I deal with my brother.

55
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,140
You can read all you want to know.

56
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,620
Yes,

57
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,060
but what's the use of studying?

58
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,860
The book says

59
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,140
only if it works happens,

60
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,900
then I can help the world city.

61
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,180
But because

62
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,380
I mis Mi Ah & her family members,

63
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,860
my grandmother was hurt.

64
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,900
The consequences was such.

65
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,460
I think

66
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:47,340
Do you think he would do anything bad to her directly?

67
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,820
Then what if there's another trip?

68
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,060
What's your plan?

69
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,820
Will you marry my brother?

70
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,580
I admit that

71
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,220
he indeed knew about God's eyes,

72
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,780
but I kept hitting on him

73
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,340
for not let me acknowledge his genius technique.

74
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,340
I can't be like him-

75
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,020
Stop!

76
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,300
Stop racking on matters.

77
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,300
I'm sorry.

78
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,100
It's a pity.

79
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,020
You're just like this.

80
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,580
You never stole a sword.

81
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,260
But I didn't get this one.

82
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,940
Then you can steal the next one.

83
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,100
The whole number of the Red Lake Water Skill.

84
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,180
You don't need to steal it.

85
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,900
As long as my method is right,

86
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,620
there will be another chance.

87
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:37,900
How do you know

88
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,580
your method is right?

89
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,180
You stand here,

90
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,580
I stand here.

91
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,620
As long as my target is the Sword Lake,

92
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,900
I can always steal it.

93
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,180
Yuan Zheng.

94
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:54,700
Ji Wu San.

95
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,060
Ying is right.

96
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,780
Rather than being selfish here,

97
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,900
it's better to clear the target.

98
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,140
Maybe one day

99
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,540
it can reach my heart.

100
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,620
出 activity

101
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,140
Let's go.

102
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,780
How to deploy Premier?

103
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,820
I saw it when I came here.

104
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,500
There are no flaws on the surface.

105
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,900
The crown prince must have been well prepared.

106
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,140
Such a big hunting ground.

107
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,380
Where can we find the leads of the bad money?

108
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,980
Time is so short.

109
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,100
They can't be in the mountains.

110
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:58,980
As long as there are flaws,

111
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,580
we can catch them this time.

112
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,060
I've asked the war road to investigate in secret.

113
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,380
We'll find a chance to leave after the banquet.

114
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,980
Prime Minister, the fourth prince is here.

115
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,260
You go first.

116
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,820
What are you here for?

117
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:21,860
I was stupid to come here.

118
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:26,340
I apologize to you and all the villagers.

119
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,500
It's over.

120
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,020
Don't think too much.

121
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,220
But after what happened,

122
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,380
have you changed your mind?

123
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:39,540
No.

124
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,660
As soon as the hunting is over,

125
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,300
I'll go back to the imperial capital as soon as possible.

126
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,820
I'll report to Jingzhao Yin with all the evidence.

127
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:51,700
Jingzhao Yin is one of the three prefectures since the Qin Dynasty.

128
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,820
It's not a sect.

129
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,420
It can be sent directly to the heaven.

130
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:56,780
At the same time,

131
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,180
I'll send people to protect the villagers and evidence

132
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,660
at all costs.

133
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,460
You still want to report to the government?

134
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,060
Yes.

135
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,580
Cousin, what is the law?

136
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,260
It's the law that is beneficial to the people

137
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,700
and long-term to the country.

138
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,180
If you want to follow this kind of law,

139
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,140
you have to establish this order first.

140
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,660
The law won't go wrong.

141
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:30,700
The law of the law is the same as the law of the law.

142
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,820
I think the law is right.

143
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,220
I don't think it's wrong to report to the government.

144
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:39,940
It's not wrong.

145
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,860
What's wrong is the corruption of those who follow the law.

146
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,580
The way to correct it

147
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,660
shouldn't be to refuse to believe in the law.

148
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,700
It should be to create an environment

149
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,340
where everyone obeys the law.

150
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:55,060
It's not difficult to set the law,

151
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:56,900
but it's difficult to follow the law.

152
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,180
If I, a prince,

153
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,900
can't believe in the law,

154
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,780
who will go against the law?

155
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,780
If the emperor accepts your proposal,

156
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,340
then I, a prince,

157
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,540
cannot fault the state.

158
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:12,740
Go with the flow.

159
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,260
But isn't it important...

160
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,780
to help PM Chen start his journey?

161
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,780
What's wrong?

162
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:36,780
You seem to be happier than before.

163
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:43,780
I'm happy and happy in my heart.

164
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:53,780
There are hundreds of things in this world that are impossible to describe.

165
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,780
Each has its own power.

166
00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:01,780
If I can present this world in the way I want it to be,

167
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:04,780
I'll be able to show you a better world.

168
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,780
Wang Xie!

169
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,780
Momo!

170
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,780
The End

171
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,780
What kind of crap are these two things?

172
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,780
Are they deliberately making fun of me?

173
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,780
I'll kill them with one blow.

174
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:01,780
This Lu Ban Suo is hard to get rid of.

175
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,780
You find it troublesome, but you don't know that

176
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:08,780
the world is more difficult than this Lu Ban Suo.

177
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:11,780
This time, I'm also working with Shen Zai

178
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:15,780
to expose the act of the Crown Prince to create evil money

179
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,780
and avenge Xiao Lian's grandmother.

180
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,780
We also need to figure out the connections between this and Lv Hou.

181
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:25,780
Only then can we have a place to negotiate terms with Lv Hou.

182
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:29,780
But today, you and the Prime Minister are under the eyes of the Crown Prince.

183
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,780
It's definitely very dangerous.

184
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:49,400
Why don't we let that

185
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,780
Momo!

186
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,780
Momo!

187
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,780
Do you want some grapes?

188
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,780
I just washed them.

189
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,780
Let's go.

190
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,780
It's time for the session.

191
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:04,780
Everyone, today the water is flowing against us.

192
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,780
We might as well use flowers to reflect our energy.

193
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,780
Let's go for it!

194
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:09,780
Let's go for it!

195
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,780
Let's go!

196
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,780
Momo, be careful.

197
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,780
I'll go find some more flowers.

198
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,780
Okay.

199
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,780
Momo, come.

200
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:15,780
Momo, come.

201
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,780
Momo, come.

202
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,780
Momo, come.

203
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:18,780
Momo, come.

204
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,780
Momo, come.

205
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,780
Momo, come.

206
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,780
Momo, come.

207
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,780
Momo, come.

208
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,780
Momo, come.

209
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,780
Momo, come.

210
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,300
What do you think of

211
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,420
the Magic Angles Grasp 병 cesspool for the Chinese moon?

212
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,620
That one has feelings for God,

213
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,660
and wife後過世

214
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:54,720
so as not to frustrate a foreign neточ

215
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,820
How is Prime Minister Shen?

216
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Thank you, then

217
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,420
I admire you

218
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,520
for showing kindness and consider good manners

219
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,780
very good

220
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,940
Thank You, your majesty

221
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,560
Let's do something great

222
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,420
I hope all of you

223
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,940
can do great things in the hunting media

224
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,960
come

225
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,340
and tell us if you don't mind.

226
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,780
Book it and record it.

227
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,060
It will be boring.

228
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,420
If you want to sing,

229
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,980
invite Qin Chi to sing for you.

230
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:46,700
Uncle Fujian,

231
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,300
your uncle is here to sing.

232
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,540
He and Li Ying look alike.

233
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,140
He also prefer to stay with me.

234
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,020
I have a rose for you.

235
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,740
Give it to me.

236
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:55,400
Let's go.

237
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:06,620
Prime Minister Shen,

238
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,620
a toast to you.

239
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:21,980
Come on.

240
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,780
I won't show mercy.

241
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,460
Here.

242
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,340
It's almost time.

243
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,820
Let's begin.

244
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,780
Prime Minister,

245
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,340
I want you to feed me.

246
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,660
Please forgive me, Prime Minister.

247
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,500
I'll go get changed.

248
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,620
Thank you.

249
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,240
Go?

250
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,780
either way.

251
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,940
My lord,

252
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,300
there's a buyer's mistake.

253
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:46,620
I'll ask for a punishment.

254
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,420
Be sure to buy one of these words with me.

255
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,900
Yes, my lord.

256
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,980
What happened?

257
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,140
Wuan

258
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,580
Where are we?

259
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,740
Is Zhan στα sperret the location of the general?

260
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,940
You went with X gibi.

261
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,620
Yes.

262
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:35,820
Here.

263
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,360
This should be the place

264
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,480
which Zhao Bu said

265
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:18,820
is right here.

266
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,020
As expected.

267
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,480
So it's the Silver Mine.

268
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,500
I thought people'd cash in

269
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,540
and shake hands beforeilloys.

270
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,760
Nothing will change.

271
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,020
Fortunately,

272
00:18:51,020 --> 00:19:00,940
ode

273
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,140
Are you serious?

274
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,180
children

275
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:09,020
Give the child

276
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:13,020
to architecture

277
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,080
Teacher

278
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,860
You are indeed smart.

279
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,460
You deliberately left a flaw.

280
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,020
I believe you now.

281
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,620
Next...

282
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,740
Next...

283
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,860
Next, Prime Minister Shen and his concubine

284
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,380
will be drunk and drown here.

285
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,900
Unexpectedly, the hot springs of Ganhe

286
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,060
suddenly flood.

287
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,260
They accidentally fall into the water.

288
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,780
They both die in the water.

289
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,540
Why is there water?

290
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,540
Let's go.

291
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,420
Oh no, we are trapped.

292
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,500
We have to get out of here quickly.

293
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,300
Let's go.

294
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,300
Let's go.

295
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,060
My legs are stuck.

296
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:17,820
Yeah.

297
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,220
Oh no.

298
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:50,100
Xintong

299
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,540
Take this.

300
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,620
You didn't go?

301
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,140
Come on.

302
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:29,960
Yes.

303
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,600
Lin Fo,

304
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:57,420
expect our

305
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,020
will spread throughout the whole Yu City.

306
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,700
We'll spread the news

307
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,540
that there's a false

308
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,620
impression of Prime Minister Shen.

309
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,660
Then no one will dare to approach Lie Chang.

310
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,340
By then,

311
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,940
the Crown Prince's silver mine

312
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,820
will be in ruins.

313
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,140
Good idea.

314
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,340
You and I shouldn't leave Yan Hui for too long

315
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,020
to avoid causing trouble.

316
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,100
Let's go.

317
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,580
The stone is heavy and heavy.

318
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:29,900
We can only use our strength

319
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:30,980
to crush it.

320
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,700
We can only wait for Zhiyuan.

321
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,540
Jiang Dihua, hang in there.

322
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,180
Don't give up.

323
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,020
I won't give up.

324
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,620
Otherwise, how can I

325
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,420
avenge Grandma Xiao Lian?

326
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,900
No one will be weak forever.

327
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,900
I won't give up.

328
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,540
I won't give up.

329
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,220
I won't give up.

330
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,660
They will also use

331
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,860
the pen and ink swords in their hands

332
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,660
to protect others.

333
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,460
He's dying.

334
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,500
But he still thinks of others.

335
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,820
With the Crown Prince's mind,

336
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,260
he can't imagine

337
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,380
such a sinister plan.

338
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,980
It must be my brother's soldiers.

339
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,940
If today,

340
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,060
the peach blossoms and the elephant are

341
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,820
all dead,

342
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,900
we can't be together in this life,

343
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,860
but we can be together in death.

344
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,260
It's like

345
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,060
a couple's fate.

346
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,100
It's a good thing

347
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,580
that you said so.

348
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,060
Liang,

349
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,340
go fight.

350
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,540
This is a hellfire.

351
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:02,660
Yes, Your Majesty.

352
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:04,620
You can't go far anymore.

353
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,500
Go fight them.

354
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,620
think

355
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,780
by the sidelines as if they are hiding inside you.

356
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,260
The disease is a disease of the heart.

357
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,060
Goodbye, the old man who is tired.

358
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,620
The sixth generation of Zirang Drugstore, Xiao Ziping,

359
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,220
invites you to continue.

360
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,980
He was here just now.

361
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,260
Why is he gone?

362
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,180
Go find him for me.

363
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,620
Yes, Your Majesty.

364
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,140
Father.

365
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:35,820
Father.

366
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,740
Did you lose anything important?

367
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,060
How do you know?

368
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,340
Your Majesty, you are looking for

369
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,140
this chess piece.

370
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,260
It was clearly eaten by a low-ranking official.

371
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,180
It's this one.

372
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,540
Take it.

373
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,860
Why are you here?

374
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,060
How can you understand this?

375
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,420
I'm not here.

376
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,860
Where else can I be?

377
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,780
tricks and tricks.

378
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,260
Your Highness.

379
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,660
Don't be angry, Your Highness.

380
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:43,940
Shen Zaiye just came back to the banquet.

381
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,620
He didn't see anything unusual.

382
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,060
Alone?

383
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,460
The package of peach blossoms.

384
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,060
Could it be that they found something in the silver mine?

385
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,300
Jing.

386
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,260
Open the room!

387
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,900
Open the room!

388
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,300
Brother, open the door!

389
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,180
Institute.

390
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:19,780
Start it!

391
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,740
Open the door!

392
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,060
Open!

393
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,060
Get out!

394
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:37,060
I lost something very important.

395
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:40,060
It's very similar to what you have.

396
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:43,060
This is definitely not something that the Crown Prince has.

397
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:46,060
Please don't make any more trouble, Your Highness.

398
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,060
Since you are so honest,

399
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:51,060
then I will just check if there is nothing.

400
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:55,060
You can check it for me,

401
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,060
but please leave first

402
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,060
to avoid disturbing others.

403
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:02,060
It's not your turn to call me a servant.

404
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,060
I want to see

405
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:09,060
what tricks you are playing.

406
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:20,060
How dare you!

407
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,060
Your Highness, don't be angry.

408
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,060
It's the fault of the peach blossoms.

409
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,060
It's just that the Crown Prince

410
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,060
is so much in the way.

411
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:32,060
He really can't stop it.

412
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,060
How dare you trick me!

413
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,060
Are you okay?

414
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,060
I'm fine.

415
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,060
I'm fine.

416
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:49,060
Are you okay?

417
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,060
What is the Crown Prince doing?

418
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,060
Prime Minister,

419
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,060
the Princess is changing her clothes.

420
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,060
The peach blossoms are sending clothes to the Princess.

421
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,060
Who would have thought

422
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,060
that the Crown Prince has been following her all the way

423
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:07,060
and he has to break into the Princess' changing room.

424
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,060
And he has to see the Princess' clothes.

425
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,060
Shut up!

426
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,060
Are you okay?

427
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,060
How dare you break into the Princess' changing room?

428
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,060
I'm not dead yet.

429
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,060
Father,

430
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,060
I didn't mean to deceive Princess Lan.

431
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,060
Your Highness,

432
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,060
the Crown Prince is helping me

433
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,060
to find the lost jade pendant.

434
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,060
I didn't mean to go to the wrong account.

435
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,060
I didn't mean to hurt Princess Lan.

436
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,060
Yes,

437
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,060
my cousin's jade pendant is lost.

438
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,060
I saw the Lady Jiang

439
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,060
sneaking around.

440
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,060
This is Princess Lan's jade pendant.

441
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,060
Your Highness,

442
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,060
I accidentally spilled the wine on the clothes

443
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,060
and asked my concubine to help me return it.

444
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,060
The Crown Prince rushed in regardless.

445
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,060
Now he lost the jade pendant.

446
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:58,060
Could it be

447
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,060
that he suspects that I stole the jade pendant

448
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,060
from the Crown Prince?

449
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,060
How could it be, my dear?

450
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,060
You are always kind and considerate.

451
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,060
You are wrong.

452
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,060
You misunderstood Lady Jiang and disturbed Princess Lan.

453
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,060
You are so nervous

454
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,060
for the safety of the hunting ground.

455
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,060
It's the Crown Prince's duty.

456
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,060
I was too nervous.

457
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,060
I'm sorry

458
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:22,060
to Princess Lan.

459
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:26,060
Since the Crown Prince has already admitted his mistake,

460
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,060
he won't investigate it anymore.

461
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:30,060
My Lady.

462
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:44,060
Everyone is here.

463
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,060
Why is nobody here at the banquet?

464
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:48,060
Father,

465
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,060
what is the game plan for tomorrow?

466
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:52,060
You can't be lazy.

467
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:54,060
Ni Ze,

468
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,060
you are the first suspect

469
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,060
in the case of the jade pendant.

470
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:00,060
Get out of here

471
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,060
and get the stone whip.

472
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,060
Let's go.

473
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:06,060
I know my mistake.

474
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,060
You and Lady Jiang

475
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,060
are really

476
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,060
very close.

477
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,060
I envy you.

478
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,060
Thank you, Your Highness.

479
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:34,060
Lady Jiang was frightened.

480
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:36,060
She should go back to rest now.

481
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,060
You actually

482
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,060
can put Princess Lan,

483
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,060
who you admire the most,

484
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,060
in the game.

485
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:02,060
You are quite brave.

486
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,060
These ten times

487
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,060
are just

488
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:08,060
a temporary vent for Xiao Yan.

489
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:18,060
Not bad.

490
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,060
This is just the beginning.

491
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:22,060
The Crown Prince will definitely

492
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,060
pay for what he has done.

493
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,060
Let's go.

494
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:34,060
I heard a sound.

495
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,060
Don't move.

496
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,060
Let me go.

497
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:40,060
The whole Yujin knows

498
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,060
that you are my most favorite concubine.

499
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,060
Now the concubine is wronged.

500
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,060
The heart is like a grave.

501
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,060
The one who is in a hurry is not the right one.

502
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,060
That's the right one.

503
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:52,060
I'm sorry.

504
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,060
I'm sorry.

505
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:56,060
I'm sorry.

506
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:58,060
I'm sorry.

507
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,060
I'm sorry.

508
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:02,060
I'm sorry.

509
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,060
The one who is in a hurry is not the right one.

510
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:08,060
You have good eyes.

511
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,060
Is it the Princess of Shi who is holding the statue of the Prime Minister?

512
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:38,060
The Prime Minister is holding

513
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:40,060
a concubine to show his love.

514
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,060
How can you be so humble?

515
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,060
Isn't the Lady Meng also here?

516
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:50,060
I can't see

517
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:52,060
that the Prime Minister has such a beautiful face.

518
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,060
I'm sorry.

519
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,060
I'm sorry.

520
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:08,060
I'm sorry.

521
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,060
I'm sorry.

522
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,060
I'm sorry.

523
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,060
I'm sorry.

524
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:16,060
I'm sorry.

525
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,060
I'm sorry.

526
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,060
I'm sorry.

527
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,060
I'm sorry.

528
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,060
I'm sorry.

529
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,060
I'm sorry.

530
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,060
I'm sorry.

531
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:30,060
I'm sorry.

532
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,060
I'm sorry.

533
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:35,060
Could It

534
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:54,060
kry

535
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:56,060
I mistook the servants

536
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,060
instead of her just now.

537
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,180
I'm afraid I'll die under that mine.

538
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:15,300
Prime Minister.

539
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,140
It's me.

540
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,020
Why are you late?

541
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,300
They've been watering there.

542
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,860
I'm afraid I'll be in trouble if I come out early.

543
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,300
Don't be late.

544
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,940
Go back to the camp with Lady Jiang.

545
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,260
I have to go back to Yanxi.

546
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:30,500
Where's my clothes?

547
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,300
Here.

548
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,420
I'll go back to Yanxi with you.

549
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,380
No need.

550
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:37,900
You're so weak.

551
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:38,980
Just go back and get better.

552
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,260
I'll go back alone.

553
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,780
The two princes won't say anything.

554
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,140
It's okay.

555
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,100
If you go back alone,

556
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,060
I'm afraid I can't stop the prince.

557
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:49,140
Okay.

558
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,460
It's too dangerous, Princess.

559
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,340
If you meet this kind of thing again,

560
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,340
let the Prime Minister go and check it out.

561
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:58,300
Don't put yourself in danger again.

562
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,780
I've been tricked by the prince so many times.

563
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,820
This time, I finally got a chance.

564
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:06,940
And if I didn't go,

565
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,460
how would I know what Lv Hou is doing?

566
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:10,700
You've found out?

567
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,180
I only realized after I got to the mine

568
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,300
what Lv Hou wanted to do.

569
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,260
Such a big sum of money

570
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,500
is enough for him to attract many ministers in the North.

571
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,540
The death of Xu Yang

572
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,740
and even the army

573
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,660
and the money of the mine

574
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,260
are all related to the prince.

575
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,220
Once the prince's accident occurs,

576
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,260
he will be fired.

577
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,940
The other princes of the Great Qi

578
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,020
will start to fight for the position of the crown prince.

579
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,300
When the situation is in chaos,

580
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,420
Lv Hou can think of the power of the fish.

581
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,100
This is his real purpose.

582
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,380
Is he crazy?

583
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,060
The army of the Great Qi is strong.

584
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,860
They've been looking for a chance

585
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,060
to destroy the tired North Campus.

586
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,020
But there's no reason

587
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,540
to let the ministers

588
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,140
to send troops.

589
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,940
But if Lv Hou goes on a trip,

590
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,700
there will be no other group of the main group of Qi.

591
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,700
Lv Hou's ambition

592
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,620
will destroy the whole North Campus.

593
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,460
We must find a way to stop him.

594
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,340
But it's too dangerous, Your Highness.

595
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,380
How about we find a chance to hide?

596
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,580
We'll come out after they're done fighting.

597
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,940
We've been involved in it for a long time.

598
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,380
We can't go out.

599
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,140
But to put it back,

600
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,660
it's a crisis,

601
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,460
but it may be a turn-based.

602
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,580
As long as we work together,

603
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:30,820
and cooperate internally and externally,

604
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,900
it may become

605
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,060
the breakthrough I used to control Lv Hou.

606
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,660
Then this breakthrough

607
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,420
is the one who killed the Prime Minister?

608
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,340
Now,

609
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,180
Shen Zaiye is the last

610
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,500
life-saving knife in the world.

611
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,460
But the Prime Minister

612
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,380
is not a good person.

613
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,740
Don't be so passive.

614
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,980
If you want to win him over,

615
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,180
you must make a plan first.

616
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,580
What plan?

617
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,260
Make a move

618
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,300
so that he won't doubt my plan again.

619
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,340
You're not worthy of being a talent.

620
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:16,980
I was wrong.

621
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:20,940
Please calm down, Your Highness.

622
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,820
This is a great greatly.

623
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,780
Cursing at me is no big deal.

624
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,540
Although you've just been whipped,

625
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,020
you've just broken your finger.

626
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:39,580
Because a guard

627
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,720
who just started fighting

628
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:41,340
ETI,

629
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,780
he's not a properly another ranger?

630
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:43,900
If he's hurt by your medicine,

631
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:44,900
a few days later he will recover.

632
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,740
What the eag Premier Zhang just now didn't move

633
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,140
made me believe

634
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,260
that he had something important

635
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,900
You made me die.

636
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,620
And you were humiliated

637
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,580
in front of so many people.

638
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,180
I'm the crown prince.

639
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:02,420
You don't care about me at all.

640
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,100
Shen Zaiye is very cunning.

641
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,660
His concubine is also a smart woman.

642
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,580
You have to be careful.

643
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:11,660
Otherwise,

644
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:14,020
they will lead you to a big disaster.

645
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,780
Didn't you say that everything is fine?

646
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,380
How did they escape?

647
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:19,860
There is a hole

648
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,220
on the top of the mine.

649
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,420
I'm afraid that Shen Zaiye

650
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,740
has left a good hand early.

651
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,100
Why are they so famous?

652
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:30,300
They can't kill them even if they kill them several times.

653
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:32,700
The more this time,

654
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,220
the more we have to be calm.

655
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,300
The most urgent thing now

656
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,220
is to end the Spring Hunting quickly.

657
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,780
We can't let it go.

658
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,540
Then I was

659
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,140
in vain.

660
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,700
Don't worry.

661
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,260
Now they are in our territory.

662
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,260
I'm afraid that they

663
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,660
have no time to prepare.

664
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,740
Tomorrow is the Spring Hunting.

665
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,900
Father won't find out about the silver mine, right?

666
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:58,820
Don't worry.

667
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,220
It's all arranged.

668
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,380
As long as you do as I say,

669
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,220
it will be a good opportunity.

670
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,300
Now the evidence is available.

671
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,700
But the witness still needs to spend some time.

672
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:19,620
If we can find the workers

673
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:20,700
in the mine,

674
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,020
we can send them to the Lord safely.

675
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,340
Then we can prove it.

676
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,340
According to what Xiaolian said,

677
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,660
those workers will be selected

678
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,220
every once in a while.

679
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,060
Such a large group of people

680
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,660
is not something that can be tolerated in a normal place.

681
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,100
They are so fast.

682
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,300
There are so many people.

683
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,500
They can't go far.

684
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:48,060
They should be around the mine.

685
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:52,940
You are so NASH,

686
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,820
you should behave yourself.

687
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,340
Don't make such a their fake.

688
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:00,180
You are not a common figure.

689
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:01,100
You can't

690
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,940
get someone or the nature in this place is the System Company.

691
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,020
What points can I place on my musters?

692
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:17,820
A

693
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:39,080
There represented the

694
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:44,660
I'll think of another way

695
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,060
to rescue the minesweeper

696
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,140
Tomorrow still need

697
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,860
I'll try to find a way to get some time.

698
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:51,580
No.

699
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,380
I'll let someone else do it.

700
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:54,940
But I'm the most suitable

701
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,940
and the least suspicious person.

702
00:40:58,620 --> 00:40:59,700
Don't worry, my lord.

703
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,380
I'll take the chance.

704
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,260
pepper

705
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,260
I'm her captain!

706
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,520
I'll let you take the 바忙!

707
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,540
It's not funny to interrupt

708
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,060
my captain's family practice.

709
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,180
Don't worry, my lord.

710
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:15,700
At the same time,

711
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,660
make sure that

712
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:19,580
I can have a meeting with Mr. Cheng.

713
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,420
I'll change myself and lead the way.

714
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:22,580
Sure, my lord.

715
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,500
Thank you, my lord.

716
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:24,260
Thank you, my lord.

717
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:25,820
My god, please forgive me.

718
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,660
Shut your mouth.

719
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:28,820
My god.

720
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:29,540
Please, stop.

721
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:30,700
Can anyone help me

722
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:31,380
I'm afraid.

723
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:03,780
Take care tomorrow.

724
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:03,980
my heart is broken.

725
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:06,140
Tears fall,

726
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:08,020
my heart is torn.

727
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:13,700
There's nowhere to go.

728
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:25,820
I wish to grow up in your eyes.

729
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:33,220
Regret is killing in despair.

730
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:40,620
I still wish to wipe the flowers under my arms.

731
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:44,820
Even if I have to give up my life,

732
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:52,820
I will sing with you.

733
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:57,820
Who can destroy the heart?

734
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:00,820
Love and hate can only be eaten.

735
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:02,820
The flower withers,

736
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,820
the heart is broken.

737
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:11,820
There's no need to tell me.

738
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:18,820
How can I love you?

739
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:26,820
How can I love her like crazy?

740
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:33,820
I'm not afraid of being surprised by the world.

741
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:35,820
I'm quiet.

742
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:40,820
What she said is related to the flower.

743
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:48,820
It turns out that she has the answer of love.
