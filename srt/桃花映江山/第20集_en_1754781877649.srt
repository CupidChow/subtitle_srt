18
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:48,620
(Shunjing Residence)

19
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,400
Your Highness!

20
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,900
Your Highness, you're finally awake!

21
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,300
Here.

22
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,720
I've been worried these past few days.

23
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,880
I was afraid you wouldn't wake up.

24
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,640
Your Highness, that was Yugui Mountain.

25
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,480
Falling from there and surviving

26
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,440
is nothing short of a miracle.

27
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,720
Yugui Mountain...

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,120
Was that the mountain
we passed on the way to form

29
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,280
the marriage alliance?

30
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,000
Marriage alliance?

31
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,080
That is...

32
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,560
Miss Qingtai.

33
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,080
Physician Lin is here.

34
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,280
Physician Lin!

35
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,560
Physician Lin!

36
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,320
Tend to Her Highness at once!

37
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,480
Miss,

38
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,000
you are finally awake.

39
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,200
Your pulse has steadied too.

40
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,480
What a relief.

41
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,520
I've troubled you.

42
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,480
Physician Lin.

43
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,640
Her body is delicate.

44
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,120
Do examine her carefully.

45
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:58,640
Of course.

46
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,400
You...

47
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,480
He is Prince Wuyin.

48
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,040
Thank you for your concern.

49
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,640
Do you feel

50
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,000
any discomfort?

51
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,920
It is supposed to be
the chill of early spring,

52
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,320
but I feel a bit stifling heat.

53
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,520
Your Highness.

54
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,040
Early spring chill?

55
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,640
It is already the autumn heat.

56
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,200
Perhaps your qi and blood are disturbed.

57
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,200
You must rest

58
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,320
and not strain yourself.

59
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,560
I'll give you a prescription
to start with.

60
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,160
Take a few doses,
and then we'll reassess.

61
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,520
Miss Qingtai,

62
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,880
go with Physician Lin to fetch it.

63
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,400
There are many herbs
in the alchemy room.

64
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,960
Bring them here.

65
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,320
I'm not leaving.

66
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,000
I want to stay with Her Highness.

67
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,000
Do not waste words.

68
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,640
Do you expect me to fetch them myself?

69
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,520
Go on,

70
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,360
Qingtai.

71
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,040
Miss,

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,640
do you know how much I spent on medicine

73
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,640
to save you?

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,080
I've troubled Your Highness.

75
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,000
How did you know

76
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,160
I would let you live?

77
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,800
How will you repay me?

78
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,840
I've already married
into your residence.

79
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,400
I am yours.

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,520
How would you have me repay you?

81
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,160
When did you marry me?

82
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,920
Don't tarnish my good name.

83
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,360
I came all the way from Beiyuan

84
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,720
for a marriage alliance.

85
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,720
If I had not married Your Highness,

86
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,720
why would I live in your residence?

87
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,600
We are not yet married.

88
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,160
We are still waiting for my father

89
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,160
to set the wedding date.

90
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,360
Since you came,

91
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,800
I gave you the name Miss Meng.

92
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,120
Meng?

93
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,720
You dislike it?

94
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,280
Not at all.

95
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,640
It is my honor

96
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,760
to receive a name from you.

97
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,160
Then

98
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,720
let it be your name from now on.

99
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,440
Understood.

100
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,800
It really is autumn now.

101
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,080
Please take care.

102
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,800
His Highness is generous indeed.

103
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,560
Much better than sitting
in a medical hall...

104
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,200
Have you seen this woman
in the portrait?

105
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,720
She does

106
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,400
look familiar.

107
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,200
Look closer.

108
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,920
Is there such a woman

109
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,200
in Prince Wuyin's residence?

110
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:01,640
Chancellor.

111
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,920
Now that you mention it,

112
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,680
there is someone

113
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,560
in Prince Wuyin's residence

114
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,200
who looks much like this woman.

115
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,680
But her expression

116
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,680
and demeanor are duller

117
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,880
than in the portrait.

118
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,640
Come with me.

119
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,320
Physician Lin.

120
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,160
Pardon me for earlier.

121
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,880
Please accept this gift.

122
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,000
Thank you.

123
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,440
You know the Chancellor's reputation,

124
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,840
then you should know
he never shows himself easily.

125
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,760
About what was asked today...

126
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,360
No one asked me anything.

127
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,640
All right. You may leave.

128
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,480
Chancellor.

129
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,440
Why did you not

130
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,800
ask after Her Highness's condition?

131
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,960
That man is greedy and disloyal.

132
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,680
Asking more would just invite trouble.

133
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,600
We know she's here.

134
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,800
We can follow proper etiquette
and come back another time.

135
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,240
Yes, sir.

136
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,760
Your Highness.

137
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,760
What is the meaning of this?

138
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,080
Starting today,

139
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,480
the lady in my inner residence

140
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,840
will be called Miss Meng.

141
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,040
She is my betrothed.

142
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,720
As her maid,

143
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,760
you'd do well
to watch your words and deeds.

144
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,360
Do not make her suspicious.

145
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,640
Who would believe your lies?

146
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,000
Miss Meng believes them.

147
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:32,800
Her Highness...

148
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,920
What's wrong with Her Highness?

149
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,000
I had Qingfeng

150
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,160
prepare a room for you.

151
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,200
After you serve

152
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,400
her daily meals,

153
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,760
you will stay there quietly.

154
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,360
Otherwise...

155
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,200
You have seen

156
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,080
the Jiangtao pill's antidote.

157
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:00,600
You...

158
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,800
Hold your tongue,

159
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,640
or Miss Meng

160
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,600
will die.

161
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,720
Miss Qingtai.

162
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,040
Please.

163
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,920
I'll show you to your quarters.

164
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,720
This will be a risky operation,

165
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,080
(15 Days Before)

166
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,400
if I fail...

167
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,880
Your Highness!

168
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,040
Take me to Prince Wuyin's residence.

169
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,080
Prince Wuyin?

170
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,120
Your Highness must be mistaken.

171
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,600
We should seek aid from Prince Wuxia.

172
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,800
If this mission fails,

173
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,640
knowing Shen Zaiye's ways,

174
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,760
Prince Wuxia will not be able
to protect me.

175
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,240
Only Prince Wuyin

176
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,760
remains a gamble I can take.

177
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,080
So no matter what,

178
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,040
I must get
into Prince Wuyin's residence.

179
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,200
My poor princess.

180
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,080
You just escaped
that treacherous Chancellor,

181
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,800
only to leap into Prince Wuyin's grip.

182
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,280
What are you thinking?

183
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,440
(Qingfeng, Third Prince's Personal Servant)

184
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,000
Your Highness.

185
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,560
Your calculations are brilliant indeed.

186
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,840
Qingtai went into the side room
as expected.

187
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,480
She's a maid.

188
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,680
She poses no threat.

189
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:54,960
Your Highness.

190
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,280
Has Her Majesty contacted you?

191
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,120
Then...

192
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,480
The antidote?

193
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,400
Before Lan Boutique was raided,

194
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,920
I worried they would find something,

195
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,040
so I searched first.

196
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,240
That antidote

197
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,280
turned up by accident.

198
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,680
Your Highness.

199
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,360
Did the princess of Beiyuan

200
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,280
really mistake you
for the Left Chancellor?

201
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,840
I still think something is off.

202
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,040
If she dared lie like that,

203
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,320
she would not be alive now.

204
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,200
She was likely confused

205
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,240
from her injuries.

206
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,440
But what if

207
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,760
she suddenly remembers

208
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,400
someday?

209
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,000
Your Highness.

210
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,200
Even setting aside
whether Yang Wanqing's death

211
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,560
involved her, she is exposed.

212
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,680
She is now useless.

213
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,880
A useless piece can still win the game

214
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,120
if played right.

215
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,160
Should we report this

216
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,760
to Her Majesty?

217
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,680
No need.

218
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,280
Her Majesty is waiting to hear

219
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,840
what happened with Lan Boutique.

220
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,160
Will Her Majesty be upset

221
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,240
if we don't report this matter?

222
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,720
Upset?

223
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,560
If that's the case,

224
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,280
then I'm no different
from Yang Wanqing to her.

225
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,960
If she is angry,

226
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,760
let her come question me herself.

227
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,240
I will explain everything then.

228
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:34,760
Your Highness.

229
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,440
Chancellor Shen sent a visiting card.

230
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:47,340
(Left Chancellor Shen Zaiye
Pays Respects)

231
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,400
He destroyed my Lan Boutique.

232
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,920
I have yet
to settle that score with him.

233
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,760
Now he shows up at my door
of his own accord.

234
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,380
(Left Chancellor Shen Zaiye
Pays Respects)

235
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,960
Tomorrow, grant Chancellor Shen
permission to enter the residence.

236
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,720
Yes, Your Highness.

237
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:26,760
Your High...

238
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,120
Miss Meng, why are you up?

239
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:34,880
Qingtai,

240
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,480
am I really

241
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,280
addressed as Meng in this residence?

242
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,120
You are.

243
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:40,880
Please sit down.

244
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,080
It's time for your meal.

245
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,440
There are scrambled eggs today.

246
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,400
The medicine is ready too.

247
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,840
Remember to take it after your meal.

248
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,400
If there is nothing else,

249
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,520
I shall take my leave.

250
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,400
Qingtai.

251
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,640
What is the matter?

252
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,960
Prince Wuyin saved you.

253
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,920
I simply wish to do whatever I can

254
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,120
to repay his kindness.

255
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,320
These past few days,

256
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,240
I've been helping
in Prince Wuyin's alchemy room.

257
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,720
If there is nothing else,

258
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,600
I'll be going now.

259
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,640
Prince Wuyin.

260
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,320
(Qingtai's behavior is strange.)

261
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,760
(This matter is certainly
not as simple as she claims.)

262
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,120
(If that is not it,)

263
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,040
(then what is she trying to tell me?)

264
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,160
Miss Meng.

265
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,400
Thank you for the gift.

266
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,840
I like it very much.

267
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,640
You are only

268
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,000
pretending to like it.

269
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,000
Your Highness jests.

270
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,040
I'm overwhelmed

271
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,560
by the favor and affection.

272
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,240
Why would I pretend?

273
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,480
Perhaps I should

274
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,880
send you back to Beiyuan.

275
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:28,840
After all,

276
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,240
nowhere compares to one's homeland.

277
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,160
Taohua!

278
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,200
Changjue!

279
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,840
Changjue!

280
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,640
Taohua!

281
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,160
Move!

282
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:39,880
Taohua!

283
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,480
If you are worried about your brother,

284
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,160
then all the more reason

285
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,000
- Taohua!
- to give your utmost in Qi.

286
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,560
Your Highness.

287
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,880
Though we are not yet married,

288
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,360
in my heart,

289
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,840
I already belong to you.

290
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,680
If I fall short in any way,

291
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,400
please tell me.

292
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,440
I wish to follow you always.

293
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,440
That is rather heartfelt.

294
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,160
But have you forgotten

295
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,680
why we have yet

296
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,000
to marry?

297
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,000
My injuries have not healed.

298
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,840
Much of what happened after I came to Qi

299
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,920
is still unclear to me.

300
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,840
Is that so?
Or is it that you dare not admit it?

301
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,720
Since you arrived in Yujing,

302
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,120
you have consorted with another man,

303
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,480
stirring scandal across the city.

304
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,400
Utterly shameless.

305
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,600
Tell me.

306
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,440
Where does that leave the dignity

307
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,120
of your betrothed?

308
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,120
Your Highness.

309
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,120
I was framed.

310
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,200
I am Princess Chengping of Beiyuan,

311
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,160
sent here to foster peace
between our two nations.

312
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,920
I would never commit
such disgraceful acts.

313
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,640
I ask Your Highness to see the truth.

314
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,240
I thought as much.

315
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,720
That is why

316
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,400
I spoke well of you

317
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,000
before my father

318
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,320
to allow you to stay.

319
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,480
Thank you for believing in my innocence.

320
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,240
I'm alone in Qi.

321
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,720
To receive your protection

322
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,000
is my greatest fortune.

323
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,560
Don't speak too soon.

324
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:25,960
If that man

325
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,440
dares to approach you again,

326
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,600
will you fall into his trap once more?

327
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:31,880
Absolutely not.

328
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,440
He has wronged me once already.

329
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,600
If he dares show his face again,

330
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,560
I'll tear him limb from limb.

331
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,360
That won't do.

332
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,200
If you really did that,

333
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,040
I would be in serious trouble.

334
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,800
I keep to myself within the residence.

335
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,280
I will have no chance of crossing paths
with him again.

336
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,720
Your Highness need not worry.

337
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,800
That man holds great power

338
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,040
in court

339
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,600
and will stop at nothing
to get what he wants.

340
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,520
If he insists on seeing you,

341
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,200
even I may not be able to stop him.

342
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,080
What does Your Highness mean?

343
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,440
Play along.

344
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,040
Tease him.

345
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,280
Toy with him a little.

346
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,520
You should help your betrothed

347
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,120
regain a bit of dignity,

348
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,240
should you not?

349
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:29,880
Yes.

350
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,520
Rest assured, Your Highness.

351
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,520
I won't betray your trust.

352
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:36,880
However,

353
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,560
I simply can't remember who he was.

354
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,480
None other than

355
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:46,920
the Left Chancellor,

356
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,000
Shen

357
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,400
Zaiye.

358
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,220
(Serene and Tasteful)

359
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,680
A rare guest.

360
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,640
What wind blows Chancellor Shen

361
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,600
to my residence today?

362
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,840
I heard Your Highness harbors a woman

363
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,120
in your residence

364
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,680
whose appearance is identical
to the Princess Chengping

365
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,840
who went missing from mine.

366
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,520
I have come today

367
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,920
to take her home.

368
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,800
Chancellor Shen, how bold of you.

369
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,840
By your words,

370
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,200
I'm now suspected
of hiding the princess?

371
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,000
Your Highness,

372
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,760
there's no need to accuse yourself.

373
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,520
This is a crime so grave that it could
spark a war between two nations.

374
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,120
It must be judged by His Majesty.

375
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,800
I wonder who has been spreading rumors

376
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,040
and slandering me behind my back.

377
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,240
Your Highness's residence has never seen
the presence of a lady.

378
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,520
This matter was kept secret
for more than a month.

379
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,880
If word has leaked,

380
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,120
it is only natural.

381
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,640
Perhaps Your Highness would bring

382
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,040
the princess out for me to see?

383
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,520
Everything else

384
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,400
can be discussed later.

385
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,000
Qingfeng.

386
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,960
Bring Miss Meng over.

387
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,400
Understood.

388
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:03,760
Your Highness,

389
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,160
Miss Meng said she suddenly felt sleepy

390
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,600
and wished to rest for a while.

391
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,160
Nonsense.

392
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,920
Did you tell her Chancellor Shen
has come to see her?

393
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,880
Go summon Miss Meng, at once.

394
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,280
That won't be necessary.

395
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,120
If she wishes to rest,

396
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,600
let her.

397
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,400
Chancellor Shen.

398
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,000
You are quite patient.

399
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,360
I've long heard that the tea served
at Your Highness's residence

400
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,640
is mellow and sweet.

401
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,040
It's not everyday I get the opportunity

402
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,600
to enjoy some fine tea in peace.

403
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,720
It's a refreshing

404
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,760
change of pace.

405
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,640
I couldn't agree more.

406
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,640
Truly,

407
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,760
it offers a different kind of pleasure.

408
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,520
Your Highness.

409
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,280
Miss Meng has woken up from her nap.

410
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,480
And?

411
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,560
Where is she?

412
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,560
Miss Meng said she needed time
to wash up and dress

413
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,440
before she greeted an honored guest.

414
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,760
Chancellor Shen came to see her,
not her makeup.

415
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,440
With all that powder and rouge,

416
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,520
he might not even recognize her.

417
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,280
Have her come at once.

418
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,920
Patience, Your Highness.

419
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,320
Let her follow her own wishes.

420
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,720
Chancellor Shen.

421
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,240
You're busy with state affairs.

422
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,560
If we wait any longer,

423
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,240
it may interfere
with more pressing matters.

424
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,200
This concerns peace between two nations.

425
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,120
I have the patience for it.

426
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,120
Truly a noble servant

427
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,280
of the people,

428
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,760
sacrificing for the country.

429
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:38,820
(Shunjing Residence)

430
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,480
Chancellor Shen.

431
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,000
Had you not kept urging me to hold back,

432
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,440
I would have brought her here myself.

433
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,760
To waste an entire day,

434
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,760
keeping you waiting.

435
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,240
She ought to be punished.

436
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,880
Your Highness, please don't be angry.
I'm here now.

We haven't seen each other in a while.

♪Even if it means this flower
will be hers to give to someone new♪

453
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,920
I entered His Highness's residence,

454
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,200
I have been called Miss Meng.

455
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,680
I ask that you address me as such.

456
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,160
A name is but a token of identity.

457
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,280
As long as you are safe,

458
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,560
that is what matters.

459
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,920
His Highness has treated me
exceedingly well.

460
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,600
There's no need for your concern.

461
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,360
Come back with me.

462
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,000
No matter what,

463
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,880
you are mine.

464
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,280
Shameless!

465
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,120
Your Highness,

466
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,080
I don't even remember this man.

467
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,760
Please do not misunderstand.

468
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,200
Jiang Taohua!

469
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,760
I ask you to show some respect.

470
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:21,720
Miss Meng.

471
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,720
Chancellor Shen is an honored guest.

472
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,440
How dare you slight him?

473
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,360
I meant to receive him properly,

474
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,320
but who knew
he would be so disrespectful?

475
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,600
Chancellor Shen,

476
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,840
now that is your fault.

477
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,880
Has waiting all day

478
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,360
worn away your patience?

479
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,200
I know you resent me,

480
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,200
but...

481
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,640
Since this is your arrangement,

482
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,200
I shall go along with it.

483
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,360
Chancellor Shen, please take a seat.

484
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,160
Upon hearing you would visit today,

485
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,920
I prepared a Beiyuan delicacy.

486
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,840
This is roasted beef.

487
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,520
Please try it.

488
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,800
(The peach blossom mark is gone.)

489
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,160
(The poison has been cured.)

490
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,520
Since you made it just for me,

491
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,880
I shall savor every bite.

492
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,600
This roasted beef is grilled

493
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,520
until both sides
are charred and fragrant.

494
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,120
Crisp on the outside

495
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,160
and tender within.

496
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:26,920
What a pity

497
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,320
Your Highness does not eat meat.

498
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,640
Such a treat wasted.

499
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,000
I made this dish myself.

500
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,480
Chancellor Shen,

501
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,000
you must finish it all.

502
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,040
I heard the people of Beiyuan
favor beef and lamb,

503
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,040
and use them to enhance flavor.

504
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:53,560
In that case,

505
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,840
my Lady Jiang should find it

506
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,520
quite to her taste.

507
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,080
I made this just for you.

508
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,560
Lady Jiang,

509
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,680
you must eat it all.

510
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,120
(This is the cumin I used
the first time I cooked for you.)

511
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,880
(And you still claim
not to remember me.)

512
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,360
Delicious.

513
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,760
Chancellor Shen, please have some soup.

514
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,720
What is that pungent smell?

515
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,600
Spiced soup.

516
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:57,800
Chancellor Shen,

517
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,080
allow me to change.
I shall return shortly.

518
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,000
You would rather suffer here in silence

519
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,400
than admit who you are to me?

520
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,760
Why do you keep hurting me
again and again?

521
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,280
What are your intentions?

522
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,760
That was never my intention.

523
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,000
To find you,

524
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,240
I searched all of Yugui Mountain.

525
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,640
I inquired at every medical hall.

526
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,400
At one point, I even feared you were...

527
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:31,880
But look.

528
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,640
I found this.

529
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,200
If you say it was not your intent,

530
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:47,720
then you admit

531
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,560
to having harmed me.

532
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,600
I have never denied the things

533
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,920
I have done.

534
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:58,840
But...

535
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,400
Then what right do you have
to keep troubling me?

536
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,920
A person should know their place.

537
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,680
I ask that you never seek me out again.

538
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,560
Jiang Taohua.

539
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,520
Do you feel only hatred

540
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,560
toward me?

541
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,800
We are nothing more than strangers.

542
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,360
Why would I hate you?

543
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,800
I am engaged to His Highness.

544
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,800
Please behave appropriately.

545
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:32,920
What did you say?

546
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,640
You are a high-ranking minister.

547
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,120
There are countless women in the world.

548
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,320
Why do you insist
on making my life miserable?

549
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,840
I came here from Beiyuan, alone,

550
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,920
with no one to rely on.

551
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,000
Every day I live in fear,

552
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,840
walking on thin ice.

553
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,520
Even so,

554
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,360
I have never

555
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,800
harbored ill intent toward anyone.

556
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,840
If I ever offended you

557
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,680
in the past,

558
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,440
I beg you not to hold it

559
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,480
against me.

560
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,040
Chancellor Shen.

561
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,480
I was merely gone for a moment.

562
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,400
Why has your face gone so pale?

563
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,800
Did Miss Meng

564
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:12,960
offend you again?

565
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,000

I apologize.

Ever since Lan Boutique was shut down,

610
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,720
we have caught many Beiyuan spies,

611

yet we've found
no trace of the antidote.

00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,680
Most of the spies in custody

613
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,160
have already died from the poison.

614
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,200
She's been in Prince Wuyin's residence
for over a month now.

615
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,880
While the spies in prison
have all succumbed,

616

is in Prince Wuyin's hands?

That is not yet confirmed.

621
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:38,680
Investigate it.

622
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,520
This matter must be handled
with utmost secrecy.

623
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,120
Understood.

624
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:41,840
One more thing.

625
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,360
Send Zengtu with a unit to Beiyuan.

626
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,240
Find the Jiangtao pill antidote.

627
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:45,880
Yes, sir.

628
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,200
(If she's staying with Prince Wuyin
for the antidote,)

629
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,520
(then I'll help her solve her problem.)

Chancellor.

633
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,360
I wanted to ask you about a poison

634
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,680
known as the Jiangtao pill.

635
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,800
When the poison takes effect,

636
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,680
a peach blossom-shaped mark
appears on the body.

637
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,800
I had a junior fellow disciple

638
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,120
who specialized in poisons.

639
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,080
I remember she once told me herself

640
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,880
that only the most potent toxins

641
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,880
produce a visible mark.

642
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,720
Where is she now?

643
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,360
She was expelled long ago.
I'm afraid I don't know where she is.

644
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:39,960
Chancellor.

645
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,320
Why the sudden interest in this poison?

646
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,840
All the Beiyuan spies I apprehended
were poisoned with it.

647
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,360
Without the antidote,
they die within a month.

648
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:51,960
Several have

649
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,120
already succumbed.

650
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,760
Once the coroner finishes his autopsies
and records the findings,

651
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,640
I will have the bodies sent to you

652
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:58,840
for further study.

653
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,480
You must find a cure
as soon as possible.

654
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,000
Of course.

655
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,760
As you wish, Chancellor.

656
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,720
There's another matter.

657
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,920
My wife is suffering from amnesia.

658
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,960
Do you have any way
to treat such a condition?

659
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,400
Amnesia often stems

660
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,520
from emotional trauma.

661
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,880
It is not easy to treat.

662
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,080
Allow me to consult the medical texts.

663
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,480
I'll share any possible remedies
once I have more clarity.

664
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,040

665
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,440
(unhealable grudge against Shen Zaiye.)

666
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,640
(Why else would just looking at him)

667
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,240
(bring such stabbing pain to my heart?)

668
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:37,840
(Enough.)

669
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,880
(I'll think no more on it.)

670
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,720
(Right now,
completing this political marriage)

671
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,920

comes first.)

That's a big camel!

680
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,160
Judging by their attire,

681
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,360
they must be from Beiyuan.

682
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,920
I heard a delegation
has arrived from Beiyuan.

683
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,320
I wonder why they're here this time.

684
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,440

00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:07,760
