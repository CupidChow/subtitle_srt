If human fragments of stuff are found

57
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,800

Quickly add the peach blossoms.

Who could really go against my will?

Just it was a loss.

00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,040
I didn't hurt anyone because of you.

119
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,120
Do you know

00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,520

00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,780

I want to give you the best.

00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,700
The imperial concubine is here.

Your Highness, slow down.

00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,260
The imperial concubine is here.

Eat first.

143
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,300
Your Highness.

144
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,700
I just ate the snacks that father gave me.

145
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,540
I can't eat it.

146
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,540
You eat.

147
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:53,900
Y...

148
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,180
Do you know

150
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,220
How dare you steal DarlingWhat's lunch?

151
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,300
How dare you?

152
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,980
Eggs are eggs.

153
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,300
You bastard.

154
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,340
You...

155
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,060
For me, the palace of Qi

00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,660
are all humiliation.

157
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,380
I'm sorry.

158
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,380
I didn't expect this.

159
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,020
You're just a child

160
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,580
spoiled by your father.

161
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,220
How can you

162
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,180
let others feel that?

163
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:40,980
Hua.

164
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:47,860

00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,660
I'll make it up to you.

167
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:52,940
This time,

168
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,540
I'll make it up to you with all my strength.

169
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,500
You said

170
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,180
you'd give up the state of Qi.

171
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,540
I tried again and again.

172
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,660
But I failed again and again.

173
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:06,780
Hua.

174
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,420
I promise you.

175
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,260
This time,

176
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,500
I'll give you

177
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,740
everything you want.

178
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,300
Hua.

179
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,660
This time,

180
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,420
I'll do it my way.

181
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,500
Hua.

182
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,180
I gave you what you wanted.

183
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,140
Then,

184
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,580
you should give me what I want, too.

185
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,020
I've arranged for the Wu Family

186
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,420
to escort you back to the capital.

187
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,420
I've arranged for the Wu Family to escort you back to the capital.

188
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,500
Thank you, Prime Minister.

189
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,620
I don't know when we'll see each other again.

190
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:53,860
Do you

191
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,180
have anything else to tell me?

192
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,700
Yes.

193
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,420
Although Mu Wuyin is not dead,

194
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,580
she and Lv Houchi murdered His Highness

195
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,100
and committed the crime of colluding with the enemy.

196
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:05,860
After His Highness returned to the capital,

197
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,380
we need to tell His Majesty

198
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,380
about her crime as soon as possible.

199
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,460
In this case,

200
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,540
I'm afraid you'll die.

201
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,060
I know you're kind and kind.

202
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,460
But it's necessary to deal with someone who's not easy.

203
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,100
It's necessary to use some thunderous means.

204
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,060
I understand what you mean.

205
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,940
Sometimes, you have to be like a hero who fights against the bandits.

206
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,060
You have to be cruel.

207
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,460
Is there anything else

208
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,180
besides this?

209
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,460
No.

210
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,460
I won't leave you.

211
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,100
I will follow your steps.

212
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,220
Take care, two of you.

213
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:54,900
Brother.

214
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,100
Note that you care a lot.

215
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,380
Jiang Taohua.

216
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,180
I'm entrusting my brother to you.

217
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,780
You take care of him for me.

218
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,420
Yes, it's right that I take care of him.

219
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,340
Qingying, don't worry about me.

220
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:09,780
Take care.

221
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,180
Take care.

222
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,220
The基本 line is clear

223
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,220
as ALLRAGE has a giant dissolve.

224
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,140
And you just let him go?

225
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,940
You're...

226
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,220
Sanshu.

227
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,540
I've figured that you're his cousin.

228
00:11:50,140 --> 00:12:03,680
There are no

229
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,220
I can finally be at peace.

230
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,420
You promised to heal me.

231
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,420
You must keep your promise.

232
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:17,860
Of course.

233
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,340
The Prince still understands me well.

234
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,860
Please show yourself to Qu Han and the others.

235
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,060
What's the matter?

236
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,060
You seem to forget about me a little.

237
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,300
I thought

238
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,820
you were a little (#abord겠습니다人言號不正確.)

239
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,580
ASTRO-ATEEX's treasure hunt just for blind date.

240
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,820
Do you still remember

241
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,140
Do you want to hear it?

242
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,260
In the past,

243
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,580
I always stood in front of the old and ran away.

244
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,100
I was afraid that my misfortune

245
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,100
would become your burden.

246
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,380
But I never thought

247
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:25,940
that such torture

248
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,980
would only cause more harm.

249
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,180
Until today,

250
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,580
I realized how much I regret it.

251
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,060
I've never talked about your feelings.

252
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,340
Seeing you still alive,

253
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,420
I'm grateful to the Heaven

254
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,220
for being kind to me.

255
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,940
Even if you have to

256
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,580
hold the peach-blossom elixir for me,

257
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:46,820
so what?

258
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,700
Even if I live a hundred years

259
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,500
in a day of heart-to-heart,

260
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,580
I can't beat the day when we get together.

261
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:01,540
Look.

262
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,060
I've received

263
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,540
the hairpin you gave me.

264
00:14:32,580 --> 00:15:00,440
The

265
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,220
We should find all the food and food items

266
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,340
as soon as possible.

267
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,860
Otherwise,

268
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,980
we will be in a panic.

269
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,740
It's not just me.

270
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,580
After the whole city's disaster,

271
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,060
we still have to work together.

272
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,220
That's right.

273
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,300
Then, let's get back to work.

274
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,060
Let's get back to work.

275
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,260
Let's go.

276
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,220
Yes.

277
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,420
Aunt Xiang,

278
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,500
stop working.

279
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,580
Changjue has arranged

280
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,540
the reconstruction of the city.

281
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:53,980
By the way,

282
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:56,980
look.

283
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,380
What's this?

284
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,780
This is called watermelon.

285
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,660
In the family book that Changjue gave me,

286
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,540
it mentioned the fruit of this color.

287
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,100
The father is too yellow.

288
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,980
The only fruit he can find is this.

289
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,700
Changjue has suffered.

290
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,260
Aunt Xiang,

291
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,740
I'm happy that you can treat him

292
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,860
as your brother.

293
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:31,940
By the way,

294
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,980
Changjue is safe now.

295
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,340
Why don't we go to Hao Du now?

296
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,620
Go to Hao Du?

297
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:50,940
We have to find the root of the

298
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,940
I've never thought about the future.

299
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:52,540
I'm excited.

300
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,060
Aunt Xiang.

301
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:53,660
Aunt Xiang,

302
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,500
the scout reported that

303
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,300
the Empress Lv and Mu Wuyin have returned to Yujing.

304
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,020
What did the Empress Lv do in Yujing?

305
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,940
She's looking for Mu Wuyin

306
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:01,740
to fight for the throne.

307
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,620
The Fourth Prince is in danger.

308
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,220
We have to return to Yujing.

309
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:07,860
Don't worry.

310
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,620
As long as we can capture the Empress Lv,

311
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,540
the root of the law is not under the picture.

312
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:18,500
It's done.

313
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:19,380
Hurry up.

314
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,340
Find the third brother.

315
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:21,700
Stop.

316
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,100
Go and call the third brother.

317
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,900
Father is looking for me.

318
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,660
Greetings, Princess Lan.

319
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,620
I'm here to deliver the medicine to Father.

320
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,220
Father,

321
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,660
what's wrong with your body?

322
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:34,460
Third Brother.

323
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,340
Are you not feeling well?

324
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,940
Give me the medicine.

325
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:37,900
The medicine.

326
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:38,780
Hurry up.

327
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:41,780
Father,

328
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,180
it's really not a coincidence.

329
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,620
A few days ago,

330
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,540
I didn't operate properly.

331
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,060
The pot was blown up

332
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,020
and it was still in the repair shop.

333
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,500
But

334
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,620
I found this half of the elixir

335
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,980
in the ruins.

336
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,580
Please save Ji.

337
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,220
Yes.

338
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,100
How can it be so unfortunate?

339
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:20,820
Didn't you say

340
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,540
there are many elixir stoves

341
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,460
in your Taoist Temple?

342
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,260
Father,

343
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,540
the elixir stoves

344
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,900
are still in the treatment.

345
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,100
It will take some time.

346
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,180
Father,

347
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,500
I think

348
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,740
you should move to

349
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,460
my Qingxiu Temple some other day.

350
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,060
After the medicine is cured,

351
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,180
you can come to my house immediately.

352
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,060
Very good.

353
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,700
Get ready.

354
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,540
Your Majesty.

355
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,140
Your Majesty.

356
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:01,820
Prime Minister.

357
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,100
Your Highness.

358
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,020
Does His Majesty suspect anything?

359
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,260
The one who took the medicine

360
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,740
is only

361
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,260
the elixir.

362
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,300
It seems that

363
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,900
it's time

364
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,820
to send Shen Zaiye

365
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,540
and Mu Wuxia to the road.

366
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,100
Thank you, Prime Minister.

367
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,020
The palace and the spiritual guards

368
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,380
are in a good relationship.

369
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,140
General Qi of the Imperial Guards

370
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,940
has always been my confidant.

371
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:37,740
I think

372
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,540
there should be no problem.

373
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,260
However,

374
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,740
the world is coming to an end.

375
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:48,060
I still have some concerns.

376
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,540
It's okay to say that.

377
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,420
After you took the throne,

378
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,980
how can I assured you

379
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,260
that Meng's Family

380
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,100
is still the first in our country

381
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,580
rather than being banished

382
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,820
or murder?

383
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,300
Unless...

384
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,100
Unless we're from a family

385
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,500
The sitting upside down

386
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,140
made me understood,

387
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,620
Miss Meng and I

388
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,620
We've known each other since childhood.

389
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,780
He's smart and knows the rules.

390
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,140
Prime Minister You,

391
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,460
I'm willing to be close to the Meng family.

392
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,100
Then we'll be a family.

393
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,460
Are you at ease, Prime Minister You?

394
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,420
I'm flattered.

395
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,580
Thank you for your permission.

396
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:57,940
Meng family will serve you until death.

397
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,300
It's a serious matter.

398
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:04,340
I have many things to ask you for.

399
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,500
Please take back your order.

400
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,180
Impossible.

401
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:18,380
You've agreed to it.

402
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,220
I'll talk to him.

403
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:21,900
How dare you!

404
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:23,580
А

405
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,100
During the evaluation meeting,

406
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,420
I decided

407
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,900
not to be a grown man.

408
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:45,900
니까

409
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,740
Can you assist Meng family with the work?

410
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,020
Everyday sneakers,

411
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,280
aquele霤衣,

412
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,620
old women's shoes,

413
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,580
shoelaces,

414
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,060
everywhere,

415
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,280
she even looked at one thing!

416
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,420
If it was the old lady,

417
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,040
if the original woman

418
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,780
is not something

419
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,740
to be Mommy includes,

420
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,560
her mind will notantragen.

421
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,020
Stop thinking

422
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,020
you might have been

423
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,300
under the influence of the evil.

424
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,420
If Meng family becomes the foreign wife again,

425
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,900
it's hard to avoid the result of

426
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,860
the attack of the high-ranking officials.

427
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:24,940
Father,

428
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,140
you're not

429
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,500
doing very well.

430
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,020
It's no use saying more.

431
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,420
If you don't agree,

432
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,540
Meng family has many sons.

433
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:36,980
I don't mind

434
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,100
having another

435
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,820
and third Meng Huai Rui.

436
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,660
Everything about Huai Jin

437
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,500
can be replaced.

438
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,460
Even the name

439
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,260
can disappear from the family history.

440
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,420
So, Lv Hou has gone to Qi Country.

441
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,220
Chang Ju,

442
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,420
come back to Qi Country with us.

443
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:03,900
With you here,

444
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,020
you'll be safe.

445
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:08,940
Sister,

446
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,060
I know you've made such a good arrangement.

447
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,740
It must be a good one.

448
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,340
But,

449
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,020
I can't go with you.

450
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,340
Why?

451
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,500
Lv Hou has gone to Qi Country.

452
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,660
It's the best time

453
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,260
to get rid of Lv Hou's party

454
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,260
and rebuild Jiang's society.

455
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,140
Sister,

456
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,660
I'm not doing this for my own good.

457
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,540
Lv Hou has been in power for years.

458
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,420
He has caused the people of North Campus to suffer.

459
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:43,860
Chang Ju,

460
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,740
you've really grown up.

461
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,100
I'm not a child anymore.

462
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,220
I'm not a child anymore.

463
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,500
We're in the royal family.

464
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,820
We do have the responsibility to protect the people.

465
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,260
I can't think about it.

466
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,340
Sister,

467
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,820
do you remember

468
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,740
what you said to me when you were a child?

469
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,700
You said,

470
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,460
the higher the position,

471
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:10,980
the more worried you are.

472
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,340
The deeper the position,

473
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,540
the more you'll never forget it.

474
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:16,940
Sis,

475
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,220
I really respect you.

476
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:24,220
Thank you, Dr. ecological doctor.

477
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,860
Thank you, Lv Hou.

478
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,620
As Jinальной Wu,

479
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,900
she's on the way.

480
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,740
When you're back,

481
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,980
you must be careful.

482
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,540
Don't worry.

483
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,780
I'm not the boy

484
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:46,780
But if she doesn't want to help,

485
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,300
she can only take revenge on herself.

486
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,260
Fine.

487
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,500
As long as it's the way you want,

488
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,380
I'll do my best to support you.

489
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,180
Thank you, Sister.

490
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,540
You don't have to thank me.

491
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,380
As the Crown Prince,

492
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,980
you're still a poor man.

493
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,900
You've been running for them

494
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,100
to get rid of the slaves.

495
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,420
That's a human being.

496
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,020
You're trying to save the people.

497
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,340
That's a hero.

498
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,500
You're not trying to get others involved.

499
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:23,860
That's a hero.

500
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,780
You're helping the people rebuild their homes.

501
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,100
That's a hero.

502
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:28,900
It seems that we, the Qi,

503
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,420
have to do our best.

504
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:33,140
Don't worry, Prime Minister.

505
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,220
The country is not at war.

506
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,260
The people are safe.

507
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,980
The Northern Courtyard and the State of Qi

508
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,020
are fighting for the peace.

509
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,140
It's always been my wish.

510
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,260
Changjue,

511
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,260
you must write me a letter to keep me safe.

512
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,180
Of course.

513
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,260
Then,

514
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,940
I'll leave it to you.

515
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,060
Don't worry.

516
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,740
When the country is at war,

517
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,300
we'll come back to see you.

518
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:03,780
Okay.

519
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:06,260
I'll definitely come to you then.

520
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,340
Sister,

521
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,620
it's not too late.

522
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:10,940
I'll go make preparations.

523
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,100
Okay.

524
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,180
Go.

525
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,340
We should leave now.

526
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,220
I suddenly feel

527
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,620
a little bit reluctant to leave.

528
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,740
After we catch the Lv Heng,

529
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,660
we'll find the root of the Jiangtao Egg.

530
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:36,940
I'll come back with you.

531
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,620
It doesn't matter how long it takes.

532
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:41,500
Okay.

533
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:14,860
Two days later

534
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,460
Hua.

535
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,460
Hua.

536
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,060
It's time to change your medicine.

537
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,220
I'll give you everything you want.

538
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,260
But this time,

539
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,380
I'll use my own way.

540
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:45,020
Don't be afraid.

541
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,300
Wu Yin,

542
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,220
you've always listened to me.

543
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,300
I didn't�t.

544
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,980
I kept being give five Academy Nap setup

545
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,780
once.

546
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:13,860
Why did you suddenly bring me to Qi?

547
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,140
Hua,

548
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,580
I want to keep my promise to you.

549
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:23,580
Qi will soon be in my palm.

550
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,660
Don't you want to see it with your own eyes?

551
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,540
Hua,

552
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,580
soon,

553
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,020
I will hold a grand wedding for you.

554
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:40,020
I will also let everyone in the world see it.

555
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:45,220
You and I will rule the world together.

556
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,540
Hua,

557
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,420
it's been so many years.

558
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,740
Our wish is about to come true.

559
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,380
I'm so happy.

560
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:06,980
Are you happy?

561
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:11,900
Of course.

562
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,140
But look at my ankle.

563
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,100
It's so ugly.

564
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:22,620
It's inevitable that it will leave a mark on our wedding.

565
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,460
I remember that there is a Hall Leader in the Blue-Sweeping Pavilion.

566
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,220
He is good at treating wounds.

567
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,140
Why don't you find him?

568
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,820
Why do you want to find him?

569
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:36,660
I want to ask him to remove my scar.

570
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:41,860
Only by doing this can we have a perfect wedding.

571
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,700
Hua wants a perfect wedding?

572
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,740
Yes.

573
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,700
Hurry up.

574
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,660
Call him here.

575
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:58,900
Hua,

576
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,140
it's too late.

577
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,980
He is dead.

578
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,660
Dead?

579
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,380
Yes.

580
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,380
He was killed by me.

581
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,740
Not only him,

582
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,860
but also all the Northern Yuan nobles you left in Daqi

583
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,260
were killed by me.

584
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,260
Do you know how long I have been planning this?

585
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,460
Of course I know.

586
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,660
Hua put so much effort into it.

587
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,660
That's why it looks like this.

588
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,620
Of course I know.

589
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,620
If they are still alive,

590
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,580
Hua will have a will.

591
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,380
Hua will never have me in his heart and eyes.

592
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,180
Hua,

593
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,740
I just want to break your wings.

594
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,580
Only by doing this

595
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,980
can you stay by my side forever.

596
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,980
Only by doing this

597
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:13,740
can you be the wife of Mu Wuyin.

598
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,620
You want me to be your wife?

599
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,460
You dream?

600
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,380
I won't marry you.

601
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:29,220
You can't marry me.

602
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:35,980
Mu Wuyin!

603
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,540
I hate being suppressed and arrested the most.

604
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,820
Why don't you kill me?

605
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:05,980
You are crazy.

606
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,460
How do you know I'm crazy?

607
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,740
I was forced to be crazy by you!

608
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,860
Since the door was closed in front of me,

609
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,860
I've been in a state of panic.

610
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,180
I was so scared.

611
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,580
I was so scared.

612
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,980
I was so scared.

613
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,380
I was so scared.

614
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,780
I was so scared.

615
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,180
I was so scared.

616
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,580
I was so scared.

617
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,980
I was so scared.

618
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,180
I was so scared.

619
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,180
At that moment,

620
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,380
I finally understood

621
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,380
that only by standing high

622
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,180
can I get you.

623
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,580
Hua,

624
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,380
even if you die,

625
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,380
in five days,

626
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,100
I will marry your body.

627
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,980
I'll marry your body.

628
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,580
Is that okay?

629
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:17,780
Because everyone around the world knows

630
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,340
that I, Mu Wuyin,

631
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,020
am the only woman.

632
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,520
looked at this homeland

633
00:34:35,560 --> 00:35:00,380
and the civil

634
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,700
Sun sweats

635
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,980
and there are the dead

636
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:05,180
I, Li Dian, would like to see Your Highness.

637
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:13,900
Your Highness,

638
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,140
Xiangye ordered me to send a letter.

639
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,420
Mu Yin and Lv Hou have returned to their home.

640
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,700
Xiangye and Her Highness

641
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,100
are on their way back to the capital.

642
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,140
I want to enter the palace to see my father.

643
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,060
Your Highness, wait.

644
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,460
His Majesty has been in the Ling Dynasty for many days.

645
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:30,780
The imperial guards in the palace have been on the run.

646
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,420
Don't worry.

647
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,540
Now, Her Highness and Prime Minister Meng

648
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,500
are in the palace.

649
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,380
Now, the whole imperial capital

650
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,020
is under their control.

651
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,380
Your Highness is alone in the palace.

652
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,100
You might get caught in the trap.

653
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,500
We've just left the capital for a long time.

654
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,540
The imperial capital has become a cage of fire.

655
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,700
What you said is right.

656
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:50,540
Xiangye said

657
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,540
Your Highness could go to my home to hide.

658
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,260
We'll discuss it

659
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,660
when she comes back.

660
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,740
That's it.

661
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,420
Go.

662
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,500
Go.

663
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,140
Leave them alone.

664
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,660
Oh no, they're attacking us.

665
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:53,980
Youxiang.

666
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,100
Your Highness,

667
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,340
my men have made a hole

668
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,500
and Shen Zai has run away.

669
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,780
What about Wu Xia?

670
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,020
He hasn't returned to the capital yet.

671
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,140
Then we should stop

672
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,140
the medicine for my father.

673
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:01,620
Your Highness.

674
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:02,380
Your Highness.

675
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,220
Your Highness.

676
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,020
Your Highness.

677
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:04,780
Your Highness.

678
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,620
Your Highness.

679
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,620
Your Highness.

680
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,620
Your Highness.

681
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,620
Your Highness.

682
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,620
Your Highness.

683
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:10,620
Your Highness.

684
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,620
Your Highness.

685
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,620
Your Highness.

686
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,620
Your Highness.

687
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,620
Your Highness.

688
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,620
Your Highness.

689
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,620
Your Highness.

690
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,620
Your Highness.

691
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:18,620
Your Highness.

692
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,620
Your Highness.

693
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:20,620
Your Highness.

694
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,620
Your Highness.

695
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:22,620
Your Highness.

696
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,620
Your Highness.

697
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,620
Your Highness.

698
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,620
Your Highness.

699
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,620
Your Highness.

700
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:27,620
Your Highness.

701
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,620
Your Highness.

702
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:29,620
Your Highness.

703
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,620
Your Highness.

704
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,620
Your Highness.

705
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,620
Your Highness.

706
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,620
Your Highness.

707
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,620
Your Highness.

708
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,620

719
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:46,620

720
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:47,620
