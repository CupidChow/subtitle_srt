1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
My Girlfriend is an Alien

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
How dare they!

4
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The Red Ravine in the south,

5
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
the drought in the northwest,

6
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and the three of them are so insolent.

7
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
They only care about colluding with the Empress Lv

8
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
to get power and take the throne.

9
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
In this way,

10
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I will be the next North Court.

11
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Your Highness.

12
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
This is the report of today?

13
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yes.

14
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It just came from the palace.

15
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I think there is something wrong with it.

16
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Why did His Majesty suddenly go to Qingxiu?

17
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Call Wang Xi.

18
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Hurry up.

19
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,500
Yes.

20
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Go.

21
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Mu Wuxia,

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
what happened?

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Father will be staying in Qingxiu

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
for 44 days.

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
His Majesty is going to ask for the Tao?

26
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Father may take the elixir,

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
but he never believes in the old age.

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
He can't leave the state affairs to be taken care of.

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I don't believe he is a selfish person.

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I have to do everything

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
to see father as soon as possible.

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Your Highness,

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
someone will be watching over you.

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We will only go there

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
to kill ourselves.

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
What should we do?

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Well,

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I have been to Qingxiu.

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I know there is a hole in the corner of the wall.

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It can allow people to get in and out.

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Li Tian.

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
He is just a dog.

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Why does he say there is a hole?

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Let's go.

45
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Your Majesty.

46
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Your Majesty,

47
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
please come and have a rest.

48
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Here.

49
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Slowly.

50
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Your Highness.

51
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Father.

52
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Your Highness, where is the elixir?

53
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Don't worry, Your Highness.

54
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Father,

55
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
look at you now.

56
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You are not like a king of a country.

57
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
If you give me the elixir,

58
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I will ask for the Taoist priest

59
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
to leave the court

60
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
and take the medicine.

61
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The medicine.

62
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The medicine.

63
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
As long as you write down the elixir,

64
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I will give you the elixir.

65
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Father.

66
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Father.

67
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Father,

68
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
you have to think it over.

69
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Zhuo Meng.

70
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Then think it over.

71
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I have a lot of things to do.

72
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I will come to see you another day.

73
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Don't go.

74
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Don't go.

75
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Don't go.

76
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Your Majesty.

77
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Your Majesty.

78
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Your Majesty.

79
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Okay.

80
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I will pass it to you.

81
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Give me the elixir.

82
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Do as you say.

83
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Okay.

84
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Your Majesty.

85
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Father,

86
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
please have a good rest.

87
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Let's go.

88
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Let's go to the back door.

89
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Come on.

90
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Hurry up.

91
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Who is it?

92
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Your Highness.

93
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Wu Xie.

94
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Wu Xie, come here.

95
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Father.

96
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Wu Xie.

97
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Father.

98
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Wu Xie.

99
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Hurry up.

100
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Sit down.

101
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Father.

102
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You have suffered a lot.

103
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I am unfilial.

104
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Uncle is late.

105
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
How could he...

106
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Don't mention this.

107
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I am telling you, Wu Xie.

108
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Mother wants to kill me.

109
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Please let me out.

110
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Okay.

111
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Don't worry, father.

112
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I will save you.

113
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I will help you out.

114
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
When we get back to the palace,

115
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
you will be able to recover

116
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
and recover your health.

117
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Okay.

118
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Father.

119
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Please believe me.

120
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I

121
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
believe you.

122
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I want to ask father

123
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
for a edict.

124
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You want an edict too?

125
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I am not trying to take the throne.

126
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I want to take the edict

127
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
to the Imperial Guards

128
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
to handle the old military affairs.

129
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Father.

130
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Hua.

131
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I brought the gift for you.

132
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The edict for the Imperial Guards.

133
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Tomorrow,

134
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I will announce it to the public

135
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
and tell the whole world

136
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
that you are my queen.

137
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Wuyi.

138
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You have matured.

139
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You have become a man

140
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I can rely on.

141
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Hua.

142
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I did all this

143
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
for you.

144
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You have taken the throne.

145
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I must make you my queen.

146
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Really?

147
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Third Brother.

148
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
How could I lie to you?

149
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Hua.

150
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I will take you

151
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
to the palace to prepare the wedding.

152
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Hua.

153
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Brother. Jiang Taohua.

154
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Qingying.

155
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Your Highness.

156
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You said you didn't know

157
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
when you would meet each other.

158
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You didn't expect to meet each other

159
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
after a few days.

160
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
How did you get into the city?

161
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
The whole imperial jade palace

162
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
is searching for you.

163
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
The imperial jade palace is in charge

164
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
of the safety of the royal family.

165
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
They can't get into the city gate

166
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
and guard the capital.

167
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
We were worried for nothing for days.

168
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
By the way,

169
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
what happened

170
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
after Mu Wuyin came back?

171
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Third Brother used the elixir

172
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
to control father.

173
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Meng Zhongyan

174
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
controlled the imperial jade palace.

175
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
They are in danger.

176
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Third Brother will marry Meng Zhenzhen

177
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
tomorrow.

178
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Why would Mu Wuyin marry Meng Zhenzhen?

179
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Third Brother used

180
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
father's cultivation to be his friend.

181
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
He put father in the Qingxiu temple

182
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
and forced father to write

183
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
the edict of the throne.

184
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Did you see His Majesty?

185
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
This is the edict

186
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
from father.

187
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Father gave me the edict.

188
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
No sign of him.

189
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Did you hear

190
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
anything about Lv Houchi

191
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
after you came back?

192
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
We only heard that

193
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
he and Mu Wuyin came to the Qi State.

194
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Lv Houchi can't give up

195
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
his power in the north garden

196
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
and come to the Qi State

197
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
to help Mu Wuyin.

198
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Then there is only one possibility.

199
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
He was forced to come here.

200
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
If so,

201
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Lv Houchi's hiding place

202
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
is known.

203
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Mu Wuyin knew

204
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
he was going to assassinate Wu Weiguo.

205
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Now he has the Imperial Censor.

206
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
He may tell the world at any time.

207
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I went to his mansion

208
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
to find Lv Houchi.

209
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Lv Houchi

210
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
came to hold Mu Wuyin.

211
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You've been here before.

212
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Have you seen Liao Kang?

213
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
No.

214
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It seems that Lv Houchi

215
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
was kidnapped by Mu Wuyin.

216
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Where is he now?

217
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I don't know.

218
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's a marriage letter.

219
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
So Mu Wuyin

220
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
is the one who is going to marry.

221
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Lv Houchi.

222
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Tomorrow is the wedding.

223
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Lv Houchi is in the palace now.

224
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I want to make the North Campus the queen.

225
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
He's crazy.

226
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
He's really crazy.

227
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Qingying, you may not know.

228
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Mu Wuyin is very obsessed with Lv Houchi.

229
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
He has always wanted to win Lv Houchi.

230
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
He won't give my country

231
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
to Lv Houchi, will he?

232
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It's very likely.

233
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
When he announced the marriage,

234
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
he would marry Lv Houchi.

235
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
When the wedding is held,

236
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
the court will know.

237
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It's also the best time

238
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
to reveal his crime.

239
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
But if we want to attack the main hall,

240
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
we can only do it by ourselves.

241
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Plus, the secret guards.

242
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm afraid it's not enough.

243
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Let's go now.

244
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Take the order to the camp.

245
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Brother, the camp is far away.

246
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
We can make it.

247
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It takes more than ten hours to go back.

248
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It's late.

249
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Let's go now.

250
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Xiaoye.

251
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Xiaoye.

252
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Maybe I can

253
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
fight for you.

254
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
If Meng Zhenzhen knows

255
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
that Mu Wuyin is not the one he wants,

256
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
what will she do?

257
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You want to find her?

258
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
But if she doesn't believe you,

259
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
you'll be in trouble.

260
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Hua.

261
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Don't worry.

262
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I can take the army to the camp.

263
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Okay.

264
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'll wait for you.

265
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Mu Wuyin has his own forces

266
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
in the camp.

267
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
We need to act smart

268
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
to enter the camp

269
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
without any warning.

270
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
The general of the camp, Zhou Chonglong,

271
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
is a good sniper.

272
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
With his current situation,

273
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
even if he doesn't fight against Mu Wuyin,

274
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
he will still be a target.

275
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
So we have to

276
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
bring Zhou Chonglong

277
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
to our camp.

278
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Please wait.

279
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm the special envoy of the Third Prince.

280
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Take me to see your general Zhou.

281
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Yes.

282
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
The key to this is not Zhou Chonglong

283
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
but his subordinates.

284
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Only then can those people

285
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
directly mobilize the front line troops.

286
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
As long as they can

287
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
gather their determination to protect the Qin's army,

288
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
they can mobilize the camp.

289
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
The Third Prince is getting married tomorrow.

290
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
We are ordered to discuss the matter of the exchange room.

291
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'll go to see General Zhou.

292
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You gather here

293
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
and wait for all the generals and soldiers.

294
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Yes.

295
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Fourth Prince,

296
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
you are responsible for the general's tour.

297
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Those old men who were given by the lower-level generals

298
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
will be handed over to me.

299
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
The generals are here.

300
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Thank you, sir.

301
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's been a long time.

302
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
What are you doing here?

303
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'm Yao Jing.

304
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm the general of the Jingji Camp.

305
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'm Yuan Qin.

306
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm the general of the Jingji Camp.

307
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm here to reinforce the army.

308
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
If I remember correctly,

309
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
three years ago,

310
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I've made you the subordinate of the lower-level generals.

311
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Why are you still the subordinate

312
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
after three years of being injured?

313
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm ashamed.

314
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I've let you down.

315
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I, Zhou Chonghu,

316
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
pay my respects to the Fourth Prince.

317
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Since the Fourth Prince has come here today,

318
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
what's the matter?

319
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
General Zhou,

320
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
my third brother

321
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
has sent someone to check on you, right?

322
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You are wise.

323
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
But as the crown prince,

324
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
you are responsible for the state affairs.

325
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It's normal for you to send someone to check on me.

326
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
General Zhou, you don't have to explain.

327
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I know

328
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
you have always been unruly

329
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
and ungrateful.

330
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm sorry for my father's order.

331
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
His Majesty has been kind to me.

332
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I

333
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
will always be loyal to him.

334
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Very good.

335
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Then,

336
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
look at this.

337
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Your Highness,

338
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
forgive me for being rude.

339
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Who wrote the words on it?

340
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
General Zhou,

341
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
is this an order from your father?

342
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I dare not.

343
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm just a rough man.

344
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I don't know much about writing.

345
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Not to mention writing.

346
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I only know

347
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
to read and write.

348
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
The King's Mansion

349
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
The military system in our country

350
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
has only three soldiers.

351
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Liu Ming, Ping Ming and Jun Hu.

352
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
You are now

353
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
soldiers.

354
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
But you must not forget your roots.

355
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
We dare not.

356
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You dare not forget.

357
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
You can't forget.

358
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
From soldiers

359
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
to soldiers,

360
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
how many of you have passed

361
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
the Gui Gate Pass?

362
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
How many comrades have you trained?

363
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Which one of you

364
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
survived the most?

365
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
But these

366
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
are the family of the powerful.

367
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I don't care

368
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
if I don't experience it.

369
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
General Zhou,

370
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
you said you were a rough man.

371
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You don't think you can read much.

372
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Then I will help you analyze the rules.

373
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
The current situation is

374
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Third Brother imprisoned his father

375
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
to take over the imperial guards.

376
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
The imperial guards are as good as the left.

377
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
And you have three options.

378
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
One,

379
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
if you have two ideas of the same kind,

380
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
whether it is not knowing the truth

381
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
or knowing the truth,

382
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
you will not end up well.

383
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
The second option

384
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
is to take me down

385
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
and surrender to him.

386
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
But you have missed the best time.

387
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
First the Meng family,

388
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
then the Yu Lin Wei Qi general.

389
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
That's the snowy end.

390
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And now the problem is urgent.

391
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
With my third brother's temperament,

392
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
he should not be able to

393
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
see you as a fake snowy end.

394
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
The third option

395
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
is to help me, the King of Qin,

396
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
and you should take the credit.

397
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
The third prince is a family

398
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
with the same temperament.

399
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
If he becomes the emperor,

400
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
you two

401
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
will still have to

402
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
exchange your lives

403
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
to save your future.

404
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
You came out of the snowy end.

405
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Do you want to do this?

406
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Everyone,

407
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
come with me today

408
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
to protect the King of Qin

409
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
and kill the King of Qin.

410
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Kill the King of Qin.

411
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Everyone, come with me.

412
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Come with me.

413
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Your Highness,

414
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
to be honest,

415
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I have the right to lead the army,

416
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
but I don't have the right to transfer troops.

417
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Even if I want to help you,

418
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'm afraid I can't help you.

419
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
General Zhou,

420
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
why don't you

421
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
come with me to the camp?

422
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Yes.

423
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It's been a long time since I saw you.

424
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Prime Minister Shen has persuaded

425
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
all the lower-level generals

426
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
to go to the King of Qin.

427
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
It's a good way.

428
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
You're really a good man.

429
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I'm not a good man.

430
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I'm a good man.

431
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I'm a good man.

432
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Of course it's a good way.

433
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
But I have

434
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
a little concern.

435
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
General Zhou, please.

436
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
The army will be in a rush for a day.

437
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
The soldiers will be exhausted.

438
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
The morale is low.

439
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
If His Majesty can show up,

440
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
he will let the soldiers

441
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
take a break

442
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
and go straight to the hall.

443
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
General Zhou means

444
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
if he can't see His Majesty,

445
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
he won't bring the soldiers into the palace.

446
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I need a back road.

447
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Please help me.

448
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Okay.

449
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
As you wish.

450
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Go to the capital.

451
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
The King of Qin is with you.

452
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
The King of Qin is with you.

453
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
The King of Qin is with you.

454
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
The King of Qin is with you.

455
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
The King of Qin is with you.

456
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
The King of Qin is with you.

457
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,280
Protect the King of Qin!

458
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,840
What a strange sedan chair.

459
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,400
Which family is it from?

460
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,440
It's from the Meng family.

461
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,720
Yes, it's from the Meng family.

462
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,280
Princess, look.

463
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,680
The sedan chair team

464
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,360
is going to the Meng family.

465
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,920
If Meng Zhenzhen enters the palace,

466
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,080
I'm afraid we'll miss the chance to see her.

467
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,160
Wait for the night.

468
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,440
Hua.

469
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,760
You're the most beautiful bride I've ever seen.

470
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,320
Your Highness, the time for the ceremony is coming.

471
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:19,880
Your Highness.

472
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,120
It's me.

473
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,720
It happened.

474
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:46,940
My

475
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,280
Do you want this?

476
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:50,880
Your Majesty.

477
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,560
Your Majesty.

478
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,160
Your Highness.

479
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,720
Look at you now.

480
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,520
You've been

481
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,400
a servant to me for a long time.

482
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,480
Meng Youxiang.

483
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,440
His Majesty has been kind to you.

484
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,560
You're so kind and kind.

485
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,280
You deserve to be buried.

486
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,080
Without Meng family,

487
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,240
how could Mu family have been able to play chess?

488
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,320
Don't think I don't know.

489
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,920
You've always been suspicious of the Shi family.

490
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,040
This Shen Zaiye

491
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,720
is a knife you used to deal with the Shi family.

492
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,920
Bring the medicine.

493
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,360
Your Majesty.

494
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,720
You're a sinner.

495
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,160
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

496
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,720
After an hour,

497
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,280
the Third Prince will ascend the throne.

498
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,800
How long will it take?

499
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,280
Your Majesty.

500
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,040
Coming.

501
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,400
Go.

502
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,720
Yu.

503
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,520
How is it?

504
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:34,920
The army has arrived.

505
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,200
But the soldiers

506
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,200
wanted to see His Majesty

507
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,320
before attacking the King of Qin.

508
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,040
Prime Minister changed the way to Qingxiu Hall

509
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,000
to save His Majesty.

510
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,320
It's too late.

511
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,120
Guards!

512
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,200
The Qin government equipped with bandits.

513
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:53,800
attitude.

514
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,240
I'm her husband

515
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,040
Ever since I met you

516
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,880
You looked demanding

517
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,280
But I worm my way

518
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,520
For living

519
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:40,820
Won't like the words

520
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,740
How could I

521
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,320
Even tell you

522
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,320
I underwear

523
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,360
Someone get in

524
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,560
Kill him

525
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:15,960
Stop!

526
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,760
Stop!

527
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,440
Father.

528
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,240
Father.

529
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,080
Father.

530
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,680
Are you all right?

531
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,160
I'm fine.

532
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,520
Father.

533
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,240
The soldiers of the elite battalion have arrived outside the city.

534
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,560
They are waiting for you to lead the troops

535
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,520
and kill them.

536
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,000
Really?

537
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:40,720
Yes.

538
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,960
Father, please get up.

539
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:46,960
Father.

540
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,760
You and Wang Xi go first.

541
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,800
The general is still outside.

542
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,600
I'm going to help him.

543
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,280
Okay.

544
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,320
You have to be very careful.

545
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,160
Zhu Shang, come with me.

546
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:55,960
Okay.

547
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,440
Father.

548
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:56,960
Come.

549
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,480
Okay.

550
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,160
Princess Consort.

551
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,080
Slow down.

552
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:01,880
Let's go.

553
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,440
Meng Zhongyuan.

554
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,040
You lost.

555
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,600
You are too late.

556
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,240
The Third Prince

557
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,640
has already got the imperial edict.

558
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,760
Once the family registration is completed,

559
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:29,160
the Third Prince will be the new king of Xi.

560
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,600
The imperial guards will be in good hands.

561
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,480
There will be no more conflicts.

562
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,560
Even if His Majesty comes,

563
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,480
he won't change his mind.

564
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,360
Take him away.

565
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,160
Go.

566
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,640
Go.

567
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:45,880
Go.

568
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,040
Let him go.

569
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,600
Let him go first.

570
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,320
If you dare to touch the Fourth Prince,

571
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,920
I will make you die.

572
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,400
You can't save his family.

573
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,600
Why bother to die?

574
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,600
Liu Meng.

575
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,920
I know you are loyal to your master.

576
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,000
But Meng Zhongyuan committed the crime of treason.

577
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,200
Is it worth it?

578
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,560
If you take another step,

579
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,560
I will kill him.

580
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,320
Let him go.

581
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,320
I will be your hostage.

582
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,800
You?

583
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,680
You are just a prime minister

584
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,200
who climbed up the ladder.

585
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,040
Do you want to exchange with the prince?

586
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,400
I am the cousin of the Fourth Prince,

587
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,840
Xie Jing'an.

588
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,400
You can also kill him

589
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,160
if you take me away.

590
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,320
The End

591
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,600
Does this handkerchief

592
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,400
still remembers it?

593
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:45,960
Go.

594
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,480
Wu Xiang,

595
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,760
something happened to Brother Shao.

596
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,480
Cousin.

597
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,080
I'll go with you.

598
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,320
No.

599
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,520
It's too dangerous.

600
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,400
Cousin can't protect you.

601
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,840
I'm fine.

602
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,120
Wu Xiang,

603
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,760
His Majesty needs you.

604
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,320
Others,

605
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,240
follow me.

606
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,480
Go.

607
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,960
You're the one to blame.

608
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,320
I had no intention to hurt you,

609
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,520
but I have an important matter to explain

610
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,160
which is your life.

611
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,920
If you can't speak English or Call,

612
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,480
looked away,

613
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,640
Miss Jiang,

614
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,780
you are right

615
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:22,480
It's best ש Россים

616
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,320
for you not do that

617
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,080
Accidents never happen

618
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,800
imperative

619
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:28,840
Estab RTX

620
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,800
And I also

621
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,440
don't know

622
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,360
if I remember

623
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,120
her good days

624
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,720
really

625
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,720
what is she doing

626
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,280
is

627
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,360
another woman.

628
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,400
So what?

629
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,400
Meng family only wants the position of the central palace.

630
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,120
The harem has three thousand people.

631
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,600
What does it have to do with me?

632
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,160
The position of the central palace

633
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,480
will also belong to her.

634
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,160
The third prince is in the throne.

635
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,640
Why would he do such a thing?

636
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:02,920
You may have underestimated

637
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,280
the obsession of a person who loves someone.

638
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,880
If you enter the palace today and get married,

639
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,760
Mu Wuyin will kill you

640
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,720
and take away your family.

641
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,440
No way.

642
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,000
Why would he fight against the Meng family?

643
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,400
I found this marriage certificate

644
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,160
in Mu Wuyin's private room.

645
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,240
The woman in this marriage certificate

646
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,240
is the one Mu Wuyin wants to marry.

647
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:27,880
Her name is Hua.

648
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,440
She is Mu Wuyin's personal maid when she was young.

649
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,080
Mu Wuyin was a busybody.

650
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,120
Yan'er has a great affection for Hua.

651
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,000
You can go to the medical examination

652
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,040
for everything I said.

653
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,800
Hua

654
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,680
has another identity.

655
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,240
She is the queen of the North Courtyard.

656
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,280
If I'm not wrong,

657
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,520
the marriage between Mu Wuyin and the Meng family

658
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,920
is not her own will.

659
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,560
So for her,

660
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,440
the Meng family is not a cornerstone.

661
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,240
It's the Lanlu clan

662
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,400
that will be eliminated sooner or later.

663
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,760
I don't believe you.

664
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,240
Why did you tell me about this?

665
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,280
You should have told me.

666
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,960
I didn't want to tell you.

667
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,680
Mu Wuyin and the Meng family

668
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,960
are competing against each other.

669
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,560
Isn't it better for you?

670
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,520
How about this?

671
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,040
We make a bet.

672
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,560
You take us to the palace.

673
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,720
If Mu Wuyin really does it,

674
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,240
the Green Stage can protect your life.

675
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,920
If what I said is not true,

676
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,560
both of us

677
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,600
will be killed by you.

678
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,240
Why is the Third Prince's wedding

679
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,840
held in the palace?

680
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,240
Only the king can do this.

681
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,360
His Majesty hasn't appeared for a long time.

682
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,400
The power of the government

683
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,840
has been in the hands of the Third Prince.

684
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,600
Isn't he

685
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,720
the master of the country now?

686
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,200
Mr. Li,

687
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,480
please be careful.

688
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,280
Move aside.

689
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,640
Move aside.

690
00:36:59,040 --> 00:36:59,640
Go.

691
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,040
This is a bit strange.

692
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,240
Long Zhang rapper

693
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:18,880
has the liberty of having a había

694
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:22,840
and

695
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,280
is willing to get hair cut

696
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,280
to let Shiva be in heaven and earth forever.

697
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,640
Third Prince.

698
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,640
Greetings, Third Prince.

699
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,640
Third Prince.

700
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,640
All the relatives, please accept the decree.

701
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,640
By the will of Heaven,

702
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,640
I, Mu Wu Yin,

703
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,640
the son of the widow,

704
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,640
Mu Wu Yin,

705
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,640
is a man of great virtue,

706
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,640
and a man of great people.

707
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,640
I am old,

708
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,640
and I have experienced many ups and downs.

709
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,640
I am afraid that I will not be able to remember the night of the emperor.

710
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,640
I will not follow the old rules,

711
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,640
and will not follow the good etiquette.

712
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,640
I will take Mu Wu Yin as my successor.

713
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,640
From now on, I will retire from the imperial court

714
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:21,640
and live in the heaven.

715
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,640
I will write the will of Heaven

716
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,640
and let the officials see it.

717
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,640
I will write the will of Heaven and let the officials see it.

718
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,640
I will write the will of Heaven and let the officials see it.

719
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,640
You...

720
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,640
You should believe what I said now, right?

721
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,640
Thank you for saving me, Princess.

722
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:41,640
I owe you my life.

723
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,640
The soldiers of the Jingji Battalion

724
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,640
are now under the imperial city.

725
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,640
Mu Wu Yin's beautiful dream of the royal court

726
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,640
will not last long.

727
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,640
Are you willing to join us?

728
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,640
It is not too late to make up for the past.

729
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,520
Fairy ready for the round.

730
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,680
That one.

731
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,220
It is an ideal Chinese wedding now.

732
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:16,120
How did it become a

733
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,120
good-way式?

734
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,200
Are you sure Their Lordship

735
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,520
has decided to become a comfort real quick?

736
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:32,160
The 1986

737
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,680
質疑

738
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,840
It seems she knows her duty8

739
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,040
Bow

740
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,880
You Ésheng

741
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,160
He's the new master.

742
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,800
Yes.

743
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,440
His Majesty hasn't shown up yet.

744
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:18,960
Yes.

745
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,880
Why doesn't His Majesty show up in person?

746
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,480
Get out of here!

747
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,720
Kneel!

748
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,520
Bow down before the Emperor.

749
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,120
Wait!

750
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,120
Wait.

751
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,160
Princess Chengping of the North Court

752
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,960
came to congratulate the third prince

753
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,200
on his enthronement.

754
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,720
Why are the State of Qi so close to each other?

755
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,440
I came without invitation.

756
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,720
You are rude.

757
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,520
Everyone can be expelled.

758
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,160
Your Highness, please calm down.

759
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,680
I have something to tell you.

760
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,480
If you help me solve the problem,

761
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,480
I will leave.

762
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,920
After you take the throne,

763
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,560
you will make the lady next to you the empress.

764
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,920
She is not the daughter of Meng family.

765
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,240
Who is she?
