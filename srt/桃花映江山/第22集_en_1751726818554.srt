1
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,860
I'm tired.

2
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,100
You still have too many pepper venues.

3
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,260
Wait.

4
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,940
I'm doing this just because you want.

5
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:29,600
I'm just

6
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,920
gard.

7
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:49,780
A

8
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:53,380
I can't

9
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:56,980
I want to see

10
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,400
Then

11
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,120
How about you?

12
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,920
Are you okay?

13
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,640
My Lady.

14
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,240
My Lady, something bad happened.

15
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,920
Don't make a fuss in my brother's hall.

16
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,800
Young Master, I'm sorry.

17
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,160
But it's your fault.

18
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,720
I was so anxious that I...

19
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,040
It's about my brother.

20
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,760
Master is going to be the heir.

21
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,280
It's Meng Huai Rui.

22
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,720
His family is far from our family.

23
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,480
Why would father choose him?

24
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,280
I heard that

25
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,800
he sent an article to the court.

26
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,400
His Majesty didn't agree.

27
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,760
He blamed Master for pushing him out earlier.

28
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,960
Master made him the heir.

29
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,320
He?

30
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,240
It's not that important.

31
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,680
It's just a credit to others.

32
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,520
I'm not sure about that.

33
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,520
But the time has been set.

34
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,760
It's going to be held in two days.

35
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,880
And...

36
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,960
Young Master and Li's family

37
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,800
will be taken over by Meng Huai Rui.

38
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,240
After the ceremony,

39
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,000
he'll be dead.

40
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,560
How could Meng Huai Rui marry Sister Ye?

41
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,000
He's a man of the dark.

42
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,920
He's a man of the dark.

43
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,920
My family will be destroyed by him.

44
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,000
My Lady, what should we do?

45
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,720
Father.

46
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,240
Han Yue is Li Zhong Cheng's daughter.

47
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,800
I'm close to her.

48
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,920
Please approve our marriage.

49
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,600
Li Zhong Cheng has been dead for years.

50
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,720
What's the benefit of this marriage to Meng family?

51
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,640
I think

52
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,840
it's because that Li's daughter

53
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,920
is too high to be a concubine.

54
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,240
Father.

55
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,000
Sister Yue's conduct

56
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,520
is very kind to me.

57
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,000
I see it all.

58
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,480
I've been kneeling for three days.

59
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,200
Please approve her marriage.

60
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,840
Three days?

61
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:17,480
Wei Ying,

62
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,880
kindly accept the flying salamander.

63
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,840
Unless

64
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,920
But you knelt and begged for three days and nights for father.

65
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,920
How could you be at ease?

66
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,920
Zhenzhen, today is your birthday.

67
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,920
I will personally make a gift for you.

68
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,920
When Han Yue marries into the manor,

69
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,920
you will not be the only woman in the manor.

70
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,920
By then, you two can have fun together.

71
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,920
My biggest wish in this life

72
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,920
is to see you two happy.

73
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,920
Brother, now that your family has been taken in,

74
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,920
they are not only ungrateful,

75
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,920
but also your childhood sweetheart,

76
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,920
and your engagement.

77
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,920
I will never let them be as they wish.

78
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,920
Miss Mo'er, it's cold outside.

79
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,920
You are weak.

80
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,920
You should go back to your room and rest.

81
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,920
I am so bored staying in the room all day.

82
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,920
And I am the wife of the prince.

83
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,920
Don't I have the right to walk around in this manor?

84
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,920
You are being too serious.

85
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,920
I am also worried that you will catch a cold and catch a cold.

86
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,920
This manor belongs to the North.

87
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,920
Miss, where are you going?

88
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,920
I already told you that I will go around.

89
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,920
That is the kitchen where the kitchen is.

90
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,920
And there are servants there.

91
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,920
In case you will run into them.

92
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,920
It's fine.

93
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,920
I am just looking at what we are going to eat today.

94
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,920
Miss, since you are so in the mood,

95
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,920
I will go inform the prince.

96
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,920
I am tired. I am going back.

97
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,920
Miss Mo'er, time to eat.

98
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,920
Where is Qingfeng?

99
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,920
Qingfeng has some business to attend to.

100
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,920
So she asked me to bring her some food.

101
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,920
What is this?

102
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,920
I have never seen this before.

103
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,920
This is the local seal of the seal.

104
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,920
It is the seal of the seal.

105
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,920
I have never seen this before.

106
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,920
This is the local seal of the seal.

107
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,920
It is very nutritious and good for your health.

108
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,920
I am from the North.

109
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,920
I never eat this.

110
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,920
The people who ordered the kitchen

111
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,920
should prepare me a meal again.

112
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,920
I just made a dish with yellow sprouts.

113
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,920
But I put so much ginger.

114
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,920
Is it because the cook is not satisfied with my ginger?

115
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,920
Miss, please wait.

116
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,920
I will ask the cook to make it again.

117
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,920
Goji berry and pork rib soup.

118
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,920
Roasted duck feet.

119
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,920
Cucumber and walnuts.

120
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,920
Miss, what is wrong?

121
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,920
Did you say something to the cooks?

122
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,920
No.

123
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,920
Then why did they make fun of me?

124
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,920
Dog, tent, person, and city.

125
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,920
What does it mean?

126
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,920
Dog, tent, person, city?

127
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,920
I will make them do it again.

128
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,920
Wait.

129
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,920
Even if you keep an eye on them,

130
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,920
they will not be able to eat.

131
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,920
I have been watching them.

132
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,920
They are already dissatisfied with me.

133
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,920
How can I eat the food I made?

134
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,920
You are also unlucky.

135
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,920
You encountered this kind of thing on your first day of work.

136
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,920
Qingfeng will not blame you, right?

137
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,920
Miss, how can you be assured?

138
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,920
At least let me keep an eye on them.

139
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,920
Okay.

140
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,920
Miss, please.

141
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,920
I want to eat the noodles with water.

142
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,920
Can you make noodles with water?

143
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,920
No.

144
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,920
What kind of sauce do you want?

145
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,920
This lady is...

146
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,920
Miss, I am the cook.

147
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,920
If you want to eat anything, please tell me.

148
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,920
Didn't you say that there are no women in His Highness's mansion?

149
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,920
His Highness is eating the dishes he made in the temple.

150
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,920
He thinks it is very delicious.

151
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,920
So he invited me to his mansion these days.

152
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,920
You can make North Campus dishes?

153
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,920
Miss, my husband used to go to business when he was alive.

154
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,920
He took me to North Campus to do business for a few years.

155
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,920
He learned North Campus dishes at that time.

156
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,920
So that's how it is.

157
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,920
A few days ago, His Highness asked me

158
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,920
if it was convenient to eat here.

159
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,920
So he invited you here.

160
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,920
That's great.

161
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,920
So that he can eat North Campus dishes every day.

162
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,920
Thank you for your consideration.

163
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,920
As long as I am here, I will satisfy your appetite.

164
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,920
But sometimes I also cook in His Highness's mansion.

165
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,920
Stop talking.

166
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,920
Make noodles for her.

167
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,920
Yes.

168
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,920
Bring the noodles here.

169
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,920
I have never heard that His Highness has a mansion.

170
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,920
Maybe Qingtai will be locked up there.

171
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,920
I will check there.

172
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,920
I respect all the ancestors of my parents.

173
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,920
Can I?

174
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,920
Yes.

175
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,920
I raise six children and pick the best family.

176
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,920
Can I?

177
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,920
Yes.

178
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,920
I have already forgotten the past.

179
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,920
I will remember the future.

180
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,920
If I break the promise and make a new one,

181
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,920
I will be punished.

182
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,920
Can I?

183
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,920
Yes.

184
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,920
All the ancestors,

185
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,920
I will write the letter of Liu Ju as the comment.

186
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,920
Please sign the letter.

187
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,920
Wait.

188
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,920
The Meng clan worships the ceremony.

189
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,920
How can you, a girl, be so wise?

190
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,920
Father, I have something to report.

191
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,920
After the death of her father,

192
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,920
she broke the marriage contract with her family.

193
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,920
Now I just want to find another son to support the family.

194
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,920
Why do you stop it?

195
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,920
Father, do you really think Meng Huai Rui can do this?

196
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,920
His Majesty is too lazy.

197
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,920
Why don't you recommend the talent of Meng family to me?

198
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,920
You can make a decision.

199
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:17,920
Now he is the best among the descendants of the clan.

200
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,920
Who else can I choose except him?

201
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,920
Tell me.

202
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,920
You.

203
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,920
If only you can dress like a child.

204
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,920
I can find a priest.

205
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,920
There are many people who can choose.

206
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:48,920
By the way, you and Meng family have broken off the relationship.

207
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,920
It's not appropriate to say this.

208
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,920
I am sorry to make you angry.

209
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,920
From now on, I am willing to change my mind.

210
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,920
I will die with Meng family.

211
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,920
I will be your father's bodyguard.

212
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,920
Do you know what it means to live and die together?

213
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:25,920
I can do what you can do.

214
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,920
Tell me.

215
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,920
Now the crown prince of Wugou is dead.

216
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,920
There are three princes and three ministers.

217
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,920
One of them will be the priest.

218
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:46,920
Father, if you choose the priest, who will you choose?

219
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,920
What do you think?

220
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,920
The third prince.

221
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,920
Why do you make this choice?

222
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:05,920
If the fourth prince is the crown prince, he will change the whole country.

223
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,920
Then the imperial examination will select talents.

224
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,920
And weaken the family.

225
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,920
Maybe his ultimate goal is to eliminate the whole family.

226
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,920
So he can't be chosen.

227
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,920
The second family of Qin, Yu'er is the most vulnerable relative.

228
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,920
Brother and Qin family were against each other.

229
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,920
They hate brother.

230
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,920
We can't let them down.

231
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:38,920
If we run away, no matter how good we do, we may be taken away by the Qin family.

232
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:43,920
But if we make a mistake, the Qin family will be punished.

233
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,920
We will die.

234
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,920
Go on.

235
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,920
I thought about the day before the crown prince died.

236
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,920
I wanted to detain him.

237
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,920
But the third prince was the one who took the throne.

238
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,920
He doesn't care about the state affairs.

239
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,920
But there is a crown prince in Qin.

240
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,920
He is hesitating between the right and wrong.

241
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,920
But he is the right person.

242
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,920
I can rely on him in my dream.

243
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,920
It's reasonable to analyze.

244
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,920
But you did things for the family.

245
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,920
You always have your own thoughts.

246
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,920
I'm afraid you don't agree.

247
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,920
Father.

248
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,920
Please give me another chance.

249
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:39,920
From now on, I won't believe it.

250
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,920
I'm afraid you don't agree.

251
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,920
How can I believe you?

252
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,920
I...

253
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,920
Master.

254
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,920
The elders of the clan are in a hurry.

255
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,920
They are rushing you to finish the ceremony.

256
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,920
Zhen.

257
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,920
You are a woman.

258
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,920
A woman is a natural law.

259
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,920
But you are a man of the heart.

260
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,920
You want to kill and set fire.

261
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,920
Can you do it?

262
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,920
Since you are in a hurry.

263
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,920
Then continue.

264
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,920
Father, don't underestimate me.

265
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:46,920
I have been a man of the heart.

266
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,920
From now on.

267
00:18:53,920 --> 00:19:00,920
I will kill and set fire.

268
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,920
I won't be angry.

269
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,920
Ok.

270
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,920
As you say.

271
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,920
I want to tell you.

272
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,920
The ceremony needs to be discussed.

273
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:35,920
Please go back.

274
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,920
No.

275
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,920
Master.

276
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,920
Didn't you hear the order?

277
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,920
Stop talking.

278
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,920
Yes.

279
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,920
Come.

280
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,920
Don't worry.

281
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,920
About the marriage.

282
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,920
I will choose the one.

283
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,920
I will live in the house.

284
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,920
I will help Meng family.

285
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,920
I will live in the house.

286
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,920
I will listen to you.

287
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,920
But for Meng family.

288
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,920
I will do everything for you.

289
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,920
I will do everything for you.

290
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,920
I will do everything for you.

291
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,920
Leave the report.

292
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,920
Master.

293
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,920
I am the one.

294
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,920
I am the one.

295
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,920
I am the one.

296
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,920
I will help you.

297
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,920
I will help you.

298
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,920
I will help you.

299
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,920
Miss.

300
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,920
Miss.

301
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,920
You.

302
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,920
You.

303
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,920
You.

304
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,920
You.

305
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,920
Yes.

306
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,920
You.

307
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,920
You.

308
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,920
You.

309
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,920
You.

310
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,920
You.

311
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,920
You.

312
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,920
You.

313
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,920
You.

314
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,920
You left Meng family.

315
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,920
Why do you come back?

316
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,920
What happened to you?

317
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,920
I will do nothing

318
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,920
I will go with your brother

319
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,920
Sister Yue, don't worry

320
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,920
For you

321
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,920
and for my brother

322
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,920
I will never let you marry Meng Huai Rui

323
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,920
From now on

324
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,920
you can't have any relationship with the Li family

325
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,920
Do you understand?

326
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,920
The married man and the unmarried woman are not married yet

327
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,920
The family is poor

328
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,920
Can you control it?

329
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,920
If you dare to go to the door

330
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,920
I will deal with you

331
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,920
Besides

332
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,920
you are using other people's articles

333
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,920
You'd better give up as soon as possible

334
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,920
If there is a difference

335
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,920
I will

336
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,920
You

337
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,920
What do you want?

338
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,920
Take your phone

339
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,920
If your father didn't want to marry you

340
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,920
who would marry the Li family woman

341
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,920
Premier

342
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,920
I have been reading the ancient books in the palace

343
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,920
I found a man

344
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,920
who had suffered from this difficulty

345
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,920
He is the son of the Li family

346
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,920
He is the son of the Li family

347
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,920
It's not easy to find such a man

348
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,920
But he is out of mind

349
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,920
and never knows what to do

350
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,920
This disease is rare

351
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,920
Is there really no medicine?

352
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,920
Premier

353
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,920
I'd better go to the mansion

354
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,920
and see your wife in person

355
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,920
It's not too late to be diagnosed

356
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,720
But with smooth magic

357
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,680
Anica

358
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,160
Mrs, now

359
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,720
She is not here

360
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,200
What happened?

361
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,080
You need to date a resident

362
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,560
Test whether

363
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,800
you can restore your mind

364
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,620
Thank you for your不用

365
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,280
Goodbye

366
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,600
Your Highness,

367
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:51,960
Doctor Bai said

368
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,000
Her Highness needs to go back to her mansion.

369
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,680
And the Zengchun Pavilion is still kept for her.

370
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,720
When you asked me to clean up the Zengchun Pavilion,

371
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,600
I didn't throw away

372
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,720
any of Her Highness's things.

373
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,800
I'm sure she'll remember everything

374
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,800
when she comes back.

375
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,200
Zeng Tu hasn't brought the antidote back yet.

376
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,760
Jiang Duhua is the most dangerous.

377
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,200
She almost died.

378
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,400
I can't take her life

379
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,160
as the only way out.

380
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,560
Then,

381
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,560
let Her Highness forget you

382
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,480
just like that?

383
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,440
She can be safe.

384
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,760
That's the best.

385
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:32,800
I don't know

386
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,440
where Her Highness's mansion is.

387
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,240
Qingtan,

388
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,960
you must wait for me.

389
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,280
I'll make the antidote

390
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,960
for His Majesty myself.

391
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,280
Thank you, Eunuch Chen.

392
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,360
Be good and go back to your room right now.

393
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,560
Yes, Your Highness.

394
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,400
I need to leave for say politely.

395
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,720
feature

396
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,520
won't let me go home alive.

397
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,040
acquired

398
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,360
你是

399
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:15,800
Ooh,

400
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,640
so

401
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,040
Don't mind it, Your Highness.

402
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,200
I'll be in charge of the affairs of Meng family.

403
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,480
Miss Meng,

404
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,040
you're taking the blame for your brother.

405
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,440
It seems that Your Highness still has doubts about me.

406
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,480
How about

407
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,360
we make a bet?

408
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,840
Miss Meng is really prepared.

409
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,200
Others are not so free to know that I'm good at chess.

410
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,360
Your Highness,

411
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,680
please.

412
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,080
You want me to be free?

413
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,280
If you lose,

414
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,240
don't say that I'm bullying you.

415
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,800
Don't worry.

416
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,640
But if I win,

417
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,640
if you agree with me,

418
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,960
I'll be 🐆 election leader in the candidates in the mouth of each si I Soup.

419
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,120
We use a bait to keep you away from Uncle Vi Village

420
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,280
and saving the winnings.

421
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,280
But don't let our fleet of 그들

422
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,160
get prepared and jammed together!

423
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,880
Come on.

424
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,680
Form it, Form it!

425
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,920
Leave it to me.

426
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,720
If not,

427
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,320
They almost made me into a sun.

428
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,320
Why don't they cooperate?

429
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:53,320
How dare they make a mess under my eyes?

430
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,320
They think I'm a good man?

431
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,320
How dare they!

432
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,320
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

433
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,320
Why hasn't the minister come back yet?

434
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:08,320
Your Majesty, the pill is here.

435
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,720
Bring it here.

436
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,720
Give me a massage.

437
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,720
Your Majesty.

438
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,720
The pill that Third Brother made is really good.

439
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,720
Little Chen, did you ask him to prepare more pills for me?

440
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,720
Your Majesty, His Highness is not at home.

441
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,720
But the servants at home said that

442
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,720
His Highness had prepared the pill long ago.

443
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,720
I was going to bring it to you tonight.

444
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,720
Let me tell you.

445
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,720
Third Brother is the most filial.

446
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,720
It's a pity that he hasn't been able to go back to his home

447
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,720
because he hasn't been able to get married.

448
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,720
I feel so bad.

449
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,720
Your Majesty, you don't know that

450
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,720
I can see a woman's figure

451
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,720
in Third Prince's mansion.

452
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,720
Did you see clearly who that woman is?

453
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,720
Your Majesty, I didn't see it clearly.

454
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,720
But that woman's appearance is similar to Princess Chengping.

455
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,720
Her temperament is very elegant.

456
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,720
She is very compatible with His Highness.

457
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,720
You dare to hide it in your room.

458
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,720
Little Chen, go back and pass my order.

459
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,720
Bring that woman here and let me see.

460
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

461
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,720
Miss Meng, I've let you go.

462
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,720
I've let you go, Third Prince.

463
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,720
Third Prince.

464
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,720
Meng's daughter is indeed a well-known woman.

465
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,720
Your Highness, since I've won,

466
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,720
you must be careful.

467
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,720
These days...

468
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,720
Third Prince, something happened.

469
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,720
I still have something important to deal with.

470
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,720
Miss Meng, please do as you wish.

471
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,720
I've lost my credit.

472
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,720
Guards.

473
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,720
Yes.

474
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,720
Go and investigate

475
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,720
what happened in Third Prince's mansion.

476
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,720
Yes.

477
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,720
You let me go when someone came to tell me.

478
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,720
Why didn't you wait for me to come back?

479
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,720
His Majesty personally sent someone to look for me.

480
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,720
How could I dare to stop him?

481
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,720
But I've already asked the carriageman in the mansion

482
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,720
to send Princess Chengping to look for her.

483
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,720
She hasn't arrived yet.

484
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,720
If that's the case,

485
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,720
then you go and find a woman

486
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,720
who looks like her

487
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,720
and change her before the palace gates.

488
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,720
Yes.

489
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,720
Excuse me, where are we going?

490
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,720
Miss Meng, don't be anxious.

491
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,720
You'll know when you get there.

492
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,720
Why is this carriage

493
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,720
circling around the city?

494
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,720
Where are they taking me?

495
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,720
Master,

496
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,720
Prince Qi wants to see a woman in Third Prince's mansion.

497
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,720
She's on her way.

498
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,720
I've never heard of a woman in Third Prince's mansion.

499
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,720
According to the news in the palace,

500
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:41,720
that woman looks very similar to Princess Chengping.

501
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,720
Jiang Taohua,

502
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,720
isn't she dead?

503
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,720
It seems that Third Prince doesn't want to see her.

504
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,720
He chose a woman who looks similar

505
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,720
and is chasing her.

506
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,720
There's one more.

507
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,720
It seems that she wants to change her before the palace gates.

508
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,720
I've asked around.

509
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,720
Some time ago,

510
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,720
I went to Third Prince's mansion to visit her.

511
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,720
I also asked to see the woman

512
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,720
who looks similar to Princess Chengping.

513
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,720
Is Jiang Taohua dead?

514
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,720
Whether she's dead or alive,

515
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,720
we'll know in a moment.

516
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,720
Prime Minister,

517
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,720
we just got the news

518
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,720
that Princess Chengping is going to the palace.

519
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,720
But her carriage circled around the city.

520
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,720
It was taken away by someone else

521
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,720
and went to the market in the south of the city.

522
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,720
Brother,

523
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,720
I'm sorry.

524
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,720
I'm sorry.

525
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,720
I don't know what we've been through.

526
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,720
What can I do more

527
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,720
than asking you to die?

528
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,720
I just want to die a little bit more clearly.

529
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,720
Recently,

530
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,720
more and more unidentified corpses in the south of the city

531
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,720
have been coming here.

532
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,720
It's not the winter yet.

533
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,720
It's not.

534
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,720
Slow down.

535
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,720
Slow down.

536
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,720
Slow down.

537
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,720
Jiang Taohua.

538
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,720
The flowers bloom,

539
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,720
without knowing anything.

540
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,720
The beauty of the flowers cannot be ignored.

541
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,720
The flowers fall,

542
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,720
the north wind blows.

543
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:39,720
The city is in a state of panic.

544
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,720
The petals are withered.

545
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,720
The heart is broken.

546
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,720
The flowers fall,

547
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,720
the tears are in the heart.

548
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,720
There is nowhere to go.

549
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:58,720
There is nowhere to go.

550
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:10,720
The wish is struggling in the mud.

551
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:17,720
Regret is dead in despair.

552
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:24,720
The flowers are still in the heart.

553
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:29,720
Even if I have to cut the flowers,

554
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:34,720
I will sing it with my soul.

555
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,720
Who has lost the heart?

556
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,720
Love and hate can only be eaten.

557
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,720
The flowers wither,

558
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,720
the heart is broken.

559
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:04,720
There is no need to tell.

560
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,720
How to love?

561
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:15,720
