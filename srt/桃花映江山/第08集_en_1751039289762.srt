Open all those cabinets.

7
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Don't let go of every corner.

8
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yes.

You were just here for nothing.

11
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I didn't expect you to prepare such a good show for me.

12
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's really wonderful.

13
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Right, third brother?

It's much more than the treasury

18
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,560
Father should be the one to enjoy the fun

19
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,720
Brother, let's go

20
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,040
Let's go

21
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,440
Huaiji, what should we do?

22
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,680
My son and my third brother are not in contact

23
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,400
They suddenly appeared

24
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,160
They must be trying to coerce me

25
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,440
If they tell father about this

26
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,560
what should I do?

27
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,520
Your Highness

28
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,080
Don't panic

29
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,640
For now

30
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,240
we can only give up the plan and destroy the place

31
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,760
Don't worry, I will take care of everything

32
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,760
Go

33
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,320
I've lost track of my bananas

34
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,680
The well must be in very rapid mourning

35
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,600
I can't believe the fire NARRATOR XUE

36
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,000
Yeah

37
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,400
Search this Rotten Image

38
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,600
I really don't want to do this

39
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,520
I am very sick

40
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,520
This fire can't burn the gold and silver

41
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,240
It can only burn the evidence of the past

42
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,240
But the gold and silver in the bank

43
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,240
is a large sum of money

44
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,240
If we leave all of them

45
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,240
we can't expect the consequences

46
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,240
Fortunately, after tonight

47
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,240
the crown prince will stop the fire

48
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,240
It's not a good idea to burn all of them

49
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,240
How are you going to explain to His Majesty

50
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,960
Your Majesty, please explain to His Majesty

51
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,960
His Majesty knows what to do

52
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,960
with such a big deal

53
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,960
Besides

54
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,960
there are two princes who are the witnesses

55
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,960
It depends on how he chooses

56
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,960
It's a long story

57
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,960
You

58
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,960
I was careless

59
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,960
It's not about the situation

60
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,960
Your Majesty, please don't beat my cousin

61
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,960
You are over thinking

62
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,960
You are the most precious thing in the world

63
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,960
What you say is true

64
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,960
What you do is the will of the heaven

65
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,960
How could it be wrong

66
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,960
I will learn from you

67
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,960
and I will be a good father

68
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,960
I will follow your advice

69
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,960
I will follow your advice

70
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,960
I will follow your advice

71
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,960
I will be a good father

72
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,960
I will follow your advice

73
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,960
I will be a good father

74
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,960
Huaijin

75
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,960
was your partner when he was young

76
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,960
He grew up

77
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,960
He is like a silver lining

78
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,960
I'm sorry

79
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,200
You two made a mistake

80
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,840
His Majesty won't deprive you of your right

81
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,960
but will use Meng Family to cut the knife

82
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,520
He is the eldest son of Meng Family

83
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,400
He didn't stop him

84
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,840
and caused the whole Meng Family to be harmed

85
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,600
It's his fault

86
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,560
Uncle

87
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,080
Uncle

88
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,960
My cousin has been weak since he was a child

89
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,600
It's my fault

90
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,080
Don't punish him anymore

91
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,760
If you want him, then hit me

92
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,160
Stop it

93
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,120
Uncle

94
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,600
It's time to leave

95
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,640
Why won't you think about this

96
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,360
for him and the Meng Family?

97
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,600
Do you really think that

98
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,240
your Crown Prince is that helpless?

99
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,800
The Duan Family won't keep up with your advice

100
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,800
Princess Lan of the palace is still in the process of being favored

101
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,200
If she gives birth to more children

102
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,200
and raises them for seven or eight years

103
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,800
the world will change

104
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Uncle

105
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,800
I've seen everything

106
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,800
about what happened today

107
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,800
What should we do?

108
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,000
Sister Huai

109
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,800
Father

110
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,600
Father

111
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,200
We need to make a deal with the nobles

112
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,200
who have been staying in the gambling house for years

113
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
We will definitely go there

114
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,200
Yes

115
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,600
But isn't the gambling house

116
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,200
for the future city?

117
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,400
Wu Gou

118
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,000
The evil money is related to the people's livelihood

119
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,200
If you make a scene

120
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,000
even His Majesty can't escape you

121
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,000
When the crisis is over

122
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,400
we can only catch those nobles

123
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,600
and take them all with us

124
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,600
Only in this way

125
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,200
can they talk for you with all their heart

126
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,000
I will make the people of the gambling house

127
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,400
pay for it

128
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,200
You will

129
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,200
But I think

130
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,200
we should deal with these things first

131
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,800
I've found out that the gambling house

132
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,400
is a big place for the evil money

133
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,000
It's not difficult to find out the source of the evil money

134
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,800
Wu Hen sent you this

135
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,400
Take a look

136
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,000
Your Highness is quick

137
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,000
The most technologically advanced

138
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,000
Let's search his residence

139
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,000
He should never be there

140
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,400
His memorial is cremated

141
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,800
It will be long in search for

142
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,000
the manufacturing of evil money

143
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,600
In just one day

144
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,200
I have a hundred names.

145
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,760
The money

146
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,400
is worth a year's salary.

147
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,520
Even if there are not many people in it,

148
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,480
they will be like a shadow,

149
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,480
watch the fire.

150
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,000
Waiting for them to fall,

151
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,320
they will go to share a cup of tea.

152
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,280
Even if I do them,

153
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,320
maybe in a few years,

154
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,240
there will be a new list.

155
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,120
Like this,

156
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,920
in front of me,

157
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,600
so,

158
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,280
I ask you,

159
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,840
should we

160
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,240
continue to investigate this matter?

161
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,200
His Majesty ordered me to investigate the money.

162
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,440
It's for my reputation.

163
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,560
If it leads to a riot,

164
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,400
I will report it to you.

165
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,760
As for the Crown Prince,

166
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,800
after this matter,

167
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,200
he will be in charge.

168
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,240
Let's stop here.

169
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,800
lobbying

170
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,320
donors

171
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,040
The iron Sword is like a mountain,

172
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,920
yet it has such a pure turn- conversive change.

173
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,160
The Crown Prince is safe,

174
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:34,960
but only got a few

175
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,040
unfeeling mine punishments.

176
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,960
However, according to Meng Family,

177
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,720
hisxture coming from labor

178
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,960
has lost a lot.

179
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,160
But you became the crown prince

180
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,400
so your character

181
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,120
can't be influenced anymore

182
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,920
so this has been achieved

183
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,180
The Qi Dynasty was a團 你 pages

184
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,200
and many other Great Families

185
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,980
havedig��這裡

186
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,920
Today

187
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,680
everyone of the court

188
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,200
are P finalmente

189
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,720
Both having their

190
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,720
birthplace

191
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,560
Although you have

192
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,680
many times

193
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,840
supported Han Men weaning

194
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,360
however

195
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,600
but it can't last long.

196
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,520
This tea is called

197
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,880
Wan Gan Hou.

198
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,840
It's bitter when it's fresh,

199
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,400
and stronger when it's dried.

200
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,360
This tea is for the people,

201
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,880
and it's not easy to pick tea.

202
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:44,960
So,

203
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,360
we have few grains.

204
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,400
It's your wish.

205
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,400
Just tell them to be supplied.

206
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,680
No matter how little,

207
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,280
it's enough for you to use it alone.

208
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,680
The local officials

209
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,120
send three

210
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,880
of them to the palace every year.

211
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,240
The other two

212
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,640
are sent to different places.

213
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,400
Half of them

214
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,360
are sent to the old house.

215
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,800
The others wait for an apology.

216
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,080
Tea with the handles

217
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,080
and the improvement

218
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,560
is not 더 tasty.

219
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,120
Father,

220
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,000
we went to the palace today.

221
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,320
Some of the king

222
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,960
did not punish us

223
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,320
on the matter of Uncle Wei Wang and theósir.

224
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,960
He also sent you to

225
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,960
different families

226
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:47,800
This is the condition that His Majesty has set for the

227
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,360
excommunication of the evil money.

228
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,320
As the head of the Shi family,

229
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,360
Meng family must help His Majesty

230
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,760
to get rid of the evil money.

231
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,320
So, you must not let your stupid cousin's

232
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,160
temper come to you again.

233
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,760
Yes, Father.

234
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,360
But when you see a shadow,

235
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,160
how can you take it back without seeing blood?

236
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,760
The Qian Feng map must still hold a bigger secret.

237
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,960
When everything is clear,

238
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,960
Meng Zhongyan,

239
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,760
what else can you do?

240
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,360
If you agree to save Qingtan,

241
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,360
I will give you the flowers.

242
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,760
Yes.

243
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,760
If you are worried that there are articles in this painting,

244
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,160
you can take it and ask Madam.

245
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,760
After all, in this mansion,

246
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,960
besides me,

247
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,760
only Madam is familiar with this painting the most.

248
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,560
Madam Jiang is quite happy this time.

249
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,760
However,

250
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,360
how do you plan to make me believe

251
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,560
that you are not writing articles in this painting?

252
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,560
It's about Qingtan's life.

253
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,760
I will not use Qingtan's safety to write articles.

254
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,960
Please rest assured, Prime Minister.

255
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,760
If you have no other orders,

256
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,160
I will take my leave.

257
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,160
I will take my leave.

258
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,160
I will take my leave.

259
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,560
Prime Minister, is this real?

260
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,360
I don't know.

261
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:07,600
Why did you give the complete picture of the

262
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,960
Sun and Sunlight Qian Feng to the Prime Minister?

263
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,760
But you only gave the half of the painting to Manager Yang.

264
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,360
I don't know the intention behind it.

265
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:23,860
I can only accept his

266
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,960
but if he finds out the truth,

267
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,560
he can put the whole situation in a dead end

268
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,960
and reject his request.

269
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,960
At that time,

270
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,560
there may be a place to release the matter

271
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,960
to save Changjue.

272
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,160
I will go to the Lan Yi Pavilion later.

273
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,560
Wait for me outside.

274
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,360
If there is any trouble,

275
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,160
you can take action.

276
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,960
Don't worry, Princess.

277
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,960
Prince, don't be anxious.

278
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,160
Prince, please spare my life.

279
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,760
How dare you call me a servant?

280
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,960
What did you say?

281
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,960
I am a servant.

282
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,960
I am a servant.

283
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,960
I am a servant.

284
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,960
I am a servant.

285
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,960
I am a servant.

286
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,960
I am a servant.

287
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,960
I am a servant.

288
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,960
I am a servant.

289
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,160
What did you say?

290
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,560
Please spare my life, Prince.

291
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,360
You call me a servant.

292
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,560
Now you dare to

293
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,160
call me a servant?

294
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,160
No.

295
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,160
What are you waiting for?

296
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,560
Open the window.

297
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,760
Do you want to kill me?

298
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,760
Yes.

299
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,560
Now there are many forces watching this painting.

300
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,600
The portrait of the evil

301
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,560
is hidden in the study.

302
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,760
It looks precious.

303
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,960
I risked

304
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,160
my life to find it

305
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,960
in the study.

306
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,960
You can't forget it.

307
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,760
Why is there only half of it?

308
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,760
The portrait of the evil is very aggressive.

309
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,760
When I heard something,

310
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,360
I put it together.

311
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,160
I only saw so much.

312
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,960
Except for the stamp on the block,

313
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,360
I couldn't see anything else.

314
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,360
After listening to Sister Qing,

315
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,560
I tried to

316
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,360
find it in the study.

317
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,360
I was curious about...

318
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,360
I heard...

319
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,760
This is...

320
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,360
The pattern on the arm...

321
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,360
It's the lady who was gambling with me yesterday.

322
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,440
The back of the

323
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,440
gold and silver

324
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,440
is the crown prince.

325
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,440
Although this matter

326
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,440
is not disclosed to the public,

327
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,160
there is no secret

328
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,560
in the gold and the gold.

329
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,760
What do you want to find out?

330
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,560
I'll think of a way.

331
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:13,560
There is a black mark in the painting.

332
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,960
You go and think of a way to

333
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,960
keep an eye on Shen Zaiye.

334
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,560
See where he has been recently.

335
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,760
Yes.

336
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,760
The antidote for this month.

337
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,760
Who is the culprit?

338
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,760
Who is the culprit?

339
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,760
Go out!

340
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,760
Go out!

341
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,760
Are you mistaken?

342
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,760
We don't have a culprit here.

343
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,760
Yes.

344
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,760
How did the crown prince find me?

345
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,760
Did he find me?

346
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,760
Please, Young Master.

347
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,760
I have to leave here quickly.

348
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,760
Please, Your Highness.

349
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,760
Please, Your Highness.

350
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,960
Post-permissiva, let go.

351
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,360
Theman is a woman of the Shen'sblack Order.

352
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,360
Something major will happen!

353
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:51,080
You are humiliating me in public

354
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,520
This is the etiquette of your Qi

355
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,760
The peach blossoms are beautiful

356
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,760
but the etiquette is shameful

357
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,960
If you think I am guilty

358
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,480
then arrest me

359
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,040
In front of the officials of the civil and military affairs

360
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,360
in front of your father

361
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,280
in front of the people

362
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,600
you can be separated

363
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,240
Qingtan, let's go

364
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:22,640
No

365
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,480
This voice

366
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,120
The last one

367
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,760
is for me

368
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,440
It's him

369
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,640
Catch him

370
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,120
Let Shen Zanyan lose

371
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:33,800
Yes

372
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:37,960
Chase

373
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,200
Qingtan, let's split up

374
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:42,760
Okay

375
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:44,920
Stop

376
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,280
Stop

377
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,400
It's raining

378
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,080
We need to get out of the city before it gets dark

379
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,560
Go after them

380
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,160
Yes

381
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,400
Go

382
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,440
The guards reported

383
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,320
that they searched the whole city

384
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,320
but couldn't find the peach blossoms

385
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,640
If they escaped outside the city

386
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,760
it would be hard to catch them

387
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,880
Hard to catch?

388
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,960
Then what do I have to do?

389
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,400
Should I inform Lord Meng?

390
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,920
My cousin is very thoughtful

391
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,760
I have my own plan

392
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,520
Find more people to go into the mountain

393
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,640
and tell them

394
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,480
If you can't find them

395
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,080
don't come back

396
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,280
They escaped so far

397
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,560
but they still caught up with us

398
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,160
It seems that the crown prince doesn't want to let me go

399
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,920
I have to find a way to distract them

400
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,340
Lord Meng

401
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:16,820
Lord Meng

402
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,300
It celebrated the day the princes went away

403
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,540
Like a reliable empress

404
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,420
Yes

405
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,080
Lord Stop

406
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:39,620
Lord

407
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,280
Open the door, Lord

408
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:41,880
What happened?

409
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,160
tasty

410
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,880
This is you

411
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,240
Get on my feet

412
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,460
Great

413
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,000
take off

414
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,100
I'll take away

415
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,280
I'll take out

416
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,140
on 그런데

417
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,540
let's look around

418
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,780
look around

419
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,780
watch

420
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,220
Stied Gra'm

421
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:37,680
Let's cross a bridge again after reconstitution.

422
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,680
Chief, there are two ways.

423
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,080
Follow me.

424
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,080
The one down there is over there.

425
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,180
ków

426
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:23,580
kan

427
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,160
campaign

428
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,960
��릴게요

429
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,680
I'm not sure.

430
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,560
Life and death are not in our hands.

431
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,200
No.

432
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,280
I must survive.

433
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,440
Zhou Xiao Yan!

434
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,000
Don't fight.

435
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,720
Amazing.

436
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,280
Everyone.

437
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,200
Be careful.

438
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,840
Thank you.

439
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:08,960
Someone's here.

440
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:14,720
Search inside.

441
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,400
Yes.

442
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,720
There's a sound here.

443
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,400
What's that smell?

444
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,800
Is it the sound of a beast?

445
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,440
Forget it.

446
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,440
Nothing.

447
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,160
Let's go over there.

448
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,040
You...

449
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:30,640
No poison.

450
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:31,800
I can't die.

451
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:41,320
Are you here to save the peach blossoms?

452
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,680
Of course not.

453
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,840
I haven't verified the true taste of the painting.

454
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,040
If you die,

455
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,920
the case of the evil money will be investigated from the beginning.

456
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,160
So,

457
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,080
you can't die yet.

458
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:03,680
Indeed.

459
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,880
Only those who have value are worthy of wine.

460
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:08,880
I'm not a man who can't die.

461
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,480
I'm a man who can't die.

462
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,040
I'm a man who can't die.

463
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,520
I'm a man who can't die.

464
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,120
I'm a man who can't die.

465
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,560
I'm a man who can't die.

466
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,920
I'm a man who can't die.

467
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,280
I'm a man who can't die.

468
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,640
I'm a man who can't die.

469
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,040
I'm a man who can't die.

470
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,280
I'm a man who can't die.

471
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,520
I'm a man who can't die.

472
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,760
I'm a man who can't die.

473
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,080
I'm a man who can't die.

474
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,360
I'm a man who can't die.

475
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,640
I'm a man who can't die.

476
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,080
I'm a man who can't die.

477
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,440
I'm a man who can't die.

478
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,760
I'm a man who can't die.

479
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,120
I'm a man who can't die.

480
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,160
Don't think too much.

481
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,040
If you're sick,

482
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,120
I'll use even more strength

483
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,480
to get you out of the jungle.

484
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,240
Don't get sick.

485
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,240
reme

486
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,720
Y后色

487
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,880
Where are you going?

488
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,240
What are you waiting for?

489
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,160
Do you think

490
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,480
a painting of flowers

491
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,880
worth your life

492
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:41,800
and dedication under strike

493
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:48,320
to guard in the outside?

494
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,820
When there is a wet rain

495
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:12,820
The more I look at your heart, the closer you are, the more I miss you.

496
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:19,820
My thoughts are always in the night that I miss you.

497
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:25,820
The more I wake up, the more I'm afraid of losing you.

498
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:29,820
Those simple and ordinary moves,

499
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:33,820
the more I'm afraid of losing you.

500
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:40,820
The more I look at your heart, the more I'm afraid of losing you.

501
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:45,820
Those memories are in the past,

502
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:48,820
and they last forever.

503
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,820
My heart is filled with feelings,

504
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:55,820
and it's so heartless.

505
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:03,820
Prime Minister, are we going back to the manor now?

506
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,820
No.

507
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,820
The Crown Prince didn't find you last night.

508
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:09,820
He will send more men to kill you.

509
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,820
Now you and I are in a tight circle.

510
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,820
We can only show up once.

511
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:17,820
We must wait for reinforcements to come.

512
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,820
The forest is so big.

513
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:22,820
Can Zhan Lu and the others see these signs?

514
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:25,820
As long as they come, they will see.

515
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,820
So many bamboo shoots!

516
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,820
Let's go.

517
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,820
Who are you?

518
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:56,820
Little girl, don't be afraid.

519
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,820
We are not bad people.

520
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:01,820
We are people who go to the mountains to play and get lost.

521
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,820
I scared you just now.

522
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,820
It's our fault.

523
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,820
It rains every day these days.

524
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:08,820
You are noble people.

525
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,820
You won't come here to play.

526
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,820
Get lost? You are a bad kid.

527
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:21,820
Little girl, we did encounter some trouble.

528
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:24,820
I didn't tell you just now because I was afraid of scaring you.

529
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,820
This pendant is enough for you to change many bamboo shoots.

530
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:36,820
Can you take us to your house to get some food?

531
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,820
We will leave as soon as we finish the cleaning.

532
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,820
We won't cause you any trouble.

533
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:52,820
You are young, but you are very cunning.

534
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,820
Little girl, we really don't want to cause trouble.

535
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:00,820
Just make yourself at home.

536
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:04,820
This pendant is enough to make up for the years of your family.

537
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:07,820
You people are so good at pretending.

538
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:10,820
Who knows you will be so rude to us after you leave?

539
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:14,820
If we want to hurt you, do we need to pretend?

540
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,820
My house is in front of us.

541
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,820
You will leave as soon as you finish the cleaning.

542
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,820
Xiao Lian is back.

543
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:41,820
Hello, grandpa.

544
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,820
Hello, grandma Wang.

545
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,820
Xiao Lian is back.

546
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,820
These two are...

547
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,820
These are my guests.

548
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:58,820
Grandma, I am back.

549
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,820
Okay.

550
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,820
You must be very thirsty.

551
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,820
Come and eat.

552
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,820
What is going on?

553
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:09,820
This sister and her husband are lost in the mountains.

554
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,820
I asked them to bring them back.

555
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,820
Please forgive us for being so rude.

556
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:16,820
My husband was bitten by a snake.

557
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:20,820
Please give us some hot water to clean up the wound.

558
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,820
I just got up.

559
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,820
I am so tired.

560
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:27,820
Xiao Lian, don't be rude to our guests.

561
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,820
Who doesn't have a hard time when they are out?

562
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,820
I am sorry.

563
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:38,820
I will use it.

564
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:46,820
Lu, this is the medicine.

565
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,820
It's for your health.

566
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,820
I will take it.

567
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:57,820
Lu, this young man looks like Xiao Lian's brother.

568
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:01,820
I am happy to see him.

569
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,820
You should rest.

570
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:06,820
Xiao Lian, take them to change clothes.

571
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,820
I will cook.

572
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,820
Let's eat.

573
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,820
Okay.

574
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:11,820
Go.

575
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,820
You come with me.

576
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:17,820
My brother is much better looking than you.

577
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:23,820
Come.

578
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,820
Come.

579
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,820
Sit.

580
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,820
Come.

581
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:00,820
The dishes in the farm are not as good as the ones in the city.

582
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:01,820
Please try it.

583
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,820
Where did you get the chicken?

584
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,820
Grandma, you killed the chicken.

585
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,820
You always want to eat chicken.

586
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,820
I am not a chicken.

587
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,820
I am a chicken.

588
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,820
I am a chicken.

589
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,820
I am a chicken.

590
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:18,820
I am a chicken.

591
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,820
You always want to eat.

592
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:22,820
Come.

593
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,820
But we only have this chicken.

594
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,820
We can pay you back.

595
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,820
Okay.

596
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,820
They are injured in the mountain.

597
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,820
They can't eat only the dishes.

598
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,820
Right?

599
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,820
Come.

600
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,820
Come.

601
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,820
Eat more.

602
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,820
Thank you.

603
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,820
You are hungry.

604
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,820
Thank you.

605
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,820
Eat.

606
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:58,820
Come. Eat.

607
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:00,820
No.

608
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,820
You eat this.

609
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,820
Eat.

610
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:09,820
Delicious.

611
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,820
You are so good at cooking.

612
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,820
Really?

613
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,820
Good.

614
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:17,820
Eat more.

615
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:18,820
Come.

616
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:19,820
Xiaolian.

617
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,820
Let me.

618
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,820
Eat.

619
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,820
Let me.

620
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,820
Eat more.

621
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,820
Eat more if it's delicious.

622
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:34,820
Delicious.

623
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:35,820
Really?

624
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:36,820
Don't worry.

625
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,820
I will try my best to get the bamboo shoots.

626
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,820
I will buy chicken for our family.

627
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:41,820
Good.

628
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,820
Good boy.

629
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,820
A bowl of small bones.

630
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,820
Everything.

631
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,820
A fan, a pot, vinegar, rice wine.

632
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,820
Do you have honey?

633
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:54,820
Five?

634
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:55,820
Last time it was two.

635
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,820
Now it's this price.

636
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:58,820
A bowl of small bones.

637
00:40:58,820 --> 00:40:59,820
A fan, a pot.

638
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,820
Everything.

639
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,820
Rice wine.

640
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:04,820
Firewolf.

641
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,820
Everything.

642
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,820
My lady is not like a local.

643
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,820
What do you want?

644
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,820
I will pay for her.

645
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:13,820
Good.

646
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,820
You can buy me with a piece of sugar.

647
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:18,820
What about two?

648
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,820
No.

649
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,820
Take more sugar.

650
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:26,820
Good.

651
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,820
My lady is kind.

652
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,820
I will give you more.

653
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,820
Wait a moment.

654
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,820
I will find you some.

655
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,820
Give it to me.

656
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:37,820
Together.

657
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:38,820
Together?

658
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:39,820
Good.

659
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,820
I will go.

660
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,820
I really don't want it.

661
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,820
You are just staying in my house.

662
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,820
I will eat two pieces of sugar.

663
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,820
It's nothing.

664
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:56,820
Let's go.

665
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,820
Look.

666
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:01,820
There is something wrong with the silver.

667
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,820
My lady, you just finished eating.

668
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,820
Why don't you take a walk in our village?

669
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,820
It's good for your appetite.

670
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,820
Okay.

671
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:11,820
I will go.

672
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,820
Okay.

673
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,820
Look.

674
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,820
Here is the new goods.

675
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:22,820
New goods?

676
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:23,820
Here is the goods.

677
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:24,820
Let me see.

678
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,820
I want this.

679
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:29,820
Good.

680
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,820
You are rich.

681
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,820
Keep it.

682
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:35,820
What do you want?

683
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,820
I want this.

684
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:45,820
What are you doing?

685
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,820
My lady.

686
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:49,820
I am here.

687
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,820
My lady.

688
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,820
I want to see you.

689
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,820
What do you want?

690
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,820
I want to see you.

691
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,820
I want to see you.

692
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:01,820
Go, my lady.

693
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,820
Go, my lady.

694
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,820
Go, my lady.

695
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,820
Go, my lady.

696
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:09,820
You are rich.

697
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:10,820
Yes.

698
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:12,820
There are only a few rich people in the village.

699
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:14,820
In the open field of Wei County,

700
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:17,820
only a few rich people are taking care of the fields.

701
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:21,820
This money is left in the whole village.

702
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:24,820
So I plan to sponsor a few people

703
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:26,820
to figure out the strange things in it.

704
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:28,820
There are only a few rich people in the village.

705
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:30,820
When you go to Xianliang and Taohua,

706
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,820
you can also let them put down some worries.

707
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:37,820
What about you?

708
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:38,820
Me?

709
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:43,820
I naturally have more important things to do.

710
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:52,820
The good wind has come.

711
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:54,820
This time,

712
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:56,820
I must use his order

713
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:58,820
to find out the reason of Qian Feng Poem.

714
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:00,820
I won't let you get up again.

715
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:10,820
The flower blooms, you know nothing

716
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:13,820
The beauty of the flowers cannot be lost

717
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:17,820
The flowers fall, the north wind blows

718
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:21,820
The city is as yellow as a poem

719
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:24,820
The petals are covered with the wind

720
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:27,820
The flowers are covered with the wind

721
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:31,820
The city is as yellow as a poem

722
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:34,820
The petals are covered with the wind

723
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:38,820
The petals are covered with the wind

724
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:42,820
The heart is broken, but the seed is still there

725
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:45,820
The flowers fall, the north wind blows

726
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:51,820
The city is as yellow as a poem

727
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:03,820
The wish is growing in the mud

728
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:10,820
Regret is in despair

729
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:18,820
I still hope that he can hold the flowers in his arms

730
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:30,820
Even if I have to give this flower to the song of the jade bell

731
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:37,820
The flower falls, the north wind blows

732
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:42,820
The city is as yellow as a poem

733
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:45,820
The flower falls, the north wind blows

734
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:48,820
The flower falls, the north wind blows

735
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:53,820
The city is as yellow as a poem
