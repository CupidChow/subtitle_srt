1
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:25,100
Murong Chen's

2
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,080
Orientation

3
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,640
Under the double stories

4
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,400
I, the Prime Minister of Qi,

5
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,840
will never let my sister

6
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,360
make any mistakes.

7
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,520
For the sake of Prime Minister Shen,

8
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,920
Zhao Yu's disaster can be avoided.

9
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,080
But if Prime Minister Shen

10
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,120
doesn't want to discipline his sister

11
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,320
because of his work,

12
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,040
he can send her to my residence.

13
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,040
As long as she listens to me,

14
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,240
I will definitely return to Zhao.

15
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,920
If I don't want to discipline my sister

16
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,760
because of my work,

17
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,480
I won't let you do it.

18
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,360
I won't let you do it.

19
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,760
Catch him!

20
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,800
Prime Minister Shen.

21
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,080
Eunuch Wen.

22
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,040
His Majesty heard that you are going to hold a wedding.

23
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,200
He asked me to pick some good things

24
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,640
from the palace.

25
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,520
Your Majesty.

26
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,760
I'm so flattered.

27
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,640
Your Majesty, you are so kind

28
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,680
to me.

29
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,040
But the jewelry

30
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,880
looks like it's for the unmarried girl.

31
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,080
This gold hairpin was given to me by His Majesty.

32
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,840
Last time I came to the palace,

33
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,960
the little girl was so happy to have Princess Lan.

34
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,320
She said that she has

35
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,760
a beautiful and clever spirit

36
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,480
that good people like.

37
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,680
I see.

38
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,080
But just now, Your Highness,

39
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,800
I saw that Qingying

40
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,160
was so cute and cute.

41
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,480
I want to give her something as a gift.

42
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,120
In that case,

43
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,920
I will thank you

44
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,960
on behalf of my sister.

45
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,320
I didn't expect that

46
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,320
Prime Minister Shen has such a good sense of humor.

47
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,160
Please forgive me.

48
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,800
I'm sorry.

49
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,180
I will go.

50
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,480
I will take my leave.

51
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,600
and learning new skills.

52
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,440
I could help.

53
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,800
The order

54
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,040
no one should be allowed to leave the palace.

55
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:09,800
No?

56
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,000
He is eating happily after he learned from Lei,

57
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,520
I asked him to heat the pack and cooked something,

58
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,600
bringing it back.

59
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,360
Let her see.

60
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,000
I made the pot for him personally.

61
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,240
If he was in my hands,

62
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,080
I'll take it.

63
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,680
Stop.

64
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,080
You're not in the wedding.

65
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,760
Which steamed bun do you want?

66
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,080
You must have had too much wine

67
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,040
and didn't hear it.

68
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,360
It was the bridegroom who told you

69
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,720
to take it before the wedding.

70
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,320
Let me check.

71
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,280
If anything happens,

72
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,760
I'll take full responsibility.

73
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,080
If you don't believe me,

74
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,440
I'll take it back

75
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,760
and tell you.

76
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,240
You're so stingy.

77
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,560
You're the one who's wrong.

78
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,480
Give me the stone box.

79
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,240
Give it back to me.

80
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,040
Give it back to me.

81
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,160
This is

82
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,820
the

83
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,520
Give it to me.

84
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,000
Don't touch it.

85
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,760
It's a thing.

86
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,280
Give it to me.

87
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:29,840
Give it to me.

88
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,440
Don't grab it.

89
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:31,920
Give it to me.

90
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,440
Don't grab it.

91
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,200
Let go of me.

92
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:33,880
Give it to me.

93
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,400
Let go.

94
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,560
Give it to me.

95
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,520
Let go.

96
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,880
Give it back to me.

97
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,720
Don't try to attack me.

98
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,280
Let go.

99
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,640
Let go.

100
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,120
Get out of the way.

101
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,220
Get out.

102
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,240
Go.

103
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,280
Mr. Shen said

104
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,160
I'm so happy

105
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,080
to have you as my wife.

106
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,040
Princess Chengping,

107
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,160
thank you.

108
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,680
This is the cooperation you mentioned.

109
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,160
I saw it clearly.

110
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,560
That King of Fu

111
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,120
was obviously burnt by you.

112
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,680
The family of the Pei Hua

113
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,600
is all dependent on the Prime Minister.

114
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,640
How can he help the Crown Prince?

115
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,320
Besides,

116
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,120
I was really shocked by that horse-drawn cloth,

117
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,720
so I let go of it.

118
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,080
Jiawu Taohua,

119
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,160
is it possible that you have been

120
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,480
acting so smartly for the past few days

121
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,680
that you dare to lie to me in front of me?

122
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,200
Do you think

123
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,400
I can't see it clearly?

124
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,280
If I were dead,

125
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,000
I would never

126
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,240
get that painting.

127
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,680
I...

128
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,280
I forgot

129
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,240
that my wife is always afraid of death.

130
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,720
What are you going to say this time?

131
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,520
Although I'm dead,

132
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,880
I've always

133
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,880
had the ability to forget.

134
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,080
In this world,

135
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,640
I'm still

136
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,560
able to touch that painting.

137
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,360
I'm not afraid of death.

138
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:44,920
But

139
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:45,960
I...

140
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,840
Believe it or not,

141
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,160
I'll try.

142
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,760
So this is your plan.

143
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,640
Hua.

144
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,280
Hua.

145
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:50,840
Hua.

146
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,480
Hua.

147
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,080
Hua.

148
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,880
Hua.

149
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,480
Hua.

150
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,320
Hua.

151
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,040
Hua.

152
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,880
Hua.

153
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,640
Hua.

154
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,320
Hua.

155
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,080
Hua.

156
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,880
Hua.

157
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,680
Hua.

158
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,400
Hua.

159
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,160
Hua.

160
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,000
Hua.

161
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,760
Hua.

162
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,560
Hua.

163
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,240
Hua.

164
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,000
Hua.

165
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,800
Hua.

166
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,600
Hua.

167
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,360
Hua.

168
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,040
Hua.

169
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,800
If you agree to three conditions,

170
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,920
the Sun and the Sun will be drawn in a line,

171
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,360
I'll make it up to you three times.

172
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,080
So this is your plan.

173
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,040
If we cooperate,

174
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,160
we'll be in a tight spot

175
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,080
and lose the advantage.

176
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,680
In this situation,

177
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,520
I don't care about the plan.

178
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,400
And even if I say it,

179
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,600
you won't believe it.

180
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,760
You should be glad

181
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,360
I saw that painting.

182
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,480
I'm willing to negotiate with you.

183
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,360
Tell me.

184
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,200
First,

185
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,680
we should work together

186
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,120
to investigate the case of the Crown Prince.

187
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,240
How do you know the Crown Prince is involved in the case?

188
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,720
Meng family gave up Meng Zhenzhen

189
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,560
and gave the painting to the Crown Prince.

190
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,000
It means there must be

191
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,320
some key evidence in the painting.

192
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,600
And the evidence

193
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,720
is the key that

194
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,120
you can use to support the Crown Prince.

195
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,800
But what does it have to do with you?

196
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,920
Since the Crown Prince

197
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,120
found us on the bed of the Dream House,

198
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,160
without hesitation,

199
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,360
I knew

200
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,480
it was his doing

201
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,080
that made the painting.

202
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,680
Otherwise, it wouldn't be so rough.

203
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,840
There are ten thousand ways to compete with each other in the court.

204
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,120
But he chose the most despicable

205
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,520
and most scary one.

206
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,320
Women are as clear as grass.

207
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,520
I'm willing to live in the dark.

208
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,760
I should take revenge

209
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,480
for all the love and hate.

210
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,200
Second,

211
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,840
take away the private room

212
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,920
arranged by the Prime Minister and Madam

213
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,040
of the Zhengchun Pavilion.

214
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,920
Only the artist Qingtai is allowed to enter and exit.

215
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,640
Third,

216
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,080
from now on,

217
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,480
no matter when,

218
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,800
I will go out to see people,

219
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,840
and I will have visitors.

220
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,800
I can't stop you.

221
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,880
You are here without relatives and friends.

222
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,760
Why do you need visitors?

223
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,240
Why do you need to see people?

224
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,520
I don't have any now.

225
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,520
If I don't go out, I won't have any.

226
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,360
I've been trapped in the Deep Palace for 18 years in the North Court.

227
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,160
I don't want to be trapped in another prison.

228
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,040
You are a man.

229
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,960
You can't understand it.

230
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,200
One painting,

231
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,200
three conditions.

232
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,800
People are like knives, I'm like fish.

233
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,600
Do you like

234
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,120
the feeling of being unable to move on the dark board?

235
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,040
Three conditions.

236
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,760
I understand.

237
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,360
Madam Jiang came to Qi State

238
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,640
with great ambition.

239
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,000
But

240
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,640
what if I don't agree?

241
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,400
Even if you have the ability,

242
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,400
you can't take her away.

243
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,080
I can't let her go.

244
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,880
I can't let her go.

245
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,320
I can't let her go.

246
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,320
I can't let her go.

247
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,320
I can't let her go.

248
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,320
I can't let her go.

249
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,160
You can't open the mind of the peach blossom

250
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,720
and take the painting out.

251
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,480
Do you really think

252
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,400
you can take me away

253
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,280
with just one painting?

254
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,840
As you said,

255
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,840
there are thousands of ways

256
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,040
to fight in the court.

257
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,840
If I let this case go,

258
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,000
I can still find the evidence of the crown prince's death.

259
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,120
Madam Jiang, you think this painting

260
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,720
is the foundation of your life and death.

261
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,880
But you don't know

262
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,880
if I spread the ability

263
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,160
of Madam Jiang to the crown prince,

264
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,120
what will she do?

265
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,400
Think about Xue Ran who buried the painting.

266
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,280
The one who killed her

267
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,800
is still in the Prime Minister's mansion.

268
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,120
Who will be the one to help

269
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,840
Tonight the inventory of things

270
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,400
has reached the person who got the item.

271
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,120
So why does he need it the most?

272
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:18,800
Do you believe

273
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,280
I will tell your answer in public?

274
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,480
Madam17

275
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,560
You ungrateful bastard!

276
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,600
Your Majesty,

277
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,920
Madam,

278
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,200
I have a bad body,

279
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,720
and I'm not good enough

280
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,640
to be with you.

281
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,720
So,

282
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,520
I beg you to leave the hall.

283
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,680
Leave the hall?

284
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,080
I wonder if Father-in-law knows about this.

285
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,520
It's okay.

286
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,240
What Madam used to do

287
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,680
is up to you and me.

288
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,120
I will be ashamed if Madam

289
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,520
is restricted.

290
00:15:36,000 --> 00:16:03,840
The

291
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:11,560
prove夫人 Season 3 Episode 13

292
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:19,880
Madam,

293
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,360
what is that?

294
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,320
This is from the Prince.

295
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,160
He said that it's for you.

296
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,520
I...

297
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,520
Everyone knows

298
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:49,480
it's the wedding day of Princess Shen Xiao and Princess He Qing.

299
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,640
Only you

300
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,320
still remember my birthday.

301
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,800
Father.

302
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,400
Master.

303
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,960
Yes, I am here.

304
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,240
spring

305
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,040
I...

306
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,920
Fourth Highness.

307
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,840
It's you again.

308
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,280
And theértity to make trouble.

309
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,360
She is not competent

310
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,640
in wetting hair today.

311
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,960
982 New Year Film Festival

312
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,640
would have been different than this

313
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:38,680
if I hadn't taken Наiscl

314
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:38,700
the

315
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,100
I wouldn't have taken the

316
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,000
first gift stage.

317
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,680
You

318
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:46,680
are presents

319
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,620
for many men

320
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,540
but you still

321
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,760
spend so much time

322
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,800
cooking refrigerator for yourself.

323
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,600
Qingying,

324
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,320
declined by gifts.

325
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,940
Disapp 되고

326
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,600
As officer,

327
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,600
Prince Yinsi.

328
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:16,840
Actually,

329
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,560
I've had cold dishes.

330
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,320
I also asked people to buy

331
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,000
the porridge that people eat.

332
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,720
Really?

333
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,680
The teacher said

334
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,880
the elder should be in the east.

335
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,920
If you don't eat, you'll get the rice.

336
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,040
The core is the white cabbage.

337
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,280
I just want to try

338
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,080
what people usually eat.

339
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,800
What is it

340
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,440
that you taste?

341
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,160
I can only say

342
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,160
the soup is hard.

343
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,360
I used to think

344
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,760
the rice in the palace

345
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,400
is just a normal food.

346
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,680
But compared to the porridge,

347
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,920
it's sweet and soft.

348
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,520
It's much better.

349
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,800
Miss Xingying.

350
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,800
Miss Xingying.

351
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,800
Where are you?

352
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,520
Oh no.

353
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,840
I'll take advantage of you.

354
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,960
Prince Yinsi is wise.

355
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:24,880
He let Shen Zaiye

356
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,240
hit the water with a bamboo basket.

357
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,400
He deserves it.

358
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,440
I didn't get it.

359
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,520
But Shen Zaiye didn't get it either.

360
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,640
I won this round.

361
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,360
Dong.

362
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,240
Yes.

363
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,240
Here's your reward.

364
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,600
Thank you, Your Highness.

365
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,080
Pass my order.

366
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,160
Put all the money

367
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,840
that's not in the bank out.

368
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:50,960
All of it?

369
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,880
Now it's so cold

370
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,480
and so many are thrown out.

371
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,920
I'm afraid it'll cause a doubt.

372
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,640
No matter how strong the wind is,

373
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,240
it's also the boat

374
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,120
that's breaking the Shen Zaiye.

375
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,920
I just want to show him

376
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,680
who's

377
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,400
the god of Go.

378
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,840
You're playing Go with your dirty wife.

379
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,880
I don't feel any sense of achievement

380
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,080
even if you win.

381
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,360
Give it to Shen Xiang.

382
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,800
He came here this morning

383
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,400
and didn't have breakfast, right?

384
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,200
Thank you, Your Highness.

385
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,320
Shen Xiang.

386
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,560
Do you know

387
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,600
the price of the rice today?

388
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,400
Today's price is 300 silver dollars.

389
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,840
I'm not good at it.

390
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,160
300?

391
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,040
I'm afraid

392
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,960
even this bowl of porridge

393
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,240
is not enough for the common people.

394
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,080
You've checked

395
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,960
the money-making case for months.

396
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,840
The price of rice has gone up.

397
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,120
Now the Mu family is growing.

398
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,640
The common people are suffering.

399
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,520
You should sort out

400
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,440
all the secrets in your hands

401
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,920
and give it to the Crown Prince.

402
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,240
Your Highness,

403
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,680
I've just found some clues.

404
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,120
Please give me

405
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,320
a chance to make a contribution.

406
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,880
Your family's food price

407
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,720
is related to the country.

408
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:44,880
It's not something

409
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,000
you can practice to your heart's content.

410
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,560
I dare not underestimate

411
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,320
the danger of the evil money.

412
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:50,640
One month.

413
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,080
It only takes a month

414
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,960
for me to find out the source of the evil money.

415
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,240
Half a month?

416
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,880
I'll give you half a month.

417
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,080
If you still can't find out the source,

418
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,560
you can ask the Crown Prince

419
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:23,220
to go to the

420
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,080
I can't believe it.

421
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,320
The deadline is coming again.

422
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,720
This flower is very important.

423
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,160
Now only I know the full story.

424
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,080
It's the enemy.

425
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,280
It's also the Cui Ming's Mansion.

426
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,320
If we give it to the Prime Minister,

427
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,640
he might kill us.

428
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,840
If we give it to Yang Wanqing,

429
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,280
if the Prime Minister

430
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,840
knows this flower is spreading,

431
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,600
I can't escape death.

432
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:51,920
So

433
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,680
if we can find out

434
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,920
the source of the evil money,

435
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,960
we can talk to them.

436
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,280
So, Qingtai,

437
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,800
you have to figure out a way to sneak out

438
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,320
and go to the book shops

439
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,920
to find out the source of the seal.

440
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,360
It's dangerous sometimes.

441
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,360
Be careful.

442
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,440
Go.

443
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,400
The flower was destroyed.

444
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,160
The Crown Prince's behavior is getting more and more rampant.

445
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,400
Even the street vendors

446
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,720
are not aware of the evil money.

447
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,080
If we follow the traffic channel in the market

448
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,520
and find out the source of the evil money,

449
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,840
I'm afraid that...

450
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,320
It's so dangerous to let go.

451
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,520
Those shops can only

452
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,880
use their heads to cover the accounts.

453
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,520
The goods from the shops

454
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,920
can't be produced by the screen.

455
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,480
They can only be used to make money.

456
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,440
If we follow this direction,

457
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,200
we can focus on

458
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,320
those rich and fast drug dealers.

459
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,640
This method is possible,

460
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,480
but it still takes a lot of time.

461
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,920
If we want to find out the source of the evil money,

462
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,800
we still need that painting.

463
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,560
We can only agree to

464
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,960
three conditions of his painting.

465
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,040
But this woman is cunning.

466
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,880
We can't put all the money on her.

467
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,640
Prime Minister, there's one more thing.

468
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,240
According to the report from the servant of Zhengchun Pavilion,

469
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,040
Qingtai started to enter

470
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,840
all the drug shops in the money shop last morning.

471
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,840
It seems that they are investigating something.

472
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,080
Finally, they entered the gold and silver drug shop

473
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,360
and never came out again.

474
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,120
I knew she wasn't a safe person.

475
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:27,800
Keep watching.

476
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,600
Yes.

477
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,720
Gold and silver drug shop.

478
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,360
It seems that I have to go.

479
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,520
Prime Minister,

480
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,280
I have something important to see you.

481
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,000
Madam Jiang broke into the study at night

482
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,080
to inform me.

483
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,160
You told me the secret of the case

484
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,200
to tell Qingtai

485
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,240
and let her go out of the mansion to investigate.

486
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,520
But she ran away.

487
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,640
She must have been in danger.

488
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,800
It means

489
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,600
there's something wrong with the place she went to.

490
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,120
As long as we can find Qingtai,

491
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,000
we can find the clue to this painting.

492
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,080
In this case,

493
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,640
I should thank you two.

494
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,360
It's Taohua's fault

495
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,840
to give the painting to you at the first time.

496
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,680
As long as you are willing to send someone to find Qingtai,

497
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,320
I am willing to restore the painting

498
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,280
and restore it to you.

499
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,800
What about the three conditions?

500
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,480
As long as we can find Qingtai,

501
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,760
Taohua will take back the three conditions.

502
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,040
It sounds good.

503
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,720
If I put it in yesterday,

504
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,240
I might be hard.

505
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,440
It's a pity that

506
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,440
Madam Jiang is not greedy enough to swallow the painting.

507
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,680
That painting is the painting of yesterday.

508
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,680
I don't need it.

509
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,120
Zhan Lu,

510
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,120
send her back.

511
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,520
Madam Jiang, please.

512
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,960
It seems that I have to find another way.

513
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,760
Qingying is really a heroine who has been through a lot.

514
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,200
She has seen a lot of things.

515
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,520
We women in the back are incomparable.

516
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,760
You are right.

517
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,040
Except me,

518
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,480
I'm afraid there are not many noble ladies who can know it.

519
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,440
This is the symbol of the gold and silver gambling house.

520
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,520
Do you know the gold and silver gambling house?

521
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:30,800
Please give me a lesson.

522
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,440
I have heard my brother...

523
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,360
No.

524
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,920
My friends on the street mentioned that

525
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,240
the gambling house is called everything can be gambling.

526
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,360
From the most ordinary gold and silver concubines

527
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,800
to the real estate of the land,

528
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,040
even the innocence of the official women of men,

529
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,920
as long as you can afford to make others willing to gamble,

530
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,200
you can gamble.

531
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,920
But I have been in Yujin for a while.

532
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,720
Why has this feng shui treasure land never been mentioned?

533
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,280
Sister,

534
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,600
are you not hearing the small news from somewhere?

535
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,400
How is that possible?

536
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,040
That gambling house is said to have a big mission.

537
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,240
If you want to enter, you can only ask the bookseller to introduce you.

538
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,280
The poor people are so poor that they take you to play.

539
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,920
Otherwise, ordinary people like us can't enter at all.

540
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,320
Then why don't you go with me to see it?

541
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,200
Let's go.

542
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:22,920
No.

543
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,160
If you want to go,

544
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,000
why don't you ask my brother to take you?

545
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,560
You asked me to take you in the middle of the night.

546
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,160
There must be something wrong with you.

547
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,200
It's true that I can't escape from my sister's eyes.

548
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,120
I can bet with my maid Qingtai

549
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,200
that she can't find out the truth.

550
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,760
So she sneaked out

551
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,000
to find out the pattern.

552
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,040
But she hasn't come back yet.

553
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,920
I wanted to go to her,

554
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,720
but I didn't dare to tell you.

555
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,800
I'm afraid that if you know it,

556
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,680
Qingtai will be the most suspicious.

557
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,320
I'm just a weak girl.

558
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,080
Let alone going to the gambling house,

559
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,200
I can't even get out of the door of the Prime Minister's Mansion.

560
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,720
If you can take me to the gambling house,

561
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,000
I'll take you out of the mansion.

562
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:14,640
Deal.

563
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:17,560
Deal.

564
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,240
What's your way to get in?

565
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,840
I have my own trick.

566
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,440
It's not the first time I've been a maid.

567
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,720
We can definitely get in.

568
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,000
Why is it so high?

569
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,760
Come on. Come up.

570
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,000
Pull me.

571
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,320
How is it? Did you get out?

572
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,280
Am I great?

573
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,960
You're really a blind girl.

574
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,920
You're so annoying.

575
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,960
You're going to break into the underworld.

576
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,680
You still have to see who's the real one.

577
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,280
Stop.

578
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,520
Where are you going to break into

579
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,320
the house of the Prime Minister's wife?

580
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,280
Save her.

581
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,280
You go first. I'll wait.

582
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,280
Go.

583
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,920
You're so stupid.

584
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,760
You're being sold and you're still counting money.

585
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,720
Brother, you don't understand.

586
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,920
That's our strategy.

587
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,760
Do you know the strategy?

588
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,240
Chase the horse, Xiang Yan.

589
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:10,840
Don't worry.

590
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,720
I'll go with you.

591
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,320
She can't enter the casino.

592
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,680
Stay in the mansion.

593
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,600
Let's go, Miss Yu.

594
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,400
Come on, come on.

595
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,160
That will make me happy once I win the pool.

596
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,000
You crunched it too much.

597
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,840
Come on.

598
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,600
Come on.

599
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:33,880
Come on.

600
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,240
You're crazy.

601
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,480
You're crazy.

602
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,520
You are unusual.

603
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,080
You're a East Indian woman.

604
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,240
Exactly.

605
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,640
Temp fast night experience

606
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,000
Relaxation

607
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,200
Xiuying

608
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:59,160
This is a stage created for

609
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,960
Spiriting

610
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,540
Just like those

611
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,540
to move forward.

612
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,460
The second floor is the luxurious gambling house.

613
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,060
The gambling house is also a place for the rich.

614
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,820
It's not a place for the rich.

615
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,660
And the third floor is even more beautiful.

616
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,380
No entry and exit is forbidden by the gambling house.

617
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,940
I'm sure the green screen is locked on the third floor.

618
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,020
I have to figure out a way to open the third floor.

619
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,420
Stop! Stop!

620
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:44,940
Give me a glass of wine!

621
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,580
The time is eight o'clock!

622
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,020
advisors

623
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:28,920
will die if they lack many info on whether the

624
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,060
blind man usually hits the target.

625
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,580
It seems to have been in Shen Zaiye's study.

626
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,020
It must be the incense from Mount Bosan.

627
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,980
It must be the Yin and Yin.

628
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,900
He must have come here quickly.

629
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,420
Zhang Wanxi

630
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:03,460
Start on 4pm.

631
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,280
Get on the horse and let your choices be made!

632
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,680
This visitor wins!

633
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,800
Great plan,

634
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,040
a bit simpler this time.

635
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:12,880
Take crock disturbance.

636
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:13,620
Good.

637
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:30,860
But after the fight,

638
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,260
the slight situation

639
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,620
was just too shocking andomatic.

640
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,420
Listen,

641
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:55,200
go to the

642
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,320
I'm going to watch.

643
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:01,280
Little, little, little.

644
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:12,640
Little, little, little.

645
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,240
Stop.

646
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,520
This guest is won.

647
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,400
I quit.

648
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,000
You are so talented today.

649
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,120
What's the next game?

650
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,760
I quit.

651
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,360
I'm afraid you'll be sorry if you win again.

652
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,600
These are for you.

653
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,120
These are for me.

654
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,120
Thank you, sir.

655
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,360
I changed the gold for the silk.

656
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,320
Why is it silver now?

657
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,040
It's the first time, sir.

658
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,360
We have rules.

659
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,360
No matter what the exchange rate is,

660
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,680
the one who takes it can only be silver.

661
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,760
Silver is silver.

662
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,760
Your silver is not right.

663
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,040
Although this silver has an input from the official silver,

664
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,200
but the official silver is one silver.

665
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,880
We only give three.

666
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,520
You still make money.

667
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,680
I see.

668
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,840
This gambling house is the source of the money.

669
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:32,120
The money is used to exchange the money.

670
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,120
The official silver will be kept by the crown prince.

671
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,040
It seems that a lot of money

672
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,040
must be hidden in this gambling house.

673
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,720
There is no guest on the third floor.

674
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:47,200
I have to find a way to go up.

675
00:34:53,160 --> 00:35:20,480
The

676
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,480
The room is so dark.

677
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,480
The reception table might be locked here.

678
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,480
Who's there?

679
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,480
The client lost money and was very angry.

680
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,480
He said he was going to pay for the room.

681
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,480
He said he was going to pay for the room.

682
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,480
He said he was going to pay for the room.

683
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,480
He lost money and was very angry.

684
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,480
I...

685
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,480
I don't dare to go there.

686
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,480
This is not a place you can hide.

687
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,480
Let's go.

688
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,480
Yes.

689
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,480
As I expected.

690
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,480
This secret room should be the place where the money is hidden.

691
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,480
Hurry up.

692
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,480
Did the owner ask you to move the money?

693
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,480
It will be done soon.

694
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,480
Close the door.

695
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,480
It seems that to enter the secret room,

696
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,480
it must be obtained by this jade pendant.

697
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,480
It's Shen Zai Yin.

698
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,480
He hasn't left yet.

699
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,480
It seems that tonight,

700
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,480
like the peach blossoms,

701
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,480
nothing is obtained.

702
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,480
Jiang Taohua.

703
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,480
The flower bloomed, without knowing,

704
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,480
the beauty of the flower can't be ignored.

705
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,480
The flower falls, the north wind is blowing,

706
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:27,480
the city is in a state of panic.

707
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,480
The petals are withered,

708
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,480
the heart is broken.

709
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,480
The flower falls, the tears fall,

710
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:41,480
the heart is broken.

711
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,480
The flower falls, the tears fall,

712
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,480
the heart is broken.

713
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:50,480
There is nowhere to report.

714
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:03,480
The wish is struggling in the mud.

715
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:10,480
Regret is killing in despair.

716
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,480
He still hopes

717
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,480
under the auspicious flower,

718
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,480
it is Они have worsted.

719
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:21,480
Even if we have to comfort flowers,

720
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:26,480
we Karl overwhelming it with Infinity Falls.
