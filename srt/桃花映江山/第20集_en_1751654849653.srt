The Long Ballad

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,000
Princess.

4
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,080
Princess, you're finally awake.

5
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,280
Come on.

6
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,840
I've been scared these days.

7
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,000
I was afraid you'd fall asleep.

8
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,760
Princess, that's Mount Yuguai.

9
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,600
Falling from Mount Yuguai

10
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,520
can save lives.

11
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,880
Mount Yuguai?

12
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,160
Is it the mountain we met

13
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,440
on our way to the wedding?

14
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,040
Wedding?

15
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,200
Isn't it...

16
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,800
Miss Xingta.

17
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,400
Doctor Lin is here.

18
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,840
Doctor Lin.

19
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,080
Doctor Lin.

20
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,720
Show my princess.

21
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,920
Little lady.

22
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,560
You're finally awake.

23
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,240
The pulse is also stable.

24
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,960
Congratulations.

25
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,920
Thank you, doctor.

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,680
Doctor Lin.

27
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,120
My lady is weak.

28
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,640
Look carefully.

29
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:05,200
Pre-classical investigation in the history will be hold in 3 days.

30
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,240
Are you expedient

31
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,400
Is this a counter- expedition?

32
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,920
Yes.

33
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,240
You.

34
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,320
Your Highness.

35
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,760
The bayonet which please His Highness

36
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,400
caught warm.

37
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:49,400
Perhaps she had the souvenir in the

38
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,840
Thank you, your highness

39
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,440
I know you are in a bad mood.

40
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,440
You need to rest well.

41
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,520
You can't be too hard on yourself.

42
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,640
I'll prescribe a prescription

43
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,320
and take a few pills before I check it.

44
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,400
Miss Qingtai,

45
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,360
aren't you going to

46
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,240
go with Doctor Lin to get the medicine?

47
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,640
There are many medicinal materials

48
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,560
in the medicine box.

49
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,160
You should bring them here.

50
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,480
I'm not leaving.

51
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,120
I want to stay with the princess.

52
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,040
Stop talking nonsense.

53
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,880
Are you asking me to go there myself?

54
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,520
Go ahead, Qingtai.

55
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,120
My lady,

56
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,840
you've wasted so much money

57
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,840
to save your life.

58
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,200
Thank you for your concern.

59
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,360
How do you know I'll spare your life?

60
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,840
Sher...

61
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,320
How did you know I want revenge for DOK 종?

62
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,480
Bon prophets in the Wei Family

63
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,960
are often rejected by envoys.

64
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,160
According to official literature,

65
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,760
sacrificing fly- 막i

66
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,400
proves that

67
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:05,900
part of the students

68
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:19,260
is�� Tapu

69
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,260
If you didn't marry the Prince,

70
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,260
how could you live in the Prince's mansion?

71
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,260
We are not married.

72
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,260
We are waiting for the Prince to decide the wedding date.

73
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:44,260
Since you came into the mansion,

74
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,260
I gave you the name of Meng'er.

75
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,260
Meng'er?

76
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,260
You don't like it?

77
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,260
How could I?

78
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,260
It's my fortune to give you the name.

79
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,260
Then, let's call each other by that name.

80
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,260
I understand.

81
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,260
I really want to marry you.

82
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,260
You really want to marry me?

83
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,260
Take care.

84
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,260
Your Highness is really good at it.

85
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,260
It's better than sitting in the hall and listening to...

86
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:48,260
This is a gift for you.

87
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,260
Have you seen this woman?

88
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,260
This woman looks familiar.

89
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,260
Look again.

90
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,260
Is there this woman in the Third Prince's mansion?

91
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,260
Your Highness,

92
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,260
I remember now.

93
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,260
This woman looks like the woman in the Third Prince's mansion.

94
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,260
But her beauty and temperament...

95
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,260
are a little less than the one in the painting.

96
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,260
Come.

97
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,260
Dr. Lin,

98
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:28,260
I offended you just now.

99
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,260
Take this.

100
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,260
Thank you.

101
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,260
Since you know the Prime Minister's name,

102
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,260
you should know that he has always been a man of his word.

103
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,260
Today, I was asked about it.

104
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,260
No one asked me anything.

105
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,260
Enough. You can go now.

106
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,260
Prime Minister,

107
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,260
why don't you ask about the specific situation of the Princess?

108
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,260
This person looks like someone who is too loyal to his orders.

109
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,260
If you ask too much, it will be troublesome.

110
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,260
Remember that she is here.

111
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:56,260
Send the invitation by the usual way.

112
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,260
It won't be too late.

113
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,260
Yes.

114
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,260
Your Highness,

115
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,260
what are you going to do?

116
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,260
From today on,

117
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,260
the one in my mansion,

118
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,260
will be Miss Meng.

119
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,260
She is my wife.

120
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,260
As her maid,

121
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,260
you should be careful

122
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,260
when you speak in the future.

123
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,260
You can't let her doubt you.

124
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,260
Who will believe such lies like you?

125
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,260
Miss Meng believes it.

126
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,260
Princess.

127
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,260
What happened to her?

128
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,260
What happened to her?

129
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,260
I asked Qing Feng

130
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,260
to prepare a room for you.

131
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,260
Every day in the future,

132
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,260
you should serve her three meals a day.

133
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,260
You should go in and stay with me.

134
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,260
Otherwise,

135
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,260
you should have seen

136
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,260
the antidote of the peach-tree pill.

137
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,260
You...

138
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,260
Don't talk.

139
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,260
Otherwise, Miss Meng

140
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,260
will die.

141
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,260
Miss Qing Tai.

142
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,260
Please.

143
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,260
I'll take you to the room.

144
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,260
This time, it's very dangerous.

145
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,260
If I fail,

146
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,260
Princess.

147
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,260
Send me to the Third Prince's mansion.

148
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,260
Third Prince?

149
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,260
You must be mistaken.

150
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,260
It should be the Fourth Prince's mansion.

151
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,260
I'm sorry.

152
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:02,260
I'm sorry.

153
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,260
I'm sorry.

154
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,260
If I fail this time,

155
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,260
I'll do whatever I can.

156
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,260
I'm afraid the Fourth Prince can't protect me.

157
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,260
I can only bet on the Third Prince.

158
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,260
So,

159
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,260
I must go to the Third Prince's mansion.

160
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,260
Princess.

161
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,260
You just escaped from the prison.

162
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:26,260
And you jumped into the fire pit.

163
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,260
You're so stupid.

164
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,260
You're so stupid.

165
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,260
You're so stupid.

166
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,260
You jumped into the fire pit.

167
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,260
What do you want to do?

168
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,260
Your Highness.

169
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,260
You're so clever.

170
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,260
Qing Tai did come to the room.

171
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,260
She's just a maid.

172
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,260
She doesn't need to be afraid.

173
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,260
She contacted you?

174
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,260
What about the antidote?

175
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,260
Before the Lan Yin Pavilion was searched,

176
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,260
I was afraid that I would find the antidote.

177
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,260
So I went to search.

178
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,260
I was afraid that I would find the antidote.

179
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,260
I was afraid that I would find the antidote.

180
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,260
I was so careless.

181
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,260
Your Highness.

182
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,260
The princess of the North Court

183
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,260
really inherited you as the Prime Minister.

184
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,260
I think it's a little strange.

185
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,260
If she dares to say such a thing,

186
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,260
she won't live to this day.

187
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,260
I think she's seriously injured.

188
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,260
I think she's seriously injured.

189
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,260
She's seriously injured.

190
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,260
What if she wakes up one day

191
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,260
and remembers something she shouldn't remember?

192
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,260
What should she do?

193
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,260
Your Highness.

194
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,260
If she doesn't tell me if Yang Wanqing's death

195
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,260
is related to her,

196
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,260
and she sees the light as her spy,

197
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,260
then she's just a useless concubine.

198
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,260
A useless concubine is good

199
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,260
but she can also be a great concubine.

200
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,260
but she can also be a great concubine.

201
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,260
Then do you want to report this to Her Highness?

202
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,260
No need.

203
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,260
Her Highness is waiting for

204
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,260
all the incidents of the Lan Yin Pavilion.

205
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,260
If she doesn't even say this,

206
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,260
what if she's angry?

207
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,260
Angry?

208
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,260
Then what's the difference

209
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,260
between Yang Wanqing and me in her heart?

210
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,260
Then what's the difference between Yang Wanqing and me in her heart?

211
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,260
If she's angry,

212
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,260
then she'll personally come to me

213
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,260
and ask me for forgiveness.

214
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,260
I'll explain it to her in person.

215
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,260
Your Highness,

216
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,260
Prime Minister Shen sent someone to send a invitation.

217
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,260
She went back to my Lan Yin Pavilion.

218
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,260
I haven't even

219
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,260
settled my score with her.

220
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:50,260
She came to the door

221
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,260
herself.

222
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,260
Tomorrow,

223
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,260
I'll go to the Palace of Purity.

224
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,260
Yes.

225
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,260
Go.

226
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,260
The Palace.

227
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,260
Miss Meng'er,

228
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,260
why did you wake up?

229
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,260
Qingtai,

230
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,460
I am not a dreamer in this mansion.

231
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,060
It's true.

232
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:45,780
Sit down.

233
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,900
Let's eat first.

234
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,300
I have fried eggs today.

235
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,340
The medicine is ready.

236
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,540
Remember to take it after you eat.

237
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,300
If there's nothing else,

238
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,500
I'll go now.

239
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,340
Qingtan.

240
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,420
What's wrong?

241
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,820
The Third Prince saved the girl.

242
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,740
I want to do something reasonable

243
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,020
to repay the favor of the Third Prince.

244
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,340
I've been helping in the Lian Dan's room

245
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,460
for the past few days.

246
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,820
If there's nothing else,

247
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,780
I'll go now.

248
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,740
The Third Prince?

249
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,300
Qingtan is a very unusual person.

250
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,860
It's not as simple as he said.

251
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,180
If it's not,

252
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,060
what does Qingtan want to tell me?

253
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,220
Miss Meng.

254
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,180
You're here.

255
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,340
Thank you for the reward.

256
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,780
I like it very much.

257
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,620
You?

258
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,940
You're pretending to like it.

259
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,940
You're kidding.

260
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,380
I'm flattered.

261
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,060
How can I pretend to like it?

262
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,340
How about

263
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,780
I send you back to the North Court?

264
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,820
After all, it's better to be at home.

265
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,620
A'Jie!

266
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,500
Changquan!

267
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,340
Changquan!

268
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,380
A'Jie!

269
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:44,660
A'Jie!

270
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,180
If you're worried about the younger brother,

271
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,780
you should do your best

272
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,540
in Qi.

273
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,260
Your Highness.

274
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,500
Although we haven't got married,

275
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,940
in my heart,

276
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,380
I'm already yours.

277
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,420
If I did something wrong,

278
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,860
please give me some advice.

279
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,860
I'm willing to follow you forever.

280
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,060
It sounds like

281
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,980
you're deeply in love with me.

282
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,740
But have you forgotten

283
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,460
why we're engaged?

284
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,460
I haven't recovered yet.

285
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,780
I can't remember

286
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,380
what happened after I came to Qi.

287
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,220
You can't remember or you don't dare to admit it?

288
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,220
Since you came to Yujing City,

289
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,820
you've been having an affair with a man.

290
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,940
You're so mischievous

291
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,380
that you've caused a ruckus in the city.

292
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,260
You're so shameless.

293
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,420
Princess Changping,

294
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,140
where did you put

295
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,060
my face?

296
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:51,940
Your Highness,

297
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,780
I was framed.

298
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,020
I'm Princess Changping of the North Court.

299
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,860
I came here for the good of our two countries.

300
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,860
I won't do anything ridiculous.

301
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,540
Please forgive me.

302
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,980
I knew it.

303
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,540
So,

304
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,100
I told you

305
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,740
so many good things

306
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,980
before I came here.

307
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,260
Thank you for your trust.

308
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,060
I'm so embarrassed in Qi.

309
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,620
I'm so lucky

310
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,860
to have you as my mistress.

311
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,060
I'm so sorry.

312
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,380
Don't say it too slowly.

313
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:31,780
Tell me,

314
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,420
if that man comes to you again,

315
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,420
will you still find him?

316
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,700
Absolutely not.

317
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,260
He has hurt me once.

318
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,420
If he dares to show up again,

319
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,340
I'll break him into pieces.

320
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,100
No way.

321
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,020
If you break him into pieces,

322
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,780
I'll be in trouble.

323
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:59,060
Meng is staying in the mansion.

324
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,580
I'm sure

325
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,500
I won't have a chance to see him again.

326
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,100
Please rest assured.

327
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,900
He's powerful and powerful.

328
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,260
He's a man of the court.

329
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,900
He'll do anything to achieve his goal.

330
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,660
If he insists on seeing you,

331
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,380
I'm afraid I can't refuse him.

332
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,220
You mean...

333
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,020
He's just playing around.

334
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,860
And then he's joking

335
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,540
about nothing.

336
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,700
You should

337
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,260
find some face

338
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,260
for your fiancee, right?

339
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,060
Yes.

340
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,740
Don't worry, Your Highness.

341
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,700
I won't let you down.

342
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,020
But...

343
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,100
I really can't remember

344
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,780
who that man is.

345
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:53,700
Left Prime Minister Shen Zaiye.

346
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,660
Xi Ke,

347
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:33,540
why did you

348
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,820
haunt my place?

349
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,520
I heard that a woman

350
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,060
stays in Your Highness's mansion.

351
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,220
But GUANлуOu

352
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,360
is missing,

353
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,700
so step by step.

354
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,180
I come here today

355
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:50,900
Does Prime Minister Shen mean that I drank repunt on purpose.

356
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:55,060
Your Highness, don't rush to blame yourself for your crime

357
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:59,200
Such an unexpected crime why stifle the people of the different countries

358
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,580
we must hold its own事

359
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:07,020
I don't know who planned this

360
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,480
and gave me this illusion

361
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,420
There's no one� going into the Serene Manor

362
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,420
It's normal for you to hide this for more than a month

363
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:18,020
and show your face.

364
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,220
Why don't you

365
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,700
ask the princess to come out and see her first?

366
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,220
As for the other things,

367
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,220
we can discuss them.

368
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:29,740
Qin Feng,

369
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,820
bring Miss Meng here.

370
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,220
Yes.

371
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,220
Great!

372
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:58,700
Here!

373
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:12,580
Your Highness,

374
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,580
You want to be petty?

375
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,420
Nonsense.

376
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,220
Did I tell him that you want to see him?

377
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,100
Go and call Miss Meng'er here.

378
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:22,460
No need.

379
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,300
I'm just being petty.

380
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:26,940
Just let him be.

381
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:31,620
Prime Minister.

382
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,340
You're so patient.

383
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,820
I heard that the tea from His Highness' mansion is sweet and sweet.

384
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,580
It's rare for me to have a chance to taste the tea here.

385
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,820
It's a special taste.

386
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,780
You're right.

387
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,780
It's a special taste.

388
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:10,780
This...

389
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,380
Your Highness.

390
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,140
The young lady has finally woken up.

391
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,380
So?

392
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:30,580
Where is she?

393
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,540
The young lady said that she wanted to see an important guest.

394
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,220
So she wanted to dress up.

395
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:35,780
Come.

396
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,980
I saw her.

397
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,620
She's wearing powder.

398
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,740
I don't think I can recognize her later.

399
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:45,540
Let her come here directly.

400
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,140
Don't worry, Your Highness.

401
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,540
Just do as she says.

402
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:51,860
Prime Minister.

403
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,420
You're busy with work.

404
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,740
If you keep waiting,

405
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,420
I'm afraid you'll delay the official affairs.

406
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,460
It's about peace between the two countries.

407
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,380
I'm patient enough.

408
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,220
You're really

409
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:10,060
caring for the country and people.

410
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,540
If we don't

411
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,820
slowly decode the official affairs here,

412
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:45,760
her stuff will be

413
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,460
less powas akin to me.

414
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,540
falling in love with beauty

415
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,860
will save two classmates.

416
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,940
It's like you're afraid of height.

417
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,660
It's for the sake ofETD.

418
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:00,860
Prime Minister.

419
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,660
It's your official house

420
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,100
that you're still watching this day.

421
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,620
I deserve to be punished for my misdeed

422
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,260
Your Highness, please don't be angry. I'm coming

423
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,860
I haven't seen you for a long time

424
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:09,780
Your Highness

425
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,140
Jiang Denghua

426
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,860
Long time no see

427
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,860
Your Highness

428
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,940
Please don't overwork it

429
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,380
Because Q 한번

430
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,980
L Birth once

431
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,980
First time

432
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,260
First time

433
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,220
Since I came to your house

434
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,420
My name has been Meng Er

435
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,300
Please?

436
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,040
Most important is,

437
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:15,620
in order to protect their secret for such a long time,

438
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,440
you need to tell them

439
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,720
that I am here to take care of...

440
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,740
All because of my son,

441
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:29,980
明白了

442
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,280
inski

443
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,280
I wanted to treat him well.

444
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,280
But he was so rude.

445
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,280
Shen Xiang.

446
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,680
This is your fault.

447
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,520
Did you wait for a day

448
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,240
to put out your patience?

449
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,000
I know you hate me.

450
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,080
But...

451
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,480
His Majesty is living with Jin State.

452
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,520
Jin State is still percentile for someone like me to be alive.

453
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,200
This is wolf's numbers.

454
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,880
Please go to class again.

455
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:16,640
It didn't go well

456
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,200
so Saintess Arori

457
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,240
developed it

458
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,320
May I visit you please

459
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,960
Experienced

460
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,640
Since it's your time

461
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,640
I made our family medicine

462
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,160
You should have a taste

463
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,600
You made this especially for me.

464
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,000
I will surely enjoy it.

465
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,640
The beef is roasted with beef to give it a nice aroma.

466
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,440
It's crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.

467
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,440
It's very delicious.

468
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,520
It's a pity that Your Highness doesn't like the wedding stars.

469
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,920
You don't have the luck to eat them.

470
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,120
I cooked this dish myself.

471
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,120
Please finish it, Prime Minister Shen.

472
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,880
I heard that North Yuan people love beef and lamb.

473
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,880
They use this to make it fresh.

474
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,880
In this way,

475
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,880
Madam Jiang won't be able to get used to it.

476
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,880
I made this for you personally.

477
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,880
Madam Jiang, you must finish it.

478
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,880
This is the natural medicine that I made for you for the first time.

479
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,880
You still say that you don't remember it?

480
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,880
It's delicious.

481
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,880
Prime Minister Shen, please drink some soup.

482
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,880
I'm sorry.

483
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,880
Why are you so self-willed?

484
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,880
It's because I'm in a rush.

485
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,880
Prime Minister Shen, allow me to change my clothes.

486
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,880
I'll be back soon.

487
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,880
You don't want to be my friend?

488
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,880
You're trying to frame me again and again.

489
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,880
What's your purpose?

490
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,880
It's not my intention.

491
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,880
To find you,

492
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,880
I've searched all the hospitals in the mountain.

493
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,880
I even think that you've...

494
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,880
But look.

495
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,880
I found this.

496
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,880
Since you said it wasn't your intention,

497
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,880
it means that you admit that you hurt me.

498
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,880
I never deny what I've done.

499
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,880
But...

500
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,880
Then why are you still pestering me?

501
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,880
People kneel in the name of self-knowledge.

502
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,880
Please don't look for me again in the future.

503
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,880
Jiang Dahuang.

504
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:23,880
Do you hate me?

505
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,880
We're strangers.

506
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,880
Why should I hate you?

507
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,880
I have a engagement with His Highness.

508
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,880
Please take care of yourself.

509
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,880
What did you say?

510
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,880
What?

511
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,880
You're a high-ranking official.

512
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,880
You're as beautiful as a woman.

513
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,880
Why are you so different from me?

514
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,880
I came from the North.

515
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,880
I've been here for no reason.

516
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,880
I've been here every day,

517
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,880
and I've been sick and tired.

518
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,880
Even so,

519
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,880
I'm self-righteous.

520
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,880
I've never had the intention to harm anyone.

521
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,880
I've never been a traitor.

522
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,880
I've never been a traitor.

523
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,880
I've never been a traitor.

524
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,880
I'm self-righteous.

525
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,880
I've never been a traitor.

526
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,880
If I ever

527
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,880
offended you,

528
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,880
please forgive me.

529
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,880
Please let me go.

530
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,880
Sheng Xia.

531
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,880
I've just been away for a while.

532
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,880
Why do you look so pale?

533
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,880
Could it be that Miss Meng

534
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,880
has been slow-witted again?

535
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,880
Apologize to me.

536
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,880
Meng.

537
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,880
I'm sorry.

538
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,880
Please forgive me.

539
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,880
Your Highness, don't worry.

540
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,880
I hope you can

541
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,880
take good care of Miss Meng.

542
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,880
I'll take my leave.

543
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,880
Your Highness.

544
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,880
Meng.

545
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,880
You really make me look at you.

546
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,880
I used to look at you with high regard.

547
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,880
Now,

548
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,880
it's just that.

549
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,880
I'm so sad.

550
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,880
I can feel her sadness.

551
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,880
What's wrong with me?

552
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,880
We're just strangers.

553
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,880
Why should I hate you?

554
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,880
I'm engaged to His Highness.

555
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,880
Please take care of me.

556
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,880
You've said

557
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,880
you're not capable.

558
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,880
That means

559
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,880
you admit that you've hurt me.

560
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,880
You're just like a woman in the world.

561
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,880
Why can't you live with me?

562
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,880
Please don't think about me.

563
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,880
Please let me go.

564
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,880
Zhalong.

565
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,880
Prime Minister.

566
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,880
How's the investigation of the gunpowder?

567
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,880
I'm incompetent.

568
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,880
Since Lan Yi Pavilion was sealed,

569
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,880
we've caught a lot of Northern Courtyard's spies.

570
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,880
But we still haven't got the antidote.

571
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,880
Most of the spies in the prison

572
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,880
have been poisoned.

573
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,880
The gunpowder has been in Third Prince's mansion

574
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,880
for more than a month.

575
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,880
Even the spies in the prison

576
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,880
have been poisoned.

577
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,880
But he's fine.

578
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,880
Prime Minister, you mean

579
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,880
the antidote is in Third Prince's hands?

580
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,880
I'm not sure yet.

581
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,880
Check it.

582
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,880
We must keep it a secret.

583
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,880
Yes.

584
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,880
And

585
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,880
ask Zeng Tu to take a team

586
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,880
to Northern Courtyard

587
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,880
to find the antidote.

588
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,880
Yes.

589
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,880
If he's staying with Third Prince

590
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,880
for the antidote,

591
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,880
I'll help him

592
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,880
to solve the poison.

593
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,880
Doctor Bai.

594
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,880
Prime Minister.

595
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,880
I want to ask you about a poison

596
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,880
called the peach-flavored pill.

597
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,880
When the poison is released,

598
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,880
there will be a peach blossom mark.

599
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,880
My classmate's junior

600
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,880
was good at testing the poison.

601
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,880
I remember that

602
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,880
she told me personally that

603
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,880
only the top poison

604
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,880
can show a mark.

605
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,880
Where is your junior now?

606
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,880
She's in the prison.

607
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,880
She's in the prison.

608
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,880
Where is your junior now?

609
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,880
She's been kicked out of the city

610
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,880
and disappeared.

611
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,880
Prime Minister.

612
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,880
Why are you suddenly

613
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,880
concerned about this?

614
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,880
The North Courtyard's spy

615
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,880
I caught was poisoned.

616
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,880
If I don't take the antidote,

617
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,880
I'll get sick.

618
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,880
A few people died

619
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,880
because of the poison.

620
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,880
After the test is over,

621
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,880
I'll order someone

622
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,880
to send the body back

623
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,880
to study it

624
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,880
and find a solution as soon as possible.

625
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,880
Good.

626
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,880
I'll listen to you.

627
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,880
I have one more question.

628
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,880
My wife has amnesia.

629
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,880
I wonder if the imperial physician

630
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,880
has any way to cure her.

631
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,880
Amnesia is a mental illness.

632
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,880
It's not easy to cure.

633
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,880
I'll explain to you

634
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,880
how to cure it

635
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,880
after I've checked the medical books.

636
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,880
It seems that I have a strong

637
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,880
relationship with this God-dweller.

638
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:33,880
I don't know

639
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,880
why I see him

640
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,880
as a man of great ambition.

641
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,880
Forget it.

642
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,880
Now we're married.

643
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,880
It's more important to save Changjue's life.

644
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,880
Changjue.

645
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,880
I miss you so much.

646
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,880
You must protect yourself.

647
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,880
We'll meet again.

648
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:03,880
Changjue.

649
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,880
What's going on?

650
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,040
Is this man from the North?

651
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,760
I heard that he's sent by the North.

652
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,040
I wonder what's going on.

653
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,280
Stop.

654
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,960
Who are you?

655
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,600
How dare you stop me?

656
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,960
The North Court's envoy.

657
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,280
You're the leader of the North Court's envoy,

658
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,320
Mr. Wang.

659
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,400
That's right.

660
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,960
We came here under the order of His Majesty.

661
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,400
After the North Court's envoy entered the city,

662
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,600
we immediately entered the courier station

663
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,680
and received the memorial.

664
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,800
We represent the North Court's envoy,

665
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,360
not the criminals.

666
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,440
Mr. Wang,

667
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,360
I'm just following orders.

668
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,000
You...

669
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:28,960
Please.

670
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:33,880
Hurry.

671
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,480
Shen Zaiye.

672
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:49,920
Your Highness,

673
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,400
there are still some people from Her Highness's group.

674
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,600
You must hurry and save them.

675
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,000
Mu Wuyin,

676
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,080
so you still have something important to do.

677
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
The flower has blossomed, but nothing is known.

678
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,320
The beauty of the flower is indescribable.

679
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,200
The flower has fallen, but the wind has changed its direction.

680
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,200
The city is as yellow as a thorn.

681
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,960
The petals are covered with the rain.

682
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,000
The flowers are in full bloom.

683
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,040
The flowers are in full bloom.

684
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,040
The flowers are in full bloom.

685
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,160
The flowers are in full bloom.

686
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,080
The flowers are in full bloom.

687
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,480
The rain has stopped,

688
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,920
but my heart is still in the flower.

689
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,880
The flowers are in full bloom,

690
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,720
but my heart is still in the flower.

691
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:14,240
There is nowhere to go.

692
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,320
My wish

693
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:26,840
is growing in your eyes.

694
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,800
Regret

695
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:33,920
is killing in despair.

696
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:37,240
I still wish

697
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:41,560
to hold the flowers in my arms.

698
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:45,680
Even if I have to give up my life,

699
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:53,440
I will still sing this song.

700
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:03,180
A Little Possession

701
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,000
The flowers' flowers are blooming, but they don't bloom.

702
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:10,640
But my heart is still in the flower.

703
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,960
The flowers wither, but my heart still windowstep.

704
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:21,280
I don't need to tell anyone.

705
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:25,280
I'm afraid I'll be misunderstood.

706
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,280
I'm afraid I'll be misunderstood.

707
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,280
I'm afraid I'll be misunderstood.

708
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,280
I'm afraid I'll be misunderstood.

709
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,280
I'm afraid I'll be misunderstood.

710
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,280
I'm afraid I'll be misunderstood.

711
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,280
I'm afraid I'll be misunderstood.

712
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,280
I'm afraid I'll be misunderstood.

713
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,280
I'm afraid I'll be misunderstood.

714
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,280
I'm afraid I'll be misunderstood.

715
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,280
I'm afraid I'll be misunderstood.

716
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,280
I'm afraid I'll be misunderstood.

717
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,280
I'm afraid I'll be misunderstood.

718
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,280
I'm afraid I'll be misunderstood.

719
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,280
I'm afraid I'll be misunderstood.

720
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,280
I'm afraid I'll be misunderstood.

721
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,280
I'm afraid I'll be misunderstood.

722
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,280
I'm afraid I'll be misunderstood.

723
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,280
I'm afraid I'll be misunderstood.

724
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,280
I'm afraid I'll be misunderstood.

725
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,280
I'm afraid I'll be misunderstood.

726
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,280
I'm afraid I'll be misunderstood.
