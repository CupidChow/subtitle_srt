00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,860
Ah Military

2
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,860
I will never forget you

3
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,860
I will never forget you

4
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,860
I will never forget you

5
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,860
I will never forget you

6
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,860
I will never forget you

7
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,860
I will never forget you

8
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,860
I will never forget you

9
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,860
I will never forget you

10
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,860
I will never forget you

11
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,860
I will never forget you

12
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,860
I will never forget you

13
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,860
I will never forget you

14
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,860
I will never forget you

15
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,860
I will never forget you

16
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:40,860
The Long Ballad

17
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,860
Episode 18

18
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:03,860
Madam

19
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,860
Madam, I heard that Madam Jiang is awake

20
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,860
Should we go and visit her?

21
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,860
Madam Jiang is a smart person

22
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,860
I stopped her that day

23
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,860
She must have some doubts

24
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,860
We should not ask ourselves

25
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,860
Otherwise, we can't explain it

26
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,860
even if we ask her

27
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,860
You have been in her care these days

28
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,860
Until she woke up

29
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,860
you dared to leave

30
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,860
What is so good about Madam Jiang?

31
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,860
She...

32
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,860
She fell in love

33
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,860
She fell in love

34
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,860
She is not afraid of a cold heart

35
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,860
She is afraid of a cold heart

36
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,860
If she falls in love

37
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,860
She must not miss you

38
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,860
She must not miss you

39
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,860
She is going to be a big trouble

40
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,860
Keep your voice down

41
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,860
The crown prince's men must still be around.

42
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,420
Your highness,

43
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,460
I found the traces of the runaway Kuangong.

44
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,260
Really?

45
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,060
I saw it with my own eyes.

46
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,300
Good for you, Shen Zai Yi.

47
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,540
You almost got out of the way.

48
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,340
Get ready.

49
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,540
I want these people to disappear

50
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:28,340
without any trace.

51
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,340
Yes.

52
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,940
Do you want to ask Mr. Meng to do it?

53
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,500
It's been a while.

54
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,180
And you just received a letter from the Eagle Division.

55
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,780
Will you do it?

56
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,100
Mr. Meng?

57
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,540
It's too late to discuss everything with him.

58
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:44,940
Get ready.

59
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:45,940
Yes.

60
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,460
Shen Zai Yi,

61
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,060
I'm the crown prince.

62
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,300
You can't beat me.

63
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,900
suppressed Xuanzheng's !

64
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,340
That's great, Game Master.

65
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,060
This time,

66
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,500
we're doing everything like we promised.

67
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,340
Rest assured, Prime Minister Yuz общем.

68
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,860
We're running out of time.

69
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:24,380
Keep my pr Bandai a L Umweltungful guy is our last resort.

70
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,740
Wang Meng's G 가지 of戀 boss knots

71
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,580
should be done,

72
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,220
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,100
Prime Minister, I have something to report.

74
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:42,660
I'm sorry.

75
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,300
There's something urgent at home.

76
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,780
I'll take my leave now.

77
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,620
Please do as you please.

78
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:53,780
I'm sorry.

79
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,740
Prime Minister, take care.

80
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,900
Go to the capital immediately.

81
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:00,820
Yes, sir.

82
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,020
All of you, go.

83
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,340
Yes.

84
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,180
Search.

85
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,580
Not good.

86
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,580
Isn't this the commander of the guards who followed the Crown Prince?

87
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,580
Does the commander really think that

88
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,580
as long as he says something,

89
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,580
he can wait for the Crown Prince to come and save him?

90
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,580
He has been secretly opening the silver mine and the evidence is clear.

91
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,580
He even killed someone under His Majesty's eyes.

92
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,580
This time, the Crown Prince is in danger.

93
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,580
Can he still be able to save you?

94
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,580
If you don't say it,

95
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,580
those miners will say it too.

96
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,580
It's better to confess earlier.

97
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:36,580
You can still protect your wife and children.

98
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,580
Commander, think about it.

99
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,580
Put the signal out.

100
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,580
Go.

101
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,580
Find out which direction it is.

102
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,580
See who is suitable.

103
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,580
Yes.

104
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,580
Why are you so late?

105
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,580
Come and drink.

106
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,580
Wine.

107
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,580
Come.

108
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,580
Come.

109
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,580
Come.

110
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,580
Come.

111
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,580
Is there anything suitable for Huaijin?

112
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,580
It was His Highness who sent someone to assassinate that mine.

113
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:29,580
Didn't Huaijin also say that Father didn't mean to abolish it?

114
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,580
Those mines are also a waste of time.

115
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,580
As long as it is done cleanly,

116
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,580
even if Father notices it,

117
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,580
nothing will happen.

118
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,580
Nothing will happen?

119
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,580
The person that His Highness sent was controlled by Shen Zaiye.

120
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,580
The fireworks that were just fired were the signal.

121
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,580
That's why I came to find His Highness.

122
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:59,580
I didn't expect that His Highness would celebrate it in advance.

123
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,580
Huaijin, are you lying to me?

124
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,580
I never joke about court matters.

125
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,580
I asked His Highness to stay still.

126
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,580
His Highness...

127
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,580
Forget it.

128
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,580
It's all about friendship.

129
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,580
Friendship?

130
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,580
Friendship?

131
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,580
Huaijin, teach me.

132
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,580
When Father asks,

133
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,580
how should I answer?

134
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,580
All my previous judgments

135
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,580
were based on His Majesty's desire to balance the power of the court

136
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,580
and the harmony of the Shi family.

137
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,580
But if someone makes a scene,

138
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,580
and removes the cloth,

139
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,580
even if His Majesty doesn't want to,

140
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,580
he will have to explain to the court and the people.

141
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,580
If I guess right,

142
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,580
the fireworks just now

143
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,580
have disturbed the entire hunting ground.

144
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,580
I will also hold His Highness back.

145
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:22,580
I can't do anything about it.

146
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,580
No, no, no.

147
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:32,580
Father won't remove the cloth.

148
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,580
No.

149
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:36,580
It's just like the gambling.

150
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,580
As long as my people are killed,

151
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,580
I won't order them to do so.

152
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,580
It's... it's not related.

153
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,580
Okay.

154
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,580
Where is the gun?

155
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,580
How do I get it out?

156
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,580
His Majesty has ordered

157
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,580
that all the people in the palace

158
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,580
must be killed.

159
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,580
Father.

160
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,580
I want to see Father.

161
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,580
You people are just like the dead people.

162
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,580
You will be beautiful when I go out.

163
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,580
I am still the Crown Prince.

164
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,580
I want to see Father.

165
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,580
Sister Hua.

166
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,580
Say something.

167
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,580
Are we just waiting here

168
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,580
for Shen Zaiye to be out there

169
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,580
and frame me?

170
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,580
Your Highness.

171
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:00,580
Does Shen Zaiye have to frame me for this?

172
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:04,580
Tearing the silver mine is the biggest crime.

173
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,580
This is Shen Zaiye.

174
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:19,580
What deep hatred do you have against me?

175
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,580
You are so clever.

176
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,580
You want to kill me?

177
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,580
Your Highness.

178
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,580
My wife is the Prime Minister's wife.

179
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,580
Before we set off,

180
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,580
I want to make some food for you

181
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,580
and Mr. Meng to warm up.

182
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,580
I respect you, Madam.

183
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,580
I am also the daughter of the Meng family.

184
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,580
I hope you can be at ease.

185
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,580
Please forgive me.

186
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,580
I really didn't order you.

187
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,580
Before we enter the palace,

188
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,580
no one is allowed to approach the crime scene.

189
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,580
Please forgive me.

190
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,580
I dare not to disobey.

191
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,580
Shen Zaiye.

192
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,580
You are so rude.

193
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,580

195
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,580
Go back.

196
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,580
Don't make things difficult for them.

197
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,580
Yue Tao.

198
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,580
Come back.

199
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,580

Your Highness.

261
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,580

262
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,580
and become motions.

263
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,580
I shall go.

264
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,580
I must see courtship.

265
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,580
Cuz I believe

266
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,580
Madame Leng

267
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,580
has got something.

268
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,580
I think

269
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,580
I can arrange

270
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,580
with Madame Leng

271
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,580
Shahada

272
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,580
to bring back

273
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,580
不能讓

274
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,580
me back,

275
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,580
I amyoung.

276
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,500

00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,460

278
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,580
and Chen Ri

279
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,540
The medicine is bitter.

280
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,260
You should drink it first.

281
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:39,940
The most truthful one

282
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:05,660
Before she is all done,

283
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,820
she should open a warehouse alone in the kitchen.

284
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,220
and water.

285
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:11,180
Your body needs to be nourished

286
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:11,940
with some blood.

287
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,500
If you need any medicine,

288
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,300
go to the warehouse.

289
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,540
If you don't have any,

290
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,380
write a list for me.

291
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,100
Yes.

292
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,380
Aren't you going in to have a look?

293
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,380
No.

294
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:24,900
I should go to the court.

295
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,500
Your Majesty is here.

296
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,180
Thank you, Your Majesty.

297
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:50,820
Arise.

298
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,940
Thank you, Your Majesty.

299
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,860
Bring him in.

300
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,220
Let me go.

301
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,420
I can walk on my own.

302
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,300
Let me go.

303
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,380
I can walk on my own.

304
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,260
Choose one.

305
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:13,660
Your Majesty.

306
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,180
It's a mistake.

307
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,020
Nope.

308
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,340
I was too eenous

309
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,220
and made a mistake.

310
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,900
In my last years.

311
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,980
To save Chief checking the balance,

312
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,580
please forgive me, Father.

313
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:30,940
Shanxiang.

314
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:32,660
Yes.

315
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,420
I underestimated you.

316
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,060
The silver mine was opened.

317
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,940
The people of Qinan and Ba'an were all evidence.

318
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,820
Do you still want to be accused here?

319
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,300
Father, I am sorry.

320
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,260
I am sorry.

321
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,380
I really know I was wrong.

322
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,260
Please give me another chance.

323
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,620
Father, I am sorry.

324
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,580
I... I won't do it again.

325
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,700
I am sorry.

326
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,340
I am sorry.

327
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,700
I really know I was wrong.

328
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,820
Father.

329
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,060
You know it.

330
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,540
The crown prince is ungrateful.

331
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,980
He is not loyal to the king.

332
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,820
The silver mine was opened.

333
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,100
The people of Qinan and Ba'an were all evidence.

334
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,860
The prince committed the same crime as the common people.

335
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,260
Today, he will be deported to the crown prince's position.

336
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,380
He will be locked up in the mansion

337
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,300
and will be told the truth.

338
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:08,980
concealed.

339
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:14,340
They won't face confusion and 융You have indicated it.

340
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,780
Lazying down people.

341
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:22,660
You are indeed willing to take the crown prince's young man away?!

342
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,060
Why are you here now?

343
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,380
How is it possible that you could not live without him?

344
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,900
Akuni.

345
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,980
and the court will be closed

346
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:45,580
Your Majesty

347
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,500
The Crown Prince's crimes

348
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,340
are all helped by Meng Family

349
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,900
I have a record here

350
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,420
May I ask Your Majesty

351
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,420
what the Meng Family should be guilty of?

352
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,420
Your angel is so wingshaling

353
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,300
Is the Prime Minister

354
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,740
trying to be the son of His Majesty?

355
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:14,940
No, I don't want this

356
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,200
It's just that Putve family

357
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,760
has!」m guilty of the Crown Prince's crimes

358
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,300
If the crime is proved

359
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,800
Your Majesty would be trying to favor the Qi

360
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,140
and His Majesty

361
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,000
with his power

362
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,080
I think

363
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,300
As aдоthe Prime Minister

364
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,080
for His Majesty

365
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,980
I hope His Majesty can understand

366
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:31,660
I'm sorry.

367
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:41,540
You've worked hard for our state.

368
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,980
How could I misunderstand you?

369
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,340
Don't talk nonsense.

370
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:01,900
Here.

371
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,060
�

372
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,220
Meng family

373
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,820
indenells his son to commit such a sinful crime.

374
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,380
His Rome.

375
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:22,420
But

376
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,380
it's a serious matter.

377
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,620
Let me think over it.

378
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,980
But it seems you are running late.

379
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:12,000
These people used to

380
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,540
be AG in order to be able to control you.

381
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,020
Today, they are incomprehensible.

382
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,340
I really am ashamed of you, Prime Minister.

383
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,160
between us,

384
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,220
should not dare to act like this.

385
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:36,700
you don't have to be so

386
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,700
aggressive.

387
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,700
You never think about the future.

388
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,700
The same goes for the court.

389
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,700
The East Wind has taken the West Wind down.

390
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:48,980
But I don't know if the West Wind will take the East Wind down.

391
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:54,780
I'm just waiting for the end of the trial.

392
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,780
We're both waiting for the end of the trial.

393
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,840
Father.

394
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:33,020
I've suffered too much.

395
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,760
Lianוא׮

396
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,400
Father.

397
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,960
One lost his life.

398
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,000
Eternity flowing on,

399
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,920
you two still do not love each other.

400
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,580
Give my son a chance.

401
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,740
now for others.

402
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,980
Huai Qian is abused by his voivoger father

403
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,980
for defending the Crown Prince.

404
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,420
I admit my fault

405
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,860
when Meng Family died.

406
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,260
Except you,

407
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,580
the hideous and useless

408
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,220
Crown Prince.

409
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,220
Nobody shouldمل justice.

410
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,020
I don't fear for many years

411
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,020
but I'm ruined.

412
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,020
The crown prince was fired?

413
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,020
Yes.

414
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:53,020
I rushed back to Yujin at midnight.

415
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,020
I've already settled down.

416
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,020
I can't go back.

417
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,020
If I had known it,

418
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,020
I would have been dead.

419
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,020
I wouldn't have let you take a step.

420
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,020
Even if it's not the crown prince,

421
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,020
there will be other things.

422
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,020
The crown prince is destined to be useless.

423
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,020
But Huaijin,

424
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:21,020
because of the crown prince,

425
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,020
Meng family can be said to be

426
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:25,020
a group of wolves fighting for their lives.

427
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,020
It's dangerous.

428
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,020
Everyone is looking forward to

429
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,020
seeing which step we have to take.

430
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,020
If we make a big mistake,

431
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,020
we can divide Meng family into ten.

432
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,020
Meng family

433
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:45,020
can't be cut off from our hands.

434
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,020
So we have to have a conclusion

435
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,020
as soon as possible

436
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,020
to get the Meng family out of it.

437
00:25:56,020 --> 00:26:00,020
We must wait for the right time

438
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,020
to make a decision.

439
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,020
Do you understand?

440
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:22,020
Huaijin has been filial to his family since he was little.

441
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,020
The Meng family should be repaid

442
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,020
for their troubles.

443
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,020
Huaijin understands.

444
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,020
But father,

445
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,020
I have no one to ask for help.

446
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,020
Shu'er,

447
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,020
Zhenzhen is in a difficult situation in the Prime Minister's Mansion.

448
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,020
As her brother,

449
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:53,020
I haven't been able to take care of her since childhood.

450
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,020
After this,

451
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,020
let her live a comfortable life.

452
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,020
Don't worry.

453
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,020
No matter what,

454
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,020
Zhenzhen is still the legitimate daughter of the Meng family.

455
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:16,020
I won't let anyone

456
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,020
bully her.

457
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,020
Father,

458
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,020
Huaijin is unfilial.

459
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,020
She can't be repaid.

460
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,020
Get up.

461
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:12,020
Huaijin,

462
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,020
the Meng family is proud of you.

463
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,020
You are the only one

464
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,020
who can help them.

465
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,020
You are the only one who can help them.

466
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,020
You are the only one who can help them.

467
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,020
You are the only one who can help them.

468
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,020
You are the only one who can help them.

469
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,020
You are the only one who can help them.

470
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,020
You are the only one who can help them.

471
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,020
You are the only one who can help them.

472
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,020
You are the only one who can help them.

473
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,020
You are the only one who can help them.

474
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,020
You are the only one who can help them.

475
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,020
You are the only one who can help them.

476
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,020
You are the only one who can help them.

477
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,020
You are the only one who can help them.

478
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,020
You are the only one who can help them.

479
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:09,020
You are the only one who can help them.

480
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,020
You are the only one who can help them.

481
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,020
You are the only one who can help them.

482
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,020
You are the only one who can help them.

483
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,020
You are the only one who can help them.

484
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,020
You are the only one who can help them.

485
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,020
You are the only one who can help them.

486
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,020
The moon is bright.

487
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,020
It's beautiful.

488
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,020
Chenchen.

489
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,020
You see this letter.

490
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,020
Brother should be gone.

491
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,020
He is gone.

492
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,020
The sky is dark.

493
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,020
The world is vast.

494
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,020
You can't see it.

495
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:01,020
The night of life is just a dream.

496
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,020
Fortunately, the two stars are still there.

497
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,020
There are seven sisters below.

498
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,020
If I can protect the people with the body of Huaijin,

499
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,020
Huaijin will be happy.

500
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,020
But

501
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,020
I miss you in the capital.

502
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,020
I'm afraid I won't have a chance to take care of you in the future.

503
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,020
Don't do anything too much.

504
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,020
Shen Xiang is not a person who dares to kill.

505
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,020
Father also promised me

506
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,020
to take care of you.

507
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,020
In this way,

508
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,020
I have no regrets.

509
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,020
Madam.

510
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,020
Let me help you put the letter away.

511
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,020
If it's the last time he knows that day,

512
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,020
I will also meet with my brother for the sake of the order.

513
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:10,020
Unfortunately, that night,

514
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,020
my brother didn't drink the soup.

515
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,020
He drank it.

516
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,020
Madam.

517
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,020
At least you and your father

518
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,020
said goodbye with a smile.

519
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,020
I didn't expect

520
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,020
that father could give up his life

521
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,020
for the sake of the family

522
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,020
and even give up his own son.

523
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:46,020
My brother seems to be a noble disciple of the Shi family.

524
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,020
But he is just a pawn

525
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,020
for the family.

526
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,020
I am also like that.

527
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,020
All the Meng family are like that.

528
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,020
Even my father can't die.

529
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,020
Before my father became the Prime Minister,

530
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,020
he was the leader of the Meng family.

531
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,020
He was also the Prime Minister of the court.

532
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,020
The Shi family has always decided

533
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,020
the action of my father.

534
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,020
One day,

535
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,020
I will also be sacrificed by the family.

536
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,020
Madam.

537
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,020
Life is short.

538
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,020
Why do you still

539
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,020
hurt yourself for something that hasn't happened?

540
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,020
I hope you can live well.

541
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,020
You are right.

542
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,020
I want to live well.

543
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,020
Help! Help!

544
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,020
Someone is going to kill himself!

545
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,020
The Meng family

546
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,020
has been loyal for generations.

547
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,020
They never thought

548
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:15,020
that my son would make such a big mistake.

549
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,020
He is not a good son.

550
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,020
I am sorry.

551
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,020
I am ashamed of you.

552
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,020
I am ashamed of my ancestors.

553
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,020
I have no words to serve you.

554
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:31,020
I hope you can live well.

555
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,020
Let me and my son

556
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:40,020
return to the heaven.

557
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,020
The heaven.

558
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,020
Prime Minister You.

559
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,020
No.

560
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,020
This is the time for the court to use people.

561
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,020
How can Prime Minister You spare the family

562
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,020
and care for the family?

563
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,020
If you want to find Prime Minister You,

564
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,020
the Crown Prince's fault

565
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,020
is also because of

566
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,020
my father's unfavorable teaching.

567
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,020
Do you want me

568
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,020
to commit a crime

569
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,020
and not be punished?

570
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,020
I don't mean that.

571
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,020
But

572
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:17,020
I am old and weak.

573
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:21,020
I don't want to be a court official.

574
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,020
I am afraid that people will say

575
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,020
I am greedy for power and war.

576
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,020
I am a man of my word.

577
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,020
If I involve His Majesty

578
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,020
in this matter

579
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,020
and bring an innocent person

580
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,020
to the court,

581
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,020
I will be

582
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,020
too guilty.

583
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,020
You don't have to say more.

584
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,020
Please resign your letter.

585
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:53,020
I will not allow you to report it.

586
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:01,020
Prime Minister You.

587
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:05,020
Meng family has been living in poverty

588
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,020
for hundreds of years.

589
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,020
Even if there are traces of poverty,

590
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,020
it's okay to remove it.

591
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,020
Why do you have to

592
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,020
ruin your family just because of one person?

593
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:20,020
I am busy with the court.

594
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,020
Do you still need to

595
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:26,020
share my burden?

596
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:35,020
I am willing to work for His Majesty

597
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:38,020
and die for him.

598
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:50,020
I am sorry.

599
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,020
Prime Minister, why did you

600
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,020
use such a big sword?

601
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:55,020
You even risked your life

602
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,020
to get in the game.

603
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,020
But you still didn't let Meng family

604
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,020
to be completely destroyed.

605
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,020
Why did His Majesty deal with it like this?

606
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,020
Is His Majesty reminding me

607
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,020
that I am just a knife

608
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,020
he is holding up?

609
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,020
What kind of punishment

610
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,020
does he want me to see?

611
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,020
I am afraid that

612
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,020
he will be too guilty

613
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,020
to be punished.

614
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,020
I am afraid that

615
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,020
he will be too guilty

616
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,020
to be punished.

617
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,020
I am afraid that

618
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,020
he will only let me

619
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,020
see what kind of punishment

620
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,020
he wants me to see.

621
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,020
Then what about us?

622
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,020
It doesn't matter.

623
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,020
The hatred of the Bai clan

624
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,020
is not over yet.

625
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,020
Moreover,

626
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,020
it is the first family of Ruo Da.

627
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,020
Now that the Crown Prince

628
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,020
and Meng Huai are gone,

629
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,020
the Meng family is already

630
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,020
in a great state of vitality.

631
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,020
I have more time

632
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,020
to spend with them.

633
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,020
The new cakes are complicated.

634
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,020
They are so beautiful

635
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,020
and delicious.

636
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,020
They are all made of beautiful ingredients.

637
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,020
I want some.

638
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,020
I want some.

639
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,020
Come on.

640
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,020
Line up.

641
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,020
Line up.

642
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,020
Line up.

643
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,020
Line up.

644
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,020
Line up.

645
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,020
Your Highness,

646
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,020
it is time to take your medicine.

647
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,020
Leave it there.

648
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,020
Your Highness,

649
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,020
I heard that Madam Meng's brother

650
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,020
committed suicide in prison.

651
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,020
So,

652
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,020
His Highness's plan was successful.

653
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,020
The Crown Prince was fired.

654
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,020
Meng Huai is in a state of self-destruction.

655
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,020
Qing has known about it.

656
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,020
At this moment,

657
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,020
she must be angry

658
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:42,020
because I didn't send the news

659
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,020
out early.

660
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,020
Please give this letter

661
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,020
to Yang Wanqing as soon as possible.

662
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,020
Don't worry.

663
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,020
I have been

664
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,020
very convenient recently.

665
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,020
As long as I say that

666
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,020
Her Highness wants to eat cakes,

667
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,020
they will let me go.

668
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,020
She is a little kind.

669
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,020
Don't relax.

670
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,020
I have no iron in my hand.

671
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,020
If I make a mistake,

672
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,020
the consequences will be unimaginable.

673
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,020
Go.

674
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,020
Okay.

675
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,020
Your Highness,

676
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,020
I have sent the letter to the Crown Prince.

677
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:21,020
Please go.

678
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,020
Prime Minister.

679
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,020
Should I tell Her Highness

680
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,020
that you are here?

681
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,020
No need.

682
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,020
I will go now.

683
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,020
By the way,

684
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,020
His Majesty is going to have

685
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,020
a tea party in the palace

686
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,020
in ten days.

687
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,020
If Her Highness

688
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,020
is bored,

689
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:57,020
she will arrange

690
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,020
the meeting.

691
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,020
Your Highness,

692
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,020
that eunuch said...

693
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,020
I have heard that

694
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,020
the palace is having a tea party.

695
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,220
This is a good chance.

696
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:19,180
I'll find a way to go to Lan Yi Pavilion

697
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,980
and meet Qing in person.

698
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,140
But

699
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,580
you have to go out with her that day.

700
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,060
What if you don't have a chance?

701
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,380
Then I'll find another chance.

702
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:30,940
I'm a spy.

703
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,420
I'll take the risk.

704
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,580
Your Highness, have some cakes.

705
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:39,220
It's sweet.

706
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,020
This is the snack cake from our North Campus.

707
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:44,980
It's a snack cake.

708
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,460
This is a snack shop.

709
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,940
It takes a long time to buy it.

710
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,180
It's a good deal.

711
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,740
Lady Jiang has recovered well recently.

712
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:12,820
Don't worry.

713
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,660
Don't call her Lady Jiang anymore.

714
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,980
What... what should I call her?

715
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:21,980
She's the princess of North Campus.

716
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,740
You should call her princess

717
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,300
along with Qingtai.

718
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:26,780
Yes.
