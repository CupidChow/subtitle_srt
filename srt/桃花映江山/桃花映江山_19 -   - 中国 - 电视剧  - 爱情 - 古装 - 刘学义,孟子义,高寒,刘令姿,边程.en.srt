(Adapted from the novel "Peach Blossoms
Reflecting the River and Mountains")

16
00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:40,980
(by Bai Lu Cheng Shuang)

17
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,900
=Episode 19=

18
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,000
Prince Wuxia.

19
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,680
Prince Wuxia!

20
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,400
Prince Wuxia!

21
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:50,840
Prince Wuxia!

22
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,280
Jiang Taohua...

23
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,400
You would go against Her Highness?

24
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,600
You're as good as dead.

25
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,600
If that's the case,

26
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:01,800
don't fault me

27
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,640
for trading your life
for a shot at survival.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,600
Get up!

29
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,680
Shen Zaiye.

30
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,200
Quite the grand entrance.

31
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,040
If you've got the guts,

32
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,720
tell your men to shoot me.

33
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,320
No!

34
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,360
If she dies,
she'll take the Princess with her!

35
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,400
Princess!

36
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,960
Princess!

37
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,320
I know who you are.

38
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,520
You run Lan Boutique,

39
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,440
Yang Wanqing.

40
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,320
You entered the palace at 12,

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,960
and became Empress Lv's
personal maid in Beiyuan.

42
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,320
Eight years later,

43
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,760
you were banished
for disrespecting your mistress.

44
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,840
You came to Qi to make a living.

45
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,400
But clearly,

46
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,720
there's more to it.

47
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,480
Shen Zaiye.

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,160
Look at the situation.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,180
Do you really think
you have everything under control?

50
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,080
Does it even matter who I am?

51
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,680
What matters is that

52
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,040
everyone you care about

53
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,520
is in my hands now.

54
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,440
Whoever you're working for,

55
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,280
they're not worth

56
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,360
dying for.

57
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,160
Whatever promises she made you,

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
whatever deal you struck,

59
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,800
I can give you the same.

60
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,280
Turn yourself in,

61
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,840
and I'll spare your life.

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,040
Shen Zaiye.

63
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,320
Everyone in Qi

64
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,160
knows how ruthless and cunning you are.

65
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,160
If I let them go now,

66
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,480
you'd have me stuck
with arrows in no time.

67
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,560
If you don't want them
end up as corpses,

68
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,560
tell your men to back off.

69
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,200
Prepare a carriage for us.

70
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,600
Once we've left the mountain,

71
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,840
I'll release them.

72
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,200
But if you refuse,

73
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,200
then these two

74
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,040
shall die with me.

75
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,600
You're more naive than I thought.

76
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,920
Since Jiang Taohua
is a spy from Beiyuan,

77
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,560
why would I care if she is dead?

78
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,790
The only person
walking away from this alive

79
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,880
is Prince Wuxia.

80
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,040
Chancellor Shen,

81
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,600
the Princess did nothing wrong.

82
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,000
Please! I'm begging you, save her!

83
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,200
Jiang Taohua.

84
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,120
My heart aches for you.

85
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,280
Shen Zaiye!

86
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,840
I'll kill you!

87
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,360
Someone send Qingtai back to the house!

88
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,760
Let go of me!

89
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,480
I'm not going back!

90
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,080
I'm going to Beiyuan.

91
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,920
I'll tell the Heir
you killed the Princess.

92
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,160
He'll avenge her!

93
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:35,920
Chancellor.

94
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,040
Maybe the Princess...

95
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,800
Not another word!

96
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,280
The Princess is no more.

97
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,360
The two who fell

98
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,600
were spies committing espionage.

99
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,400
They were traitors from a rival nation,
plotting against our royal bloodline.

100
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,240
Search the cliff base.

101
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,360
I want them found

102
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,840
dead

103
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,000
or alive.

104
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,400
Yes, sir.

105

♪I've watched time drift gently by♪

106
00:07:17,954 --> 00:07:26,072

(Things have come to this.)

112
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,160
(Better to part ways.)

113
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,760
(Drink this farewell wine.)

114
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,760
(After tonight,)

115
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,600
(we will never meet again.)

116
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,240
Zhan Lu.

117
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,400
Chancellor.

118
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,240
Take down the Zhengchun Boudoir's

119
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,120
plaque.

120
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,560
Yes.

121
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,240
What about the Princess's belongings?

122
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,120
You heard me.

123
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,600
There is no princess here.

124
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,800
Go through
the spy's belongings carefully.

125
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,880
Keep anything we can use as evidence

126
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,400
and seal it all up.

127
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:33,960
As for the rest,

128
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,080
destroy it.

129
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,200
Chancellor.

130
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,280
What should we do with Miss Qingtai?

131
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,800
She said she'd head back to Beiyuan

132
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,790
to bring the troops here
and avenge Jiang Taohua.

133
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,040
So be it.

134
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,720
Have all the spies
from Lan Boutique been caught?

135
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,400
Yes, they've locked up.

136
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,360
However, none confessed.

137
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,440
Would you interrogate them?

138
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,120
Talk.

139
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,000
Speak!

140
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,040
Who's pulling

141
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,000
the strings in Yujing?

142
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,560
I don't know.

143
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:10,800
Speak up!

144
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:11,760
Talk!

145
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,400
Start talking!

146
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:18,760
Speak!

147
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,885
- Chancellor.
- Chancellor!

148
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,880
I don't keep useless men under me.

149
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,280
If you can't find the one behind it,

150
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,840
I'll have your heads.

151
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,304
- Yes!
- Yes!

152
00:09:29,304 --> 00:09:29,682
Yes, sir.

153
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,200
Talk!

154
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,840
You treacherous dog...

155
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,400
Wait!

156
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,240
Curse you!

157
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,400
What is this?

158
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,520
The most popular makeup in Yujing.
It's the Peace Blossom makeup.

159
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,200
What is the purpose

160
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,560
of the peach blossom mark?

161
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,920
Is this how your spies from Beiyuan

162
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,880
identify each other?

163
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,880
Anyone bearing the mark

164
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,920
is a spy ready to die for Beiyuan.

165
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,280
Ready to die for Beiyuan?

166
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,240
(She's a princess,)

167
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,760
(she can't be one of them.)

168
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,240
(Besides, I saw it last night.)

169
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,160
(Her arm was clean.)

170
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,560
(Back at the gambling house,)

171
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,400
(she had a mark on her arm,)

172
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:47,560
(but it was way lighter
than these spies'.)

173
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,960
(But if it was drawn on,)

174
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,440
(it couldn't be identical,)

175
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,080
(with the same location,)

176
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,520
(but different depths,)

177
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,560
(and not always present.)

178
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,960
(Could it be)

179
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,840
(a sign of poisoning?)

180
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,320
Chancellor.

181
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,720
We went easy on her.

182
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,200
She just...

183
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,640
She just dropped dead.

184
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,160
(Blood from all seven orifices.)

185
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,400
(She was poisoned.)

186
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,080
(Could the color of the mark)

187
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,760
(be tied to the onset of poisoning?)

188
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,040
You've seen

189
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,840
how she ended up.

190
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,720
When we searched Yang Wanqing's place,

191
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,880
we found a single pill.

192
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,000
Most likely, it's the antidote.

193
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,120
It might be your only cure.

194
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,240
He has the antidote!

195
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,320
If any of you want to live,

196
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,520
then tell me who is behind all this.

197
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,400
There is only one pill.

198
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:49,840
The antidote!

199
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:50,920
The antidote!

200
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,960
Please, sir! Give it to me!

201
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,080
Please, I need it!

202
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,200
The antidote!

203
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,280
Give it to me!

204
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,240
I'll tell you everything!

205
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,640
(Looks like I was right.)

206
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,400
(It really is poison.)

207
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,320
What kind of poison is it?

208
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,120
It's called...

209
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,280
It's called the Jiangtao pill.

210
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,720
It was Empress Lv

211
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,920
who forced us to take it.

212
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,440
The peach blossom mark
shows the poison is active.

213
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,960
She used it to threaten us serving her.

214
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,200
If we don't take
the antidote every month,

215
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,440
at best,

216
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,920
we cough up blood and faint.

217
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,680
In the worst case,

218
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,840
we die instantly.

219
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,080
Empress Lv

220
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,800
also used our families as leverage.

221
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,480
My parents are locked up on her orders.

222
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,160
I just want to see them one last time.

223
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,200
Chancellor Shen...

224
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,480
Please, sir...

225
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,280
My wife and child

226
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,520
are Empress Lv's hostages too!

227
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,160
If I fail the mission,

228
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,600
they'll be killed,

229
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,480
Chancellor Shen.

230
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,400
Chancellor Shen...

231
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,000
So all of you were under her control.

232
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,840
What about Jiang Taohua?

233
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,760
She was the same as us.

234
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,240
She's just another expendable pawn.

235
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,640
She was Princess Chengping,

236
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,160
you can't possibly
be on her level as well.

237
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,560
Treacherous Chancellor,

238
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,000
did you really believe

239
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,480
Beiyuan

240
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,040
would hand over a royal princess

241
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,920
just to be your concubine?

242
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,640
Back then

243
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,200
at the Beiyuan Palace,

244
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,000
Jiang Taohua got down on her knees

245
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,200
just for a bowl of medicine.

246
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,560
You two make a perfect match!

247
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:38,720
Chancellor.

248
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,160
Chancellor, we found something.

249
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,440
I found this letter under the bed

250
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,320
at Zhengchun Boudoir.

251
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,400
Looks like a letter

252
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,960
from Jiang Taohua's younger brother.

253
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:52,552
(Are you well, Sister?
Has Chancellor Shen treated you kindly?)

254
00:13:52,552 --> 00:13:53,260
(Signed: Changjue)

255
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,560
(Her brother is held hostage
by Empress Lv.)

256
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,600
(No wonder...)

257
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,600
(Empress Lv)

258
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,080
(also used our families as leverage.)

259
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,840
(If I fail the mission,)

260
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,680
(they'll be killed.)

261
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,860
Why hasn't the scout
sent to Beiyuan returned?

262
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,400
We received a message from him.

263
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,360
He ran into trouble multiple times,

264
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,520
but he should be on his way back now.

265
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,480
Our guards have been searching
Yugui Mountain.

266
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,520
No sign of Jiang Taohua's body.

267
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,960
Nearby boatmen says

268
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,880
the bottom of the cliff
is full of whirlpools.

269
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,680
Anyone who falls

270
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,920
is as good as gone,

271
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,280
and the body likely won't even surface.

272
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,000
Shen Zaiye.

273
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,300
- Shen Zaiye.
- Prince Wuxia.

274
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,280
What happened that day at the teahouse?

275
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,560
Why were you there?

276
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:57,880
That day,

277
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,920
someone used the Princess's name

278
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,640
to lure me out.

279
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,320
But as soon as I arrived,
I was knocked out.

280
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,000
I was half-conscious,

281
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,720
but I heard them arguing.

282
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,040
After the Princess tricked
that person away,

283
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,120
she tried everything to wake me up.

284
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,960
By the time I came to,

285
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,640
I heard the Princess had already...

286
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,720
Jiang Taohua.

287
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,320
What are you doing?

288
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,480
I said I was saving him,

289
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,080
and you threw me
into the interrogation room.

290
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,400
Is this how you show trust?

291
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,200
So...

292
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,640
She was telling the truth.

293
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,720
Shen Zaiye.

294
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,560
Is the Princess's fate

295
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,440
your doing?

296
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,000
I'm talking to you.

297
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,360
Was it your doing or not?

298
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,640
Mu Wuxia.

299
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,320
It was an accident Jiang Taohua fell.

300
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,760
My brother was trying to save her.

301
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,640
An accident?

302
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,320
It all seems too suspicious.

303
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,640
How could it be just an accident?

304
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,640
I don't buy it.

305
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,200
She was probably killed by him.

306
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:05,120
(Shen Residence)

307
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,900
(Sister Taohua, it's been so long
since we parted. I think of you often.)

308
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,045
(How is your body?)

309
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:12,180
(Has Chancellor Shen
treated you with kindly?)

310
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:22,800
I, Zengtu, have uncovered

311
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
the truth behind
the Princess's marriage alliance.

312
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,560
Sorry for taking so long.

313
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,800
Please, Chancellor,
grant me another chance

314
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,800
to make things right.

315
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,320
Tell me everything you found.

316
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,480
I want every detail.

317
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:36,800
Yes.

318
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,080
Chancellor,

319
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,640
this is everything I managed to uncover.

320
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,480
Princess Chengping
had the title in name only.

321
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,040
She was treated worse
than a palace maid.

322
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,040
Chancellor,

323
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,240
why don't we storm
the Beiyuan Palace now,

324
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,840
and make them pay for her death?

325
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:07,880
No.

326
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,720
Prince Changjue is still

327
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,440
Empress Lv's hostage.

328
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,800
Go rest and recover.

329
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,240
Thank you, Chancellor.

330
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,800
I'll take my leave.

331
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:25,840
Chancellor.

332
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,800
What do we do now?

333
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,120
Send more men. Keep searching.

334
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:35,760
Yes, sir.

335
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,240
Understood.

(And you can't die.)

373
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,180
(Zhengchun Boudoir)

374
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,920
Princess Chengping!

375
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,240
Princess Chengping!

376
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,040
Princess Chengping!

377
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,440
- Princess Chengping!
- Princess Chengping!

378
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,400
(Heaven,)

379
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,360
(Jiang Taohua has had
a life full of suffering.)

380
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,520
(And yet, she always chose kindness.)

381
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,400
(She would never harm a soul.)

382
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,920
(All she ever wanted)

383
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,920
(was a quiet, peaceful life,)

384
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,120
(for her family to be safe.)

385
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,960
(It was me who brought her to this.)

386
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,880
(If there's any justice,)

387
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,760
(let me be the one to bear it.)

388
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,000
(I, Shen Zaiye, swear before Heaven,)

389
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,840
(let the Buddhas be my witness,)

390
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,960
(may my lifespan)

391
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,080
(be exchanged for a chance
to save Jiang Taohua.)

392
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,128
(Just let her make it through this.)

393
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:26,509
♪If you walk away, looking back♪

394
00:21:26,834 --> 00:21:32,584
♪How many more years will I lose again?♪

395
00:21:32,584 --> 00:21:35,100
(Changsheng Hall)

396
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,000
My brother has been
searching for Jiang Taohua,

397
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,600
but there's still no sign of her.

398
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,840
Please, I pray to you

399
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,880
to keep her safe and sound.

400
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,280
I swear

401
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,120
that if Jiang Taohua comes back alive,

402
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,240
I'll rebuild every last statue
of the Heavenly Immortals

403
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,360
and give each ten big buns!

404
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,600
And also...

405
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,040
But you don't drink or eat meat, so...

406
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,560
What else would be good?

407
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,200
Miss Qingying,

408
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,240
take a look around.

409
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,360
Do you know where we are?

410
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,280
It's a temple.

411
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,040
The ones worshipped here

412
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,280
are all great sages,

413
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,520
bodhisattvas, and buddhas.

414
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,640
The Heavenly Immortals

415
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,240
are worshipped in Taoist temples.

416
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,720
There's a difference?

417
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,720
I'll say it again.

418
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,380
Dear Buddhas,
please don't take offense.

419
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,240
I'd better go light
a bigger incense stick

420
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,440
to make up for that slip.

421
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,080
That's not necessary.

422
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,120
Buddhas are enlightened beings.

423
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,880
They won't mind something so trivial.

424
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:42,960
Give that back!

425
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,680
Come on!

426
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:44,800
Come here!

427
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,280
Give it!

428
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:45,960
Hey!

429
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,080
Sir, please return my manuscript.

430
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,960
It took us forever
to win that girl over.

431
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,040
As soon as you showed up,

432
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,000
she outright ignored us.

433
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,520
You're just a broke scholar!

434
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,000
All you do is recite poems.

435
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,680
You ruined everything for me.

436
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,240
I should rip up your manuscript!

437
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,160
Look at you rat-faced
and weasel-eyed losers.

438
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,920
What kind of girl would fall for that?

439
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,520
You blame him for your own failings?

440
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,720
What a bunch of losers.

441
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,040
A feisty lady hero shows up.

442
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,360
Hot temper aside,

443
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,160
she's just my type.

444
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,240
Boys,

445
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,560
seize her.

446
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,080
I'd like to have a proper duel with her.

447
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,960
Stop right there!

448
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,320
So, Prince Wuxia is here too.

449
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,440
Is something the matter?

450
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,040
Temples are sacred places.

451
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,640
You'd really harass a woman
here of all places?

452
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,800
His Majesty loathes this behavior.

453
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,160
Perhaps

454
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,040
I should report this to him.

455
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,360
We're sorry.

456
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,520
It was just a joke.

457
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,280
Forget us.

458
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,960
We'll be on our way now.

459
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,680
We take our leave.

460
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,280
Hold up!

461
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:55,880
Gentlemen,

462
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,400
Mr. Li here is a dear friend

463
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,200
of mine and Prince Wuxia's.

464
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,080
You'd better not mess with him again.

465
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,000
Of course not, Miss.

466
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,120
No, never again.

467
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,720
Let me give you a word of advice.

468
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,600
Make peace, not grudges.

469
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,640
No more messing around, or else...

470
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,800
(I finally pulled it off once.)

471
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,080
Sorry about earlier.

472
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,160
I'm from the Liu household.

473
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,200
Next time we meet, let's be friends.

474
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,040
Why don't you

475
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,360
have a drink on me?

476
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,480
You're too kind.

477
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,360
It was just a misunderstanding.

478
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,960
You all look like refined gentlemen.

479
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,440
How about I share a poem?

480
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,160
A little literary exchange with friends?

481
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Sounds great!

482
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,560
- Wonderful!
- Excellent!

483
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,840
Dashing as legends of Song Yu go,

484
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,160
unmatched wit to be a true pillar.

485
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,280
Never short of intelligence,

486
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,520
courage bound to serve and blaze.

487
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,760
Eyes still wander when beauty comes.

488
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,640
- Great poem!
- Bravo!

489
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,920
What I meant was,

490
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,440
you have the looks of Song Yu,

491
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,520
and the knowledge of sages.

492
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,840
Exceptional gentlemen

493
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,480
with hearts loyal to the realm.

494
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:03,960
So of course,

495
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,360
it's only natural
to appreciate a pretty girl.

496
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,280
Well said, my friend!

497
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:09,720
You there!

498
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,960
Write that down for me.

499
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,720
Turn it into a scroll when we're back.

500
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,800
Hang it in my study!

501
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,320
Let's go.

502
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,480
Prince Wuxia, please carry on.

503
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,800
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

504
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,520
Mr. Li!

505
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,360
You...

506
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,960
What's so funny?

507
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,320
By the way,

508
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,520
aren't poems supposed
to come in couplets?

509
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,360
That poem only had five lines.

510
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,200
Something feels off.

511
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,880
If that bunch really knew what's right,

512
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,440
why would they have

513
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,880
no manners left?

514
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:44,760
So?

515
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,000
What is so funny about the poem?

516
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,680
D-U-N-C-E.

517
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,480
The first letters form a word!

518
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,000
You scholars really know

519
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,440
how to insult people without cursing.

520
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,740
(The manuscript.)

521
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,520
Mr. Li, that's a fine essay.

522
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,480
You flatter me, Mr. Mu.

523
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,960
It's just a rough draft.

524
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:07,880
Or perhaps...

525
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,600
I should call you Prince Wuxia.

526
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,320
It's just a title, nothing more.

527
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,840
Mr. Li, no need for modesty.

528
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,680
What you've written is excellent.

529
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,520
I'll be sure to recommend you.

530
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,640
Then, I'll polish it some more.

531
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,040
Thank you for the trouble.

532
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,040
Of course.

533
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:40,640
Chancellor.

534
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,600
You look exhausted.

535
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,600
Even your chess is slipping.

536
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,200
Shall I give you a little jolt?

537
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,720
Thank you, Your Majesty.

538
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,360
Sit.

539
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,960
I've been waiting for your report.

540
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,080
Do you know how long it's been?

541
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,480
Princess Chengping

542
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,920
came for the marriage alliance.

543
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,160
Now she's dead before the wedding.

544
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,560
Are you trying to start a war
between our nations?

545
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,160
How dare you!

546
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:44,960
Your Majesty.

547
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,920
I had no intention of provoking a war.

548
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,400
After the Princess fell from the cliff,

549
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,880
neither her body nor her remains

550
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,040
have been found.

551
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,720
Her fate remains unknown.

552
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,520
An all-out search is ongoing.

553
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,480
I wanted to report it

554
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,440
after finding her.

555
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,960
But your punishment is timely.

556
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,280
I failed to report it sooner.

557
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,040
I deserve it.

558
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,160
We must decide soon

559
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,120
whether she is dead

560
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,960
or alive.

561
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,240
A letter from Beiyuan says

562
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,760
they're sending a delegation.

563
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,240
If they ask about her whereabouts then,

564
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,880
we need an answer ready.

565
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,640
I put you

566
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:21,800
in charge of this.

567
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,960
You created this mess,

568
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,080
so you clean it up.

569
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:30,920
Yes.

570
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,360
I'll see to it right away.

571
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,640
(Shen Residence)

572
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,200
The Empress Lv sending a delegation now

573
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,320
is probably to rebuild the Lan Boutique.

574
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,480
They just won't relent.

575
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,800
Since they've come to us,

576
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,480
we can meet them.

577
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,080
But as for who comes,

578
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,880
I'll decide that myself.

579
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Make a list of the names

580
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,800
Zengtu mentioned.

581
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:08,840
Send it to Beiyuan.

582
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,000
Yes.

583
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,080
(Jiang Taohua,)

584
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,720
(Where in the world are you?)

585
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,840
(You must be alive,)

586
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:23,600
(aren't you?)

587
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,820
(Your dearest brother, Prince Changjue)

588
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:35,340
(Beiyuan Capital, Hao City)

589
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,800
How brazen.

590
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,000
(Preceptor of Beiyuan, Qian Mochen)
Shen Zaiye is just the Left Chancellor of Qi,

591
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,800
yet he dares
to appoint Beiyuan's emissaries.

592
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,400
Your Highness,

593
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,760
(Empress of Beiyuan, Lv Yuanhua)

594
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,960
the people appointed by Qi

595
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,520
more or less

596
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,560
have ties to Princess Chengping.

597
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,360
I noticed that too,

598
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,440
which makes me even more confused.

599
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,480
What exactly is he up to?

600
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,080
Your Highness,

601
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,760
if I may,

602
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,960
Shen Zaiye is usually very cautious.

603
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,160
For him to do this

604
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,160
must mean he has a plan.

605
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,720
As for what he wants,

606
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,320
digging too deep is futile.

607
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,480
It's better

608
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
to send more capable officials
with the delegation

609
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,400
and play it by ear?

610
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,760
You mustn't forget

611
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,120
the true purpose of this delegation.

612
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,000
You make a good point.

613
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,440
Then let's play along with it,

614
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,000
and see what he's really after.

615
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,880
The extra hands will be

616
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,880
personally selected by me.

617
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,560
I poured my heart and soul
into Lan Boutique.

618
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,000
Mu Wuyin, you useless fool.

619
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,560
You're good for nothing.

620
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,880
Your Highness, please calm down.

621
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,400
You must take care of your health.

622
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,480
Nanny Mei,

623
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,200
I'm feeling a bit unwell.

624
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,520
Go after the State Preceptor

625
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,800
and tell him to act as regent
starting tomorrow.

626
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,840
I'll be spending some time in seclusion.

627
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,280
Yes, Your Highness.

628
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,520
Chancellor.

629
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,840
Any clues?

630
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,680
We searched
the valley three more times.

631
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,880
We scoured every corner

632
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,960
within a hundred li.

633
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,520
Still nothing.

634
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,480
Chancellor,

635
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,760
should we just...

636
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,480
I'll lead the search tomorrow.

637
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:10,760
Wait.

638
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,360
Gather the patient logs

639
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,200
from every clinic within a hundred li.

640
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,200
I'll check them all.

641
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,440
Understood.

642
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,240
(Since there's no body,)

643
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,760
(there's still a sliver of hope.)

644
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,240
Chancellor,

645
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,960
(Visit Records)
visit records from city clinics.

646
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,160
What exactly are you trying to find?

647
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,120
(We've looked for so long
and found nothing.)

648
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,800
(What if she was rescued?)

649
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,040
(Falling from that height)

650
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,440
(must have injured her.)

651
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,000
(She'd have to see a physician.)

652
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,080
(Such fall injuries are rare cases.)

653
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,080
(By checking the medicine used,)

654
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,680
(and treatment records,)

655
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,880
(we might be able to find a lead.)

656
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,240
Chancellor.

657
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,440
You didn't sleep.

658
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,600
You should have some food.

659
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,080
(Shunjing Residence)
First of the ninth month.

660
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,040
Sixth of the ninth month.

661
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,280
And the thirteenth,

662
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,800
seventeenth,

663
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,560
and twentieth.

664
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,240
And the twenty-seventh.

665
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,200
Found it.

666
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,280
Lin's Clinic has been visiting

667
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,360
Prince Wuyin's residence
every few days.

668
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,840
Prince Wuyin has always been

669
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,040
around people who refine pills.

670
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,800
He's always been in good health.

671
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,320
Besides,

672
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,560
even if Prince Wuyin did fall ill,

673
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,200
they'd call for an imperial physician,

674
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,840
not a regular apothecary.

675
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,000
So you're saying,

676
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,320
the Princess might be in his residence?

677
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,280
It's still unclear.

678
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,080
Bring the portrait.

679
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:24,720
Come with me.

680
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,080
Yes, sir.

681
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:33,440
Hyah!

682
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:35,840
Whoa.

683
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:40,360
(Lin's Clinic)

684
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,160
Is Physician Lin in?

685
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:41,840
He's not here.

686
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,560
He's gone to Prince Wuyin's residence.

687
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,200
Let's go.

688
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:51,060
(Prince Wuyin's Residence)

689
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:51,660
(Serene and elegant)

690
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,080
Changjue!

691
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:04,680
Sister!

692
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,240
Stop!

693
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:05,960
Let go!

694
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,760
Sister!

695
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,800
(Special Envoy Princess Taohua,)

696
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,320
(titled Chengping,)

697
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,460
(shall be sent to Qi State
for the marriage alliance.)

698
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,580
(Shen Residence)

699
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,520
(Do you regret)

700
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:16,880
(marrying me?)

701
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,680
Your Highness, you're finally awake.

702
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,240
Here.

703
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,000
Your Highness, you have no idea

704
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,840
how worried I've been
these past few days.

705
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,320
I was afraid you wouldn't wake up.

706
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,840
I don't mean to jinx you.

707
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,800
But you're awake now.

708
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,200
Qingtai.

709
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,560
What happened to me?

710
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,280
When I found you,

711
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,800
you were covered in wounds.

712
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,040
Your Highness!

713
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,280
Your Highness! Where are you?

714
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,440
Your Highness!

715
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,480
Your Highness.

716
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,760
Your Highness, thank goodness!

717
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,480
I finally found you!

718
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:53,720
Your Highness.

719
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,400
I've tended to your wounds carefully.

720
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,280
They've healed quite a bit.

721
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,320
Your Highness, that was Yugui Mountain.

722
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,440
Falling from there and surviving

723
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,120
is nothing short of a miracle.

724
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,240
You're incredibly lucky.

725
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,920
Yugui Mountain...

726
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,240
Was that the mountain
we passed on the way to form

727
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,400
the marriage alliance?

728
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,320
Marriage alliance?

729
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,360
