1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,280
The wind and rain scatter and the clouds are still.

2
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,200
How can I stay alive

3
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,400
and watch the stars in the sky?

4
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,400
If I can stay with you in my life,

5
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,040
if you know my true feelings,

6
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,600
I will go through all the hardships

7
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,920
without any regrets.

8
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,200
Even if I am locked in this life,

9
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,160
I will go through all the hardships in this life.

10
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,640
The unwavering spirit of fate

11
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:23,740
has broken the

12
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:34,200
enemy's accompany.

13
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:51,740
The list of Tommy's

14
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:56,400
song

15
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,240
Episode venice

16
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:58,800
This is the confessingaina you want,

17
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,680
about the love letter.

18
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,920
Father said

19
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,840
it was sent to the study.

20
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,000
I hope you can be kind

21
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,520
and forgive the women of Meng family.

22
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,240
I won't do anything

23
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,280
like your father

24
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,560
and betray my trust.

25
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,280
Okay.

26
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:55,920
I'll filial piety

27
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,920
with

28
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,080
I'll give it to His Majesty.

29
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,520
His Majesty will definitely change his mind

30
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,760
and pay me back.

31
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,240
Father,

32
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,600
I'll always be loyal to the Xie family.

33
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,280
Father.

34
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,480
Not only did Meng Zhongyan confess his crime today,

35
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,720
I also found the love letter

36
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,800
written by Father.

37
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,000
Tao Hua,

38
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,680
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:39,680
I...

40
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,200
There's no need to apologize between us.

41
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,400
If you didn't

42
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,120
marry Her Highness for me,

43
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,080
I wouldn't have trusted you.

44
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,040
You know it all.

45
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,640
Don't worry.

46
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,520
I've ordered Zhan Lu and Dai Anwei

47
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,480
to go to the North Campus to find the antidote.

48
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,720
When I'm done with this,

49
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,400
I'll go to the North Campus with you.

50
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,480
Prime Minister,

51
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,240
you can just settle the matter of the ordinary.

52
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,760
Don't worry about me.

53
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,120
Tomorrow,

54
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,480
I'll go with Zhan Lu.

55
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,640
But how can I be at ease

56
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,360
when you go back alone?

57
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,120
There's Zhan Lu,

58
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,200
Qingtai,

59
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,520
and Anwei to protect me.

60
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,160
How can I go back alone?

61
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,880
And Changjue sent a letter today.

62
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,680
He said in the letter

63
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,960
that he had secretly

64
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,800
recruited many officials in Hao City

65
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,600
and got a lot of support.

66
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,960
Including Qian Mochen?

67
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,160
Changjue went to him for testing,

68
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,560
but he didn't know

69
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,840
that he was going to be sent out.

70
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,480
Fortunately, we've reminded Changjue

71
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,800
before.

72
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,040
He's been paying attention to it.

73
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,120
Qian Mochen didn't know his whereabouts.

74
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,120
That's good.

75
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,680
So you can relax.

76
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,360
When I'm in Hao City,

77
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,360
Changjue will help me find the antidote.

78
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,200
I'm just worried

79
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,240
that you've always been behind Changjue.

80
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,160
I can't bear to trust him.

81
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,560
Changjue is my biological brother.

82
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,120
I'll tell him

83
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,520
if I need his help.

84
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,680
Don't worry.

85
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,760
Then you have to promise me

86
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,480
to take good care of yourself.

87
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,320
After this thing is over,

88
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,360
I'll go meet you right away.

89
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,640
Okay.

90
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,760
I promise you.

91
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,080
Are you sure

92
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,720
about tomorrow's court?

93
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:43,960
Don't worry.

94
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,600
I've prepared everything.

95
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,520
The court is about to begin.

96
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,840
His Majesty is here.

97
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,920
Changjue.

98
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,000
They keep me 싫rooming in Changjue.

99
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,760
As your highness,

100
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,160
You should accept

101
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:42,480
the

102
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,200
drinks.

103
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,840
Your Majesty,

104
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,680
I've interrogated the criminal Meng Zhongyan.

105
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,920
I found that apart from the crime of treason,

106
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,600
he was also charged with treason 18 years ago

107
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,720
and hid it from you.

108
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,800
Meng Fan has written a confession.

109
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,400
Please allow me to report it.

110
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,560
I'm very unwell today.

111
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,440
I'll take the medicine another day.

112
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,600
Summon the imperial physician.

113
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:14,760
Father,

114
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,000
the imperial physician is about to invite guests.

115
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,280
You can rest.

116
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,880
I'll interrogate him for you.

117
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,040
Prime Minister,

118
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,480
please forgive Meng Fan for his crime.

119
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,040
According to Meng Fan's confession,

120
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,120
the case of the five-fifth case 18 years ago

121
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,120
was planned by him.

122
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,680
He used the evidence to frame Princess Shu

123
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,000
and hid the confession of the murder of his brother Xie Guan Yu,

124
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,280
the son of Xie's family.

125
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,200
The reason for the confession

126
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,640
is that he pretended to be innocent

127
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,320
and led the army to kill the Xie family.

128
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,920
The reason for this

129
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,320
is that Xie Guan Yu proposed to take the case

130
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,000
to the interests of his first family in the court.

131
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,080
I've found Xie Guan Yu's confession

132
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,800
in the dream

133
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,560
and submitted it to Meng Fan's confession.

134
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,440
I conduct an Filial Associating Bureau investigation.

135
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,400
Father.

136
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,320
Meng Fan lied to His Majesty

137

to raise a crime

140
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,680
such as hiding the confession.

141
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,000
Father, please follow the order

142
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,360
and reinsinitize the case.

144
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,560
and set the record high.

145
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,280
You want to kill me?

146
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,280
What's the difference between

147
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,280
you and Mu Wuying and Meng Zhongyan?

148
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,280
What Meng Fan did

149
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,280
is a crime against the law.

150
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,280
What we want is to stir up the rebellion.

151
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,280
How can we be one?

152
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,280
Now,

153
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,280
it seems that I should have

154
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,280
underestimated you before.

155
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,280
You sold your heart

156
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,280
much better than your three brothers.

157
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,280
You let Zuo Xiang

158
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,280
take the lead.

159
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,280
Good.

160
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,280
Then you will be

161
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,280
in charge of my position today.

162
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,280
You decide

163
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,280
what you want to do.

164
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,280
Father, please wait.

165
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,280
You want to rebel too?

166
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,280
I dare not.

167
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,280
I'm just talking about the past.

168
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,280
The case of Wugu

169
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,280
is really hard to convince.

170
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,280
Good.

171
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,280
You

172
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,280
and you.

173
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,280
You two stay.

174
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,280
Others, leave.

175
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,280
The case of Wugu

176
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,280
You rebel against Wugu

177
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,280
because of your mother.

178
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,280
Then I ask you, Zuo Xiang,

179
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,280
why are you?

180
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,280
I am Xie Guanyu's son,

181
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,280
Xie Jing'an.

182
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,280
Jing'an,

183
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,280
you are still alive.

184
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,280
The Xie family was killed

185
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,280
and the whole family was killed.

186
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,280
Are you sure

187
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,280
you have been around me for more than ten years?

188
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,280
What is the danger?

189
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,280
According to the law,

190
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,280
I should be sentenced to

191
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,280
the crime of deceiving the emperor.

192
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,280
Father,

193
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,280
it has been ten years

194
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,280
since my cousin was able to live.

195
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,280
I have been waiting for ten years

196
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,280
to help the court.

197
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,280
I have done a lot of work.

198
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,280
Shut up.

199
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,280
The case of Wugu

200
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,280
is impossible

201
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,280
if I am alive.

202
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,280
Meng Zhongyan deceived the emperor

203
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,280
and didn't do it.

204
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,280
The other families

205
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,280
have been trying to win the power

206
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,280
but the emperor didn't do it.

207
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,280
I am innocent

208
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,280
and I just hope that I can clear my name.

209
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,280
Are you not clear enough?

210
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,280
Or you don't want to admit

211
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,280
that Meng Zhongyan

212
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,280
is just a murderer?

213
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,280
And you

214
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,280
are the one who knows the truth.

215
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,280
You are so bold.

216
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,280
Your Majesty,

217
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,280
I have been your only son

218
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,280
for ten years.

219
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,280
I have fought for you

220
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,280
and fought for you.

221
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,280
But I am different from my father.

222
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,280
I won't be a victim

223
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,280
of your sacrifice.

224
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,280
Now the world

225
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,280
knows the truth about Wugu.

226
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,280
The Qing Dynasty

227
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,280
won't cover up for you.

228
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,280
After a hundred years,

229
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,280
do you want to be the emperor

230
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,280
who is free from the law

231
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,280
and kills the loyal subjects?

232
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,280
Or do you want to be

233
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,280
a wise emperor

234
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,280
who knows the wrong and is capable?

235
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,280
Father,

236
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,280
Li Dian and Li Xue

237
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,280
are working for you.

238
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,280
What?

239
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,280
You dare to threaten me?

240
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,280
Aren't you afraid that I will kill you?

241
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,280
Your Majesty,

242
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,280
I have been wronged

243
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,280
for what I said today.

244
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,280
But this is my

245
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,280
last warning.

246
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,280
What do you want to do?

247
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,280
I have decided

248
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,280
to resign from the position of premier

249
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,280
and return to the world.

250
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,280
Before I leave,

251
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,280
I beg you

252
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,280
to re-examine Wugu

253
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,280
and return Xie's family

254
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,280
and the fourth prince

255
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,280
and your future wife,

256
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,280
Princess Shu.

257
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,280
Re-examine!

258
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,280
The will of Wugu

259
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,280
is in the law.

260
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,280
If the law is not clear,

261
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,280
it will be misled

262
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,280
and the loyal subjects will be killed.

263
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,280
Now I have found out the truth

264
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,280
and I am hereby moving this edict.

265
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,280
I am sorry

266
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,280
for the misdeed

267
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,280
and misguidance.

268
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,280
I will be back

269
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,280
to the world

270
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,280
and I will be back

271
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,280
to the world.

272
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,280
The loyal subjects Xie Guan Yu and his family

273
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,280
have been framed

274
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,280
and are accused of being innocent.

275
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,280
To restore Xie Guan Yu,

276
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,280
all officials are in position.

277
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,280
Princess Shu's decision

278
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,280
is a good one.

279
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,280
I am hereby

280
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,280
to inform the world.

281
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,280
Father, mother,

282
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,280
I have been wronged by Xie's family.

283
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,280
I hope you can rest in peace

284
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,280
before you die.

285
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,280
Have you got on the horse?

286
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,280
I think my uncle's spirit

287
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,280
can rest in peace now.

288
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,280
Brother, are you really leaving?

289
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,280
I can't bear to leave you.

290
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,280
I can't bear to leave you either.

291
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,280
Right?

292
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,280
You can't even talk.

293
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,280
Qingying, don't be ridiculous.

294
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,280
Tao Hua has gone to the North Court.

295
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,280
She is waiting for me.

296
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,280
Then you should come back to visit us often.

297
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,280
No, we should go to the North Court to visit you often.

298
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,280
Mu Xia, will you accompany me?

299
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,280
Mu Xia will be

300
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,280
the ruler of the country in the future.

301
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,280
How can you just go to other countries?

302
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,280
But you, Qingying,

303
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,280
should be more mature.

304
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,280
You are about to be a concubine soon.

305
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,280
Brother, you should be mature too.

306
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,280
But you are about to be a consort.

307
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,280
Mu Xia,

308
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,280
Qingying has lost her father.

309
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,280
I spoiled her.

310
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,280
You should be more careful in the future.

311
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,280
We are friends.

312
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,280
You don't have to be so polite.

313
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,280
I understand, cousin.

314
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,280
How dare you!

315
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,280
Cousin,

316
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,280
Daqi will always have your position.

317
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,280
I am a secret agent.

318
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,280
I have been in the prison for many years.

319
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,280
I have only one wish.

320
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,280
My last wish is to solve the case of the criminal Wu Gu.

321
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,280
I want to clear my name

322
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,280
and help you grow up.

323
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,280
I want to protect you.

324
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,280
For the past ten years,

325
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,280
I have been a minister,

326
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,280
a son,

327
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,280
and a brother.

328
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,280
I have done everything

329
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,280
to keep my promise.

330
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,280
Now the truth is out.

331
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,280
You are about to be the crown prince of Daqi.

332
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,280
My only wish

333
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,280
is to be the main character of the play.

334
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,280
But I have failed.

335
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,280
I have failed to keep my promise.

336
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,280
I have been with her for so long.

337
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,280
In that case,

338
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,280
I hope you and your wife can take care of yourself

339
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,280
and achieve your dream.

340
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,280
The road ahead is long.

341
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,280
Daqi,

342
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,280
I will count on you.

343
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,280
Cuiwei,

344
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,280
I am back safely.

345
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,280
You don't have to worry about me.

346
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,280
Your Highness, you are exaggerating.

347
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,280
The other day,

348
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,280
Your Highness met Mu Wuyin.

349
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,280
I was in Luozhou.

350
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,280
I was looking for you.

351
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,280
I sent people

352
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,280
to Qi Valley to find you.

353
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,280
Fortunately,

354
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,280
they didn't go against the order

355
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,280
and found you.

356
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,280
Everyone thought I was dead.

357
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,280
I don't know

358
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,280
there is a secret passage in the bedroom.

359
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,280
I was there

360
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,280
and I ran away from the King of Qi

361
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,280
without knowing it.

362
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,280
I didn't expect

363
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,280
I would be saved again.

364
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,280
Your Highness, you are blessed.

365
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,280
You can be saved.

366
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,280
I was away for a while.

367
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,280
Is Hao Du moving?

368
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,280
Your Highness,

369
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,280
Jiang Changjue came to Hao Du.

370
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,280
He found

371
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,280
he not only tried to contact the State Preceptor,

372
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,280
but also contacted the Governor of Yue.

373
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,280
They want to

374
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,280
establish a new government at the meeting tomorrow.

375
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,280
Jiang Changjue

376
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,280
lives in a private house

377
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,280
arranged by the Governor of Yue.

378
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,280
Take someone to kill Jiang Changjue

379
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,280
and bring his head to the gate.

380
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,280
Yes.

381
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,280
The news from Qi Valley

382
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,280
said that

383
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,280
the Empress Lv and Mu Wuyin

384
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,280
were all buried in the fire.

385
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,280
I have asked Governor of Yue

386
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,280
to gather all the ministers

387
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,280
who support us.

388
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,280
Tomorrow, we will

389
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,280
change the date together.

390
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,280
Yes.

391
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,280
Your Highness,

392
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,280
I found a stranger in the courtyard.

393
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,280
He looks like Cuiwei.

394
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,280
Your Highness,

395
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,280
we can't stay here for long.

396
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,280
Let's go to the backyard.

397
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,280
Hurry up.

398
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,280
Cuiwei,

399
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,280
the person has escaped.

400
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,280
Well,

401
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,280
you go to the dark house first.

402
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,280
I have to inform Governor of Yue.

403
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,280
Your Highness,

404
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,280
I'll go with you.

405
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,280
You have to go to the court tomorrow.

406
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,280
You can't go out.

407
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,280
Okay, that's fine.

408
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,280
Juren, come with me.

409
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,280
Hurry up.

410
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,280
Go.

411
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,280
Go.

412
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,280
Why did you betray me?

413
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,280
You will die

414
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,280
for Cuiwei.

415
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,280
Hurry up.

416
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,280
Don't let them escape.

417
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,280
Commander Cui,

418
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,280
our spy

419
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,280
around Jiang Changjue is dead.

420
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,280
Useless.

421
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,280
Commander Cui,

422
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,280
it seems that he went that way.

423
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,280
Go after him.

424
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,280
He is lost.

425
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,280
How can I explain to you?

426
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,280
Divide a team

427
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,280
and go to the ambush outside Yuezhong City.

428
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,280
If Jiang Changjue shows up,

429
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,280
I'll take him down right away.

430
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,280
Go after him.

431
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,280
The Empress is still alive.

432
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,280
The Empress is here.

433
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,280
Greetings, Your Highness.

434
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,280
I'm here to take care of His Majesty.

435
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,280
You can leave now.

436
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,280
Yes.

437
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,280
Stay.

438
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,280
I order you to stay.

439
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,280
Stay.

440
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,280
Back then,

441
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,280
His Majesty was also a man of style

442
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,280
and was angry with Prince Xuan.

443
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,280
Now he is so weak.

444
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,280
It's really annoying.

445
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:49,280
I'm not good enough for you.

446
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,280
Don't forget.

447
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,280
Back then,

448
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,280
I was just a dancer in the Sixth Ward.

449
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,280
Yes, Your Majesty.

450
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,280
You're not good enough for me.

451
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,280
I was born with a lowly background.

452
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,280
I was humiliated in Qi State.

453
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,280
After I fled to the North Courtyard,

454
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,280
I became a dancer.

455
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,280
One day, I was only injured by a sprain.

456
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,280
I couldn't show my power.

457
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,280
I was a guest here.

458
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,280
Xia Ling asked me to stand on the ice

459
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,280
and dance.

460
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,280
Since then,

461
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,280
I've been unable to dance or do anything.

462
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,280
I couldn't be a mother

463
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,280
because of the toxic body.

464
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,280
The last branch of my family

465
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,280
was crushed in the North Courtyard.

466
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,280
I looked for it everywhere.

467
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,280
I finally found out

468
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,280
who I was.

469
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,280
It's you, Your Majesty.

470
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,280
I can't remember.

471
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,280
I have...

472
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,280
Your Majesty,

473
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:21,280
try to feel the sense of despair.

474
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,280
It's like what I felt back then.

475
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,280
You...

476
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,280
Are you crazy?

477
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,280
In order to take revenge on you,

478
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,280
I tried my best to approach you

479
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,280
and get close to you.

480
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,280
I tried my best to get close to you

481
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,280
and get close to you.

482
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,280
I tried my best to get close to you.

483
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,280
Finally, you gave me a name.

484
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,280
So...

485
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,280
You're still not satisfied?

486
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,280
How can that be enough?

487
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,280
I gradually got involved in the court

488
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,280
and listened to the government.

489
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,280
I found

490
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,280
the fun that I had never experienced.

491
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,280
Between the two,

492
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,280
I could set a person to die.

493
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,280
I, Lv Yuanhua,

494
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,280
finally don't need to be humiliated anymore.

495
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,280
They all fear me.

496
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,280
Now I've been in charge of the court for almost ten years.

497
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,280
I should have been the one

498
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,280
to take the throne of the North Courtyard.

499
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,280
You're a pig.

500
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,280
Someone,

501
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,280
please help me.

502
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,280
Someone, please help me.

503
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,280
After I take the throne,

504
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,280
I'll kill all your soldiers

505
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,280
and soldiers.

506
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,280
I'll kill all of them.

507
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,280
The North Courtyard

508
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,280
Look, Zha Long.

509
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,280
That's the famous wine of Haodu.

510
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,280
And over there.

511
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,280
Look.

512
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,280
The small town of Haodu

513
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,280
has been sealed for a long time.

514
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,280
Lv Heng,

515
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,280
I was trapped in the high walls by you.

516
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,280
In my dreams, I was free.

517
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,280
Now,

518
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,280
your ambitions and sins

519
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,280
have been burned out.

520
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,280
This time,

521
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,280
no one can stop me and Lord Chang

522
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,280
from taking back everything that belongs to us.

523
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,280
The North Courtyard

524
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,280
The Empress is here.

525
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,280
The Empress is here.

526
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,280
It's been a long time.

527
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,280
How are you?

528
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,280
We wish you good health.

529
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,280
I'm back safely.

530
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,280
My dear ministers,

531
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,280
why are you all crying?

532
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,280
Did you forget

533
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,280
what your master wanted?

534
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,280
I heard that Jiang Changjue entered Haodu.

535
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,280
You were the first one to be elected.

536
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,280
The messenger Jiang Changjue sent

537
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,280
was ordered by me

538
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,280
to leave the city in a mess.

539
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,280
At that time,

540
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,280
Commander Cui was a guest in the mansion.

541
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,280
He could be my witness.

542
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,280
Today is the meeting of the new emperor.

543
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,280
Who will give the memorial to the emperor first?

544
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,280
Your Highness,

545
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,280
since no one is here,

546
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,280
I have something to report.

547
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,280
Commander Cui, please.

548
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,280
Your Highness,

549
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,280
His Majesty has been in good health

550
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,280
for ten years.

551
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,280
The state affairs are very important.

552
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,280
We welcome Your Highness to listen to the government.

553
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,280
Now, in order to stabilize the state affairs

554
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,280
and reassure the people,

555
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,280
Your Highness should follow the will of the people

556
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,280
and take charge of the state affairs.

557
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,280
Your Highness,

558
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,280
regardless of the dynasty,

559
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,280
if there is no woman to ascend the throne,

560
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,280
I don't believe that His Majesty

561
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,280
will pass the edict to you.

562
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,280
I want to see His Majesty.

563
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,280
I want to see His Majesty.

564
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,280
I forgot to tell you

565
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,280
that His Majesty died last night.

566
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,280
What?

567
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,280
The heir, Jiang Changjue,

568
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,280
died in an unfortunate accident.

569
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,280
Your Highness,

570
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,280
without the edict,

571
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,280
we will not accept you.

572
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,280
Commander Cui,

573
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,280
I'm very annoyed

574
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,280
by your words.

575
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,280
You are very stubborn.

576
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,280
You have wronged Her Highness.

577
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,280
Take her down and kill her.

578
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:24,280
I will die for the sake of the state affairs.

579
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,280
From now on,

580
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,280
you can't pass the edict.

581
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,280
Everyone,

582
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,280
who else is suspicious?

583
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,280
We are all guilty.

584
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,280
I hope everyone will keep their duty.

585
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,280
Don't blame yourself for destroying your future.

586
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,280
You can all leave.

587
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,280
Thank you, Your Highness.

588
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,280
State Preceptor, please wait.

589
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,280
Let's go up and talk.

590
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,280
Your Highness.

591
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,280
State Preceptor,

592
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:22,460
you are going to be a

593
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,280
What should I do?

594
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,280
His Majesty died,

595
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,280
and the heir is missing.

596
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,280
So many things happened in the North Campus.

597
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,280
Zhan Lu,

598
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,280
did they find out the truth?

599
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,280
Did they hear it wrong?

600
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,280
There will be no mistake.

601
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,280
We were all deceived by

602
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,280
Marquis Lv's gold hairpin and the tinkerer.

603
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,280
No one knows

604
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,280
how he came back to the North Campus.

605
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,280
How can I tell Her Highness?

606
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,280
Your Highness.

607
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,280
Your Highness.

608
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,280
Your Highness.

609
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,280
I've heard it.

610
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,280
Now,

611
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:16,280
the most important thing is to find Chang Juan.

612
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,280
Let's go find Qian Mochen.

613
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,280
We have found Qian Mochen's whereabouts.

614
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,280
We are here to report.

615
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,280
I see. Go.

616
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,280
Go.

617
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,280
Prince Liancheng,

618
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,280
come with me.

619
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,280
I'm up and about.

620
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,280
Go.

621
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,280
Go.

622
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,280
Go.

623
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,280
Prince Liancheng,

624
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,280
go.

625
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,280
Go.

626
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,280
Go.

627
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,280
Go.

628
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,280
Go.

629
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,280
Go.

630
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,280
Go.

631
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,280
Go.

632
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,280
Prince Liancheng.

633
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,280
Prince Liancheng.

634
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,280
It's all because of you.

635
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,280
Let's go.

636
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,280
Go.

637
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,280
Let's go.

638
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,360
to return to the State of Gu

639
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,840
just to blame

640
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,240
the betrayal of the old uncle?

641
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,240
If you want to eat, you have to exchange it for money.

642
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,760
You damn Yinsuo.

643
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,720
How can you use the young master

644
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,840
to be a favor to you?

645
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,240
Don't you dare to act!

646
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,440
That's the life lock left by the Queen Mother to my sister.

647
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,680
You crazy girl!

648
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,400
Changjue, are you okay?

649
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,680
Sister, why doesn't father

650
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,960
come to protect us?

651
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,200
What's wrong with us?

652
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,240
I'm willing to change it.

653
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,640
The life lock is back.

654
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,040
Here, I'll return it to you.

655
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,800
Who are you?

656
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,880
My surname is Qian, and my name is Mochen.

657
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,400
I'm a tourist from the Jianghu River.

658
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,920
I've been blessed by the Queen of Helan

659
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,320
and I'm here to repay your kindness.

660
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,760
Mother.

661
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,520
She's gone.

662
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,000
I'll take care of you

663
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,680
until you're strong enough

664
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,200
to protect yourself.

665
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,120
This is the palace.

666
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,120
It's hard for you to come in.

667
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,360
Qian Mou, Zutong, Jing Shi, Zi Qi,

668
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,680
and the three elements

669
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,520
have been defeated by the State.

670
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,560
Can we

671
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,320
worship you as our master?

672
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,000
That's what I meant.

673
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,840
I came to you for Changjue.

674
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,880
I've been in the city for days

675
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,000
and I couldn't find Changjue.

676
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,040
This has something to do with you.

677
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,760
Do you know that

678
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,160
the Queen of Lv is still alive?

679
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,920
She wants to ascend the throne.

680
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,920
If that's the case,

681
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,080
I'll have to find Changjue as soon as possible.

682
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,040
Tell me, where is Changjue?

683
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,840
I don't know.

684
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,080
But I've sent people

685
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,720
to look for Changjue everywhere.

686
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,520
You have such a good heart?

687
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,640
Have you asked His Majesty about it?

688
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,640
His Majesty passed away.

689
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,600
Since you know,

690
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,760
I have an important thing

691
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,520
to give you.

692
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,520
What is it?

693
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,120
The will of His Majesty to pass the throne to Changjue

694
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,440
is in my hands.

695
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,880
You know nothing

696
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,000
and you can't be aware of it.

697
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,160
Flowers fall and the north wind blows.

698
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,880
The city is in a mess.

699
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,400
The petals are withered.

700
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,720
My heart is in a mess.

701
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,840
Flowers fall and tears fall.

702
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,720
My heart is in a mess.

703
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:52,440
I have nowhere to go.

704
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:55,300
My heart is in a mess.

705
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,660
My15

706
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,220
My heart is in a mess.

707
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,900
My heart is in a mess.

708
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:03,700
No one knows how...

709
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:06,940
How they semua

710
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,500
spaces干

711
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,340
Yeah.

712
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:21,060
Dilraba If you stand by me

713
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,880
I will give you jade.

714
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:58,920
No need to tell

715
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:09,920
How to love like him crazy

716
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:16,920
Not afraid to be surprised by the world

717
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:23,920
Believe me, he said something related to the painting

718
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:32,920
It turns out that he has a heart of gold
