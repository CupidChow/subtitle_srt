1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,140
Have a good day.

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,160
He has no right to deceive the Prime Minister.

3
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,560
It's your mostly responsible layer.

4
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:21,640
I should go read the

5
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:26,160
His Majesty's list of Library Killed fully.

6
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,440
If I only let you go,

7
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,600
you'll be charged with a false charge.

8
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,440
But...

9
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,520
Don't worry.

10
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,520
I've already thought of someone

11
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,560
who can take us out of the mansion

12
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,760
and won't make you suspect anything.

13
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,080
You're a hero.

14
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,480
How dare you dislike me?

15
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,400
Watch this!

16
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,240
Such a big fire.

17
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,760
Did His Highness annoy you?

18
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,120
No.

19
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,440
I'm fine.

20
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,440
Why are you angry with him?

21
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,080
I just heard you say that His Highness disliked you.

22
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,720
Could it be that

23
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,320
Qingying is

24
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,040
a mischievous girl

25
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,080
who likes His Highness?

26
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,040
You're so smart.

27
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,480
How can you guess everything?

28
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:12,880
Fine.

29
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,600
I was rejected by Meng Wuxia.

30
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,520
You're not related to my brother.

31
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,600
Just let it go.

32
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,560
Do you want to know

33
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,000
why your brother and I are so close?

34
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,040
I can teach you.

35
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,040
He rejected me.

36
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,360
I don't want to be close to him.

37
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,280
But there's more than one man in the world.

38
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,040
If you meet another man in the future,

39
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,680
it will be useful.

40
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,720
You've been here for a long time.

41
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,080
What are you talking about?

42
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,160
This is a secret between us.

43
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:46,960
I won't tell you.

44
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,320
Let's go.

45
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,680
Your Highness.

46
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,640
Your Highness.

47
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,640
Your Highness.

48
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,080
According to the order,

49
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,440
they took our men back

50
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,840
and ordered Wang Xi to let everything go well

51
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,920
in the Fourth Prince's Mansion.

52
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,400
The killers couldn't hold it back

53
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,960
and appeared in front of the Fourth Prince's Mansion again.

54
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,560
Let's go.

55
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,480
Is this okay?

56
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,560
A gentleman is good at teasing a lady.

57
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,000
Sometimes,

58
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,080
we girls need to use some external force

59
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,600
to attract the man we like.

60
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,080
Who's the ugly ghost in the mirror?

61
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,680
Why did you draw it like this?

62
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,200
I'm so sorry, Qingying.

63
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,600
I didn't paint the rouge for anyone.

64
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,200
I accidentally made a mistake.

65
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:58,920
How about this?

66
00:04:59,160 --> 00:04:59,800
Hurry up.

67
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,280
Help her paint it.

68
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:02,960
Otherwise,

69
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,600
if I affect your business,

70
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,000
I'll be a big sinner.

71
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,360
Yes.

72
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,160
Come on.

73
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,240
Don't worry, Miss.

74
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,680
Let me help you.

75
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,260
You swim.

76
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,540
So I can collid you.

77
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,520
When did you start to paint it?

78
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,120
I've used it since high school.

79
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,120
You can't say you're good at it.

80
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,200
Put it back.

81
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,520
Get in here.

82
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,160
Now it's not painted correctly.

83
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:14,840
Your Highness.

84
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:15,820
Thus,

85
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,880
Strange flowers were

86
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,740
Then why did the red call of the red Code

87
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,000
onto her neck?

88
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,720
Jiang Taohua.

89
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,480
Jiang Taohua

90
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,760
left me again.

91
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,080
But Jiang Taohua is right.

92
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,920
There are thousands of men in this world.

93
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,040
I should learn a better one.

94
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,200
Go.

95
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,680
You smelly smelly.

96
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,600
What's your problem?

97
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,240
If you're here,

98
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,520
you should be polite to me.

99
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,560
Tell your lord

100
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,440
when I'm in a good mood,

101
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,720
he'll regret

102
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,120
what he did today.

103
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,160
You're just wasting time.

104
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,240
Go, go, go.

105
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,520
Here's your book.

106
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,160
Who is she?

107
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,600
She's a person who's been helping others.

108
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,640
If you feel wronged,

109
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,280
I'll tell you.

110
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,200
I'll help you get out.

111
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:15,880
No need.

112
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,360
But the article I wrote

113
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,640
wasn't liked by her lordship.

114
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,080
I'll vote for another one.

115
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,480
If the article wasn't liked by others,

116
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,440
it's all because of the sound of the gun.

117
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,600
I don't want to let others know.

118
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,520
Why are you still so indifferent?

119
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,280
My article wasn't liked by others

120
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,800
doesn't mean I'm not talented.

121
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,960
It means the people who read the article

122
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,680
are blind and don't know what's on their mind.

123
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,760
There's a way to be a man of virtue.

124
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,840
It's hard to find a soulmate.

125
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,240
If I can't find a soulmate,

126
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,840
I'll just write this article.

127
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,600
This character is like me.

128
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,800
It's like a fairy tale.

129
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,480
He's tall, tall, and has a good figure.

130
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,640
He's just a little thin.

131
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,640
It's okay.

132
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,480
You'll get fat.

133
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,760
There are millions of men in the world.

134
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,440
I just found one when I went out.

135
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,200
Wait.

136
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,600
What's your name?

137
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,520
I'm Li Jiao Han.

138
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:18,840
Li Jiao.

139
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,720
We met in this huge Yujing City.

140
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,560
It's fate.

141
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,640
Today is a good day.

142
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,600
Why don't we go to Tai Lake together?

143
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,600
Look at the melon.

144
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,040
Fresh melon.

145
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,000
Look at the melon.

146
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,680
Look.

147
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,800
Look.

148
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,400
Where are they?

149
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,040
I've done my job.

150
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,120
It's hard to find a soulmate.

151
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,080
My Lord.

152
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,320
The poison bag has been taken out.

153
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,400
You must have heard my name

154
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,640
in Yujing.

155
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,720
Tell me what you know.

156
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,240
I'll give you a good time.

157
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,720
I can't bear it.

158
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,120
Shen Xing is so capable.

159
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,160
But you, Yan Zhi,

160
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,560
have many ways to kill yourself.

161
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,960
He wants to bite the snake.

162
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,880
Take him away.

163
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,680
Make sure to find something.

164
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,240
Yes.

165
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,760
Go.

166
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,840
It's strange.

167
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,360
Killers always take the target as the limit

168
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,600
and kill them with a blow.

169
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,120
But why do these killers

170
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,840
wander in the street

171
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,600
and die in the same place?

172
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:06,880
Zhang Luo.

173
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,800
Where is the Fourth Prince?

174
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,800
In the Five-Six District.

175
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,680
Let's go.

176
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,560
Go to the Five-Six District.

177
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,120
If you want to borrow books,

178
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,280
please register here.

179
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,360
The Five-Six District is the fourth prince's book.

180
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,600
Oh, no.

181
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,360
This...

182
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:08,760
Step aside.

183
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:09,880
Step aside.

184
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,040
Step aside.

185
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,120
Step aside.

186
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,760
Mu Wu Xiang.

187
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,120
You're here to collect books too?

188
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:21,920
Yes.

189
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,080
You just came out.

190
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,600
Yes.

191
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,240
Whose book is this?

192
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,600
What book is this?

193
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,120
Is it good?

194
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,840
This is the Book of God.

195
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,880
Please read it.

196
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:49,760
Okay.

197
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,760
The scholar who is with Miss Qingying.

198
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,120
Who is she?

199
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,600
Miss Qingying.

200
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,120
The God of War

201
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,320
Why are you

202
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,960
here?

203
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,120
I was thinking of giving Qingying and Fourth Prince a surprise.

204
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,560
I didn't expect you to be the one who broke the spell.

205
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,240
Don't tell anyone about it.

206
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,120
What surprise?

207
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,760
Qingying is interested in Fourth Prince.

208
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,720
Fourth Prince is also interested in Qingying.

209
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,960
I knew that Fourth Prince would come here.

210
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,400
So I wanted to hide the red rope in advance.

211
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,520
By then,

212
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,720
I'll tell him that Qingying made it for him

213
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,840
to make it work.

214
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,360
She must have seen some comentaries on you,

215
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,920
like what exactly you said.

216
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,760
But be careful.

217
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:30,840
Mm.

218
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,140
So have you seen

219
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,400
Fourth Prince around?

220
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,280
No.

221
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:42,800
By the way,

222
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,000
why did you come here suddenly?

223
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:47,700
Zhan Lu and I

224
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,500
I haven't seen any

225
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,500
of the opera operas.

226
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,700
Maybe he ran away.

227
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:55,940
Where is Jingyi?

228
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,340
She should be nearby.

229
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,460
I'll go find her.

230
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,940
It's not peaceful in the city recently.

231
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:05,900
You should be careful.

232
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,700
You should be careful, too.

233
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,700
The Emperor's Residence

234
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:32,900
My Lord.

235
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:34,980
Did you find her?

236
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:35,780
Yes.

237
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,940
Her Highness and Miss Qingying are on a trip.

238
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:39,940
Where is she?

239
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:40,780
Who?

240
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,540
Her Highness just left.

241
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,620
I think she went to the main street.

242
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,660
Do you think...

243
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,580
Search the whole place.

244
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,700
See if there's anything wrong.

245
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,220
Yes.

246
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,140
What's your name, sir?

247
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,180
Her surname is Zhu.

248
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,460
She's fat, fat, and has many friends.

249
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,220
Anyway,

250
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,140
she's a stupid pig who can't solve the problem.

251
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,460
No.

252
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,540
How dare you say that?

253
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,540
No.

254
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,020
I mean the pigs you just listed

255
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,860
are not the same as the pigs with the surname Zhu.

256
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,540
My surname is Mu.

257
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,620
I'm Li Jiao Han.

258
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,620
Mr. Mu and I have never met before.

259
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,820
We have to enjoy the scenery together.

260
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,500
Are you familiar with Miss Qingying?

261
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,580
I...

262
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,060
I just think that

263
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,940
the scenery is beautiful and it's a bit sad.

264
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,060
I just want to enjoy the scenery.

265
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,700
It's obvious that you insist on sitting with us.

266
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,300
Now you're being sarcastic.

267
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,580
What are you doing in front of Li?

268
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,100
No one is begging you.

269
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,300
I... I...

270
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:13,980
Lian Xiaobian.

271
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,700
I saw it just now.

272
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,420
You were in front of Li several times.

273
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,260
If you don't want to be with us,

274
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,140
just go.

275
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,060
I'm not going.

276
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:21,620
Be careful.

277
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,100
I'm not going.

278
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:22,860
We're going together.

279
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,340
Go.

280
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:23,860
Go.

281
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,380
Your Highness.

282
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:43,820
My second brother.

283
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:56,620
Your father.

284
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:57,540
Your Highness.

285
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,420
You failed in the palace test.

286
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,900
I just want to be by your side.

287
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,460
So I'm just some…

288
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:06,740
Forebearing daughter-in-law.

289
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:07,860
Your Majesty.

290
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,420
Are you reading the God's Way recently?

291
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:15,660
A magic book.

292
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:16,540
A magic book.

293
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,940
Have you read it, Mr. Mu?

294
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,620
If you haven't, you must have a try.

295
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:30,060
Do you really think it's a magic book?

296
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,060
But the bookshelves' emergency boards

297
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,140
are all criticism words to him.

298
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,900
It seems that people don't like him.

299
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:43,420
Everyone says that the God's Way

300
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,300
is a childish work of escaping reality and ideal.

301
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,180
But I think

302
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,020
what they say is a dog's shit.

303
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,020
If we get the book,

304
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,860
the one Jiang Kun wants,

305
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,340
the one who is not aware of the way,

306
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,860
the one who is not in the top,

307
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,620
will come.

308
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,580
Those who are blinded by the light

309
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,700
can't understand Mr. Wei Ming's intention.

310
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,020
Are you giving us hope?

311
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,180
Do you really think

312
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,100
the book gives you hope?

313
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,100
Of course.

314
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,060
If you don't have any thoughts in your mind,

315
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,860
your life will be boring.

316
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,300
Yes.

317
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,140
I think so, too.

318
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,300
Although the Peach Garden in Jiang Kun's heart

319
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,460
is difficult to reach,

320
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,780
if he is also concerned when he writes a book,

321
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,580
what's the difference with the present?

322
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,940
The hero sees the prey as a three-fold drink.

323
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,420
It's okay to drink a few glasses of wine

324
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,940
to get this kind of friend.

325
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:39,620
Okay.

326
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:40,740
Come on.

327
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,380
Mr. Mu, please stop.

328
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:49,820
Li Zhao Han.

329
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,740
I asked you out first.

330
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,340
Why are you so happy with him?

331
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,620
Though the red eyes are good,

332
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,700
they are hard to find.

333
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,420
I'm happy to see this young man

334
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,340
as an old friend.

335
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,860
I'm happy to travel in the garden.

336
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,340
I have no need to be lonely.

337
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,940
The land is smooth and smooth.

338
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,300
The temple is thirty-four devoted to tree phoenix and e 날天開.

339
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,300
The wood is an excellent pair to you.

340
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,100
The stable bell is alto to the set.

341
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,940
mooth eyal Original RNA

342
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,100
Why did you want to open the Powdering Corps?

343
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,100
I don't know it.

344
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:34,980
If Flu's

345
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,660
I will follow the wind and start a new life.

346
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,660
I hate the wild children of the East.

347
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,860
I miss the people in the water.

348
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,620
I'm worried about the water in the mud.

349
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:49,780
Stop it.

350
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,020
You're falling into the lake.

351
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,340
Brother Li.

352
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:57,740
I'm fine.

353
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,460
I'm fine, Brother Mu.

354
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:58,940
Brother Li.

355
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,540
I'll take the responsibility for my misdeed.

356
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,700
I'll remember my heart and know my future.

357
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:06,580
Okay.

358
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,780
Why are you here?

359
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,020
I was going to

360
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:40,020
surprise Qingying and the Fourth Prince.

361
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,460
But you broke the spell.

362
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,140
Don't tell anyone.

363
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,260
I hope it's a coincidence.

364
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,740
I was too blind.

365
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,380
Prime Minister.

366
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,180
Everything is normal in the Library.

367
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,300
But in the middle of the night,

368
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,060
in the five-storied residence where the Fourth Prince often goes,

369
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,340
a dead rat was found.

370
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,740
The rat was not injured.

371
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,580
The dead rat was poisoned.

372
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,580
But it's strange that

373
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,700
the Library hasn't put rat poison in it recently.

374
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,420
When I entered the Five-Storied residence,

375
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,780
did you smell a faint smell of the qi?

376
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:16,580
Yes.

377
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,820
It seems to have a faint smell of the powder.

378
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,380
And it smells like

379
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,260
a fake one.

380
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,220
It's very special.

381
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,700
It's my first time to smell it.

382
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,540
Find it in this direction.

383
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:27,900
I see.

384
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,300
By the way, Prime Minister.

385
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:30,740
The killer confessed.

386
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,180
He said he heard the order from the Blue-clothed Pavilion.

387
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,820
Blue-clothed Pavilion?

388
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:38,620
Yes.

389
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,540
If I remember correctly,

390
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,340
the princess's clothes

391
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,780
are all made from the Blue-clothed Pavilion.

392
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,020
The shopkeeper said

393
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,580
the peach blossom is worn

394
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,140
in the present Yujing City.

395
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,580
It's the most fashionable style of the Qis.

396
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,860
It seems to have a faint smell of the powder.

397
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,020
And it smells like

398
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,940
a fake one.

399
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,500
From now on,

400
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,300
I want the list of all the people in and out of the Blue-clothed Pavilion

401
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,260
to find out that the peach blossom has nothing to do with the Blue-clothed Pavilion.

402
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,620
And all the details of the past.

403
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:19,580
I see.

404
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,600
The ===

405
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:42,420
Your Highness?

406
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:47,660
Your Highness.

407
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:55,780
Your Highness.

408
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,660
How about i 4

409
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,500
to have a doctor for you?

410
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,820
No.

411
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,900
The poison

412
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,580
can only be destroyed

413
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,980
by the antidote in Yang Wanqing's hand.

414
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,740
He only gave me half a pill before

415
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,340
to make me suffer

416
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,460
and punish me.

417
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,140
I have to go to him again.

418
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:24,860
But

419
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,140
the thing he gave us last time

420
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,540
failed.

421
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,420
Can he give us the antidote?

422
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,940
As long as they need me,

423
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,180
they won't let me die.

424
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,820
Otherwise,

425
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,180
who will sell rice for them?

426
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,900
It's just

427
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,260
to add more antidote

428
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,060
and get rid of it.

429
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,020
It will be fine.

430
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,900
Go get a clean cloth.

431
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,420
Yes.

432
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,180
Go.

433
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,220
Qingtai.

434
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,580
What's this?

435
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,940
Her Highness wants to change.

436
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,260
I'm going to send her clothes.

437
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,220
Great.

438
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,420
I'm going to see Her Highness.

439
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,820
I'll take her with me.

440
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:30,900
Deputy Chief.

441
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,580
Thanks, Your Highness.

442
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,220
You have myヒmusic.

443
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,540
Please give me a little more time.

444
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,740
I'm leaving.

445
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,580
Each of you will get the adjustment코

446
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,020
a little bit later.

447
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,140
Get the dress here.

448
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,340
Thank you, Prime Minister.

449
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,260
Are you going out

450
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,940
to change your clothes?

451
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:06,860
Yes.

452
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,540
I want to go out

453
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,820
to see if there are any fashionable clothes.

454
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,540
Didn't you just

455
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,460
change your clothes?

456
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,140
You don't know that

457
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,140
girls' clothes

458
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,700
are always not enough.

459
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,220
And the rouge

460
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,220
is always missing one color.

461
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,860
In this case,

462
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,620
I didn't thinkך well.

463
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,220
You should change your clothes.

464
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,020
Deputy Li Wan Yue

465
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,500
I'm sorry.

466
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,260
What's this?

467
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,460
This is the new popular peach blossom makeup

468
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,140
in Yujin.

469
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,020
Peach blossom makeup?

470
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,660
You girls are so strange.

471
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,700
You insist on

472
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,620
putting on a good peach blossom makeup.

473
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,420
Don't guess

474
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,820
what we girls think.

475
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,380
You're right.

476
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,420
I don't know much about

477
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,620
women's makeup.

478
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,180
At first glance,

479
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,340
I thought it was a spy's tattoo.

480
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,380
You're really joking.

481
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,380
It's fine.

482
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,540
There's no spy.

483
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,420
Why not?

484
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,460
A few days ago,

485
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,500
I found a few

486
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,700
treacherous spies

487
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:18,780
outside the tent.

488
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,580
Your Highness,

489
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,500
you'd better not go out these days.

490
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,220
There are some things

491
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,380
that are not in time for this moment,

492
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:27,620
right?

493
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,660
I'm the wife of the Prime Minister.

494
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,980
In this clear day,

495
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,420
is there anyone

496
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,420
who dares to

497
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,620
attack me on the street?

498
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,220
A gentleman does not stand under a wall.

499
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,060
Or should I say

500
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,180
whoever you have an appointment with today

501
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,100
must be killed?

502
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,220
Whoever you have an appointment with

503
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,740
must go out.

504
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,100
Your Highness,

505
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,060
you can stay at home these days.

506
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,580
After a while,

507
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,500
I'll go with you

508
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,260
wherever you want to go.

509
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:07,860
You can choose

510
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,980
whatever you like.

511
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,660
If I say

512
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,060
I'm going out today,

513
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,380
what will you do?

514
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,660
If Your Highness insists on going out today,

515
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:35,220
I'm afraid those stupid spies

516
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,540
will take you as someone

517
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,420
and hurt you.

518
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,660
That's not good.

519
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,020
Your Highness,

520
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,460
what do you think?

521
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,580
No choice.

522
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,580
Then I will go with what you wish.

523
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,260
I will just go out a little later.

524
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:16,700
An'er!

525
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,060
Your Highness.

526
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,340
It's Qin Z scolding suisance of Zuo Yunshu.

527
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:37,240
The

528
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,300
とまり

529
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,760
it,

530
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,320
In the Palace?

531
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,460
You're up.

532
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,360
shots to be good.

533
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,540
Except for the Rụped Cave,

534
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,000
it seems like Princess went to the back door.

535
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,800
Have a rest.

536
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,400
Those are all precarious deaths.

537
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,000
The thing you see is the truth.

538
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,400
The foundation of

539
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,240
the performance

540
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,080
was never successful.

541
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,080
I'm afraid that this time,

542
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,720
Shen Zai has also been prepared.

543
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,960
It will be difficult to do it again.

544
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,520
Who is it?

545
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,760
It's me.

546
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,720
There's someone inside.

547
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,640
It can't be the Third Prince.

548
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,160
Princess, don't you know that your Lordship

549
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,440
is searching for suspicious people in the city

550
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,200
and suddenly arrived here.

551
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,720
Aren't you afraid that you'll cause trouble

552
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,000
and affect my location?

553
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,320
Please calm down, Sister.

554
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,040
I have a reason to come.

555
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,800
If I'm not wrong,

556
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,120
the task that Your Highness has assigned

557
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,720
and the target is

558
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,760
the Fourth Prince who is studying in the Library.

559
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,760
So what?

560
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,840
Is it because Your Highness is soft-hearted

561
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,680
and wants to plead for Mu Wu Xia?

562
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,200
Sister, you've misunderstood.

563
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,840
I came here today

564
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,280
to ask for another half of the antidote from Qing.

565
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,840
You haven't seen it yet.

566
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,640
What do you have that half of the antidote?

567
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,920
If you didn't believe me,

568
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,240
you would have asked me

569
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,080
and those dead people for help.

570
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,840
You were clumsy and got me involved.

571
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,920
Now Mu Wu Xia is a dead man.

572
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,520
But the first mission has failed.

573
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,440
Even if there's a second chance,

574
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,120
my body can't wait.

575
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,160
I have a perfect plan.

576
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,560
If there's no accident,

577
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,280
I can kill him with one move.

578
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,960
But the premise is to give the antidote to Qing.

579
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,600
Otherwise,

580
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,360
I'm afraid that my body

581
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,280
will delay Your Highness's big task.

582
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,360
I've already told you the antidote.

583
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,280
If there's any mistake,

584
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,280
you'll be the one to blame.

585
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:48,800
Yes.

586
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,680
Why did Your Highness agree to it?

587
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,840
You've spent a lot of time on it.

588
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,080
Since she came here in person,

589
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,640
why should I agree?

590
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,600
I won't let her down.

591
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,120
I won't believe her words.

592
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,960
If we want to succeed,

593
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,440
we have to force her to do it.

594
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,400
By the way,

595
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,200
is there any news

596
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,760
from North Moon?

597
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,160
After the last mission,

598
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,600
we lost a letter.

599
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,480
Your Highness, you haven't reached the new mission.

600
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,120
I'm thinking

601
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,280
if you're angry with us

602
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,360
and don't want to do anything,

603
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,960
then we'll wait.

604
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,480
Maybe she has something else to do.

605
00:33:59,080 --> 00:33:59,960
It's hard for us to do.

606
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:07,920
Come.

607
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,320
You should go now.

608
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,040
Yes.

609
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,440
Umpire Ban.

610
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:42,920
Where are you?

611
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,320
The Lanct bother.

612
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,120
Why?

613
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,400
Weren't you quiet about this?

614
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,400
Why departmental official?

615
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:56,960
Jiang Daohua,

616
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,440
I gave you a chance.

617
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:02,800
It was you.

618
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,560
Did you consider lightly

619
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,840
if or not I'd give you another chance?

620
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,480
for yourself.

621
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,120
So I have to thank you

622
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,760
for giving me a chance to tell you the truth.

623
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,520
You said that

624
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,040
His Highness was like your brother.

625
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,160
In your heart,

626
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:27,760
is it not important

627
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,600
to you that no one is important

628
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,000
and can give up?

629
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,520
I promised you before

630
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,200
that I wouldn't do anything to harm Qi.

631
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,480
I can't

632
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,280
do anything to harm Qi,

633
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,800
including the Fourth Prince of Qi.

634
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,640
I will never do anything to harm you

635
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,360
or Qi.

636
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,880
If you break your promise,

637
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,160
you can't meet your family again.

638
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,360
If you break your promise,

639
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,880
you can't meet your family again.

640
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,440
You know nothing

641
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,840
and you can't live in the beautiful scenery.

642
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,920
Flowers fall and the north wind blows.

643
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:04,840
Now it seems

644
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,960
that you won't believe me.

645
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,160
The petals fall and the north wind blows.

646
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,440
My heart is broken and I'm in a dilemma.

647
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,400
Flowers fall and tears fall.

648
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:16,920
I need to go.

649
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,560
The heart is torn.

650
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:24,080
There is nowhere to go.

651
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:29,080
The Love by Hypnotic

652
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:36,080
The love is struggling in the mud.

653
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:43,080
Regret is in despair.

654
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:46,080
I still hope that

655
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:50,080
the flowers in my arms

656
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:55,080
can be reborn

657
00:36:55,080 --> 00:37:05,080
into the song of the jade bell.

658
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,080
Your Highness.

659
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,080
What did the mirror say to you?

660
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,080
He said he believed me.

661
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,080
You told him everything?

662
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,080
Is the mirror worth trusting?

663
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,080
He wouldn't know if I didn't tell him.

664
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,080
After hiding in the Bookstore that day,

665
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,080
I'm afraid that Zhengchun Pavilion

666
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,080
has been watched by others for a long time.

667
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,080
What did you think

668
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,080
about Yang Wanqing?

669
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,080
I spent a lot of time

670
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,080
to get half of the antidote.

671
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,080
If there is no action this time,

672
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,080
I'm afraid that I can't get the antidote.

673
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,080
Are we really going to

674
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,080
kill the Fourth Prince?

675
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,080
No.

676
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,080
Let alone the attitude

677
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,080
of the Prime Minister and Qingying

678
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,080
towards the Fourth Prince.

679
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,080
Let's say that

680
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,080
the Prime Minister chased me away.

681
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,080
In order to protect me,

682
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,080
a princess who is not valued,

683
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,080
he risked his life to save me

684
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,080
from the evil eye of the whole court.

685
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,080
How can I be grateful

686
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,080
to such a benevolent person?

687
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,080
What are you going to do?

688
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,080
What are you going to do?

689
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,080
Now Yang Wanqing is watching me closely.

690
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,080
How about this?

691
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,080
You go out of the mansion first

692
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,080
and pretend to go to find out

693
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,080
the whereabouts of the Fourth Prince.

694
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,080
Go and change Yang Wanqing's sight.

695
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,080
Let him think

696
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,080
that we are really going to investigate the Fourth Prince.

697
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,080
Then I have time

698
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,080
to think about

699
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,080
how to prepare a perfect plan.

700
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,080
Okay.

701
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,080
Your Highness, Princess Chengping

702
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,080
asked you to go out of the mansion to relax.

703
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:50,080
She will stop your carriage

704
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,080
outside the mansion.

705
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,080
Now?

706
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,080
Yes.

707
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,080
Go.

708
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,080
Your Highness, bad news.

709
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,080
Yang Wanqing asked you to go out of the mansion

710
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,080
in the name of you.

711
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,080
I think there is something wrong.

712
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,080
So I came back to report it.

713
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,080
Oh, no.

714
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,080
They must not believe me

715
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,080
and take action on their own.

716
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,080
Where is the Fourth Prince now?

717
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,080
I think

718
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,080
he went to the direction of the Qingfang Tea House.

719
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,080
Go and find the Prime Minister.

720
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,080
Your Highness, I'm sorry.

721
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,080
The Prime Minister was just

722
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,080
summoned by His Majesty to the palace.

723
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,080
Your Highness.

724
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,080
Your Highness.

725
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,080
Your Highness.

726
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,080
Your Highness.

727
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,080
Your Highness.
