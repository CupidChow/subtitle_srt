1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,280
The wind and rain are scattered and the clouds are still.

2
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,040
How can I stay alive

3
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,360
and live a long life?

4
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,280
If I could stay with you for the rest of my life,

5
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,960
if you could understand my true feelings,

6
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,800
I would break into a play and fall into a memory.

7
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,120
Even if I'm locked in this life,

8
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,800
I would spend my whole life in this good life.

9
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:23,320
The brush me одинess the

10
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,440
digital

11
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,120
hold

12
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,120
no

13
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,520
Do you think Shen Zai will still love you and protect you

14
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,660
What about Shen Za

15
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:50,540
What does it have to do with me

16
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,640
I only pray for your presence

17
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,700
Can save me and Changsha

18
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,240
Opal Reno 14 Day Sun impresive color

19
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,520
You can see

20
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,520
Please watch the movie, Peach Blossom.

21
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,520
Please buy the ticket for the extra-curricular.

22
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,520
Please buy the ticket for the extra-curricular.

23
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,520
Li Dian.

24
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,520
Li Dian.

25
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,520
Lord Li,

26
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,520
congratulations. You are the top.

27
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,520
I am the top?

28
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,520
Lord, why are you so happy today?

29
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,520
Let me tell you.

30
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,520
I just met

31
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,520
the top of the court, Li Dian.

32
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,520
This person is indeed

33
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,520
full of knowledge and skills.

34
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,520
And he is

35
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,520
very well-informed in analyzing the court.

36
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,520
This time, Wu Xia

37
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,520
did the right thing.

38
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,520
He really caught the real talent in the middle of the night.

39
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,520
In the past,

40
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,520
I always thought that this child

41
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,520
would never be able to be a man.

42
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,520
But in the world,

43
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,520
he is so weak.

44
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,520
It seems that I am too indecisive.

45
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,520
That is because you love your body

46
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,520
and your wife. How can you be indecisive

47
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,520
when you are fully in love?

48
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,520
Fully in love?

49
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,520
Well said.

50
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,520
But

51
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,520
I always feel that

52
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,520
this child

53
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,520
lacks a little bit of the spirit of killing and decisive.

54
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,520
I am afraid that he cannot handle it.

55
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,520
Lord, you can rest assured.

56
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,520
Let Wu Xia

57
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,520
practice hard.

58
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,520
In the future, he will definitely be a talented man.

59
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,520
Yes.

60
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,520
He must practice hard.

61
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,520
Your Highness,

62
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,520
do not worry.

63
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,520
Lord has given the imperial examination

64
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,520
that Fourth Prince is going to give.

65
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,520
I am afraid that he will be a little bit

66
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,520
of a troublemaker.

67
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,520
That is why I have ordered Li Dian to be the assistant.

68
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,520
Why do you think that

69
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,520
I care about just one Li Dian?

70
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,520
Your Highness, are you worried that

71
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,520
Fourth Prince will be more popular

72
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,520
because of Li Dian?

73
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,520
I am not interested in

74
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,520
what they want.

75
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,520
You can go and see

76
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,520
if there is any reply from A'Hua.

77
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,520
Your Highness,

78
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,520
after I went to write to Your Highness,

79
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,520
I checked the numbers

80
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,520
several times every day

81
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,520
and did not see any reply from Your Highness.

82
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,520
He must be very angry.

83
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,520
I will go and see.

84
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,520
Your Highness,

85
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,520
according to our people's reports,

86
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,520
the imperial examination of Qi has ended.

87
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,520
Mu Wu Xia

88
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,520
has won the favor of the King of Qi

89
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,520
and has won the trust of the scholars.

90
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,520
All the families of Qi are well-known.

91
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,520
They dare not act recklessly.

92
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,520
The whole of Qi

93
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,520
has a beautiful land.

94
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,520
I cannot comment on this matter.

95
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,520
I have designed such a wonderful plan.

96
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,520
I have designed such a wonderful plan.

97
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,520
But I am confused by Mu Wu Yin's plan.

98
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,520
I am not competent enough.

99
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,520
I have no chance to win.

100
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,520
Your Highness,

101
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,520
Third Prince has a letter from Fei Shu.

102
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,520
Shen Zai Ye is investigating A'Hua.

103
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,520
Shen Zai Ye,

104
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,520
don't touch me.

105
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,520
You are now touching me?

106
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,520
I think you are a living dog.

107
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,520
Your Highness,

108
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,520
we have not touched her

109
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,520
in recent years.

110
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,520
But now,

111
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,520
we cannot even feel her comfort.

112
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,520
It is too difficult

113
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,520
for the imperial guards in Qi to do so.

114
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,520
Since the imperial guards are not easy to attack,

115
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,520
they will be eliminated.

116
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,520
And that pretty peach blossom,

117
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,520
I am afraid that she will be a big part of this.

118
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,520
And Mu Wu Xia,

119
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,520
they are always against me.

120
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,520
I want them to know

121
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,520
that if they are against me,

122
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,520
they will die.

123
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,520
Your Highness, you are wise.

124
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,520
But how can we let them leave Yujing?

125
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,520
Now, the King of Qi is obsessed with Mu Wu Xia.

126
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,520
As far as I know,

127
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,520
if he wants to kill Mu Wu Xia,

128
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,520
he will definitely do it for her.

129
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,520
I can send a spy

130
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,520
to the border of Qi.

131
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,520
The border of Qi?

132
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,520
That is just a few kilometers

133
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,520
from my North Campus, Luocheng.

134
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,520
It is only a few kilometers from Luocheng.

135
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,520
Let them pretend to be the bandits

136
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,520
and disturb the people.

137
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,520
Your Highness, you are wise.

138
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,520
How is Jiang Changjue?

139
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,520
How is he?

140
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,520
On Luocheng,

141
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,520
Deng Xiaowei has been watching him.

142
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,520
Nothing wrong happened.

143
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,520
It seems that the unbending

144
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:31,220
and unbending

145
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,220
Hurry up!

146
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,220
The camp near the border of North Campus

147
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,220
is only in Luocheng.

148
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,220
Is Changjue

149
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,220
right here?

150
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,220
Hurry up!

151
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,220
Hurry up!

152
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,920
Hurry up!

153
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,920
Hurry up!

154
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,920
Liu Fan,

155
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,920
you are playing tricks again.

156
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,920
Stop!

157
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,920
Get out of my way!

158
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,920
Your Highness!

159
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,920
Jiang Changjue,

160
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,920
I advise you to mind your own business.

161
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,920
You dare not obey me?

162
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,920
I am really going to fight against Deng Xiaowei.

163
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,920
You can go as you like.

164
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,920
You!

165
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,920
You wait for me.

166
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,620
So the Crown Prince is here.

167
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,620
He can't go out freely.

168
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,620
You said you can't act impulsively.

169
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,620
Doctor Liu, help you to have a rest.

170
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,620
Okay.

171
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,620
It seems that I can only follow the Crown Prince.

172
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,620
Be careful.

173
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,620
Jiang Changjue,

174
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,620
Deng Xiaowei wants to see you.

175
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,320
Your Highness.

176
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,320
Stop playing tricks.

177
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,320
It's okay.

178
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,320
Deng Xiaowei,

179
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,320
Jiang Changjue is here.

180
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,320
What are you doing?

181
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,320
Let me go!

182
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,320
Jiang Changjue,

183
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,320
it's troublesome to keep you in my camp.

184
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,320
Deng Xiaowei, why do you say so?

185
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,320
I am in charge of

186
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,020
this place.

187
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,020
It's not the camp.

188
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,020
This place is full of

189
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,020
all the evil Liu Fangs.

190
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,020
But you are always helping them.

191
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,020
You even let those

192
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,020
who are guilty

193
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,020
out.

194
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,020
Do you admit it?

195
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,020
I admit.

196
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,020
But the evil Liu Fangs

197
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,020
are all being killed by the Queen.

198
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,020
Shut up!

199
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,020
Someone wants

200
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,720
to kill me.

201
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,720
I am the son of the King.

202
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,720
How dare you touch me?

203
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,720
I am afraid that the King has forgotten

204
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,720
that he has a son like you.

205
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,720
You are a man

206
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,720
who can't be killed.

207
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,720
Take him down

208
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,420
and take care of him.

209
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,420
No one is allowed to let him out

210
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,420
without my order.

211
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,420
Yes.

212
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,420
Deng Xiaowei,

213
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,420
you are not loyal to the royal family.

214
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,420
If you are against the Queen,

215
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,420
I will make you suffer the death of your own country.

216
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,420
Your Highness,

217
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,420
the Queen replied.

218
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,420
Call Jiang Taohua here.

219
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,420
Yes.

220
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,420
Father,

221
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,120
Your Highness,

222
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,120
what can I do for you?

223
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,120
I just got a gift.

224
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,120
Please

225
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,120
give it to me.

226
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,120
Take a closer look.

227
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,120
You should know

228
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,120
this gift very well.

229
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,120
I don't know what it is.

230
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,120
I just want to know

231
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,120
if you like it or not.

232
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,120
I will go to the palace

233
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,120
to see if you like it.

234
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,120
Changjue,

235
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,120
don't let the fire go out.

236
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,120
I will find more charcoal.

237
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,120
Changjue, what's wrong?

238
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,120
What happened?

239
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,240
It's my fault.

240
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,680
It's my fault.

241
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,640
Changjue.

242
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,760
What did you do to Changjue?

243
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,440
Don't worry.

244
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,720
He's not dead yet.

245
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,120
But it's not long now.

246
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,880
I just heard that

247
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,560
he's going to be punished by the military law.

248
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,400
Punish him by the military law?

249
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,440
That's right.

250
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,720
He broke the military rules in the North Campus.

251
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,320
He wanted to see you before he died.

252
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,560
I'll let you go

253
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,360
if you're so close to each other.

254
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,960
Where should I go?

255
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,560
The place where Liu Fang was released.

256
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,720
Why are you so cruel?

257
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,320
You can also not believe me.

258
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,320
You can wait and see

259
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,360
whether Jiang Changjue will be killed.

260
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,520
No more problèmes.

261
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,800
My son will be fine.

262
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,440
That's right.

263
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,280
It's dangerous to go out alone

264
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,840
why don't you pass Shen Zaiye

265
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,040
and get him?

266
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,040
and lonely

267
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,040
So their goal

268
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,040
is to be a monk

269
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,040
I thought you had prepared a fast horse

270
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,040
and a high mountain and a long road

271
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,040
If you keep delaying

272
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,040
just wait to collect the corpse

273
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,040
Prime Minister

274
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,040
The carriage is ready

275
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,040
We will go to the North Campus this time

276
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,040
and wait for 30 people to be comforted

277
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,040
at any time

278
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,040
Take me to the Third Prince's mansion

279
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,040
We will leave immediately

280
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,040
Report, Prime Minister

281
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,040
The princess was in a hurry

282
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,040
The carriage has left the Third Prince's mansion

283
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,040
and has gone to the North Gate

284
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,040
Retreat

285
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,040
How could the Third Prince

286
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,040
leave the mansion?

287
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,040
Something must have happened

288
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,040
Wait

289
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,040
It's the Third Prince

290
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,040
It's the Third Prince

291
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,040
Why is Prime Minister Shen here?

292
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,040
Did he keep sending people to keep an eye on me?

293
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,040
Something happened

294
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,040
It has nothing to do with you

295
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,040
Please don't worry about it

296
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,040
I will take care of your business

297
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,040
no matter what

298
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,040
If Prime Minister Shen is here

299
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,040
I won't be lonely on the way to the imperial palace

300
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,040
Since their goal is Shen Zaiye

301
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,040
If he doesn't go

302
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,040
will things get better?

303
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,040
Shen Zaiye

304
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,040
Since we met

305
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,040
I knew you were cold-hearted

306
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,040
You treated me mercilessly

307
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,040
humiliated me

308
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,040
stabbed me

309
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,040
chased me

310
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,040
beat me

311
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,040
You never trusted me

312
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,040
I always thought

313
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,040
this is you

314
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,040
But now you are pestering me

315
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,040
You are acting like you are in love with me

316
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,040
Don't you think it's funny?

317
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,040
You really remember everything

318
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,040
The moment you saved me from the water

319
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,040
I remembered everything

320
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,040
So from that moment

321
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,040
you have been hiding it

322
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,040
We are already strangers

323
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,040
I don't need to hide it

324
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,040
I just don't want to explain

325
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,040
I don't believe it

326
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,040
What do you want to do to let go?

327
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,040
Tell me

328
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,040
In the past, we tried everything

329
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,040
and set up the defense everywhere

330
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,040
That's how it ended

331
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,040
Now I want to listen to your suffering

332
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,040
I want to fight for you

333
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,040
Do you believe me?

334
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,040
Shen Zaiye

335
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,040
Our fate is over

336
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,040
Why do you want to save me?

337
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,040
I'm in a hurry

338
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,040
I have to go

339
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,040
Is it Qingtai or Changjue?

340
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,040
Changjue is in trouble

341
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,040
It's none of your business

342
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,040
The north road is long

343
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,040
I have to give you the antidote

344
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,040
Give it to me

345
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,040
Impossible

346
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,040
Speaking of which

347
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,040
If I'm not here

348
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,040
you can't save Changjue

349
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,040
If I can't save Changjue

350
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,040
it's the fate of Changjue and me

351
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,040
I don't want to have anything to do with you

352
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,040
I don't want to owe you anything

353
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,040
Although Changjue and I have never met

354
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,040
I always take him as my brother

355
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,040
I'm alone in the world

356
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,040
I'm lonely

357
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,040
I have to kill those who take care of me

358
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,040
Changjue is in trouble

359
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,040
How can I help him?

360
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,040
We go to the north

361
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,040
to Xinzhou

362
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,040
You let Wu Jiangsu lead people to chase

363
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,040
Yes

364
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,040
How can I get rid of him?

365
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,040
Your Royal Highness

366
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,040
As you expected

367
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,040
Shen Zaiye has caught up with the peach blossom

368
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,040
and went to the north

369
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,040
Your Royal Highness

370
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,040
Our next step

371
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,040
is to find my father

372
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,040
to play the flute

373
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,040
It's easy to send the fourth master to the tomb

374
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,040
Yes

375
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,040
Father

376
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,040
I come to send you the elixir

377
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,040
Bring it up

378
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,040
Hurry up

379
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,040
Third brother

380
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,040
I'm sorry

381
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,040
I'm sorry

382
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,040
I'm sorry

383
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,040
It's really hard for you to do this

384
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,040
I'm not good at governing the country

385
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,040
I just want to ask for some advice

386
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,040
You are my son

387
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,040
Prince of Qi

388
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,040
How can you be so reckless?

389
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,040
You know

390
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,040
I've always been like this

391
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,040
I hope you don't mind

392
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,040
Father

393
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,040
You can relax

394
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,040
You still have fourth brother

395
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,040
Fourth brother is the star of the world

396
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,040
Full of talent

397
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,040
I hope you can train him well

398
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,040
It's a great honor to have a great emperor

399
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,040
Very good

400
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,040
Father

401
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,040
I have one more thing

402
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,040
I want to remind you

403
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,040
Just say it

404
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,040
I heard it by accident

405
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,040
There are four brothers in the world

406
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,040
who are too weak

407
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,040
and have a bad reputation

408
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,040
Four is enough

409
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,040
Five needs to be trained

410
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,040
Go to the palace

411
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,040
Yes, your majesty

412
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,040
Father

413
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,040
You mean

414
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,040
I should go to the border to solve the bandits?

415
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,040
You dare not

416
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,040
But I

417
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,040
I just read some military books

418
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,040
I'm afraid that

419
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,040
I'll be a joke if I talk about the army

420
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,040
I'll be a disgrace to you

421
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,040
It's good to know the army

422
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,200
But it's just some

423
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,040
What's so scary about it?

424
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,040
I have issued a decree

425
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,040
Let the commander of the border troops, Dong Lang

426
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,040
join the bandits

427
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,040
He has fought in many battles

428
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,040
He has experienced many battles

429
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,040
You should ask him more

430
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,040
Fourth

431
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,040
This time

432
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,040
You have selected a lot of good materials for me

433
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,040
and great achievements for the Qi

434
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,040
I hope you can

435
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,040
keep up

436
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,040
Don't let me down

437
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,040
and let me down

438
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,040
When you

439
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,040
return with a victory

440
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,040
I will give you

441
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,040
a heavier burden

442
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,040
I will

443
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,040
I will follow your order

444
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,040
I won't let you down

445
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,040
Go get ready

446
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,040
Yes

447
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,040
I'll leave now

448
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,040
I let him fight the bandits

449
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,040
because I want him to think about the military

450
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,040
If everything goes wrong

451
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,040
Dong Lang will take care of it

452
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,040
You are thoughtful

453
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,040
Give Dong Lang

454
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,040
the secret letter I wrote

455
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,040
After he reads the letter

456
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,040
he will know my feelings

457
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,040
Yes, your majesty

458
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,040
Mu Wu Xia

459
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,040
You think you are a gentleman

460
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,040
and want to be a knife-cutter

461
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,040
Do you want to change your profession

462
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,040
and be a cook?

463
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,040
What?

464
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,040
Do you think

465
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,040
I don't deserve this?

466
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,040
With your temperament

467
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,040
a sword is the best

468
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,040
Look

469
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,040
I use a sword

470
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,040
Swords are weapons

471
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,040
If you are a horse rider

472
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,040
you should be a sword-cutter

473
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,040
I'm a sword-cutter

474
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,040
I think a sword is better

475
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,040
You want to be a sword-cutter

476
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,040
and a horse rider

477
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,040
What do you want to be?

478
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,040
My father asked me

479
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,040
to be a bandit

480
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,040
Bandit?

481
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,040
Why didn't you say it earlier?

482
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,040
I'll be your military counselor

483
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,040
and see the bodyguard

484
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,040
No

485
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,040
I'm going to fight the bandits

486
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,040
How can I take you with me?

487
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,040
You can't even fight the bandits

488
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,040
Why can't I?

489
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,040
I'm a warrior

490
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,040
Of course, except my brother

491
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,040
Zhan Lu

492
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,040
and Qing Tai

493
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,040
I'm the fourth master

494
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,040
No

495
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,040
The bandits are not like children

496
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,040
And if you are in danger

497
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,040
how can I explain to the prime minister?

498
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,040
How dare you say I'm a child?

499
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,040
I'll kill you

500
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,040
Even if you kill me

501
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,040
I can't take you with me

502
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,040
Go

503
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,040
The fish are moving

504
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,040
The small city

505
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,040
is more lively

506
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,040
Your Highness

507
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,040
I'm sorry

508
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,040
I'm sorry

509
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,040
I'm sorry

510
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,040
I'm sorry

511
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,040
I'm sorry

512
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,040
I'm sorry

513
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,040
I'm sorry

514
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,040
I'm sorry

515
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,040
I'm sorry

516
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,040
Your Highness

517
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,040
As you expected

518
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,040
Shen Zaiye of the Peach Blossom River

519
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,040
went to the city of Luo

520
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,040
to save Jiang Changjue

521
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,040
Mu Wu Xia

522
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,040
was also set up by the Third Prince

523
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,040
and transferred to the border

524
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,040
We'll wait for our King Yi to attack

525
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,040
Cuiwei

526
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,040
You take people to the border quickly

527
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,040
to create chaos

528
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,040
and bring Mu Wu Xia to the city of Luo

529
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,040
The first general of the city, Deng Xiao

530
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,040
was once the king's confidant

531
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,040
After all, he's not one of us

532
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,040
You can't be so naive

533
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,040
I'm afraid you need to

534
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,040
personally arrange it

535
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,040
I understand

536
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,040
Go

537
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,040
Hurry up

538
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,040
What are you doing?

539
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,040
The people captured by the Qi border

540
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,040
are all here

541
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,040
General, don't worry

542
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,040
The brothers are half-cooked

543
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,040
No one knows that we are the Northland Army

544
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,040
Good

545
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,040
I'll wait for Mu Wu Xia

546
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,040
Go

547
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,040
Come in

548
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,040
Your Highness

549
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,040
The border report

550
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,040
The bandits have fled to the direction of the city of Luo

551
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,040
They need to enter the state of the Northland

552
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,040
and attack the King Yi

553
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,040
Wang Xie

554
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,040
Yes

555
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,040
Inform everyone

556
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,040
to leave the city immediately

557
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,040
Yes

558
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,040
The bandits have fled to the direction of the Northland

559
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,040
Wang Xie, pass on the order

560
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,040
From today on

561
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,040
only the silver stone of the Haishi clan

562
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,040
can be used to practice

563
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,040
You must stop them

564
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,040
in the Qi's border

565
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,040
Yes

566
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,040
Yes

567
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,040
Yes

568
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,040
Stop them

569
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,040
Yes

570
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,040
Let's go

571
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,040
Your Highness

572
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,040
Your Highness

573
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,040
One more person is missing

574
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,040
Mu Wu Xia

575
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,040
I have explained to you

576
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,040
The bandits are not caught

577
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,040
It's not a joke

578
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,040
You

579
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,040
What if you are injured?

580
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,040
Mu Wu Xia

581
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:53,040
Don't look down on me

582
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,040
When I was in the Jianghu

583
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,040
you were still in the bath

584
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,040
Miss Qingyuan

585
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,040
Be quiet

586
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,040
Be quiet

587
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,040
Wang Xie

588
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,040
I have no choice

589
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,040
Mu Wu Xia

590
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,040
Don't be angry

591
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,040
I will go back by myself

592
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,040
Xia Qingying

593
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,040
I order you

594
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,040
to be my personal guard

595
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,040
and protect me

596
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,040
Are you willing to do it?

597
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,040
I will obey your order

598
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,040
Deng Xiaowei

599
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,040
You know that

600
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,040
Her Highness will keep

601
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,040
Jiang Changjue in the future

602
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,040
How dare she

603
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,040
let him run away

604
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,040
because of Yang Feng?

605
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,040
Do you think that

606
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,040
the emperor of Shang Gao

607
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,040
can't be protected

608
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,040
by Hao Du?

609
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,040
But Her Highness

610
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,040
is not easy to fool

611
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,040
Deng Xiaowei

612
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,040
The big wave is coming

613
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,040
Two boats

614
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,040
can't stand still

615
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,040
I dare not lie to Commander Cui

616
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,040
and Her Highness

617
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,040
I will take someone to find her

618
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,040
and give Jiang Changjue

619
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,040
to Commander Cui in three days

620
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,040
Three days

621
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,040
If you can't

622
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,040
hand her over before dark

623
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,040
you can be the

624
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,040
second one

625
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,040
Zhan Lu

626
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,040
You follow me all day

627
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,040
Are you tired of it?

628
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,040
If you follow me again

629
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,040
I will be polite

630
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,040
No

631
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,040
Do you think that

632
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,040
I would spend so much time

633
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,040
to find you?

634
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,040
As long as you tell me

635
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,040
where is the crown prince

636
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,040
I have told you many times

637
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,040
The crown prince is gone

638
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,040
Why don't you believe me?

639
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,040
Who told you to

640
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,040
talk nonsense all day?

641
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,040
I said that

642
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,040
it's not a lie to go back to the North Campus

643
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,040
The crown prince is the princess's brother

644
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,040
Of course he is my relative

645
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,040
I don't believe it anyway

646
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,040
Don't follow me anymore

647
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,040
Are you tired of it?

648
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,040
What are you doing?

649
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,040
You are so stupid

650
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,040
You bullied a widow

651
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,040
You have no respect for my life

652
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,040
What should I do?

653
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:15,040
I am a good woman

654
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,040
Aunt, I am sorry

655
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,040
It's okay

656
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,040
I will pay for the skin

657
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,040
I am sorry

658
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,040
Pay?

659
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,040
Okay, take the money

660
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,040
Why are you laughing?

661
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,040
Take the money

662
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,040
Madam

663
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,040
My brother and my wife

664
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,040
came from the south, right?

665
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,040
I will buy some for my wife

666
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,040
Otherwise, your wife

667
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,040
can't bear the weather in our North Campus

668
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,040
Aunt, we are not

669
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,040
My wife, you are a bride, right?

670
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,040
The one I just married

671
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,040
is thinner than your face

672
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,040
I am sorry, I am a real man

673
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,040
Don't run

674
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,040
It's not far from Luocheng

675
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,040
Don't worry

676
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,040
Before we enter the city

677
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,040
Chang Que will be fine

678
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,040
Here you are

679
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,040
Thank you

680
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,040
Thank you

681
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,040
All the people in the house

682
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,040
took care of me

683
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,040
They all know my true heart

684
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,040
But I can't let him

685
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,040
put me in danger

686
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,040
It's his fate

687
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,040
to grow old with Yu Jing

688
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,040
in peace

689
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,040
Take a rest

690
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,040
I will go to pick some firewood

691
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,040
I will go to pick some firewood

692
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,040
You don't leave any horse

693
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,040
Are you afraid of me chasing you?

694
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,040
I am afraid of you chasing me

695
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,040
Xiao Wei, Princess Changping has entered the city

696
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,040
Princess?

697
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,040
I heard that she has

698
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,040
died in the Qi State

699
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,040
Did you see it clearly?

700
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,040
The brothers of the city gate

701
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,040
have been working in the palace

702
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,040
Princess came here

703
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,040
is mostly related to Jiang Changjue

704
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,040
You follow the princess

705
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,040
Once Jiang Changjue appears

706
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,040
report it immediately

707
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,040
Yes

708
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,040
You are here

709
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,040
I can't wait to see you

710
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,040
Jiang Changjue

711
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,040
I will come back

712
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,040
as soon as possible

713
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:33,040
Flowers bloom without knowing

714
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:37,040
Flowers are beautiful and can't be missed

715
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,040
Flowers fall and the north wind blows

716
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,040
The city is as yellow as a poem

717
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,040
Flowers are left behind

718
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:52,040
Heart is with the knot

719
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:56,040
Flowers fall and tears are in the heart

720
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:02,040
No place to go

721
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:14,040
Wish to struggle in the mud

722
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:21,040
Regret is in despair

723
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:28,040
Still hoping that he will hold the flowers in his arms

724
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:33,040
Even if you want to die

725
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:39,040
Give the song to the forest

726
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,040
Who lost the flower heart

727
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:58,040
Love and hate can only be one

728
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:01,040
Flowers wither and the heart is broken

729
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:08,040
No need to tell

730
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:19,040
Waiting for the sea to be crazy like him

731
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:25,040
Not afraid to be surprised by the world

732
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:31,040
Listen to what he said

733
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,040
Related to the words

734
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,040
It turned out to be his

735
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:43,040
A return of friendship
