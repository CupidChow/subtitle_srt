1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,360
The wind and rain scatter and the clouds are still.

2
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:39,360
How can I stay alive and live in this life?

3
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,360
If I could stay with you in my life,

4
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,960
if you could understand my true feelings,

5
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:54,960
I would go through all the hardships without any regrets.

6
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,960
Even if I have to spend my whole life holding on to you,

7
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,960
I would go through all the hardships in this life.

8
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:08,960
I would fight for the light of destiny.

9
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,960
Fate is full of mistakes, love and hate.

10
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,960
I would never make mistakes.

11
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,960
I would be drunk with love and hate.

12
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,960
I would never regret.

13
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,960
The Long Ballad

14
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,960
Episode 16

15
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,960
What?

16
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,960
Are you so fierce with your wife?

17
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,960
Are you planning to use your horse to get some money?

18
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,960
I advise you not to do that.

19
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,960
Sir, Madam, please have some tea.

20
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,960
Zhenzhen, tell me the truth.

21
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,960
Have you been confined in the mansion for these days?

22
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,960
Don't worry, sir.

23
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,960
Although I've been confined,

24
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,960
I feel more relaxed than before.

25
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,960
Sir, you've been with the Crown Prince every day.

26
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,960
Have you found anything strange about him?

27
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,960
I haven't found anything strange.

28
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,960
But what did you notice?

29
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,960
The Prime Minister and Madam Jiang have been away for days.

30
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,960
What?

31
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,960
Although Madam Jiang's maid is guarding the Zhenchun Pavilion,

32
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,960
the Prime Minister and Zhanlu have been missing.

33
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,960
I was so surprised that I went to the manor to see him.

34
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,960
I found out that the maid was the only maid in Madam Jiang's manor.

35
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,960
There was no one else.

36
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,960
I think it's related to the Crown Prince.

37
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,960
I'll call you here to find out the truth.

38
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,960
How many days have they been away?

39
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,960
It's hard to tell.

40
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,960
It should be five days.

41
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,960
We can't make any more guesses.

42
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,960
I'll send someone to investigate their whereabouts.

43
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,960
Keep an eye on them.

44
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,960
If anything happens, report to me immediately.

45
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,960
Okay.

46
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,960
You've been confined by the Prime Minister.

47
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,960
You've been dragged into this.

48
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,960
Don't worry about the music hall.

49
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,960
I've sent someone to look for her.

50
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,960
She's in the dream house now.

51
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,960
But you...

52
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,960
Don't blame yourself.

53
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,960
As the daughter of the Meng family,

54
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,960
this is my destiny.

55
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,960
I'll think of a way to get the Prime Minister to release your tension.

56
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,960
Okay.

57
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,960
What's going on with you?

58
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,960
It's been so long.

59
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,960
We still haven't found her.

60
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,960
I've sent everyone out.

61
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,960
The jade mirror is this big.

62
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,960
I think... I think we'll get news soon.

63
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,960
We still haven't found her?

64
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,960
Stop!

65
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,960
Hold on.

66
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,960
Why are you so angry?

67
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,960
It's okay.

68
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,960
We haven't done anything yet.

69
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,960
Let's go.

70
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,960
You all leave first.

71
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,960
Wait.

72
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,960
You...

73
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,960
go and inform the workers of the silver mine.

74
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,960
Within five days,

75
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,960
I'll be able to make 500,000 taels.

76
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,960
Five days?

77
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,960
Your Highness.

78
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,960
No.

79
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,960
Yes.

80
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,960
I'll ask the Crown Prince to take back the city's order.

81
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,960
The gambling house incident,

82
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,960
His Majesty let it go easily.

83
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,960
But Wei Chang didn't expect that the Crown Prince would be behind it.

84
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,960
Now, we need to get the light.

85
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,960
We can't make any more trouble.

86
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,960
You get up first.

87
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,960
I know that you're upset.

88
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,960
But everything

89
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,960
is different.

90
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,960
We need to be careful

91
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,960
when we act.

92
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,960
Huaizhi,

93
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,960
you're good at everything.

94
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,960
But you're too warm-hearted.

95
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,960
Do you know why Father

96
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,960
stopped pursuing the gambling house incident?

97
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,960
Because I have the Meng family behind me.

98
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,960
You're the biggest family.

99
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,960
I have you.

100
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,960
It's like I have the support of all the big families.

101
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,960
I was scared before.

102
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,960
But after so many years,

103
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,960
I've finally found out

104
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,960
that Father

105
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,960
is afraid of the power of the family.

106
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,960
You're being too serious.

107
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,960
What's there to be afraid of?

108
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,960
There's only you and me here.

109
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,960
I have nothing to say.

110
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,960
Even if I make a mistake,

111
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,960
I'm still the Crown Prince.

112
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,960
You're the eldest son of Meng Youxiang.

113
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,960
We're both in this together.

114
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,960
Why should we be afraid?

115
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,960
But the gambling house and the bank

116
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,960
are different.

117
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,960
The gambling house is

118
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,960
your personal property.

119
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,960
But the bank is the foundation of the country.

120
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,960
You must be careful.

121
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,960
Nowadays,

122
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,960
the bank

123
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,960
should be closed.

124
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,960
Huaizhi,

125
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,960
I know what I'm doing.

126
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,960
Don't talk about it again.

127
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,960
Besides,

128
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,960
do you have anything else to do?

129
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,960
Huaizhi,

130
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,960
I said

131
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,960
I have my own rules.

132
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,960
How ridiculous!

133
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,960
This is not a work.

134
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,960
This is a robbery.

135
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,960
Is there any law?

136
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,960
I want to write a letter to the Minister of State.

137
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,960
I'm sure he will be sorry for you.

138
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,960
You can't waste time.

139
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,960
Write it now.

140
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,960
But only with a form.

141
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,960
We need to have evidence.

142
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,960
Evidence?

143
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,960
All the villagers can testify.

144
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,960
Evidence?

145
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,960
What kind of evidence do you need?

146
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,960
I can help you.

147
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,960
Okay.

148
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,960
This is the mansion of Zhou Yingshi.

149
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,960
This is the place.

150
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,960
I heard

151
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,960
she lives here

152
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,960
to help the villagers

153
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,960
to get rid of the injustice.

154
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,960
She has a saying

155
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,960
that civilization is like a crystal.

156
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,960
One day,

157
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,960
she will be homeless.

158
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,960
She will not be confused.

159
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,960
I'm sorry.

160
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,960
I'm sorry.

161
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,960
I'm sorry.

162
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,960
She is so righteous.

163
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,960
She will be punished.

164
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,960
I have the grievance

165
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,960
of 76 villagers.

166
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,960
Please help them.

167
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,960
Come in.

168
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,960
I want to talk to you.

169
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,960
I didn't expect

170
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,960
someone would

171
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,960
take advantage of the name of Zhao Gong

172
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,960
to take away the good people

173
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,960
and make a big deal out of it.

174
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,960
How dare they!

175
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,960
All the villagers of Tianshui Village,

176
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,960
I will not

177
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,960
let you down.

178
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,960
We are waiting for your good news.

179
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,960
Prime Minister.

180
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,960
Tell me.

181
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,960
Can a man and a woman

182
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,960
take this man to the Palace of Eternal Purity?

183
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,960
Yes.

184
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,960
Mr. Zhou is a famous official.

185
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,960
I think he can.

186
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,960
May I ask who you are talking about?

187
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,960
Two beautiful people.

188
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,960
They are back.

189
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,960
Your Highness.

190
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,960
Your Highness.

191
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,960
Father.

192
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,960
Zhao Lu.

193
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,960
Why are you here?

194
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,960
You tell me.

195
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,960
You are looking for someone.

196
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,960
But the one you are looking for is found by me.

197
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,960
Prime Minister.

198
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,960
Come with us.

199
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,960
I don't know where

200
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,960
you have been this afternoon.

201
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:32,960
You are so

202
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,960
beautiful.

203
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,960
Please have a meal with me.

204
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,960
Look at her face.

205
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,960
Is she still angry with me for breaking her water?

206
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,960
Your Highness.

207
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,960
You are here at the right time.

208
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,960
It's not late.

209
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,960
Why is it not late?

210
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,960
If he didn't meet us on the street,

211
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,960
he might be like a fly.

212
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,960
Where are you going?

213
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,960
You look so happy.

214
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,960
We heard about the villagers' suffering.

215
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,960
We took them to report to the government.

216
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,960
Report to the government?

217
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,960
Oh no.

218
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,960
Something is going to happen.

219
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,960
You two just went to report to the government?

220
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,960
Yes. We went to report to the government.

221
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,960
That's right.

222
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,960
We gave the report to Governor Zhou.

223
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,960
He is fair and just.

224
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,960
I believe

225
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,960
this matter will be settled soon.

226
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,960
Governor Zhou.

227
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,960
I'm afraid we haven't found

228
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,960
the person who killed the governor.

229
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,960
So he died here.

230
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,960
You don't have to lie.

231
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,960
I saw Governor Zhou.

232
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,960
He is a good official.

233
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,960
Now we have solid evidence.

234
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,960
We can't find the person who killed the governor.

235
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,960
Why can't we find it?

236
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,960
It's so new.

237
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,960
Governor Zhou.

238
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,960
It's not like what happened just now.

239
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,960
Governor Zhou has been in that place for years.

240
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,960
How can he be so ignorant?

241
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,960
The back of your hand is complicated.

242
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,960
The blood is moving all over.

243
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,960
If you just put on a mask, will it disturb the spirit?

244
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,960
Nonsense.

245
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,960
In the eyes of Governor Shen,

246
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,960
everyone has a conspiracy.

247
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,960
The officials have a plan.

248
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,960
Anything is a plan of the court.

249
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,960
If so,

250
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,960
what's the use of the officials?

251
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,960
What's the use of the law?

252
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,960
What's the use of my royal family?

253
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,800
I'm sorry.

254
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,800
Young Master.

255
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,080
I'm used to

256
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,080
handling things in my own way.

257
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,320
It's useful,

258
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,920
but it does hurt the innocent.

259
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,040
You've done it.

260
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,840
You'd better be patient.

261
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,080
If it can be resolved without any blood,

262
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,240
it's even better.

263
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,040
Ice and blood.

264
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,440
Do you really believe

265
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,600
there's a way to resolve it?

266
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,240
Of course.

267
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,040
According to the law,

268
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,040
the blood is solid and the evidence is solid.

269
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,320
We can then use the law

270
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,240
to test the court.

271
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,640
Only then

272
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,000
can people believe in the law

273
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,360
and can shock more people with illegal intentions.

274
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,360
You can only see the sky and the water.

275
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,800
But in the place you can't see,

276
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,600
there are countless evils.

277
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,800
Can you handle them?

278
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,240
Do you want to

279
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,840
report to the court one by one?

280
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,960
If you don't,

281
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,040
there will be countless people waiting for you.

282
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,520
But as long as I can see,

283
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,000
I can't be like you,

284
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,200
who is stubborn and ungrateful.

285
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,120
If I report to the court one by one,

286
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,400
justice will come back.

287
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,560
The

288
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,560
The

289
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,560
The

290
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,560
The

291
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,560
The

292
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,560
The

293
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,560
The

294
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,560
The

295
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,520
Mr. Zhou,

296
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,080
you did well.

297
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,800
Get up.

298
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,520
Yes.

299
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,920
It's my fortune

300
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,840
to serve the Crown Prince.

301
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,000
If Shen Zaiye didn't report to the court one by one,

302
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,400
who would it be?

303
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,840
He didn't mention it.

304
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,160
I could only see that he was unruly.

305
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,720
He sounded like a Yujing man.

306
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,960
I kept an eye on him

307
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,200
and brought the portrait of the man and woman

308
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,600
who brought him here.

309
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,800
Envoy Qiu,

310
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,840
I spoke to Zhaoxia now.

311
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,880
Have a try, please.

312
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,520
Reed your feet for now,

313
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,400
and memorize the function.

314
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,200
Lord,

315
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,600
I will transfer you back to the imperial capital next year.

316
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,200
Change your story of the grassland to another story.

317
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

318
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,200
Sister Hua, what do you think?

319
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,400
What do you think?

320
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,200
I think...

321
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,400
Your Highness,

322
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,400
have I told you repeatedly

323
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,800
that the gambling case is over?

324
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,400
You have no plan to kill me.

325
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,600
Why do you have to kill Shen Zaiye now?

326
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,800
He and his concubine

327
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,600
have set up a trap for me.

328
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,800
I will not take revenge.

329
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,600
How can I face them?

330
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,600
Then what?

331
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,600
They failed to kill me

332
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,400
and they were forced to the Tianshui Village.

333
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,800
You told me the other day that you had a chance to transfer back.

334
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,600
You said you sent someone to chase me

335
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,400
because Lady Jiang was disrespectful to you.

336
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Now you involve the Fourth Prince.

337
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,600
It's...

338
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,600
It's a dead end.

339
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,400
Sister Hua,

340
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,400
what should we do now?

341
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,000
They haven't left the Tianshui Village for so long.

342
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,200
I think they have already found the evil clue.

343
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,200
We will wait for the time to make the confession.

344
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,000
We can't take the village anymore.

345
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,400
Please pass on my order,

346
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,600
send out the killers

347
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,800
and kill them all.

348
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,400
You are right.

349
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,000
Today, the Fourth Prince and Lady Qingying left.

350
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,000
Then Censor Zhou left the Grassland House.

351
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,400
I'm afraid that...

352
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,600
I guessed it.

353
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,600
I wanted to make the confession and investigate the situation.

354
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,600
I found that they had a secret.

355
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,600
Hongtao, something happened.

356
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,400
The food is ready.

357
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,800
The food is ready.

358
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,600
They are all gone.

359
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,000
They are not going to make the confession.

360
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,800
Let's go.

361
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,000
We can't go.

362
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
We can't go.

363
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,600
Let's go.

364
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,000
The Fourth Prince is in the front.

365
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,800
They will stop the confession soon.

366
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,400
The Crown Prince must know that I'm here.

367
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,800
The action is so rapid.

368
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,000
It must be Meng Huaijin's men.

369
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,000
Go and gather the people and come here.

370
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,200
Keep an eye on them.

371
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,000
Yes.

372
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,400
The Crown Prince is so determined.

373
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,400
It means he is going to make the confession.

374
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,400
Now the enemy is in a dead end.

375
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,000
I must make the plan early.

376
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,080
Come on, have a look.

377
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,400
Your Highness.

378
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,300
Nothing even happens while PP Their Highness is here.

379
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,200
Have something to eat.

380
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,800
I was very picky about food when I was young.

381
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,720
I couldn't eat

382
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,040
any kind of seafood.

383
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,840
Only the taro my mother made for me

384
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,120
was not delicious.

385
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,840
My mother had no choice

386
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,800
but to make this taro

387
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,720
into a flower and eat it.

388
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,080
Since my mother died,

389
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,320
I haven't eaten it for a long time.

390
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,680
I'm sorry.

391
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I'm sorry.

392
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,600
I'm sorry.

393
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,600
I'm sorry.

394
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,800
What a coincidence.

395
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,360
My brother and I often eat this in the North Court.

396
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:27,780
No wonder I always remember the

397
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:34,880
Your Highness isn't upset about what happened.

398
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,800
I won't change my feelings.

399
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,600
Today ataxic,

400
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,280
I also listened to His Highness's words and

401
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,720
was like buying our entire country to spend it.

402
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,000
Your kindness and modesty

403
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,880
make me admire of you.

404
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,400
If you really cherish X LOLMATYesman

405
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,680
as you said,

406
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,240
it's easy to solve it according to the law.

407
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,640
It's really a good thing.

408
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,200
But

409
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,440
in the heart of Peach Blossom,

410
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,680
it's not like what you said.

411
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,080
After we came here,

412
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,560
we didn't report to the government.

413
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,880
We were afraid that

414
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,640
there would be a lot of people watching us.

415
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,920
If we alert them,

416
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,280
it's not good.

417
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,120
I know what you mean.

418
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,520
But

419
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,520
there are rules that can't be followed.

420
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,640
If there is no law,

421
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,280
there will be no restrictions on power.

422
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,800
The strong can bully the weak.

423
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,920
The country will be in chaos.

424
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,960
And we who have power

425
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,080
can't obey the law.

426
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,400
Then the existence of the law

427
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,160
will be meaningless.

428
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,960
If there is no law,

429
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,440
why should we talk about the country?

430
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,120
The reason why I insist on reporting to the government

431
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,120
is because of this.

432
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,640
You are kind-hearted.

433
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,520
I'm not as good as you.

434
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,640
Actually,

435
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,160
an old friend taught me all this.

436
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,160
An old friend?

437
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,160
Yes.

438
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,040
He taught me to play the zither,

439
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,400
to recite poems,

440
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,960
and some holy things.

441
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,160
I'm just a disciple of him.

442
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,000
Is this old friend

443
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,040
your teacher?

444
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,640
He is my cousin.

445
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,160
Cousin?

446
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,040
Yes.

447
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,640
My cousin

448
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,560
is a talented zither player.

449
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,640
He's been chasing it for his whole life.

450
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,040
So he's the most important person in the world.

451
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,840
Read this sentence with me.

452
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,640
To rule the country with power,

453
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,120
to use the military to rule the world with no power.

454
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,640
Cousin, what does this sentence mean?

455
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,920
What does it mean?

456
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:00,800
It means that

457
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,120
with the state of the righteous,

458
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,000
the country won't be in chaos.

459
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,560
Using the military to rule the country with power,

460
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,400
the country will be able to win.

461
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,840
To rule the world without disturbing the people,

462
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,920
the country will be in peace.

463
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,920
My cousin's family

464
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,520
is a family of scholars.

465
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,040
They have been officials for generations.

466
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,600
They are loyal to my zither.

467
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,360
But my mother has been involved in it.

468
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,200
She has been in a terrible situation.

469
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,840
My family will be in chaos.

470
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:29,920
Kill them!

471
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,680
My husband.

472
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,320
My husband.

473
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,400
I didn't expect

474
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,040
he would be in such a state.

475
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,800
I wonder where my cousin is now.

476
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,480
He is long gone.

477
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,320
Little rabbit.

478
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,840
You lied to us last time.

479
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,040
If you dare to lie to anyone again today,

480
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,080
I'll skin you alive.

481
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,760
This time, it will be fine.

482
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:34,840
I lied to Shen Zai

483
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,720
to let him go and chop the wood by himself.

484
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:56,840
Go.

485
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,360
Huai.

486
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,880
What did you eat?

487
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,800
Do me a favor.

488
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,800
What favor?

489
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,800
Take me to the place where you work.

490
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,480
No, no.

491
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,880
You have a choice now.

492
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,600
I...

493
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,680
I know.

494
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,120
You have the master watching you.

495
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,200
You just need to arrange me

496
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,040
to take your servant there.

497
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,320
You don't have to worry about the rest.

498
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,040
What about my poison?

499
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,800
I'll give you the antidote after it's done.

500
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,480
Okay.

501
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,560
Dartu.

502
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:00,720
Dartu.

503
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,960
Lian.

504
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,200
Why hasn't he come back yet?

505
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,200
Don't worry.

506
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,200
I'm afraid that the children are too playful.

507
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,200
You don't know.

508
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,200
There are many beasts in the mountains.

509
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,200
It's dangerous at night.

510
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,200
But this child is the most important.

511
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,200
I don't know why this time.

512
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,200
I'll go find it.

513
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,200
Xiaolian.

514
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,200
Xiaolian.

515
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,200
Xiaolian.

516
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,200
This is...

517
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,200
This is blood.

518
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,200
One time, it's not loyal.

519
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,200
A hundred times, it's not loyal.

520
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,200
Although he failed to kill me this time,

521
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,200
I know there will be no next time.

522
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,200
Xiao Ao

523
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,200
is not the reason for his mistake.

524
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,200
I'm used to making fun of his wife.

525
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,200
No one can help him.

526
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,200
No one can help him.

527
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,200
Mother.

528
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,200
What's up?

529
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,200
Xiaolian is not in the village all day.

530
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,200
Don't you think it's strange?

531
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,200
The children are just late for the visit.

532
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,200
What's so strange?

533
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,200
Xiaolian

534
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,200
betrayed us before.

535
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,200
He did things.

536
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,200
Do you think I killed him?

537
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,200
That's not what I mean.

538
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,200
I want to say...

539
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,200
So what if I killed him?

540
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,200
I am cruel.

541
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,200
I can't allow anyone to betray me.

542
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,200
Just like Mrs. Jiang.

543
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,200
She is lying to me.

544
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,200
She hid the half-sign of the sun and the thousand flowers.

545
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,200
I don't know what she is thinking.

546
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,200
She hid the half-sign of the sun and the thousand flowers.

547
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,200
She wants to be a bargaining chip.

548
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,200
You are cunning.

549
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,200
I can kill you.

550
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,200
You saw the half-sign of my clothes?

551
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,200
If not,

552
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,200
I don't know that now Mrs. Jiang's eyes

553
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,200
are so clear.

554
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,200
She played me so well.

555
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,200
I admire her.

556
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,200
Xiaolian

557
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,200
I know now.

558
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,200
Do you think I will believe your words again?

559
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,200
In order to avoid the life of Mrs. Jiang,

560
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,200
I advise you to stay and do your work.

561
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,200
I will be your wife.

562
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,200
I will be your wife.

563
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,200
I will be your wife.

564
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,200
I will be your wife.

565
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,200
I will be your wife.

566
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,200
I will be your wife.

567
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,200
I will be your wife.

568
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,200
I will be your wife.

569
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,200
I will be your wife.

570
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,200
I will be your wife.

571
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,200
I will be your wife.

572
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,200
I will be your wife.

573
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,200
I will be your wife.

574
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,200
I will be your wife.

575
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,200
I will be your wife.

576
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,200
I will be your wife.

577
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,200
Grandma

578
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,200
This is the white gourd candy

579
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,200
that Qingyun sister brought me to the town.

580
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,200
It's not delicious.

581
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,200
I don't want it.

582
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,200
Really?

583
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,200
Hurry to eat.

584
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,200
Hurry to eat.

585
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,200
Grandma doesn't eat.

586
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,200
Mom, eat more.

587
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,200
Okay.

588
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,720
I misunderstood him.

589
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,720
But where did the blood from him come from?

590
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,200
What are you doing here?

591
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,960
I misunderstood you today.

592
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,360
I came to apologize.

593
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,240
You haven't eaten anything since you came back.

594
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,720
Have some peaches.

595
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,480
My Lord,

596
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,320
My Lord,

597
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:09,880
I did have my reasons for

598
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,480
making that half-painting.

599
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,800
But I can swear

600
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,080
I won't do anything that could harm Daqi

601
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,760
or My Lord.

602
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,600
If I break my promise,

603
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,000
I won't see my family again.

604
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,080
This is the most serious

605
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,440
promise I've made.

606
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,280
Don't you believe me?

607
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,240
She's just a maid.

608
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,040
She deserves you.

609
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,440
She's never been a maid to me.

610
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,600
She's my family.

611
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,840
Don't go.

612
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
You can go back now.

613
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,080
It's a long journey.

614
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,120
How about I go with you tonight?

615
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,040
Go with me?

616
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,760
Aren't you afraid

617
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,720
I'll go there to kill and rob?

618
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,720
So what?

619
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,040
I'm not a kind person.

620
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,360
If you kill me,

621
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,360
I'll be willing to be

622
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,640
the one who kills me.

623
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,080
Besides,

624
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,560
I've told you

625
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,640
what you're going to do tonight.

626
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,160
You used me to find Gongtong

627
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,360
and forced him to take you to the palace.

628
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,200
I want to find out the source of the evil money.

629
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,680
I'm doing a good thing.

630
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,200
I admire you for not being enough.

631
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,080
Why would I be afraid of going with you?

632
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,160
You've promised.

633
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,160
My Lord, I'm here.

634
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,640
Hou Han,

635
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,880
why are there so many people?

636
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,280
It doesn't matter.

637
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,400
Let's go.

638
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,280
Yes.

639
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,240
Follow me.

640
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,440
I don't know if he's trustworthy.

641
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,480
Is there any ambush?

642
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,440
You seemed so calm last time.

643
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,560
Did you arrange it?

644
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,880
You're smart.

645
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,200
I've asked Zhan Hong to take people to the side.

646
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,640
If we can find out the truth,

647
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:42,920
if not,

648
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,240
we can delay the time for the villagers.

649
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,600
Dismantle the time?

650
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,640
What do you mean?

651
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,720
I've told Qingying and Fourth Prince

652
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,560
to wait outside the village.

653
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,200
If they find the enemy,

654
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,720
they'll take the villagers to transfer.

655
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,520
My brother is right.

656
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,200
What a bad person he is!

657
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,600
He's a good official.

658
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,520
Luckily, we've got the defense.

659
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,920
Go back and inform them.

660
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:06,680
Go.

661
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,440
According to the order of the Crown Prince,

662
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,800
once we know you're here,

663
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,200
we'll kill them all.

664
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,680
No one is left alive.

665
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,440
Guo Shan is here.

666
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:24,720
Watch out.

667
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,720
I love you, Fengmou.

668
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,400
I'm deceived by you.

669
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,280
Don't move.

670
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,040
When are you to stop?

671
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,360
You don't even know

672
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,720
what to do.

673
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,800
Diese is a danger.

674
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,000
Don't move!

675
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,040
I'm afraid we're caught in the battle.

676
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,320
I hope that we can get through them

677
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,720
and get to the villagers in time.

678
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,480
Grandfather, Grandma, come out quickly.

679
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,240
Uncle Jiang, open the door.

680
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,360
Someone is coming to stop us.

681
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,480
Everyone, run!

682
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,320
Oh no.

683
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,160
I forgot to take your brother's things.

684
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,160
I want to go with them.

685
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,360
Grandma, you have to hurry up.

686
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,160
Hurry up.

687
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,520
Hurry up.

688
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,320
Hurry up.

689
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,040
Hurry up.

690
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,640
Last time,

691
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,280
I ordered Quitean to take down and Build Uzi in Hongoxi.

692
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,040
We were arrived in Xiangyang just now.

693
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,320
ünden止 them in this area.

694
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,000
Top take down the war!

695
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,720
Immediately!

696
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,480
Top, take down!

697
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,400
Careful.

698
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,200
You're hurt.

699
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,000
It's nothing.

700
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,400
Let's go.

701
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:03,760
Let's go.

702
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:05,640
Let's go.

703
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,680
Go after them.

704
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,680
Don't let them get away.

705
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,680
I'll beat you.

706
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,000
Be careful.

707
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:35,880
Mu Gu Xia.

708
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,200
Is he awake?

709
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,640
Sister Qing Yun.

710
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,520
Have you seen my grandma?

711
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,480
Isn't she with you?

712
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,040
Lian.

713
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,280
How about this?

714
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,280
Take us to the southeast

715
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,440
and go through a bamboo forest

716
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,480
and a bamboo house.

717
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,720
You wait for me and my sister there.

718
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,240
We'll be back soon, okay?

719
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,520
How do you know?

720
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,520
Your brother told me.

721
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,040
Then we must find my grandma.

722
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,640
Don't worry.

723
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,280
Then follow me.

724
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:12,680
Go.

725
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,680
Don't touch. Stop.

726
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,560
Stop.

727
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,480
Xiao Jia.

728
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:38,840
Xiao Jia.

729
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:39,800
Xiao Jia.

730
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:57,440
Stop.

731
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:57,920
Go after her.

732
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,520
You want to steal my flower?

733
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,520
Lai Zi!

734
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,520
This is bad.

735
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,520
The grass is going to get stuck.

736
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,520
What should we do? We can't get in.

737
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,520
Help me.

738
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,520
Help me.

739
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,520
The flower blooms without knowing

740
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,520
The beauty of the flower can't be ignored

741
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,520
The flower falls, the north wind blows

742
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,520
The city is in a state of panic

743
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,520
The petals are wet with rain

744
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,520
The heart is with the knot

745
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,520
The flower falls, the tears are in the heart

746
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,520
The heart is with the tears

747
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,520
The flower falls, the tears are in the heart

748
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,520
The heart is with theituated

749
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,520
The results are out of reach

750
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,520
What the wishesoi want to make must beruption

751
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:53,520
Regret is winded by the ble Daily

752
00:40:53,520 --> 00:41:01,000
I still look forward to the flowers in my arms

753
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:12,600
Even if I have to give up my life for the song

754
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,720
Who will lose the heart of flowers?

755
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,320
Love and hate can only be eaten

756
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,920
The flower withers and the heart is broken

757
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:40,920
No more notice

758
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:51,920
How to love, love crazyly

759
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:59,120
Not afraid to be surprised by the world

760
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:06,520
I hope what he said is related to the words

761
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:18,920
It turns out that he has the answer of love
