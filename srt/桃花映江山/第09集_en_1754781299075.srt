(Adapted from the novel "Peach Blossoms

17
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,900
=Episode 9=

18
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,640
Am I seeing things?

19
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,840
Why did I see the treacherous chancellor
chopping wood?

20
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,840
Sir is such a good man.

21
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,640
I'm old and useless.

22
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,520
Lian is frail.

23
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,840
The firewood in the woodshed

24
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,480
is all branches picked up from outside.

25
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,640
Sir saw it

26
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,440
and chopped some wood
early in the morning.

27
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,360
He hasn't

28
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,280
rested at all.

29
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,440
Sir asked me to get a sweat towel.

30
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,080
Since you're here,

31
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,960
you can wipe his sweat.

32
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,280
Go.

33
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,720
(What?)

34
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,120
(I have to wipe his sweat?)

35
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,360
No need.

36
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:36,960
I can do it myself.

37
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,000
Alright.

38
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,880
Come here.

39
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,440
Come and eat.

40
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,280
Coming.

41
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:50,840
Granny.

42
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,120
We walked around the village yesterday

43
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,240
and really like the countryside.

44
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,400
I wonder if we can stay
for a few more days

45
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,760
and inquire

46
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,840
about carriages to Yujing.

47
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,560
That won't work.

48
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,200
You agreed to stay for only one day.

49
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,480
It's not a big deal.

50
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,280
If you like it,

51
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,720
just stay.

52
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,720
Ask Lian to help with the carriage.

53
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,520
She's always running around.

54
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,240
I refuse.

55
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,280
You...

56
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,360
Where are you going?

57
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,240
Sorry, this child has a temper.

58
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,000
It's alright.

59
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:23,920
Don't worry.

60
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,120
During our stay here,

61
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,400
we'll handle

62
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,480
the farm work.

63
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,320
Sir.

64
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,880
Take a break.

65
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,760
Drink some water.

66
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,080
Alright.

67
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,080
You agreed to leave in a day!

68
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,480
You didn't keep your word!

69
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,400
It's you for being too gullible.

70
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,080
I'll keep an eye on you

71
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,480
and see what you're up to!

72
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,400
Sit down.

73
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:15,960
Sure.

74
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,520
You worked all morning.

75
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,520
Have some water.

76
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:27,560
Here.

77
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,440
Thank you.

78
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,880
This village is poor,

79
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,400
but the villagers
live in peace and contentment.

80
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,840
If I could settle down here

81
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,920
and stay away from court disputes,

82
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,640
wouldn't that be great?

83
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,960
The countryside is soothing,

84
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,760
but not everyone is qualified

85
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,040
to stay away from court disputes

86
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,880
and live freely.

87
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,520
You've been in a high position
for a long time.

88
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,840
Many things must be beyond your control,

89
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,080
but sometimes

90
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,600
holding on to a yearning

91
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,440
is to preserve a small patch of peace

92
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,760
within one's heart.

93
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,440
What do you think?

94
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,080
(This yearning)

95
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,240
(doesn't seem fake.)

96
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,320
(Maybe)

97
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,440
(you're also acting against your heart.)

98
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,600
(Jiang Taohua.)

99
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,600
(If you weren't Beiyuan's princess,)

100
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,640
(wouldn't that be great?)

101
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,280
Miss.

102
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,800
I don't mean to give you a hard time.

103
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,640
It's just that Chancellor isn't around.

104
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,440
No one is in charge.

105
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,120
Go back to your room and rest.

106
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,760
Zaiye isn't around.

107
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,080
Meng Zhenzhen can't decide.

108
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,240
And you're making excuses.

109
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,480
Are you trying to drive me mad

110
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,040
from being cooped up in this residence?

111
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,560
I don't care.

112
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,240
If you don't give me an answer today,

113
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,520
you can forget about going out.

114
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,200
Alright.

115
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,240
I'm not going out.

116
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,240
What do you mean?

117
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,000
Sorry for offending you.

118
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,720
But it concerns your safety.

119
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,720
I have no other choice.

120
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,040
Take Miss back to her room.

121
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,920
Please take good care of her
during this period.

122
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,490
- Yes.
- Yes.

123
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,280
No!

124
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,160
Zhan Lu!

125
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,160
Zhan Lu!

126
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,160
I'm going to tell Zaiye about you!

127
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,880
(How dare you, Zhan Lu?)

128
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,240
(You won't let me go out,)

129
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,720
(yet you go out quite often.)

130
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,000
(But why did he go out
if Zaiye isn't around?)

131
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,680
(Did something happen to Zaiye?)

132
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,360
(Half of Sunlight over a Thousand Peaks.)

133
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,040
(Who are you going to give the rest to?)

134
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,120
(It seems
that you never really believed me.)

135
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,080
(The so-called alliance)

136
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,480
(is just a cover for you to survive.)

137
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,180
Why are you peeling
so many bamboo shoots?

138
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,040
My husband worked hard today.

139
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,320
I want to stew
some bamboo shoots for him.

140
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,480
But this is too much.

141
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,560
It doesn't matter.

142
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,280
My husband loves it.

143
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,080
(She's full of schemes)

144
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,560
(and has a hidden agenda,)

145
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,880
(but looked pitiful and loyal.)

146
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,600
(I prided myself
for seeing through many people,)

147
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,480
(yet I was also almost deceived,)

148
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,280
(risking my life to save you.)

149
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,160
(Shen Zaiye.)

150
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,200
(From now on,)

151
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,680
(don't trust this woman.)

152
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,640
Why didn't you get changed?

153
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,720
Sir looks scary.

154
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,080
I agree.

155
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,800
Did you have an argument?

156
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,440
Hurry and coax him.

157
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,680
Me?

158
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,680
I'm a lady.

159
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,560
Why should I coax a grown man?

160
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:05,880
Miss.

161
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,280
Be careful not to let another woman
steal your husband.

162
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,280
There aren't many men in our village.

163
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,040
Now that one finally showed up,

164
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,280
and such a heroic one at that,

165
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,080
many women have been secretly

166
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,440
asking my grandmother about him.

167
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,040
If you don't want to end up

168
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,240
being alone,

169
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,920
cherish him.

170
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,880
These young ladies are blind.

171
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,140
How could they fall
for such a treacherous chancellor?

172
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,960
Sir is strong and has a great figure!

173
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,640
What does him having a strong figure
have to do with you?

174
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,040
Sir.

175
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,680
Come to our house at noon
to taste our cooking!

176
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,320
I'm not bragging.

177
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,400
My daughter

178
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,880
is a great cook.

179
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,040
Go to my house.

180
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,880
My family killed a chicken today.

181
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,440
Isn't your daughter engaged?

182
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,880
Why are you still having other ideas?

183
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,480
No need.

184
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,320
I just want to be alone for a while.

185
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,680
The word "alone"

186
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,000
sounds melodious when Sir says it.

187
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,040
He must be a scholar.

188
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:07,880
Sir.

189
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,040
Where do you reside?

190
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,803
You're even asking him that?

191
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,920
Will you quit it?

192
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,720
Sir is already married.

193
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,280
He has a wife.

194
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,080
Darling.

195
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,880
His wife is here.

196
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,320
Hurry, go.

197
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,680
Didn't you invite him

198
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,240
to your house for chicken?

199
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,520
Come eat.

200
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,040
Granny

201
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,880
saw you went out to farm without eating

202
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,200
and asked me

203
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,640
to bring you some food.

204
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,000
Tell me.

205
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,800
As a chancellor,

206
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,320
yet you're more skilled at farming

207
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,360
than actual farmers.

208
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,480
Is it the important matter
you mentioned?

209
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,240
What's wrong?

210
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,760
You're digging into my past.

211
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,160
Are you hoping to find some clue

212
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:09,880
to use against me?

213
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:11,720
I advise you

214
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,560
to stop wasting your time.

215
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:15,880
I'm full.

216
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,840
Remember your mission.

217
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,880
Why is this man so fickle?

218
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,240
Seriously.

219
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,020
(Shen Residence)

220
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,320
Miss Qingying?

221
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,680
What a coincidence.

222
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,480
I practiced lightness skill
at the courtyard wall today,

223
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,680
but there was a minor accident.

224
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,480
Are you here to see Zaiye or Lady Jiang?

225
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,240
Do as you please.

226
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,600
Are you sneaking out?

227
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,240
Yes.

228
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,960
I'm going to find Zaiye and Lady Jiang.

229
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,240
Find Lady Jiang?

230
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,360
Did something happen to her?

231
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,600
Does it have anything to do
with her beating Prince Wugou

232
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,240
on the street?

233
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,760
She beat His Highness?

234
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,000
No wonder.

235
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,880
It's urgent, I won't say more.

236
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:23,680
Wait.

237
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,120
I'll go with you.

238
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,520
You?

239
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,040
You're delicate and don't know Kung Fu.

240
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,320
What's the point of you going?

241
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,240
(Tianshui Town Inn)

242
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:41,880
Excuse me.

243
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,480
Have you ever seen someone this tall?

244
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,040
He's a handsome, elegant

245
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,960
and approachable man.

246
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,080
He'll have a woman

247
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,120
about this tall with him.

248
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,280
No.

249
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,160
Alright, thanks.

250
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,400
Miss Qingying.

251
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,080
Were you describing

252
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,680
Chancellor Shen?

253
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,000
Of course.

254
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,240
Handsome,

255
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,520
elegant

256
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,880
and approachable?

257
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,600
It seems we will never find them.

258
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,760
Why?

259
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,200
If you ask me,

260
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,120
Shen Zaiye suffered this misfortune

261
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,600
simply because he has too many enemies.

262
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,040
It's destined.

263
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,500
The evil things he's done
haven't gone unpunished.

264
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,920
They're just waiting for him
to lose power

265
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,240
so that they can rise against him.

266
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,320
You scholars
have studied yourselves stupid.

267
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,880
You can't tell who's good and who's bad.

268
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:34,680
Sure.

269
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,120
He's a good man.

270
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,480
Why hasn't he shown any concern

271
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,680
for the ladies you rescued?

272
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,480
Miss.

273
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,440
Miss, save me.

274
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,320
There's a bad guy who's been tailing me.

275
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,160
I'm scared.

276
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,040
Miss, save me.

277
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:49,960
What?

278
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,240
How dare they be this brazen

279
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,200
in broad daylight?

280
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,520
I'll help you teach them a lesson.

281
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:55,840
Alright.

282
00:14:56,089 --> 00:14:56,480
Qingying.

283
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,540
They're begging on the streets
at such a young age.

284
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:12,640
Tell me.

285
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,840
If I go to the pastry shop owner

286
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,600
and ask for food,

287
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,880
will he give it to me?

288
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,760
What do you think?

289
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,160
It's all thanks
to Heroine Xiang's bravery

290
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,040
and help

291
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,880
that we're robbed of everything.

292
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,240
Even our clothes were taken.

293
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,720
We can only wear these rags.

294
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,480
Who knew such a thing would happen?

295
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,040
Should we abandon justice

296
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,680
for fear of being deceived by bad guys?

297
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,600
I didn't say that.

298
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,680
I just think

299
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,040
you can think before taking action

300
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,480
next time.

301
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,840
Are you calling me reckless?

302
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,400
Sure.

303
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,720
I'm reckless.

304
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,240
I won't drag you down.

305
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,680
This is where we part ways.

306
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,840
I'll go and save Zaiye myself.

307
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,200
Miss Qingying.

308
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,080
Miss Qingying.

309
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,880
That's not what I meant.

310
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:12,680
Mu Wuxia, look.

311
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,200
It's a mark that Zaiye left.

312
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,240
(No way.)

313
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,600
(Even that counts?)

314
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,640
My husband and I
have been in this village

315
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,640
for some time,

316
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,520
yet we haven't seen
any other men around.

317
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,360
It's all because
of that treacherous chancellor,

318
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,380
who harmed the loyal
and committed countless sins,

319
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,920
Shen Zaiye.

320
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,320
What does this have to do with him?

321
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,760
If it weren't for him,

322
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,640
would we be in this situation?

323
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,680
- Yes.
- Yes.

324
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,040
What on earth is going on?

325
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,920
You don't know.

326
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,560
My companions

327
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,440
and I

328
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,240
originally lived elsewhere.

329
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,880
We're not rich,

330
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,160
but tending the land
passed down through generations

331
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,040
has been peaceful.

332
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,520
But who would have known that one day

333
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,480
officials came suddenly

334
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,080
and told us that the land we farmed

335
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,200
was the court's military farmland.

336
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,840
They also called us

337
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,280
rioters who maliciously
farmed the court's land.

338
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,720
They also sent officials
just to suppress us.

339
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,000
The leader

340
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,320
is the current
treacherous chancellor, Shen Zaiye.

341
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,640
That's right.

342
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,840
He brought soldiers

343
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,960
and nearly massacred the whole village.

344
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,640
Luckily, a kind person helped us escape

345
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,200
that we survived.

346
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,480
How can something so lawless happen

347
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,880
in a supposedly just world?

348
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,960
You don't know.

349
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,360
Later,

350
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,680
we sent people out to get information.

351
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,240
Only then did we know

352
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,960
the so-called military farmland

353
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,840
was just a cover.

354
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,520
Some powerful officials in the court

355
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,880
had set their eyes on our ancestral land

356
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,280
and wanted to occupy it,

357
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,040
so they framed us as rioters.

358
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,560
The treacherous chancellor, Shen Zaiye,

359
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,240
colluded with the powerful officials

360
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,200
to set us up.

361
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,800
Losing our land

362
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,280
made our lives

363
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,000
even more difficult.

364
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,360
We can only rely
on the men in our family

365
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,880
to work outside

366
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,920
and send money home.

367
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,760
I see.

368
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,280
The truth

369
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,640
is so complicated.

370
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,600
Because of this,

371
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,600
my older brother left the village
to make money

372
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,280
to support me and Grandma.

373
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,650
He never came back for even a day
during the Chinese New Year.

374
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,840
I don't know how he's doing now.

375
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,600
I've only heard
of people with old friends everywhere,

376
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,560
never someone with enemies everywhere.

377
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,000
I never expected

378
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,800
villagers like this

379
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,720
to bear old grudges against you.

380
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,560
I'm

381
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,800
scared to reveal

382
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,040
our true identities now.

383
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,600
Otherwise, there might be trouble.

384
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,400
Please learn to shut up then.

385
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,800
We're in the same boat now.

386
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,040
Of course I won't reveal it.

387
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,280
In the same boat?

388
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,760
Exactly.

389
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,520
So you'd

390
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,040
better be nice to me.

391
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,640
Just think of it as a good deed.

392
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,720
Or you won't even
have someone to help you

393
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,760
when you're down and out.

394
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,160
If one day

395
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,680
I need you to save me,

396
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,560
I must be truly beyond saving.

397
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,760
Perhaps the high and mighty

398
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,480
will also need
the little people one day.

399
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,080
However,

400
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,840
there's something I don't understand.

401
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,040
Since you're so obsessed
with investigating

402
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,040
the counterfeit money,

403
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,480
why...

404
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,480
You're asking

405
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,280
why I'm investigating

406
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,760
while harming the people?

407
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,580
A general's glory is based
on the sacrifice of countless lives.

408
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,880
Don't you understand

409
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,960
such a simple truth?

410
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,240
So those villagers

411
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,800
are the ones who have to be sacrificed?

412
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,360
It's their fault for being so weak.

413
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,760
They can't even protect themselves.

414
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,480
No one stays weak forever!

415
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,480
They will also use
their pens, ink and swords

416
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,240
to become people who can protect others!

417
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:58,880
(Turns out)

418
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,800
(you're the Shen Zaiye who made us)

419
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,760
(homeless.)

420
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,560
Grandma.

421
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,760
I'm back!

422
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,720
You're back.

423
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,760
Lian.

424
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:32,840
The market

425
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,640
is being held in town today.

426
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,000
Take

427
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,160
Sir and Miss

428
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,520
with you

429
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,560
to town to find a carriage depot

430
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,560
and ask about the price to Yujing.

431
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,380
The sooner you go,
the sooner you'll be back.

432
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,200
Hurry.

433
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,080
Come with me.

434
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:49,480
Sure.

435
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:52,720
Here.

436
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:02,960
Let's go.

437
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,600
Lian's taking us to town.

438
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:09,480
Sure.

439
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,960
(Why is Lian acting weird today?)

440
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,040
(Tianshui Town Inn)

441
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,400
Freshly steamed buns.

442
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,600
They're made today.

443
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,360
Here.

444
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,320
Mr. Wang, here you go.

445
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:34,800
Thank you.

446
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,880
Take care.

447
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,560
Come again.

448
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,120
Sure.

449
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,440
Lian.

450
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,760
Something's off with you today.

451
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,840
Why are you so quiet?

452
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,560
Don't you want us to leave?

453
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,040
If you took the wrong road,

454
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,680
there's still time to change direction.

455
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,880
We didn't take the wrong road.

456
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,880
Miss, run. There's an ambush!

457
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,280
Catch them!

458
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,080
Don't let them get away!

459
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:57,760
Hurry.

460
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:58,880
Miss, hurry.

461
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,600
Lian, slow down.

462
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,400
Lian.

463
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,560
Lian, slow down.

464
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,520
Lian.

465
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:15,640
Lian.

466
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,640
Are you alright?

467
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,360
Lian.

468
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,040
Are you alright?

469
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:23,800
Are you hurt?

470
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,280
Speak.

471
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,400
Why did you lead us to town?

472
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,640
What are you doing?

473
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,840
Here, get up.

474
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,000
Here, get up.

475
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,440
Lian.

476
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:45,760
Did you find

477
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,200
the people today?

478
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,040
Miss.

479
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:48,480
Sorry.

480
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,040
Since you already agreed to their orders

481
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,080
and led us here,

482
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,040
that means you know

483
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,200
a group of people is chasing us.

484
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,200
But we haven't done anything

485
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,680
to hurt you in the past few days.

486
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,760
Why do you want to hurt us?

487
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,120
Because of him!

488
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,160
He's the treacherous chancellor,
Shen Zaiye.

489
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,680
I heard your conversation that day

490
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,040
and found out

491
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,720
he's the treacherous chancellor
who harmed our entire village.

492
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,880
If it weren't for him,

493
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,780
my brother
wouldn't have gone out to work.

494
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,040
If he hadn't gone to work,

495
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,640
those people wouldn't have detained him.

496
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,480
Since you know my identity,

497
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,000
you should know that I'm ruthless.

498
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,280
Tell me

499
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,600
everything you know in detail.

500
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,280
Otherwise...

501
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:43,880
Alright.

502
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,960
Stop crying, Lian.

503
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,480
Alright, stop crying.

504
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:51,880
Alright, Lian.

505
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:52,560
Stop crying.

506
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:53,520
Stop crying.

507
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,360
Look at what you did.

508
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,040
Alright.

509
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,320
Lian, can you tell me

510
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,800
who detained your brother?

511
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,080
A few years ago,

512
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,760
some people came to the village
to recruit workers.

513
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,560
Calm down.

514
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,080
Line up.

515
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:17,960
Come on, move forward.

516
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:18,800
Name.

517
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,000
- It pays well,
- 30 years old.

518
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,760
- so most of the adult men went.
- Next.

519
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,640
Name.

520
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,040
Including my brother.

521
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,000
Lian.

522
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:27,480
Next.

523
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,880
After I leave,

524
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,960
you have to take good care of yourself.

525
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,280
Once I finish my work,

526
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,120
I'll come home.

527
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,080
Don't go.

528
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,560
Those who worked for the nobles
never come back.

529
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:40,640
Lian.

530
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,800
Those people didn't come home,

531
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,000
but

532
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,920
they did send money back.

533
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,680
So there's definitely no problem.

534
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,280
Alright.

535
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,400
You must remember to write to me then.

536
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,120
Sure.

537
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,280
I'll write to you.

538
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,520
Since then,

539
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,800
I never heard from him again.

540
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,680
We receive money from him

541
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,360
every month,

542
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,320
but I haven't seen
a single letter from him.

543
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,800
He always keeps his word.

544
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,200
He promised to write me a letter,

545
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,720
so he would definitely keep his word.

546
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,080
If he hasn't written,

547
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,560
something must have happened.

548
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,000
Among those trying to catch you in town,

549
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,320
I saw the foreman who took my brother.

550
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:29,480
I thought

551
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,880
you're a bad guy
who harms the people anyway.

552
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,120
Why not take you there

553
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,240
in exchange for my brother?

554
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,840
Think of it as doing a good deed.

555
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,280
Since your brother
is so important to you,

556
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,120
why did you regret it
at the last minute?

557
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,960
You're a bad person,

558
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,280
but Miss is kind.

559
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,920
I don't want to hurt her.

560
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,280
Alright, I've said
everything I need to say.

561
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,080
The village women said

562
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,240
you'll skin and gut

563
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,680
those who disobey you.

564
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,040
Now that I've eaten and drunk,

565
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,240
go ahead.

566
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,760
Look at you.

567
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,240
Even a child in a mountain village

568
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,880
knows the way you do things.

569
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,360
Lian.

570
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,320
We won't kill you.

571
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,040
You're very brave

572
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:17,840
and very smart.

573
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,000
If my family was locked up,

574
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,400
I would also save them at all costs.

575
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,520
So you did nothing wrong.

576
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,880
But you have to remember

577
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,880
not to act rashly

578
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,320
before you're absolutely sure

579
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,880
of what you're doing.

580
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,640
Are you sure
your brother will be released

581
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,560
after you hand us over to the foreman?

582
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,480
But my brother...

583
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,000
Lian, don't worry.

584
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,360
This treacherous chancellor

585
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,800
doesn't do a lot of good deeds,

586
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,000
but this time,

587
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,200
he'll help you rescue your brother.

588
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,040
Really?

589
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,360
If you want to do good deeds,
don't include me.

590
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,040
Betray once,

591
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,440
and you'll never be trusted again.

592
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,120
She failed in harming me this time,

593
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,880
who knows if there won't be a next time?

594
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,000
Everyone makes mistakes.

595
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,640
Let alone a child this young.

596
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,280
Being a child

597
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,880
isn't a reason for her to make mistakes.

598
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,720
You want to protect her?

599
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,240
Yes.

600
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:33,840
Jiang Taohua.

601
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,040
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

602
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,040
Be careful

603
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,840
not to let her control you someday.

604
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,840
(Shen Zaiye said before)

605
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,600
(that he isn't from a noble family.)

606
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:56,640
(He has experienced
the ups and downs of life.)

607
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,360
(What has he been through)

608
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,840
(to make him so cautious)

609
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,360
(toward everyone?)

610
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,480
What do we do?

611
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:27,920
The mark ends here.

612
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,760
There seems to be someone over there.

613
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,120
Let's go.

614
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:46,640
Granny.

615
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:48,520
Granny.

616
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,200
Granny.

617
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,360
What's wrong?

618
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,640
Your rice bag is leaking.

619
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,280
Unbelievable.

620
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,040
Thank you, young man.

621
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,840
I was wondering

622
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,200
why the rice bag was getting lighter.

623
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,640
Granny, let me carry it.

624
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:02,880
Sure.

625
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,080
Young people nowadays

626
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,200
are all kind.

627
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,360
Granny.

628
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,160
When you said all,

629
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,000
have you met

630
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,480
other kind young people?

631
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,400
Yes.

632
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,560
A few days ago,

633
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,080
a couple came to the village.

634
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,840
They're as kind as you and your husband.

635
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,560
- Granny.
- Granny.

636
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,680
- We're not...
- We're not...

637
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,880
- That couple...
- You said...

638
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,440
- That couple...
- You said...

639
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,720
Calm down.

640
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,960
I'll take you to meet

641
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:43,520
that man

642
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,640
and that lady.

643
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:46,960
Follow me.

644
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,320
Sure.

645
00:31:47,652 --> 00:31:48,480
My home

646
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,520
is right ahead of us.

647
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,400
Grandma.

648
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:56,920
Grandma.

649
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,520
I'm home!

650
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,480
You're home.

651
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,400
I went to buy buns with Miss.

652
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,640
Really?

653
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,000
Here, try it.

654
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,560
Sure.

655
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,600
Smells good.

656
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:10,560
Is it good?

657
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,480
Yes.

658
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,840
Having seen this,

659
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,320
do you still have the heart to kill?

660
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,320
Give me another bite.

661
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,720
Never mind what I think,

662
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,280
your behavior today

663
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,280
is out of the ordinary.

664
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,280
A person focused on protecting herself

665
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,360
is meddling in other people's affairs.

666
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,920
Perhaps it's a trivial matter
for others,

667
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,600
but it means

668
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,080
everything to her.

669
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,520
You ruined her innocence,

670
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,320
and now you blame her for being cunning.

671
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,200
If someone could help her,

672
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,800
she wouldn't have done
such a dangerous thing today.

673
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,980
It's only normal
that someone high and mighty like you

674
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,280
doesn't understand what lowly commoners

675
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,480
suffer.

676
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:19,880
Six people?

677
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:26,640
Granny.

678
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,980
Why are there two extra sets
of bowls and chopsticks today?

679
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,040
That's because

680
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,520
the people who came to look for you

681
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,000
have arrived at the village.

682
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,560
So I prepared two more sets
of bowls and chopsticks.

683
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,280
We'll eat together later.

684
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:24,520
Zaiye.

685
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,480
Qingying?

686
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,280
Your High...

687
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:28,880
Your Highness.

688
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,480
Mr. Wuxia.

689
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,640
Why are you here?

690
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,920
We followed the marks here.

691
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,480
We also met Granny on the way.

692
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,080
When you two

693
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,440
wear my brother's clothes,

694
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,440
people might mistake you for brothers.

695
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,640
When you say it like that...

696
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,880
They do look similar at first glance.

697
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:03,760
Of course.

698
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,960
My brother is better looking.

699
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,240
Don't just stand there.

700
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,160
Start cooking.

701
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,520
Thank you.

702
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,280
What happened along the way?

703
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,000
Why did you come here?

704
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,880
I'm fine. Thank you for your concern.

705
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,760
We're friends.

706
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,240
No need to be so polite.

707
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,560
You're so biased.

708
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,600
They're both in danger.

709
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:57,740
Why do you only care
about Lady Jiang and not Zaiye?

710
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,640
He has always
been shrewd and calculating.

711
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,840
He won't tolerate anyone
taking advantage of him.

712
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,360
I guess

713
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,760
he doesn't need
me to worry about him.

714
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,080
You're good.

715
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,560
You made Mr. Wuxia to pity you.

716
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,160
I'm impressed.

717
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,800
Mr. Wuxia is a man of integrity.

718
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,640
I'm honored

719
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,720
to have your concern.

720
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,440
All he's good at is sweet-talking.

721
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:42,280
If I hadn't protected him
on our way here,

722
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,280
he wouldn't
even have the chance to pity her.

723
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,360
You're a little reckless sometimes,

724
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,840
but you did help a lot.

725
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,400
Thank you.

726
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:57,760
Qingying.

727
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,560
Mr. Wuxia is sincerely thanking you,

728
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,200
but you're rude to him.

729
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,280
Why aren't you apologizing?

730
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,360
Are you serious?

731
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,200
Why are you helping an outsider?

732
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,880
I'm rude?

733
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,360
He doesn't seem to be polite to you.

734
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,920
Mr. Wuxia is of noble status.

735
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,680
How can we compare to him?

736
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,840
You're saying I'm being disrespectful.

737
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:31,800
Fine.

738
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,720
He cares about Lady Jiang.

739
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,040
Splashing water on Lady Jiang
isn't disrespectful, is it?

740
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,640
Qingying.

741
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,520
You can't bully me.

742
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,840
Qingying splashed water on me
because of you.

743
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,280
I'm going to splash you, of course.

744
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,840
It's called giving someone

745
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,160
a taste of their own medicine.

746
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,520
How dare you splash Zaiye?

747
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,480
Just wait.

748
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:52,800
How immature.

749
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,680
Is he mad?

750
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:08,600
Granny.

751
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:10,920
Granny.

752
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,240
Did they argue?

753
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,640
No.

754
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,160
They might

755
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,040
