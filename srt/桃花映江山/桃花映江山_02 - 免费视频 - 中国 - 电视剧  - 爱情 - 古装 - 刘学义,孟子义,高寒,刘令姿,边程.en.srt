Make way!

Make way!

(Yujing Inn)

22
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,270
Remain where you are.

23
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,310
Chancellor Shen, please stay.

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,990
Greetings, Your Highness.

25
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,350
Is Father sending Princess Chengping

26
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,150
back to Beiyuan?

27
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,210
That's indeed
what's on His Majesty's mind.

28
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:34,830
Do you

29
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,630
want to announce it personally?

30
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,350
Chancellor Shen

31
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:41,830
made a mistake,

32
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,430
but let a woman bear it alone.

33
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,230
Don't you feel guilty?

34
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,430
I only know that this concerns
the peace between the two countries

35
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,870
and the people.

36
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:55,150
This arrangement is good for everyone.

37
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,190
Good for everyone?

38
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,870
It's bad for the princess.

39
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:02,530
I'm not getting involved
in your hypocritical games.

40
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,070
I just want to get to the bottom of this

41
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,590
and give the princess the truth.

42
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:09,690
I'll enter the palace and ask Father
to take back his decision.

43
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,790
You have no official position.

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,700
How are you going
to investigate the truth?

45
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,310
Just by talking?

46
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,070
So what?

47
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,670
You can go to His Majesty
to plead your case,

48
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,630
but this matter has been decided.

49
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,590
I

50
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,670
must announce
this imperial decree today.

51
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,630
No.

52
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,710
Stop acting like a child.

53
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:36,990
Make way.

54
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,710
Oh no! Someone, help!

55
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,510
Princess Chengping hanged herself!

56
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:02,870
Someone, help!

57
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,110
Send the imperial physician!

58
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:04,990
- Your Highness.
- Yes.

59
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,270
Shen Zaiye.

60
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,510
Is this the result you want?

61
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:22,710
Don't panic.

62
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,530
Her Highness is not beyond saving.

63
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,430
Now,

64
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:26,670
her throat is hurt,

65
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,030
hindering her breathing.

66
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,910
By targeting the key acupoints

67
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,310
to relax her muscles,

68
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,110
we can save her.

69
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,590
I know a little about medicine

70
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:36,670
and am willing to try.

71
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,190
You tried to kill Her Highness before.

72
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,130
Who knows
if you have evil intentions again?

73
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:46,990
Forget it then.

74
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,990
It will take some time
for the imperial physician to arrive.

75
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,510
Good luck

76
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,350
with Her Highness' life.

77
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,150
Wait.

78
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,470
Let him try.

79
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,150
We're all here.

80
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,830
I don't think he'll do anything.

81
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,310
Bring me silver needles.

82
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,350
Why are you inserting it there?

83
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,870
Isn't Shenting a fatal acupoint?

84
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,550
That's the wonder of acupoints.

85
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,790
If the acupuncture is done properly,

86
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,190
even a fatal acupoint can save you.

87
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:10,510
What if there's a mistake?

88
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:11,230
Then,

89
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,150
she can only accept her fate.

90
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,110
It seems to be working.

91
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:41,790
Of course.

92
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,590
Once you pierce Shenting,

93
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:45,650
you'll feel like
being struck by lightning.

94
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,910
The pain in the skull
feels like countless needle pricks.

95
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,070
I think Her Highness

96
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,550
must be in a lot of pain right now.

97
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,190
The second needle

98
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,830
will be inserted into Renying.

99
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,270
I have to be careful here.

100
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:01,590
If I'm not careful,

101
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,430
it can cause paralysis.

102
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,390
If that happens,

103
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:06,870
Her Highness

104
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,270
will be paralyzed

105
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,270
from the neck down for life.

106
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:33,030
It seems that my medical skills
are amazing.

107
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:34,910
Her Highness woke up

108
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,830
before I could insert the second needle.

109
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:44,470
I'm ashamed to be alive

110
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,070
after what happened.

111
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:48,710
Don't overthink it.

112
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,590
Have a good rest first.

113
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,910
(What a master of pretense.)

114
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:16,070
Summon Princess Chengping
for an audience.

115
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,750
Greetings, Emperor Qi.

116
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,830
Princess Chengping.

117
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,310
You've suffered.

118
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,270
Put forward any request you have.

119
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,230
I will satisfy you.

120
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,830
I'm only a woman

121
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,750
who came all the way to Qi State.

122
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,550
Even if I suffer countless disasters,

123
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:37,430
I dare not fail the peace negotiation
entrusted to me.

124
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:39,550
At this point,

125
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,910
to ensure that our alliance remains,

126
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:43,990
I'm

127
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,590
willing to follow through with it
and marry Chancellor Shen.

128
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:57,830
Your Majesty.

129
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,310
This cannot be allowed.

130
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,890
Marriages between the two countries

131
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,740
have always been arranged
among members of the royal family.

132
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,990
Many palace maids were made "princesses"
and married off in the previous dynasty.

133
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,110
It shows

134
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,950
that marriage is merely a tool.

135
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,230
What matters most

136
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,110
is the peace treaty.

137
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,430
I only care about my country.

138
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,150
I don't care if I marry a prince

139
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,190
or a minister.

140
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:23,190
Father.

141
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:24,790
I also think

142
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,870
it's more appropriate
to let Chancellor Shen

143
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:27,990
marry Princess Chengping.

144
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,830
Four hours ago,

145
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,950
you were defending Her Highness

146
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:33,990
and standing up for her.

147
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,590
Why are you willing to give her up now?

148
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,750
Her Highness' reputation
is now tarnished.

149
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,510
Should she return to Beiyuan,

150
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,990
she would be mired in rumors
and a difficult situation.

151
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,310
It's all Chancellor Shen's fault

152
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,070
that Her Highness is in this situation.

153
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,670
It makes sense for Chancellor Shen
to take responsibility.

154
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:53,390
His Majesty.

155
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,770
It's not that I don't want
to take responsibility.

156
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,790
It's just that I already have a wife.

157
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,670
With Princess Chengping's status,

158
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,150
it will be unfair
for her to be a concubine.

159
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:03,990
Chancellor Shen is an exceptional man.

160
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:05,890
If I could marry Chancellor Shen,

161
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,990
I don't mind being a concubine.

162
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:09,950
As the saying goes,

163
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,470
you follow your husband,

164
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,670
no matter who he is.

165
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,150
For the peace of the two countries,

166
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:17,990
so what if I be a concubine?

167
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,030
I don't think it's unfair.

168
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,670
Let me consider.

169
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:35,710
Your Majesty.

170
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,310
I'm willing to guarantee

171
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,310
that Beiyuan will never pursue
everything that happened.

172
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,950
All previously agreed terms
shall remain unchanged.

173
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,390
May the two countries
remain bound in lasting peace.

174
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,190
I beg you to approve.

175
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,990
You're so selfless.

176
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:56,590
How can I let you down?

177
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:57,830
I approve

178
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,750
this matter.

179
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,790
Thank you, Your Majesty.

180
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,990
Princess Chengping.

181
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,070
Please stand up quickly.

182
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,110
Chancellor Shen.

183
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:14,800
Do you have anything else to say?

184
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:17,870
I

185
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:18,990
shall obey.

186
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,550
This

187
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,950
will be unfair to Wuxia.

188
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,030
What do you want?

189
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,150
Name it.

190
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,630
I've done nothing to deserve a reward.

191
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,230
I can't accept it.

192
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:30,910
But...

193
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,110
The princess's attack

194
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,310
concerns the royal family's reputation.

195
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:37,990
I ask to be entrusted with the task
to investigate this thoroughly.

196
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,390
Our alliance remains intact.

197
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,630
Let's put this matter to rest

198
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,230
to avoid unnecessary trouble.

199
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:47,510
Here.

200
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,390
I'll give you a token.

201
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,830
You're allowed to move out of the palace

202
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,990
and build your own residence.

203
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,110
My dear ministers.

204
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,990
This matter

205
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,150
is settled.

206
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:01,070
- All hail Your Majesty's wisdom.
- All hail Your Majesty's wisdom.

207
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,390
You're of noble birth

208
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,670
and heavenly beauty.

209
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,110
If you return to Beiyuan,

210
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,110
all the nobles
will be fighting over you.

211
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,150
Why wrong yourself
by marrying someone like me?

212
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:33,510
Don't say it's for the people.

213
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,990
Even if you marry someone else,

214
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,070
the result is the same.

215
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,510
Chancellor, have you ever heard

216
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,580
that rare treasures are easy to find,

217
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,710
but a true lover is not?

218
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,030
You carry yourself with such poise.

219
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,070
I fell for you at first sight.

220
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,270
Had I not seen you

221
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,710
put a hairpin against my neck

222
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,070
last night,

223
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,390
trying to kill me,

224
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,630
I might've believed you

225
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,830
when you said
you fell for me at first sight.

226
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,830
Last night's events were sudden.

227
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,830
I was in shock.

228
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:10,030
Thankfully, His Majesty took charge

229
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,390
and betrothed me to you.

230
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,550
I'm overjoyed.

231
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:15,590
To be honest,

232
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,630
besides my wife,

233
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:19,470
I also have two concubines.

234
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:20,510
I also

235
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,710
have many other companions outside.

236
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:24,870
Someone as wonderful as you

237
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,590
deserves to find someone

238
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,150
who will love you alone forever.

239
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,310
You may not know this.

240
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:33,350
I grew up in the palace.

241
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:36,110
I'm used to seeing
women around my father.

242
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,830
No matter how many concubines you have,

243
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,910
I doubt it rivals to the imperial harem.

244
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,150
Since you insist,

245
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,630
I'll welcome you with open arms.

246
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,590
But you have to think it through.

247
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,030
Once you enter my residence,

248
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,330
it will be difficult for you to leave.

249
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,750
I'm delighted.

250
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,870
Thank you.

251
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:31,670
Chancellor.

252
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,750
I thought the princess was framed,

253
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,350
but now it seems otherwise.

254
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,670
From the fake hanging,

255
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,470
Jiang Taohua forged a way

256
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,350
out of this hopeless situation.

257
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:47,030
She isn't as weak and helpless
as she seems.

258
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,830
There must be
something fishy going on behind her.

259
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,180
(Inn)

260
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,590
What are you doing?

261
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,790
Teach Her Highness a lesson, of course.

262
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,470
She acted on her own,
going against Her Highness's will.

263
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,670
You weren't in the palace today.

264
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,510
You probably don't know
how dire it was.

265
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,790
Chancellor Shen kept pressing on.

266
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,070
He's shameless.

267
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,950
If you fail to marry Prince Wuxia,

268
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,250
Beiyuan has many noble ladies
who can marry His Highness.

269
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,470
But by marrying Shen Zaiye,

270
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,390
won't you make
this marriage alliance go waste?

271
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,830
That's where you're mistaken.

272
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,390
On the contrary,

273
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:37,990
marrying Shen Zaiye

274
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:39,270
is a godsend opportunity.

275
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,510
Her Highness said it before.

276
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:44,430
The purpose of this marriage alliance
was to enter and exit the palace,

277
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,230
mingle with ministers and noble ladies,

278
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:47,430
and gather information.

279
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,890
Should it be Prince Wuxia,
who lives in the palace,

280
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,790
or Shen Zaiye,
the emperor's close minister?

281
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,630
I think you know the answer to that.

282
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,270
You may report to Her Highness

283
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,400
that it's easy
to get another noble lady,

284
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,910
but it won't be easy to find someone

285
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:03,590
to get close to Shen Zaiye.

286
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:10,150
I will let you go for now.

287
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,510
Let's see what happens.

288
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,030
But

289
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,230
don't get ahead of yourself.

290
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:19,990
Your Highness!

291
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:20,990
Your Highness.

292
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:21,870
Your Highness.

293
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,390
What a coincidence.

294
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:24,390
Speak of the devil.

295
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:24,930
Your Highness.

296
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,750
This Jiangtao pill

297
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:27,990
acts up once a month.

298
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:30,710
Counting the time, it's time.

299
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,510
I volunteer

300
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:38,710
to marry.

301
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:41,270
Qi and Beiyuan
are thousands of lis apart.

302
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:43,630
It's beyond my reach after all.

303
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,910
If you take this pill,

304
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,190
I'll believe

305
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,550
you have no intention of treason.

306
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,030
(This is Jiangtao pill.)

307
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,150
(Anyone poisoned by this)

308
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,990
(Qian Mochen, State Preceptor of Beiyuan)
(needs to take the antidote regularly.)

309
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,350
(If not, their organs
will feel like devoured by insects,)

310
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,390
(causing great pain.)

311
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:13,790
Don't worry.

312
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:15,270
As long as you obey me.

313
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:16,670
Someone

314
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,470
will feed you the antidote regularly.

315
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:25,030
The closer
the poison is to taking effect,

316
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:27,510
The peach blossom mark on your arm

317
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,470
will become darker.

318
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,670
When your mark turns dark red,

319
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:34,470
you'll be reunited with the late queen.

320
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:36,190
How dare you
treat Her Highness like this?

321
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:37,030
Where's the antidote?

322
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:39,870
Do you want it?

323
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,670
Please give me the antidote.

324
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,510
Then just wait in your room.

325
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:47,990
Your Highness.

326
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:50,550
Take this as a chance to reflect.

327
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,950
Don't act on your own will again.

328
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,390
Your Highness.

329
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,390
Your Highness.

330
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:07,990
Chancellor.

331
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:10,870
Chancellor.

332
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,350
You guessed right.

333
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:13,590
Peng Si is dead.

334
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,690
Once our people
found an excuse to leave,

335
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,070
they couldn't help but take action.

336
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:18,860
Following your instructions,

337
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:20,190
we didn't alert the enemy.

338
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,340
It was treated as an accident.

339
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,090
What kind of death?

340
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:23,070
Hanging.

341
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,190
These people
are becoming less and less decent.

342
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,830
Jiang Taohua pretended to hang herself.

343
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:33,390
At least the roof beams are high.

344
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,510
The ones at Imperial Prison are low.

345
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,150
Wouldn't it be weird to hang there?

346
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,750
(Name List)

347
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,830
Many people joined forces

348
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:46,350
but didn't coordinate with one another.

349
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,730
They probably lost their composure.

350
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,270
A fake suspect

351
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,150
lured out so many culprits.

352
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,150
Peng Si's death

353
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:56,750
was worth it.

354
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:00,470
Use these people as leads
and continue investigating.

355
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,350
Also,

356
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,950
we must find Xue Ran's
Sunlight over a Thousand Peaks.

357
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,250
It mustn't fall
into the hands of His Highness.

358
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:08,270
Yes.

359
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:14,830
Your Highness, spare me.

360
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,630
Since you heard it,

361
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,270
why didn't you kill Xue Ran?

362
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:23,230
But I still needed to lead Chancellor Shen
to the guest room.

363
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,130
I really can't be in two places at once.

364
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,990
So what you're saying is

365
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,830
it's not that you're incompetent,

366
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,310
it's me

367
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,830
who made the wrong call?

368
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:37,430
It's me who's incompetent.

369
00:19:37,430 --> 00:19:38,350
I'm incompetent.

370
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,870
Since you're incompetent,

371
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,070
why aren't you dead?

372
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:49,830
Your Highness.

373
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:54,990
Calm down.

374
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,270
Huaijin.

375
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,270
(Meng Huaijin, Right Chancellor's Legitimate Son)

376
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,470
(Meng Huaijin, Right Chancellor's Legitimate Son)
Our top priority is to find Xue Ran.

377
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,150
We mustn't let Chancellor Shen

378
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,550
get that painting.

379
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,190
You're right.

380
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:13,470
We shouldn't create unnecessary trouble.

381
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:15,950
Someone!

382
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,510
Even if we search
every inch of this land,

383
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:20,030
find Xue Ran!

384
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:20,870
Yes.

385
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:27,310
Your Highness.

386
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:30,390
Your Highness.

387
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:40,790
Your Highness.

388
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:51,830
Has the courier...

389
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:54,390
Has the courier
with the antidote arrived?

390
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,230
No.

391
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,390
Only the owner of a clothing store came.

392
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:00,670
She said

393
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:03,830
Qi State is worried
that you've lost weight

394
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,630
during the long journey and sent her
to adjust the wedding dress.

395
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:08,830
Eunuch Ren asked you

396
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:11,890
to make sure she doesn't notice
anything unusual about you.

397
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,070
Otherwise, Prince Changjue would...

398
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:15,670
I see.

399
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,750
Your tattoo is unique.

400
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:33,950
It's a birthmark.

401
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,070
Hence the name Taohua.

402
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,110
Sure enough.

403
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:43,310
On a beauty like you,
even a birthmark is beautiful.

404
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,070
Can you hurry up?

405
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,350
Her Highness isn't feeling well
and needs rest.

406
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:54,390
Is it failure to acclimate,
or have you caught a cold?

407
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:59,070
I think you don't look too well.

408
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,750
Are you poisoned?

409
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:05,550
You're joking.

410
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,070
There are people overseeing

411
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,110
my meals throughout the journey.

412
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:14,830
There are many ways to poison someone,

413
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,390
not just through food.

414
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:23,030
But I know a Qi State miracle physician
who can cure all kinds of poisons.

415
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,350
Not everyone can hire them.

416
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,630
But you're

417
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:28,670
of royal birth.

418
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:29,870
You're different.

419
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:30,990
Are you talking...

420
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:31,630
No need.

421
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,950
Now that you finished measuring, leave.

422
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,070
I'm tired.

423
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,790
I still have
your neck circumference to measure.

424
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,390
I just

425
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,110
hung myself.

426
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,310
If you use any more force,

427
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,990
Her Highness
will have no one to do her bidding.

428
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:01,630
What did you say?

429
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,470
A real businesspeople

430
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,510
will pretend they saw nothing

431
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:11,470
for fear of getting

432
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:12,390
into trouble

433
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:14,710
if they saw scars or marks

434
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,550
on me.

435
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,870
They won't inquire about it.

436
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:22,310
If you keep testing me,

437
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,590
even the antidote will be useless.

438
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,310
You're indeed clever.

439
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:45,990
What's your name?

440
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,750
(Yang Wanqing, Shopkeeper of Lan Boutique)
Lan Boutique's shopkeeper,

441
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,110
(Yang Wanqing, Shopkeeper of Lan Boutique)
Yang Wanqing.

442
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,310
Every other month from now on,

443
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,390
I will deliver fabric to Shen Residence.

444
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:57,710
At that time, the antidote
and Her Highness's verbal decree

445
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:58,750
will be delivered together,

446
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:01,510
What are Her Highness's orders this time?

447
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:04,950
Her Highness said

448
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:08,030
our precious princess' wedding

449
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:08,990
cannot be neglected,

450
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:11,630
so I was asked to prepare

451
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,670
the best wedding dress.

452
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,230
Sunlight over a Thousand Peaks?

453
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:23,670
A painting.

454
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:26,750
You're indeed clever.

455
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,190
I only know the name.

456
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:31,630
How can I find it?

457
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,150
You're lucky.

458
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,310
Her Highness heard

459
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:38,910
that Chancellor Shen
is also looking for this painting.

460
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:41,990
You happen to marry him.

461
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,990
You can definitely
help Her Highness with this.

462
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,980
(Shen Residence)

463
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,350
She's also a concubine,

464
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:58,590
but she's born a princess.

465
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,470
Once she marries,

466
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:03,510
the Duan family and the Qin family

467
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,710
are no match for her.

468
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:07,530
So what if she's a princess?

469
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:10,990
(Qin Jieyu, Shen Zaiye's Concubine)
My family said the princess

470
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:13,230
(Qin Jieyu, Shen Zaiye's Concubine)
asked for this marriage herself.

471
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:14,630
We have nothing to fear.

472
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,580
(Duan Yunxin, Shen Zaiye's Concubine)

473
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,190
(Duan Yunxin, Shen Zaiye's Concubine)
Besides, didn't Chancellor say

474
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,750
to keep it simple?

475
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:19,630
Zhenzhen.

476
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,310
Follow Chancellor's orders.

477
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:22,290
Don't decorate with red.

478
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,230
(Meng Zhenzhen, Shen Zaiye's Wife)

479
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,830
(Meng Zhenzhen, Shen Zaiye's Wife)
Let the princess understand

480
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:27,230
(Meng Zhenzhen, Shen Zaiye's Wife)
that she has to behave like a concubine

481
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,950
since she's here to be one.

482
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:31,470
That's right.

483
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:33,150
You excel

484
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:35,630
at being a concubine.

485
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,310
Madam.

486
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,830
Chancellor
isn't happy with this marriage.

487
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,630
Why are we going against him

488
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,910
and show that princess respect?

489
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,910
How do you know
that Chancellor is unhappy?

490
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,110
(Yuetao, Meng Zhenzhen's Personal Maid)
Chancellor said to keep everything simple

491
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,110
(Yuetao, Meng Zhenzhen's Personal Maid)
and never asked about it.

492
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,550
Isn't he unhappy

493
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,870
if he don't care about it?

494
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:07,990
Yuetao.

495
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,350
You don't understand.

496
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,050
If I decorate with red,

497
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:13,110
the two concubines
will probably be upset.

498
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,800
Chancellor can also reprimand me
for not following etiquette.

499
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:16,880
If I decorate with pink

500
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:18,470
and Her Highness makes a fuss,

501
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:19,910
she can say

502
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:21,710
that the Meng family is targeting her.

503
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:25,950
Husband and wife should be a team.

504
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:28,390
Why did Chancellor
make things so difficult for you?

505
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,110
In an ordinary family, it's right

506
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,700
that husband and wife
should be a team.

507
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:35,450
But I am
Right Chancellor Meng's daughter.

508
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,430
He's Left Chancellor.

509
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,390
We're not destined

510
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,550
to be an ordinary couple.

511
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:47,870
Chancellor.

512
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,510
Her Highness is almost at the gate.

513
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:51,750
How are the arrangements going?

514
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:53,220
Madam decorated with red for her

515
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:54,790
and even opened the main gate
to welcome her.

516
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:57,670
Madam has always

517
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:59,270
been proper.

518
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,790
Lady Qin is making a scene
at the front courtyard.

519
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:04,870
Let her be.

520
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:09,350
Stop!

521
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:11,590
Concubines don't deserve red decorations

522
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,990
and can't go through the main gate.

523
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,870
This is Qi's custom.

524
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:19,070
Madam is friendly.

525
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:21,390
But I can't break this rule.

526
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,350
Tear them all down!

527
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:24,430
- Yes.
- Yes.

528
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:30,870
Sun Bao.

529
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:32,990
Lady.

530
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,630
You were sent here by the Qin family.

531
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:38,350
Lady.

532
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:40,390
We're the only ones
who need to know this.

533
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,750
No need to bring it up often.

534
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:42,700
What are you afraid of?

535
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:45,170
The Meng family and the Duan family
sent people too.

536
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:47,950
In short,

537
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:50,030
perform well today.

538
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:53,190
Make sure Jiang Taohua
takes a good look.

539
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:54,790
She has no say

540
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,870
in this residence.

541
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:57,670
Alright.

542
00:27:58,170 --> 00:27:58,790
Close the gates.

543
00:27:59,190 --> 00:27:59,750
Follow me.

544
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,630
Qingtai, what happened?

545
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,540
(Shen Residence)

546
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:43,470
You...

547
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,030
Look, everyone!

548
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:47,590
The princess' maid hit us!

549
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,700
What nonsense are you talking about?

550
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:50,710
You scared us with firecrackers first.

551
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,270
I just had an upset stomach this morning

552
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,270
and was weak.

553
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:54,830
Ridiculous!

554
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:08,630
A concubine
who asked for the marriage herself

555
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:10,910
wants to teach the servants a lesson
before marrying.

556
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:13,510
Does she really think she's the wife?

557
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,550
Who are you?

558
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,630
Unreasonable.

559
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:18,990
Confusing right and wrong!

560
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:20,070
Catch her!

561
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:23,710
Let go!

562
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:26,470
I am Chancellor's

563
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:27,990
first concubine.

564
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,350
By seniority,

565
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:31,550
your princess

566
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:33,350
should be calling me Qin.

567
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,470
How dare a few Beiyuan people

568
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,310
and defeated generals

569
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,830
insult our citizens?

570
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,350
You misunderstood.

571
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,830
I have no such intentions.

572
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:48,430
Qingtai was eager
to protect her mistress

573
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,550
that she overstepped.

574
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:51,690
I will fine her
her monthly salary later

575
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,780
and double the compensation
to the person on the ground.

576
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,410
Is that alright?

577
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:56,030
Eager to protect her mistress?

578
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:58,670
She's clearly following
her mistress' example!

579
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,950
Lady Qin is blocking the gate.

580
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:02,090
Understood.

581
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:09,430
Lady Qin is speaking more coherently
than usual today.

582
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,390
Jiang Taohua's arrival

583
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:13,510
threatens none more than her
as she fancies herself

584
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,290
the top concubine.

585
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:16,710
She's naturally determined
to get the upper hand.

586
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:20,030
The Beiyuan princess
will probably suffer then.

587
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:26,590
She brought it upon herself.

588
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:27,790
She must bear it.

589
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,850
The family gate
represents the country gate.

590
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:38,830
I, Qin Jieyu, am here, today.

591
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:42,430
If you're really
wearing a red wedding dress,

592
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:45,550
forget about stepping through this gate.

593
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:47,470
This is outrageous!

594
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:48,390
Qingtai, shut up.

595
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,090
I want to alight.

596
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:21,830
(How could it be?)

597
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,190
Your Highness.

598
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:30,350
Hasn't Madam Meng
decorated the residence with red?

599
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,310
She decorated with red

600
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,150
to protect her reputation.

601
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,230
I'm wearing pink

602
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:37,230
to avoid being criticized.

603
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:41,030
But you're a legitimate daughter
after all.

604
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:44,590
Compared to not following the etiquette
and giving Shen Zaiye

605
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,970
an excuse to cancel the engagement,

606
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,790
is face more important?

607
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,310
Besides,

608
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:53,110
I'm not marrying someone I love.

609
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:55,790
It doesn't matter
whether I wear red or pink.

610
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:03,230
Lady Jiang.

611
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:04,590
This way, please.

612
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:10,750
You...

613
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,990
Mind the servant's mistress
before striking it.

614
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:16,430
I'm also a mistress of this place
after I marry.

615
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:19,070
He spoke rudely
and showed insubordination.

616
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:20,670
Besides,

617
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:22,710
if a dog bullies me,

618
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,510
I will strike back tenfold.

619
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:28,970
Let's go back inside!

620
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:40,070
A royal princess

621
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,710
is humiliated

622
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:43,950
by her husband's family
on the wedding day.

623
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:48,150
But she endured the humiliation.

624
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:55,190
It's getting more interesting.

625
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,350
(Shen Residence)
(I've not strayed too far.)

626
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:02,330
(What's right yesterday
may be wrong today.)

627
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:04,270
(Changjue.)

628
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,470

629
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:09,070

640
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:14,230
I have no other talents.

641
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:15,630
Only my embroidery

642
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:16,830
is presentable.

643
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,670
I took several days
to embroider this handkerchief.

644
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:21,350
I hope you'll like it.

645
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,390
Thank you.

646
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:27,830
Later,

647
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:29,990
I'll ask Qingtai
to send you a box of pearl powder.

648
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:31,390
Applying it on your eyes

649
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,830
can enhance beauty
and also calm your nerves.

650
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:43,590
Qin.

651
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:56,990
You're indeed from a barbarian land.

652
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,390
You're thick-skinned and strong.

653
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,350
Go back and study hard.

654
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,990
(Lessons for Women, Volume 1)
Since you gave me Lessons for Women,

655
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:11,870
you must be

656
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:13,190
the perfect example of a lady.

657
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:14,710
From now on,

658
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:17,070
I'll keep an eye on your every move

659
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:18,750
and learn humbly.

660
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:27,030
Lady Jiang.

661
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:28,990
Chancellor's Residence has a rule

662
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:30,590
that new concubines

663
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:32,250
need to serve a cup of tea
while kneeling.

664
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:38,230
Please.

665
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:46,710
Jiang.

666
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,950
I don't like these tedious formalities,

667
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,350
but the two concubines did it before.

668
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:53,150
I can't be partial.

669
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:05,310
Chancellor.

670
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,270
I don't know if Lady Jiang

671
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:08,870
can pass the three ladies' test.

672
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:11,270
My harem

673
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:12,670
is full of intrigue.

674
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,190
With so many forces there,

675
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:17,030
let's see

676
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:19,150
how she deals with them.

677
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,670
You're already trembling?

678
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,350
