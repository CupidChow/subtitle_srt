The Long Ballad

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 35

3
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The Long Ballad

4
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Miss Jiang is indeed a good woman.

5
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
She can even gamble in the capital

6
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and enter the world of no one.

7
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I really admire your beauty.

8
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm just lucky

9
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
to have some tricks to trade for money.

10
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You're too modest.

11
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I entered the world at the age of 20.

12
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I've been in the world for ten years.

13
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I've never met anyone like you.

14
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But I've never seen anyone like you.

15
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Your majesty is good at sitting on the ground.

16
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You're talented.

17
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You even know how to eat fire.

18
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You can't fight, you can't kill,

19
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
you can't hold on to people.

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Now that I know I'm good at it,

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
why don't you join me?

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What can you do?

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I've already figured out the map,

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
the time and route of the maid.

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Tonight, I can count the resources

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
and hand them to you.

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
That's one thing.

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Second, you'll gamble tonight.

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's obvious that you're not interested in gambling.

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The key is to check the money

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
that you've spent with me.

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
With your ability,

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
you must have checked the bank,

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
but you didn't act.

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I think you can't do it alone.

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Someone needs to help you.

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's very risky.

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Think about it.

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm not afraid of danger.

40
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
As long as I can save Qingtai.

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
She's just a maid.

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Is she worth it?

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
To me,

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Qingtai has never been a maid.

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
She's a family member.

46
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Can you play the flute?

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I know the rules,

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
but I don't play it often.

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Come to the study tomorrow.

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'll teach you.

51
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
There are five pieces of the chess piece.

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The gambler will play the chess

53
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
according to the number of pieces.

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The higher the number, the better.

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I can tell you clearly

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
that the owner of the gold and silver workshop

57
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
is the current Crown Prince.

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
If a maid can

59
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
make a scene on his territory,

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
she will definitely lead him to confront you.

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Then everyone's eyes

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
will be on you two.

63
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I can go to the bank

64
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
to investigate.

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's your turn.

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You'll lose this game.

67
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Okay.

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Five pieces of each.

69
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The first three pieces,

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm three black,

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
the chess piece is three white,

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
and the rest two pieces.

73
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
If I get the same color of the bull,

74
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
it's all black.

75
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
If I get two white,

76
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
it's also the same color.

77
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
They're all the same color.

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
One is sixteen points,

79
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
one is fourteen points.

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
One is a lot.

81
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
This is the worst case.

82
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
But four black and one white

83
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
are also eleven points.

84
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You want to win me,

85
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
unless you get the red.

86
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Although the red is high,

87
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
the probability is very low.

88
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So no matter how this game is combined,

89
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
it's all my idea.

90
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
That's right.

91
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Others play chess,

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
they all think it's luck.

93
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But they don't know that before the game,

94
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
they can analyze the results of the previous round,

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
and then analyze the next time

96
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
the probability of the color.

97
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
If you don't forget,

98
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
you can practice a little bit,

99
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
you can be more generous in the gambling room.

100
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
This time,

101
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I choose five.

102
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Add it.

103
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,960
It's a

104
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,960
You're cheating.

105
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,960
Where's the evidence?

106
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,960
I saw it clearly just now.

107
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,960
Yours is not a roucai at all.

108
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,960
What you see is not important.

109
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,960
What is opened

110
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,920
is the key.

111
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,920
With your ability,

112
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,920
it's enough to deal with ordinary gamblers.

113
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,920
But to deal with the people we want to deal with,

114
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,920
it's not enough.

115
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,920
Why is it a roucai again?

116
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,920
You want to attract the attention of the crown prince,

117
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,920
you have to be like me,

118
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,920
do as you please.

119
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,920
The truth is different.

120
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,920
I want you to learn to play chess in three days.

121
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,920
Combine with your ability to count,

122
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,920
you can hold the crown prince

123
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,920
and fight for me.

124
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,920
Continue.

125
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,920
Don't use force.

126
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,920
Your palm should relax,

127
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,920
leave space for the wooden frame.

128
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,920
But the root of the palm,

129
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,920
the root of the finger,

130
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,920
must be strong.

131
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,920
Don't shake it.

132
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,920
Feel how my hands move.

133
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,920
I found the feeling.

134
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,920
It's still a secret.

135
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,920
I'm not a man.

136
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,920
I'm a man.

137
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,920
I'm a man.

138
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,920
I'm a man.

139
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,920
I'm a man.

140
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,920
I'm a man.

141
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,920
I'm a man.

142
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,920
I'm a man.

143
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,920
I'm a man.

144
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,880
Now your level

145
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,880
is enough to deal with ordinary gamblers.

146
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,880
But only the luck

147
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,880
shows some flaws.

148
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,880
What flaws?

149
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,880
Think about the gambler's room that day.

150
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,880
What did you see

151
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,880
in the gambler's room?

152
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,880
They all wear masks

153
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,880
and can't see clearly.

154
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,880
Although they wear masks,

155
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,880
their eyes won't lie.

156
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,880
Think about it again.

157
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,880
The gambler's room.

158
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,880
The gambler's room.

159
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:47,880
The gambler's room.

160
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,880
The gambler's room.

161
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,880
The gambler's room.

162
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,880
The gambler's room.

163
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,880
The gambler's room.

164
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,880
I know.

165
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,880
It's the eyes.

166
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,880
The real gambler

167
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,880
won't think like me

168
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,880
with one eye open.

169
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,880
They are all greedy.

170
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,880
Yes.

171
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,840
Ordinary gamblers

172
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,840
won't notice

173
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,840
the opponent's mistake.

174
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,840
But we are going to deal with the crown prince.

175
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,840
He is suspicious, cunning and a man of the world.

176
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,840
Your small flaw

177
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,840
is enough to get us to make a move.

178
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,840
If I'm old

179
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,840
but my eyes are like a newbie,

180
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,840
the crown prince will be suspicious.

181
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,840
The crown prince likes gambling and color.

182
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,840
The trick that you used

183
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,840
to me before

184
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,840
can be useful.

185
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,840
You mean

186
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,840
I'm trying to seduce you?

187
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,840
I'm not interested

188
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,840
in an ill-mannered woman.

189
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,840
You are a little bit of a thief.

190
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,840
I know the people who are afraid of the rich.

191
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,840
That's all for today.

192
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,840
I'm going back.

193
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,840
Have you thought it through?

194
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,840
You will get me involved in the fight with the crown prince.

195
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,840
If you regret it,

196
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,840
you can leave now.

197
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,840
I won't.

198
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,840
Let's go.

199
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,840
Why are you going to the water today?

200
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,840
This time, you and I

201
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,840
are going to the water.

202
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,840
You are the one

203
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,780
living overseas.

204
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,780
Where is the water?

205
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,780
It's back in my Flint.

206
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,780
I came back

207
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:59,140
from the

208
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,140
ancient summer mountain.

209
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,140
You must've known

210
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,980
all the places

211
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,700
which are full of fishIES!

212
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,700
I'll take a look at it secretly after I enter the gambling house.

213
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,380
I have news.

214
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,300
The crown prince has been going to the gambling house these days.

215
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,980
Your task is to keep making money

216
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,340
until the crown prince is forced to gamble with you.

217
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,500
Huacai, five steps.

218
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,180
What?

219
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,420
Huacai, five steps.

220
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,900
Eat and get off the horse.

221
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,580
Huacai, five steps.

222
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,780
Eat and get off the horse.

223
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,500
Eat and get off the horse.

224
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,020
Kowtow and horse are all taken.

225
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,860
You have to be the first to win.

226
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,420
Are you still playing?

227
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,020
I admit defeat.

228
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,300
Let me do it.

229
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,780
Huacai, five steps.

230
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:09,620
Are you still playing?

231
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,500
Let me do it.

232
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:11,500
Let me do it.

233
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,100
Let me do it.

234
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:12,700
Let me do it.

235
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:13,940
Let me do it.

236
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:15,700
Let me do it.

237
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:16,700
Let me do it.

238
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,740
This lady won.

239
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,140
I admit defeat.

240
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,820
Master, something big happened.

241
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,900
Tonight, a young lady came.

242
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,900
She won eight times in a row.

243
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,180
Eight times?

244
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,100
I know.

245
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,820
The master is best at this.

246
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,580
Prepare.

247
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,940
How about you kill that young lady's concubine?

248
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,580
Take a look.

249
00:13:59,140 --> 00:13:59,620
Here.

250
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,300
Anyone else wants to bet with me?

251
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,060
The young lady won nine times in a row.

252
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:07,820
She's the first to win.

253
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,780
Who dares to come up and touch your eyebrows?

254
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,580
Then I'll have to change the money and go home.

255
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,420
Let's go.

256
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:15,700
Wait.

257
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,100
So many horse.

258
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,420
This is a master.

259
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,580
It's said that wine is the best skill.

260
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,940
It's better than winning.

261
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,540
I'll try it.

262
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,220
Really?

263
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:39,740
What?

264
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,180
Are you afraid of losing?

265
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,340
Please.

266
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,140
Master.

267
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,580
Let's start.

268
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,100
Yes.

269
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,580
I say, third brother.

270
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,580
You're good at everything.

271
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,660
But you're not good at it.

272
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,540
My mother is just a maid.

273
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,460
I can't see it.

274
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,980
But I'm different.

275
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,260
You help me.

276
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,380
We two brothers work together.

277
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,580
And with my money,

278
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,980
the remaining officials in the court,

279
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,940
are you afraid of losing?

280
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,220
Second brother.

281
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,220
I'll tell you the truth.

282
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,740
I'm not interested in

283
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,700
your relationship with my brother.

284
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,300
I'm not interested in your relationship with my brother.

285
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,180
Don't go.

286
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,300
I haven't finished talking yet.

287
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:40,780
If you...

288
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,380
Your Highness.

289
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,500
The Guard of War by Prime Minister's side wants to see you.

290
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,060
I have something to do.

291
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:46,980
I'll go first.

292
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,260
Sit down.

293
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:49,700
Sit down.

294
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,540
He is Prime Minister's man.

295
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,820
He came to me with initiative.

296
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:00,940
Let him have a look.

297
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,020
Second brother.

298
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,060
Didn't you say you wanted to win the court?

299
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,660
Prime Minister

300
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,300
is the leader of the court.

301
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:10,780
Right?

302
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,660
Yes.

303
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,660
You're right.

304
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:17,900
Invite him in.

305
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:18,820
Yes.

306
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,380
Third brother.

307
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,940
I said,

308
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,020
as long as we two brothers work together,

309
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,100
we'll be a family.

310
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,180
Don't go.

311
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:31,620
Come on.

312
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,580
Your Highness.

313
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,420
Your Highness.

314
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,100
Prime Minister asked me to say something to you.

315
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,420
It's about the Crown Prince.

316
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:46,180
Tell me.

317
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:46,620
Don't say it.

318
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,620
I didn't say it.

319
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,220
Prime Minister prepared a big gift for you.

320
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,420
In the gold and silver gambling house,

321
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,020
you can take it to him.

322
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,100
Gold and silver gambling house?

323
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,380
Third brother.

324
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,420
Come with me.

325
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,100
It's so lively.

326
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,820
It must be about the Crown Prince.

327
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,740
When I get his handle,

328
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,500
you can go with me.

329
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,340
If you don't go,

330
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,620
you'll hear what he said.

331
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,900
Be careful that someone will blame you for covering up.

332
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,340
Go.

333
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,900
You should have known it.

334
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,820
Another circuit

335
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,940
The去了 is at 14.

336
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,780
Brother Lv, you're great.

337
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,460
He is awesome!

338
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,140
Lu Cai, 16 points

339
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,020
Interesting

340
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,500
Cai Yalan

341
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,380
It's the first step to lock the dead body

342
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,140
The most important thing is

343
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,660
you need to get the jade pendant on her

344
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,140
Cai Cai, 11 points

345
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,780
It's a pity

346
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,440
Han Yuncai, 3 points

347
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,920
Toad

348
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,940
Dwash him

349
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,320
Nod his head

350
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,940
triumph

351
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,140
疑娘子果然好手气

352
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,820
Why I ask this

353
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,060
Hanshi

354
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,540
The rules of the gambling house

355
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,100
cannot be disobeyed

356
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,300
We go on

357
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,140
I'm a little tired of winning tonight.

358
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,140
If you want to bet with me,

359
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,740
why don't you bet on the heavens?

360
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,740
What do you want?

361
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,140
You are a real woman.

362
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,140
My jade pendant is of great value.

363
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,540
But if you want my jade pendant,

364
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,740
I want to trade it for yours.

365
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,140
Okay.

366
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,940
I'm not good at other things.

367
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,140
Then let's play a simple bet.

368
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,140
That's good.

369
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,540
I'm tired of seeing this.

370
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:38,940
Let's trade.

371
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,140
Let's trade.

372
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,340
Let's trade.

373
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,540
Let's trade.

374
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,740
Let's trade.

375
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:46,940
Oh no.

376
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,540
Shen Zan hasn't taught me this.

377
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,540
I promise.

378
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:54,540
Now you can see my fate.

379
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,540
Please.

380
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,540
Small.

381
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,540
Small.

382
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,340
One, one, three, small.

383
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,540
Nice hand.

384
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,940
I'll open this one.

385
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:56,940
This girl is as rich as the moon.

386
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,140
She is just like me.

387
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,140
Good opportunity.

388
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,140
Small.

389
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,140
Big.

390
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,140
Big.

391
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,140
Small.

392
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,140
Big.

393
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,140
Small.

394
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,140
Big.

395
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,140
Small.

396
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,140
Big.

397
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,140
Small.

398
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,140
Small.

399
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,140
Young Master, you look like a man.

400
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,740
Can you help me light the incense?

401
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,140
Give it to her.

402
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,740
The incense is here.

403
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,940
Don't sell the coffin.

404
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,940
Open it.

405
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,540
Do you want a big one or a small one?

406
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,740
I want a big one.

407
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,940
Two, one, two, small.

408
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,740
Wrong.

409
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,940
Two, one, two, small.

410
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:54,940
Big.

411
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:55,740
Small.

412
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,140
Small.

413
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,340
Small.

414
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:58,940
Big.

415
00:22:59,140 --> 00:22:59,940
Small.

416
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:00,940
Small.

417
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:01,940
Small.

418
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,940
Bell.

419
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,140
The Shu family doesn't talk

420
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,140
The Ying family doesn't make a move

421
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:29,140
Continue

422
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,140
Investigate the Ying family

423
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,140
I only need one week

424
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:44,140
Before that, you must hold on

425
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,140
Shen Zaiye

426
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,140
From now on

427
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,140
I will try my best to delay the time

428
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,140
But I can't hold on for too long

429
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,140
So

430
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,140
You must be quick to stop

431
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,140
I guess

432
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,140
Two, three, six, big

433
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,140
Again

434
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,140
After three, four, five, six, big

435
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,140
Area verliered

436
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,140
It looks that you, a house on…?

437
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,140
It seems that any person can even win Devious Mudunchan

438
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,140
Brother-in-law mouse

439
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,140
It is time to you

440
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,140
I'm afraid you're out of luck

441
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,140
Yes

442
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,140
Think it over

443
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,140
I'll press the button

444
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,140
Then you should open it

445
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,140
Open it

446
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,140
Open it

447
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,140
Open it

448
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,140
Open it

449
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,140
Open it

450
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,140
Open it

451
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,140
Open it

452
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,140
Open it

453
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,140
Open it

454
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,140
Open it

455
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,140
Open it

456
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,140
Open it

457
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,140
Open it

458
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,140
Open it

459
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,140
Open it

460
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,140
Open it

461
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,140
Open it

462
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:31,140
If I lose again, I'll lose to Guangwei

463
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,140
One, two, three, go

464
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,140
Still bet?

465
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,140
I think the winner is decided

466
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,140
It's better for you to admit defeat

467
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,140
Boss, bad news

468
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,140
I'm not Shen Zaiye's horse

469
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,140
I have something important to do

470
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,140
If you don't want to bet

471
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,140
Wait, the last one

472
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,140
You don't have enough chips

473
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,140
What do you use to bet with me?

474
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,140
Bet on myself

475
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,140
Good

476
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,140
My lady's salary is really high

477
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,140
How much is it worth?

478
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,140
You can open it yourself

479
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,140
500,000 taels

480
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,140
500,000 taels

481
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,140
The compensation for this time

482
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,140
It's only a million taels

483
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,140
If you agree

484
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,140
My lady is alone

485
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,140
Just on top of a city

486
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,140
I'm talking about gold

487
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,140
Gold

488
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,140
Gold

489
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,140
What are you doing?

490
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,140
One bet is a win

491
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,140
One bet is a win

492
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,140
My lady is happy

493
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:56,140
What is Shen Zaiye doing?

494
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,140
I can't hold it anymore

495
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,140
So this is the good show that Prime Minister Shen said

496
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,140
Really wonderful

497
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:11,140
They say the Qin family is the richest family in the Qi

498
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,140
But second brother

499
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,140
You may not dare to take this game

500
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,140
Where did he get so much money?

501
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,140
This is your turn

502
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,140
I open

503
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,140
Please

504
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,140
Damn it

505
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,140
Shen Zaiye, why are you still not back?

506
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,140
Come in

507
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,140
I

508
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,140
I bet

509
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,140
I bet

510
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,140
I bet

511
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,140
I bet

512
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,140
Go

513
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,140
Big

514
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,140
I bet

515
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,140
You open

516
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,140
I bet

517
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:07,140
Five, four, three, two

518
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,140
Great

519
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,140
Great

520
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,140
500,000 taels of gold

521
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,140
Even gold and gambling

522
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,140
It's the biggest bet

523
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,140
Yeah

524
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:26,140
Someone just told me that the bank was broken

525
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:30,140
The time was just after you and I bet

526
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,140
Now I think

527
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,140
You

528
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:38,140
I'm afraid you're not on the same side

529
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,140
Is it?

530
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,140
Go

531
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,140
Yes, yes, yes

532
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,140
Catch them

533
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,140
Kill them all

534
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,140
Go, go, go

535
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,140
Go, go, go

536
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,140
Huaijin, why are you here?

537
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,140
Don't be angry

538
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,140
There are many people here

539
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,140
Let's go back to the room first

540
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,140
I'm the third

541
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,140
I have to find them

542
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,140
Moqi

543
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,140
I know

544
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,140
The woman and the bank's break-in

545
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,140
It has nothing to do with it

546
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,140
But I just saw it clearly

547
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,140
There's a man

548
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,140
next to the woman

549
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,140
Helping her

550
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,140
They must still be in this building

551
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,140
Don't hand them out

552
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,140
They've been catching me for three or four days

553
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,140
They don't kill me or kill me

554
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,140
They just change the place and then they do

555
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,140
What are they doing?

556
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,140
Eat a bun

557
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:29,140
Bun?

558
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,140
Who are you?

559
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,140
Zhan Lu, Zhan Lu

560
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,140
Zhan Lu

561
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,140
Zhan Lu

562
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,140
You little girl

563
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,140
I brought you food

564
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,140
But you hit me

565
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,140
You're not a big person

566
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,140
But you're not a small person

567
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,140
Then

568
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,140
How do you know I'm here?

569
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,140
The masters made a mess here

570
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,140
I have time to

571
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,140
Look for it from the third floor

572
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,140
Then what are you going to use to save me?

573
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,140
I stole it

574
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,140
You're so shameless

575
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,140
Don't fall on the ground

576
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,140
Thank you

577
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,140
The east camp orders

578
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,140
Search the place

579
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,140
There are peach blossom smoke

580
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,140
The woman is in a hurry

581
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,140
After searching, cut off the mess

582
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,140
Go, go, go

583
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,140
Next, next

584
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,140
Stop

585
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,140
Don't run

586
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,140
Raise your right hand

587
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,140
Next

588
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,140
Right hand, right hand

589
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,140
Raise your right hand

590
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,140
Then raise your right hand

591
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,140
Next, next

592
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,140
Right hand, right hand

593
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,140
They're looking for me

594
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,140
Although the cuffs and tattoos are painted

595
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,140
I can't wash them now

596
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,140
Hurry up

597
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,140
You go first

598
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,140
When you go out

599
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,140
Find a way to save me

600
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,140
Aren't you afraid?

601
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,140
I'm afraid

602
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,140
But now we're both dead

603
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,140
You must run out

604
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,140
Young master

605
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,140
You must run out

606
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,140
Run

607
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,140
Save yourself first

608
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,140
You go quickly

609
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,140
I'll distract them

610
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,140
You are a stubborn person

611
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,140
If you are caught

612
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,140
This is not a bad thing

613
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,140
It will be a big deal

614
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,140
Come with me

615
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,140
Hide first

616
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,140
I hope the back hand I left before

617
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,140
Not a dead end

618
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,140
Back hand

619
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,140
By the way, second brother

620
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:29,140
Your people are not moving fast

621
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:32,140
Be careful to get the Prime Minister's attention

622
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,140
I'll bite you later

623
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,140
No hurry

624
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,140
Let them make a fuss

625
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,140
The bigger the fuss, the better

626
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,140
I can do it

627
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,140
Search them

628
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,140
Second brother

629
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,140
What are you doing?

630
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,140
What are you doing?

631
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,140
Next

632
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,140
What are you doing?

633
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,140
Go

634
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,140
Hurry up

635
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,140
Take her away

636
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,140
Go

637
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,140
Go

638
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,140
Don't move

639
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,140
What should I do?

640
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:31,140
I'm going back to my mother's house

641
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,140
If the general knows

642
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,140
I have to beat you to death

643
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,140
You go into the closet first

644
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,140
Let's go to the side

645
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,140
Go quickly

646
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,140
Go in quickly

647
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,140
Hurry up

648
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,140
My lord

649
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,140
I'm afraid

650
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:56,140
It's good to be quick

651
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,140
Hurry up

652
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,140
Hurry up

653
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:29,140
My lord

654
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,140
My lord

655
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,140
My lord

656
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,140
My lord

657
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,140
My lord

658
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,140
Marquis of Xinyao?

659
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,140
I don't have time to care about these things.

660
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,140
If you dare to say one more word,

661
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,140
I don't mind

662
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,140
helping General Wei Yuan

663
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:11,140
