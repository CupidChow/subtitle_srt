1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,280
The wind and rain scatter and the clouds are still.

2
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,120
How can I live my life

3
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,360
as the scene of destiny?

4
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,320
If I can stay with you in my life,

5
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,960
if you understand my sincerity,

6
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,560
I will go through all the hardships

7
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,840
without any regrets.

8
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,080
Even if I can only hold on to you

9
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,200
for the rest of my life,

10
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,160
I will go through all the hardships

11
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,520
without any regrets.

12
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:09,160
I will fight for my destiny.

13
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,120
Fate is full of mistakes.

14
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,240
I loved and hated,

15
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,360
but I never regret.

16
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,760
I will not give up

17
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:27,440
and live my life as I want.

18
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:42,080
Quando Es De

19
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,640
Episode Industrial Karst

20
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,320
She certainly has a good way ofodeXINGKUANGTING boys

21
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,520
My ranges

22
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,640
they have sticks

23
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,880
Everything is better

24
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,960
and I can go with her

25
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,880
Go

26
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,120
Go

27
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,080
Don't you trust our princess

28
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,040
if you don't believe in my lord

29
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,480
after killing the guard outside the gate,

30
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,440
he went to the Wei Palace to pray.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,760
What?

32
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,080
I didn't see the beast,

33
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,080
Jiang Changjue himself.

34
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,120
Cuiwei,

35
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,880
take someone out

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,920
to make a living.

37
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,720
If one of them is not enough,

38
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,480
ask him to pray more.

39
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,800
Jiang Changjue will be killed sooner or later.

40
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,400
Yes.

41
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,800
Follow me.

42
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,840
Go.

43
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,600
Stop them.

44
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,800
Let's get some time for the Prime Minister.

45
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,720
Wait.

46
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,200
Watch them.

47
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,000
Your Highness,

48
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,720
I saw Qingtai

49
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,160
and the guards around Shen Zaiye.

50
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,080
Jiang Taohua and Shen Zaiye went back to Haodu?

51
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,560
How did you do it?

52
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,720
You didn't see anything.

53
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,240
I was wrong.

54
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,920
But I didn't see them either.

55
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,960
I just heard the guards shout

56
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,040
to stall them

57
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,360
to get some time for the Prime Minister.

58
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,520
Stall them?

59
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,520
Stall them?

60
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,480
Have they found out

61
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,120
where Qian Mo is?

62
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,160
Go to the Shadow Treasury and check it.

63
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,080
Yes.

64
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,440
Prime Minister.

65
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,040
Your Highness.

66
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,680
Cuiwei did take some people

67
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,560
and left the back door.

68
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,720
It's a good sign.

69
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,520
He's really in danger.

70
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,040
We should set off

71
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,280
to meet the State Preceptor.

72
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,040
What's the matter?

73
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,760
Is it a poison?

74
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,040
No.

75
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,600
What's wrong?

76
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,880
Nothing.

77
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,400
I'm just a little scared.

78
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,200
Taohua.

79
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,160
Don't worry.

80
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,480
I'm here.

81
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,200
Chengxuan.

82
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,640
Stay here.

83
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,640
Let's go inside and check it.

84
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,640
Okay.

85
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,920
You four, come with me.

86
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,320
Commander Cui.

87
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,000
Is there anything wrong?

88
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,800
Commander Cui.

89
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,560
Everything is fine.

90
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,160
Tell the Imperial Concubine that

91
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,560
everything is fine here.

92
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,480
Yes.

93
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:05,880
Follow them.

94
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,240
This way.

95
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,200
Wait for me here.

96
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,600
Go to contact the Lord Chang

97
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,640
and ambush him in the middle of the road.

98
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,640
Yes.

99
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,680
We should lure the Marquis Lv to this place.

100
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,000
Who are you?

101
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,080
Stop them.

102
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,000
Yes.

103
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,560
I'll stop Cuiwei.

104
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,520
Go to find Qian Mochen.

105
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,040
Be careful.

106
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,400
Master.

107
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:51,960
Master.

108
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,560
Master.

109
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,200
Master.

110
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,720
I...

111
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,840
I光าก Mazha

112
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,000
黨 begritting for you

113
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,480
how could I,

114
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,480
browser consciousness,

115
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,280
allow the peace to return.

116
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,000
My traditional flexible spirit

117
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,400
only's for you.

118
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:24,400
I'm glad you finally call me master again.

119
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,400
Chang Jun, you found it?

120
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,400
Yes.

121
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,400
Good.

122
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,400
Now we are three people.

123
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,400
We are in the middle of the war.

124
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,400
We are betraying the party.

125
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,400
As long as you are safe.

126
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,400
I once

127
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,400
repaid the queen's favor

128
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,400
to protect you two.

129
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,400
Now

130
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,400
I have fulfilled

131
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,400
the wish of protecting the peace.

132
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,400
I have no regrets.

133
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,400
You should be happy for me.

134
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,400
Master.

135
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,400
You taught me

136
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,400
to know the truth and not to be deceived.

137
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,400
Today is the real courage.

138
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,400
Today

139
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,400
I must take you away from here.

140
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,400
Report.

141
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,400
Your Highness.

142
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,680
We received a letter from the

143
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,400
Flying Pigeon House.

144
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,400
Go to the corner.

145
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,400
Gather everyone

146
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,400
to go to the Shadow House.

147
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,400
Yes.

148
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,400
Cuiwei may be back at any time.

149
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,400
Master, we have to hurry.

150
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,400
It's not a day's work.

151
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,400
Go.

152
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,400
Our man is on fire.

153
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,400
My legs and spine

154
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,400
are blocked by President Zhou.

155
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,400
But I don't need

156
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,400
your help.

157
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
Let him go.

158
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,400
The operation

159
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,400
is dying.

160
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:43,920
delusion

161
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,500

00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,520

165
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,580
will give themselves a poison

166
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,120
One would think such a joke

167
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:44,980
That is a mistake

168
00:11:45,220 --> 00:12:08,740
According to them

169
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,700
Lord

170
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,120
His Highness is not in the room.

171
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,000
His Highness's investigate isells!

172
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,720
Yes, Your Majesty!

173
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,020
We will never fight like this!

174
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,280
There is an ambush!

175
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,920
Protectodies!

176
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,480
Retreat! Retreat!

177
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,200
Hey!

178
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,700
Come on!

179
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,820

Jah singing

R sympathy

182
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,360
Damn, it's a trap

183
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,840
Kill him

184
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,000
Her Majesty knows

185
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,240
We should live

186
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:58,960
Hu's

187
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,280

189
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,820
Stop the battlesи.

190
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,040
Drag the people to your緩降님下

191
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,100
Xu Hao

192
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,040
You set up a case in the city

193
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,640
and instigated the innocent people to destroy their families.

194
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,560
My mother's death

195
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,560
was done by you.

196
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,040
My father's death

197
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,960
was caused by you.

198
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,440
You are violent and cruel.

199
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,240
It's unforgivable.

200
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,000
Lv Heng,

201
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,680
do you know your crime?

202
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,440
You want to judge me?

203
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,760
I'll reward you

204
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,440
for killing Jiang Changjue.

205
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,200
Kill!

206
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,360
Kill!

207
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:45,600
Retreat.

208
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,560
To the east.

209
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,800
Lv Heng is here.

210
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,520
Kill!

211
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:56,600
Kill!

212
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,240
To the north.

213
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:08,080
Kill!

214
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,920
Kill them.

215
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,600
Lv Heng, don't run.

216
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,920
Kill!

217
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:56,920
Lv Heng,

218
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,800
you've lost.

219
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It's destiny.

220
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,760
Why do you fight for nothing?

221
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,400
If you want to get rid of me,

222
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,720
I'll kill you.

223
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,760
No way.

224
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,240
Even if I die,

225
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,960
I'll still pull Jiang Tuhua together.

226
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,320
Kill him.

227
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,560
There's a secret passage in the city.

228
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,400
Let's go.

229
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,320
Look.

230
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,840
Let's go.

231
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,800
Master,

232
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,120
this way.

233
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,960
Come on.

234
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,840
Master.

235
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,520
don't wake up.

236
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,760
Stay there.

237
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,500
It's time to sleep now.

238
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,440
I don't feel good.

239
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:23,840
Young Master.

240
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,520
You...

241
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:27,960
Here.

242
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,840
Have a little กzaizeng wine

243
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,320
for me to drink with you.

244
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,280
Young Master.

245
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,520
Take it back.

246
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,400
ity

247
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,080
Are you all right?

248
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,080
I'm fine.

249
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,080
Master.

250
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,080
Master.

251
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,080
Li Heng.

252
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,080
Stop.

253
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,080
Princess.

254
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,080
The antidote.

255
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,080
Go and get it.

256
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,080
But...

257
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,080
I'm fine.

258
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,080
Go.

259
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,080
Go.

260
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,080
Master.

261
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,080
Wait for me here.

262
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,080
Okay.

263
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,080
Go.

264
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,080
Jiang Taohua.

265
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,080
We meet again.

266
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,080
Lv Heng.

267
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,080
You can't escape this time.

268
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,080
Today is your death day.

269
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,080
How do you know I can't escape

270
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,080
and you don't want to be a part of it?

271
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,080
You committed a crime.

272
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,080
Now you're finally back.

273
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,080
Back?

274
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,080
Stop lying here.

275
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,080
Why do you stand on the side of justice

276
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,080
to judge me for committing a crime?

277
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,080
I tell you.

278
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,080
I'm going to the top of power

279
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,080
with my own efforts.

280
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,080
I never miss it.

281
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,080
You're so shameless.

282
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,080
You're so shameless.

283
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,080
Li Heng.

284
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,080
You're the dream of the strong and the brave.

285
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,080
Hand over the firewood.

286
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,080
You know about the firewood?

287
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,080
It seems that the plum tree has fallen into your hands.

288
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,080
Don't believe him.

289
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,080
He won't give it to us.

290
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,080
You're so good at fighting against the power.

291
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,080
You're good at making people do things.

292
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,080
Are you jealous?

293
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:47,080
You can have it.

294
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,080
My father loves you enough.

295
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,080
But you don't know how to be satisfied.

296
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,080
Mu Wuyin loves you so much.

297
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,080
But you use it all on him.

298
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,080
You're so good at it.

299
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,080
You're so good at it.

300
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,080
You're so good at it.

301
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,080
What a joke.

302
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,080
I care about the love between a man and a woman.

303
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,080
If you say you're jealous,

304
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,080
I'll only be jealous of your background.

305
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,080
Jiang Taohua.

306
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,080
You've been a princess since childhood.

307
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,080
How can you understand my ambition?

308
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,080
Your father is the king of a country.

309
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,080
He's so good at it.

310
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,080
But Mu Wuyin is so naive.

311
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,080
But he's so stupid.

312
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,080
I'm not as good as them except for my background.

313
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,080
Why should I be oppressed by you?

314
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,080
I'll climb up step by step.

315
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,080
I want to be the master of the world.

316
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,080
I want to make everyone dare not step on my head.

317
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,080
No matter where you are from,

318
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,080
you're better than them.

319
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,080
You killed the ministers, took the people's power, and killed the poor.

320
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,080
You've been blamed for this for years.

321
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,080
The people's power is weak.

322
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,080
The power of the country is weak.

323
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,080
If you knew it, you would have been dead by now.

324
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,080
What do you know?

325
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,080
What do you know?

326
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:33,080
I know there's a red-light in my heart.

327
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,080
You don't have to talk to him.

328
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,080
He won't wake up.

329
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,080
Who was that?

330
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,080
The traditions.

331
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,080
As long as it's the traditions,

332
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,080
it'll be bad.

333
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,080
There are too many men.

334
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,280
You want fire?

335
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,440
No!

336
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,440
I've already filled this place with fire.

337
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,040
I want you to see the fire and turn it into ashes.

338
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,080
Shen Zaiye,

339
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,080
I want you to see the peach blossom

340
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,240
and die in pain because of your incompetence.

341
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,160
I'm starting to feel despair.

342
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,920
You all go and die!

343
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,680
If it weren't for you,

344
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,520
I wouldn't have been able to survive.

345
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,280
I wouldn't have been able to survive.

346
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,880
I wouldn't have been able to survive.

347
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,480
I wouldn't have been able to survive.

348
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,000
You all,

349
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,800
I've already become the master of the world.

350
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,520
As long as you all die,

351
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:16,040
no one can stop me in this world.

352
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,920
Peach blossom, Shen Zaiye,

353
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,240
die!

354
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,920
Peach blossom, die!

355
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,520
Qian Fengcheng,

356
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,640
you fatty!

357
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,560
Master!

358
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,000
It hurts.

359
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,680
Ignore me!

360
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,160
You tried to save him?

361
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,360
Xiao Mo!

362
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,760
Teacher,

363
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:05,960
get up!

364
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,600
Master.

365
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,200
Master.

366
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,000
The test is strong.

367
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,800
Qian Guocheng can't hold on anymore.

368
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,700
Come on.

369
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,160
Come on.

370
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,080
Run.

371
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,020
Master.

372
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,960
Run!

373
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,960
Master!

374
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,960
I must survive.

375
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,960
Run!

376
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,960
Master!

377
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,960
Master!

378
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,960
Ah Jie!

379
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,960
You're awake!

380
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,960
Princess!

381
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,960
Ah Jie!

382
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,960
Are you... are you awake?

383
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,960
Come.

384
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,960
Dr. Mei!

385
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,960
Dr. Mei, please!

386
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,960
Water.

387
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,960
Here, drink some water.

388
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,960
Since you're awake,

389
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,960
it means the poison of the peach-tree pill has been reduced.

390
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:45,960
Really?

391
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,960
I'll give you some medicine.

392
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,960
You'll be fine in a few days.

393
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,960
Reduced?

394
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,960
But the fireworks have been burned.

395
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,960
Qingtan, where's Xiang Yu?

396
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:30,340
There's a fire 난

397
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,280
on that night.

398
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,720
It was before

399
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,160
the dull night

400
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,680
No one is saying

401
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:49,460
due to love

402
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,640
How can I mention

403
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,060
at one glance

404
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,340
The career is complicated

405
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,880
I am now in a coma

406
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,400
Dr. Mei said

407
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,760
It's now the last time

408
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,920
I can be alive

409
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,640
we can beά

410
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,400
a member.

411
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:38,920
Who has ever thought of this world of its own?

412
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:44,920
It's like a wish that has fallen into the hands of the world

413
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:49,920
Yet it's hard to let go of the hands of the world

414
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:54,920
You never wish for it, but I never wish for it

415
00:29:54,920 --> 00:30:01,920
Who has ever thought of this world of its own?

416
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:06,920
It's like a wish that has fallen into the hands of the world

417
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,920
I only want you to remember

418
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:14,920
that no matter when, you can always trust me

419
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:24,920
The shadow is the shadow, the shadow is the shadow

420
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:30,920
I cry and cry, but I can't see

421
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:35,920
I want to forget the past

422
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:42,920
I have lost so many years

423
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:52,920
Princess, the Prime Minister asked me to give this to you

424
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:04,920
This is a lotus

425
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,920
A firefly

426
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,920
Ying Huo's growth conditions are very harsh

427
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,920
He grows in the sand pit deep in the desert

428
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:12,920
No matter how much water, the changes in soil and sand will affect his growth

429
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:16,920
And Ying Huo is a plant that can cure cold and cold

430
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:21,920
If there is no moonlight, it will be difficult to bloom

431
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:36,920
If there is no moonlight, it will be difficult to bloom

432
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:49,920
When you turn around and there is a wet rain

433
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:57,920
The more clear your heart is, the more you are the grass

434
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,920
Thinking

435
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,920
I always think of you at night

436
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:09,920
The more I am happy, the more afraid I am of losing you

437
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,920
Your eyes are like stars in the sky

438
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,920
Clear and transparent

439
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,920
Shining in the sky

440
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:24,920
Because of you, the scenery is beautiful

441
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,920
Warm and fresh, the wind blows

442
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,920
Write down the love

443
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,920
Even if we are separated, we will never stop

444
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,920
Life and death

445
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:43,920
Those simple and ordinary morning

446
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,920
Write down my dreams

447
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,920
We used to be together

448
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,920
No matter what

449
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:56,920
Those memories are in my mind

450
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,920
Long and long

451
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,920
All the Buddha's blessings

452
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,920
The poison in the Divine Leaf

453
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,920
All because of me

454
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,920
What I want today

455
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,920
Three months of light

456
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,920
The fire of the soul is not enough

457
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,920
Fairy Tao Hua

458
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,920
I am willing to be the master

459
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,920
Light a lamp for the Divine Leaf

460
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,920
Let her be safe and sound

461
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,920
Let her have no worries

462
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,920
Clear and transparent

463
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,920
Shining in the sky

464
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:35,920
Because of you, the scenery is beautiful

465
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,920
Warm and fresh, the wind blows

466
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,920
Write down the love

467
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,920
Even if we are separated, we will never stop

468
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,920
Life and death

469
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,920
Those simple and ordinary morning

470
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:56,920
Look at the wind and leaves, it is impossible

471
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,920
That moment of memory

472
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,920
The closer, the forever

473
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:07,920
Those memories are in the past

474
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,920
The fate is so cruel

475
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,920
The past that has been left unbreakable by fate

476
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:19,920
No fear of the past

477
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,920
Dr. Mei

478
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,920
Why is Xiangye still unconscious after taking the antidote?

479
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,920
After all, the poison has already entered the five organs and six organs

480
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,920
The remaining wounds are not so easy to heal

481
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,920
Xiangye's body is like a battlefield

482
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,920
Poison and medicinal nature are contrasted

483
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:53,920
Although medicinal nature is now more severe

484
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,920
But the battlefield is also empty

485
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,920
Need time to recover

486
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,920
Dr. Mei

487
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,920
Do you have about ten days?

488
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,920
This is where the battle is

489
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,920
If it rains, it may wake up tomorrow

490
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,920
If you don't believe it, you may never wake up

491
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,920
God is with you

492
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,920
No matter how long

493
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,920
I will always be waiting for you

494
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,920
What are you thinking?

495
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,920
In three months

496
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,920
The north yard will be snowy

497
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,920
I remember that one year

498
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,920
The snow in the north yard has been snowing from winter to spring

499
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,920
I was arguing and making fun of the peach blossoms

500
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,920
So the mother hugged me

501
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,920
Snow under the peach tree

502
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,920
The snow is falling every year

503
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,920
It's not that you can't see it

504
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,920
Yes

505
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:34,920
It's not that you can't see it

506
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,920
It's not that you can't see it

507
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,920
It's not that you can't see it

508
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,920
It's not that you can't see it

509
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,920
It's not that you can't see it

510
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,920
It's not that you can't see it

511
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,920
It's not that you can't see it

512
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,920
It's not that you can't see it

513
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,920
It's not that you can't see it

514
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,920
It's not that you can't see it

515
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,920
It's not that you can't see it

516
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,920
It's not that you can't see it

517
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,920
It's not that you can't see it

518
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,920
It's not that you can't see it

519
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,920
It's not that you can't see it

520
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:23,920
It's not that you can't see it

521
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,920
It's not that you can't see it

522
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,920
It's not that you can't see it

523
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,920
It's not that you can't see it

524
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,920
It's not that you can't see it

525
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:28,920
It's not that you can't see it

00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:52,920
花开你无所知

530
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,920
花美不可一世

531
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:00,080
Flowers fall, the north wind blows,

532
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:04,080
the city is in a state of panic.

533
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:07,360
The petals are left behind,

534
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,960
the heart is broken.

535
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,880
Flowers fall, tears fall,

536
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,680
the heart is torn,

537
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:20,800
nowhere to be found.

538
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,800
The Love by Hypnotic

539
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:31,800
The love is struggling in the mud.

540
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:38,800
Regret is in the despair.

541
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,800
I still wish that

542
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,800
the flowers in my heart

543
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,800
would have been like the flowers

544
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:58,800
and have been sung by the rain.

545
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,800
Who has lost the heart?

546
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,800
Love and hate can only be eaten.

547
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,800
Flowers fall, the heart is broken.

548
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:25,800
There is no need to tell.

549
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:37,800
How to love the wild chrysanthemum?

550
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:44,800
Not afraid of being crushed by the five realms?

551
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:51,800
The words she said about flowers

552
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,800
turned out to be her

553
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:01,800
sincere reply.
