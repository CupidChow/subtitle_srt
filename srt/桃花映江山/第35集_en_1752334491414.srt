1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,440
The wind and rain scatter and the clouds are still.

2
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,680
How can I live with the life and death?

3
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,640
If I could stay with you in my life,

4
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,280
if you could understand my sincerity,

5
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:55,120
I would be happy to be with you in this life.

6
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,440
Even if I have to spend the rest of my life with you,

7
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,480
I would spend the rest of my life with you.

8
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:09,480
I would fight for the cause and the cause of my destiny.

9
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,680
Fate is like a pair of lovers who have loved and hated each other for a lifetime.

10
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,640
If you can't get rid of it, you can't get rid of it.

11
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,120
You are the most beautiful and the most beautiful flower in the world.

12
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:27,600
You are the most beautiful and the most beautiful flower in the world.

13
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:34,440
The Long Ballad

14
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,440
Episode 16

15
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,440
Did you hear anything about His Majesty?

16
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,440
His Majesty passed away.

17
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,440
Since you know about it,

18
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:48,440
I have an important task for you.

19
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,440
What is it?

20
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,440
I have an important task for you.

21
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,440
What is it?

22
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,440
I have an important task for you.

23
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,440
What is it?

24
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:03,440
The will that His Majesty passed on to Changjue is in my hands.

25
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,440
Your Majesty,

26
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,440
Lv Heng has died in the palace of Qi.

27
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,440
The palace is in a panic.

28
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,440
I ask Your Majesty to come out early and take charge of the big picture.

29
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,440
The country must not be in chaos for a day.

30
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,440
Otherwise, the Northland will be in chaos.

31
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,440
The country must not be in chaos for a day.

32
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,440
My body is still as high as a mountain.

33
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,440
How can I manage the big picture?

34
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,440
Your Majesty,

35
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,440
the Crown Prince of Changjue has recovered his poison.

36
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,440
Yes.

37
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,440
I have a son.

38
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,440
I can let him take charge of the country.

39
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,440
If Your Majesty doesn't pass the throne to the Crown Prince,

40
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,440
the Crown Prince will be in a difficult situation.

41
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,440
He will be severely punished by Lv Heng.

42
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,440
If I pass the throne to him,

43
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,440
how can I ensure that

44
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,440
I can keep the country going?

45
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,440
Your Majesty,

46
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,440
how about writing a letter of edict?

47
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,440
Only after a hundred years,

48
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,440
can the throne be passed on to the Crown Prince.

49
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,440
Good.

50
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,440
Eunuch Ye of the Yue Shu House

51
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,440
can help me get the jade seal.

52
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,440
You...

53
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,440
Your Majesty, I'm used to planning.

54
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,440
I don't want you to write another edict

55
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,440
for others' advice.

56
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,440
Now that the jade seal has been destroyed,

57
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,440
this is the only edict

58
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,440
that Your Majesty left.

59
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,440
It's not safe to keep it in my hands.

60
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,440
Please come back with me.

61
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,440
Your Highness, I can't believe it.

62
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,440
I feel guilty

63
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,440
to Your Highness and Her Highness.

64
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,440
Your Highness can kill me on the spot.

65
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,440
I have no complaints.

66
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,440
Since you have the edict,

67
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,440
why don't you give it to Changjue

68
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,440
and close the door to thank him?

69
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,440
I have to guard the palace.

70
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,440
I had to take the risk

71
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,440
to enter the palace last night

72
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,440
to ask His Majesty to write the edict

73
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,440
so that I can find Changjue

74
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,440
and find him.

75
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,440
Your Highness should know

76
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,440
if the jade seal is really in the palace,

77
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,440
Changjue and you

78
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,440
will be in a terrible state.

79
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,440
Fine.

80
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,440
I'll go with you.

81
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,440
But you'd better not play tricks.

82
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,440
Otherwise, you'll be killed.

83
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,440
Please, Your Highness.

84
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,440
Your Highness,

85
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,440
we really have to go to his mansion.

86
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,440
If he is afraid,

87
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,440
we'll be in trouble.

88
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,440
Qingtai,

89
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,440
you know me for the first time.

90
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,440
If I really want to kill you,

91
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:24,440
I won't wait until today.

92
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,440
Prime Minister,

93
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,440
I've got news.

94
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,440
Her Highness is taking someone

95
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,440
to see the State Preceptor Qian Mochen.

96
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,440
Take everyone to the State Preceptor's mansion.

97
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,440
Yes, Your Highness.

98
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,440
I'll meet you later.

99
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,440
State Preceptor.

100
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,440
State Preceptor.

101
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,440
Why would State Preceptor

102
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,440
put the jade seal in such a place?

103
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,440
Your Highness,

104
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,440
you should be responsible for it.

105
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,440
Your Highness,

106
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,440
the jade seal is in there.

107
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,440
It's important.

108
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,440
Please go in alone.

109
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,440
Your Highness,

110
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,440
I'm afraid you'll be in trouble.

111
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,440
There must be a jade under the jade.

112
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,440
That's what the State Preceptor taught me.

113
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,440
I taught you that

114
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,440
if you want to get it, you must get it.

115
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,440
Okay, I'll go in.

116
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,440
Your Highness.

117
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,440
Qingtai,

118
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,440
you and Zhan Lu

119
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,440
wait for me here.

120
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,440
Your Highness,

121
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,440
I'll go in.

122
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,440
This is

123
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,440
the jade seal.

124
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,440
There's no mechanism.

125
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,440
The direction of this sword is...

126
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,440
State Preceptor, what do you mean?

127
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,440
Your Highness,

128
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,440
the jade seal is a ferocious weapon.

129
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,440
It's not for the second-hand.

130
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,440
If you want the jade seal,

131
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,440
the jade will be shot by the hidden weapon.

132
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,440
Your Highness,

133
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,440
the jade seal is a ferocious weapon.

134
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,440
It's not for the second-hand.

135
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,440
If you choose to save it,

136
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,440
the jade seal will fall into the fire and turn into a shadow.

137
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,440
The great cause of the Changxuan will be destroyed.

138
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,440
Your Highness, don't worry too much.

139
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,440
It's just an old jade on the street.

140
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,440
It's been almost ten days.

141
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,440
If it can help you get the jade seal,

142
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,440
it will be of some value if it dies.

143
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,440
Your Highness,

144
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,440
what are you hesitating about?

145
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,440
It's just an old jade that has been killed by a weapon.

146
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,440
It will help Changxuan to be exposed.

147
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,440
Why did you save me?

148
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,440
Compared to the common people,

149
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,440
the jade seal is just a piece of paper.

150
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,440
It's not worth using anyone's life to return it.

151
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,440
Are you all right?

152
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,440
I'm fine.

153
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,440
I'm fine.

154
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,440
I'm fine.

155
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,440
I'm fine.

156
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,440
I'm fine.

157
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,440
I'm fine.

158
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,440
I'm fine.

159
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,440
I'm fine.

160
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,440
I'm fine.

161
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,440
Are you all right?

162
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,440
I'm fine.

163
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,440
It's just that the old jade in the house is weak.

164
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,440
It needs to be treated.

165
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,440
State Preceptor,

166
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,440
why do you have to use your power

167
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,440
to control the lives of the common people?

168
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,440
Your Highness, why don't you choose a move?

169
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,440
If you lose a lot of credit

170
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,440
and you miss Changjue's great cause,

171
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,440
won't you regret it?

172
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,440
I won't.

173
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,440
Even if there is no move,

174
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,440
I can still get Changjue to the throne.

175
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,440
I'm fine.

176
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,440
Yicheng.

177
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,440
The Yicheng must be given a common policy

178
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,440
and a firm will.

179
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,440
I set up this game just to test you.

180
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,440
I want to know

181
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,440
if you still have a good heart

182
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,440
after going through many difficulties

183
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,440
and can put the safety of the northern Courtyard

184
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,440
before the power.

185
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,440
Your Highness,

186
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,440
you've always done a good job.

187
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,440
Today,

188
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,440
you didn't disappoint me.

189
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,320
The Yicheng's

190
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,440
Why does the imperial jade seal look like this?

191
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,440
Tell me.

192
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,440
Who dares to destroy the state's important weapons?

193
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,440
Your Highness, please spare me.

194
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,440
Your Highness, please spare me.

195
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,440
His Majesty...

196
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,440
His Majesty ordered me to send the imperial jade seal to the Palace of Qin.

197
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,440
What does he want the imperial jade seal for?

198
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,440
I don't know.

199
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,440
Is there anyone else in the Palace of Qin?

200
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,440
I was also worried.

201
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,440
So I listened outside for a while.

202
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,440
I heard the sound of the State Preceptor.

203
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,440
State Preceptor?

204
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,440
Your Highness,

205
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,440
don't hide your whereabouts.

206
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,440
You are limited in number after all.

207
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,440
I'm not limited in number.

208
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,440
Why don't you leave the matter of finding Changque to me?

209
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,440
Aren't you afraid of being discovered by the Empress?

210
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,440
I was worried that the Empress would find out

211
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,440
and lose the public.

212
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,440
Now, I've given the imperial edict to you.

213
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,440
I have no more worries.

214
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,440
I don't know why the State Preceptor

215
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,440
is willing to help my sister.

216
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,440
I've never been the Empress.

217
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,440
But every decision I made

218
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,440
was extremely difficult.

219
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,440
I once said

220
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,440
that right and wrong are not as important as living.

221
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,440
What I did back then

222
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,440
was just to protect you two.

223
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,440
I really want to thank you.

224
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,440
But it's hard to get over it.

225
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,440
Maybe I can never understand

226
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,440
your power and power.

227
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,440
Even if I see this edict,

228
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,440
I can't thank my father sincerely.

229
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,440
After he has been loyal to me for many years,

230
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,440
he never cared about Changque and me.

231
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,440
His Majesty...

232
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,440
He has always been guilty

233
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,440
of your sister and the Empress.

234
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,440
Thank you for your kind words.

235
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,440
I've always had an answer

236
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,440
to explain what kind of person my father is.

237
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,440
I'm sorry.

238
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,440
Guards, open the door.

239
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,440
The Empress summoned the State Preceptor to the imperial palace.

240
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,440
Open the door!

241
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,440
Prime Minister,

242
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,440
the State Preceptor found a signboard.

243
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,440
There's a hidden door behind it.

244
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,440
We can get in from there.

245
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,640
I'll report to the State Preceptor right away.

246
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,640
Retreat!

247
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,200
Your Highness, please give me the State Preceptor.

248
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,680
Kill those who disobey my order.

249
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,880
If you want to find Tian Mochen,

250
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,680
don't waste your time.

251
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,720
They're here to catch me.

252
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,800
I'll let them take you away from the secret passage.

253
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,200
I'll wait for you.

254
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,800
What about you?

255
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,480
There's a trap here.

256
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,800
I'll meet you later.

257
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,480
You're not a bad person.

258
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,440
Get in!

259
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,240
Let's go. Over there.

260
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,400
Zhang Long, run!

261
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:16,800
Huurong,

262
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,200
Huo.

263
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,640
Grandpa Kaixiao.

264
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,960
You're here.

265
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,400
I went too far.

266
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,440
I'm flattered.

267
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,040
Prime Minister Shen

268
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,240
came to the North Court for Her Highness.

269
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,840
I'm flattered.

270
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,640
State Preceptor, you're being too serious.

271
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,840
Prime Minister,

272
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,040
this is the will

273
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,840
that State Preceptor got from my father.

274
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,240
We'll leave first.

275
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,840
I'll talk to you outside.

276
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,640
Okay.

277
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,840
Qin Mochen,

278
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,440
your family has been captured.

279
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,640
If you want to save their lives,

280
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,040
come out now.

281
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,240
State Preceptor,

282
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,040
what should we do?

283
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,040
Take Her Highness and Prime Minister Shen away.

284
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,840
Remember what I told you.

285
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,440
State Preceptor.

286
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,040
The old and young in the manor have been following me for years.

287
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,240
I can't leave them alone.

288
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,440
Don't worry.

289
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,640
Lü Hou has trusted me for the past few years.

290
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,240
I still have the ability to deal with him.

291
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,440
When it's safe, I'll contact you.

292
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,640
State Preceptor,

293
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,040
if you don't show up,

294
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,040
these people have to die.

295
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,440
Don't let my people be in danger.

296
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,040
State Preceptor,

297
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,440
don't be so hard on me.

298
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,840
Do you really have a way to get away from this?

299
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,440
These years, Prime Minister Shen

300
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,840
has been making trouble again and again.

301
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,640
Take care, State Preceptor.

302
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,840
Goodbye.

303
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,040
Chief.

304
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,040
The guards of the guard post are here.

305
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,240
Let's take the old and young in the manor away.

306
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,040
Yes.

307
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,240
The State Preceptor's Manor is connected to the North Garden Palace.

308
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,640
Qian Muchen is really cunning.

309
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,640
Lü Hou definitely can't imagine

310
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,440
that we escaped here.

311
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,440
Chief, this is...

312
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,040
This is the Cold Palace where Changjue and I

313
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,040
have been living since childhood.

314
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,040
When did you get this secret passage?

315
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,240
Not long after the defeat of the Crown Prince and the Princess,

316
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,640
when State Preceptor was teaching the Princess and the Crown Prince,

317
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,840
Lü Hou might have seen it.

318
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,840
He must have seen it.

319
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,240
That's why he came here.

320
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,640
Since that's the secret passage,

321
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,040
State Preceptor is watching me and Changjue

322
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,640
and running around in the palace.

323
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,440
He's like a dog in a dead dog.

324
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,040
He can't be like the moon.

325
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,440
Princess,

326
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,040
State Preceptor has been very guilty

327
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,040
about what happened back then.

328
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,840
But he did it to save you.

329
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,040
Lü Hou knew that you were going to escape,

330
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,640
so he was going to kill you.

331
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,040
If he hadn't pretended to betray you,

332
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,840
you and the Crown Prince would have been dead by now.

333
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,040
Then why did he let you take the Peach Blossom Pill?

334
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,640
He had to endure the pain of the poison every month.

335
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,440
He forced you to take the pill

336
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,040
because of State Preceptor's plan to return the troops.

337
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,440
If he knew that the Peach Blossom Pill had no cure,

338
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,040
State Preceptor would never do that.

339
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,440
What did you say?

340
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,240
There's no cure for the Peach Blossom Pill?

341
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,240
There is.

342
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,040
I knew that

343
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,640
the Peach Blossom Pill was in the Old God's tomb.

344
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,640
You're Lü Hou's man?

345
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,640
After Lü Hou disappeared,

346
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,440
State Preceptor happened to kill Doctor Mei who escaped from the palace

347
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,040
and locked him up in the palace.

348
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,240
He was interrogated.

349
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:17,440
He insisted that the Peach Blossom Pill had no cure.

350
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,440
Xiaoyu.

351
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,040
It's clear that State Preceptor had been planning for a long time.

352
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,840
Since there's a cure for the Peach Blossom Pill every month,

353
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,440
why didn't he use the cure?

354
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,040
Who are you?

355
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,640
Why should I tell you?

356
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,040
You killed Chu Tao.

357
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,040
I'm sure that Lü Hou didn't mean to do that.

358
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,840
The two sides of the same coin can be friends.

359
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,440
Please give me a hand, Doctor Mei.

360
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,640
Since you saved me twice,

361
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,440
I'll tell you that

362
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,640
the antidote you took

363
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,640
didn't work to detoxify the poison.

364
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,040
It can only temporarily suppress the poison.

365
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,440
Since you've taken the Peach Blossom Pill for two years,

366
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,240
Princess,

367
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,440
you don't have much time left.

368
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,640
I don't owe anyone money.

369
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,240
I'll try to find a way to help you.

370
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,640
Thank you, Doctor Mei.

371
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,840
But to make the Peach Blossom Pill,

372
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,440
we need an incurable poison.

373
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,440
This is a rare flower.

374
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,840
It's famous for its silver.

375
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,840
Without this flower,

376
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,440
I'm afraid that there's no way to cure it.

377
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,840
Where is the flower growing?

378
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,040
According to the book,

379
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,040
this flower grows in the desert.

380
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,040
But where exactly

381
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,640
is Lü Hou's idea?

382
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,800
Lü Hou is ourative

383
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,640
Xiang Ye,

384
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,360
don't worry.

385
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,440
We still have time.

386
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,880
tape

387
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,100
Dr. Mei,

388
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,080
It is a temporary pharmacy,

389
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,220
Are you satisfied?

390
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,380
當然

391
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,280
Where is the Competition Team of Item sundry?

392
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,060
Tell them

393
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,820
You don't need to make trouble for me.

394
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,660
But I'll be frank.

395
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,220
May I ask you,

396
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,100
if there's no silver,

397
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,820
there's no way to find the antidote.

398
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,500
You care so much about the antidote.

399
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,100
Who are you?

400
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,820
Taohua is my wife.

401
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,340
She's the most important person in my life.

402
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,140
Now the time is limited.

403
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,460
We don't know if we can find the silver.

404
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,900
If there's no other way,

405
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,460
please don't ask for help.

406
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,580
I said I would, so I will.

407
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,460
I don't need you to beg me.

408
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,020
I've been developing some

409
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,460
medicines that can cure poison.

410
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,340
But there's no silver.

411
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:25,100
I can't guarantee the effect.

412
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,140
Even if the poison is poisoned,

413
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,300
it can be killed.

414
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,140
It's possible.

415
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,580
It's better than being a dead man.

416
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,660
Then find some people to test the medicine.

417
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,140
Where can we find the person

418
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,980
who can test the medicine?

419
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:43,900
I'm willing to be the one who can test the medicine.

420
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,540
Your Grace.

421
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,260
This plum syrup is made by me.

422
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,860
It will poison you immediately after taking it.

423
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,180
Think it over.

424
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,480
If we can't find the silver,

425
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,840
it can be the best but?

426
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,420
It can醫 many problems and acupressure patients.

427
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:21,240
The decoction that people with low blood

428
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,680
can't amen themselves to the torture.

429
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,640
It's freshly boiled,

430
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,300
and it's poisonous.

431
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,480
Try it.

432
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,440
Try it.

433
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:39,280
The stars coincidentally grow in a muddy place,

434
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,000
the coral sea,

435
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:47,220
crossing staunch US's

436
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:54,340
Marvellousigen on the wings of the sea …

437
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,240
I didn't know you were learning it

438
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:00,240
I can't believe it's this painful.

439
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,240
This is...

440
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,240
Princess wants to change clothes.

441
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,240
I'm going to give her clothes.

442
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,240
Bring the doctor here.

443
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,240
Bring it here.

444
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,240
So you've been through this pain

445
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,240
every time we were together.

446
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,240
But I've never seen it.

447
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,240
You girls are so strange.

448
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,240
You have to put on a good peach blossom makeup.

449
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:48,240
Don't worry about our girls.

450
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,240
I'm going home.

451
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,240
Goodbye.

452
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,240
I'm going home.

453
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,240
Doctor,

454
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,240
is Duoxing having a miscarriage?

455
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,240
Duoxing hasn't been born yet.

456
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,240
Go on.

457
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,240
Princess, Hu Shiwei is here.

458
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,240
Greetings, Princess.

459
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,240
Please get up.

460
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,240
You're Hu Shiwei?

461
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,240
Yes, Princess.

462
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,240
I'm the one who followed Hu Yun to Yuezhong City.

463
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,240
I've heard about Yuezhong City.

464
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,240
Peach blossoms are unrepentant.

465
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,240
I can only ask Hu Shiwei

466
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,240
to take Yuezhong City to receive peach blossoms.

467
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,240
Princess, don't do that.

468
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,240
Princess,

469
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,240
the maid in Yuezhong City often said

470
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,240
her biggest regret in her life

471
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,240
is that she failed to save you and the Crown Prince.

472
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,240
She knew you and the Crown Prince were out there.

473
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,240
Now that you're back,

474
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,240
you can do anything for the Crown Prince and the North Court.

475
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,240
I have no regrets.

476
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,240
You're so right.

477
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,240
Princess, I'm sorry.

478
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,240
I failed to keep you safe

479
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,240
because of your request.

480
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,240
It's not your fault.

481
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,240
Besides, Changjue is still in Lv Houchi's hands.

482
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,240
We still have a chance.

483
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,240
By the way, Princess,

484
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,240
the Crown Prince has made a promise to us.

485
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,240
If anything happens, we can hide in a secret house.

486
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,240
We'll wait for him there.

487
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,240
Lv Houchi has searched Changjue in the city.

488
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,240
I think he might not be able to escape for a while.

489
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,240
Let's search the house

490
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,240
and receive Changjue.

491
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,240
Yes, Princess.

492
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,240
Raise your head.

493
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,240
How did you do it?

494
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,240
You tortured the high-ranking State Preceptor

495
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,240
into this state.

496
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,240
Go and wash it for him.

497
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,240
State Preceptor is so kind.

498
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,240
Now you're still smiling.

499
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,240
I admire you.

500
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,240
It's a pity that State Preceptor chose the wrong person

501
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,240
and made the wrong team.

502
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,240
It seems that the poison will be released in a few days.

503
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,240
I can give you the antidote

504
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,240
to reduce the peony.

505
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,240
It would be great

506
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,240
if there was an antidote.

507
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,240
How did you know?

508
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,240
How did you know?

509
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,240
I've long been a soldier.

510
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,240
Why should I talk to you?

511
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,240
Since State Preceptor is unwilling to help me,

512
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,240
I'll have to use State Preceptor to lure the snake out of the hole.

513
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,240
What are you going to do?

514
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,240
Cuiwei,

515
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,240
write a notice in the whole city.

516
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,240
State Preceptor Qian Mochen

517
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,240
will ask Zhan three days later

518
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,240
to secretly release the news

519
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,240
that he was imprisoned.

520
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,240
Yes.

521
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,240
State Preceptor,

522
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,240
you know General Jiang better than I do.

523
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,240
He even helped the most important officials

524
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,240
in Luo City.

525
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,240
His son and daughter taught him a lesson.

526
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,240
They even took the will of him.

527
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,240
Do you think he will come to save you in person?

528
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,240
After Zhan is out of the root,

529
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,240
the will of the state will be a piece of paper.

530
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,240
You're so mean.

531
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,240
State Preceptor Qian Mochen

532
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,240
has betrayed the country and humiliated the Queen.

533
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,240
He will be executed in three days.

534
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,240
What's going on?

535
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,240
How did it get recorded?

536
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,240
State Preceptor is a good person.

537
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,240
How did it get recorded?

538
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,240
Why?

539
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,240
It's not good to help the evil.

540
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,240
It means that State Preceptor didn't help the evil.

541
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,240
Why isn't he a good person?

542
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,240
Don't be ridiculous.

543
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,240
You, with the hat, turn around.

544
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,240
I'll take care of you.

545
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,240
Stop.

546
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,240
Where are you going?

547
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,240
Sister.

548
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,240
Your Highness.

549
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,240
Your Highness is back.

550
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,240
Your Highness.

551
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,240
Your Highness.

552
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,240
Your Highness.

553
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,240
Your Highness.

554
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,240
Your Highness.

555
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,240
We've been waiting for you here.

556
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,240
You're finally back.

557
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,240
Your Highness, I'm glad you're fine.

558
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,240
Everyone,

559
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,240
before the late King died,

560
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,240
he wrote a will

561
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,240
to pass the throne to Changjue.

562
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,240
When we return to the palace,

563
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,240
Changjue will be the rightful king of the North Court.

564
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,240
Great.

565
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,240
Great.

566
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,240
Your Highness.

567
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,240
Everyone, get up.

568
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,240
Qin.

569
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,240
Qin.

570
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,240
I've missed you.

571
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,240
I've missed you too.

572
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,240
Let me see.

573
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,240
Do you have a wound?

574
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,240
Sister, don't worry.

575
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,240
I've been through a lot.

576
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,240
It's nothing serious.

577
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,240
Sister.

578
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,240
What's the reason

579
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,240
behind this will?

580
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,240
This will

581
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,240
was made by Master.

582
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,240
Qian Mochen?

583
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,240
Isn't he a member of the Queen?

584
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,240
Actually, he's been secretly

585
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,240
working with Yue Zhongcheng

586
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,240
to help you.

587
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,240
The court officials you've taken over

588
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,240
are all working for you.

589
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,240
And this will

590
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,240
was what he asked from Father.

591
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,240
I see.

592
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,240
No wonder there's a rumor on the street

593
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,240
that Empress Lv will kill him in three days.

594
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,240
Empress Lv will kill Master?

595
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,240
What's wrong, Sister?

596
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,240
I'm fine.

597
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,240
I'm fine.

598
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,240
Qin.

599
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,240
Why do you have this will?

600
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,240
In Luoyang City,

601
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,240
only Empress Lv

602
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,240
has this will.

603
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,240
The poison of the gunpowder.

604
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,240
You've been poisoned by Empress Lv

605
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,240
and killed?

606
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,240
Empress Lv.

607
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,240
Isn't it enough

608
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,240
to live in a foreign land?

609
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,240
Why did you do this, Sister?

610
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,240
This will is nothing

611
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,240
compared to me.

612
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,240
I'll go to the palace now

613
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,240
and get Empress Lv

614
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,240
and ask for the antidote.

615
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,240
Chang Juan.

616
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,240
Don't be impulsive.

617
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,240
Do you know?

618
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,240
These years,

619
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,240
I've been living in Luoyang City.

620
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,240
I've been suffering.

621
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,240
But compared to you,

622
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,240
what are these?

623
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,240
Chang Juan.

624
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,240
Sister is doing very well in Qi State.

625
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,240
Although she's heavily poisoned,

626
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,240
she takes the antidote every month

627
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,240
on time.

628
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,240
But now we're

629
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,240
like water and fire.

630
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,240
Will she give you the antidote?

631
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,240
I used to

632
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,240
have some left.

633
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,240
Let me see.

634
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,240
I didn't take it with me.

635
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,240
Sister.

636
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,240
If you still lie to me,

637
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,240
I'll go to the palace now

638
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,240
and get Empress Lv

639
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,240
and ask for the antidote.

640
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,240
Chang Juan.

641
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,240
I don't have the antidote.

642
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,240
Sister.

643
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,240
Sister.

644
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,240
I still have some time.

645
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,240
But Master is now in danger.

646
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,240
We can't just let him go.

647
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,240
But...

648
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,240
Chang Juan.

649
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,240
Brothers.

650
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,240
I have news about State Preceptor.

651
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,240
Your Highness.

652
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,240
I've asked around.

653
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,240
State Preceptor will be imprisoned.

654
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,240
Jin.

655
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,240
We need to save State Preceptor as soon as possible.

656
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,240
Your Highness.

657
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,240
I have something to say.

658
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,240
State Preceptor told me before he left.

659
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,240
If he's in the hands of Empress Lv,

660
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,240
please don't take the risk.

661
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,240
Because

662
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,240
State Preceptor is running out of time.

663
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,240
Running out of time?

664
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,240
State Preceptor didn't get Empress Lv's trust.

665
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,240
She took the initiative to take the antidote.

666
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,240
I'm never a member of the Lv family.

667
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,240
Black and white are right and wrong.

668
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,240
I can't beat my son.

669
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,240
I did it back then

670
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,240
just to protect you two.

671
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,240
Goodbye.

672
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,240
Take care, State Preceptor.

673
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,240
Get up.

674
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,240
Yu Si.

675
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,240
State Preceptor has raised

676
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,240
my two brothers.

677
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,240
Yu Gong.

678
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,240
State Preceptor is a important official of our North Court.

679
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,240
If he's poisoned by Empress Lv,

680
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,240
he'll shock the officials.

681
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,240
Then,

682
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,240
no one will dare to defy Empress Lv.

683
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,240
The North Court will be in chaos.

684
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,240
So,

685
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,240
we must save State Preceptor.

686
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,240
Yes.

687
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,240
Yes.

688
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,240
We must save State Preceptor.

689
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,240
Yes.

690
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,240
We must save him.

691
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,240
We must save him.

692
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,240
We must save him.

693
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,240
Don't be rash.

694
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,240
I guess you're Prime Minister Shen.

695
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,240
This isn't Qi State.

696
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,240
You'd better not say anything.

697
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,240
I'm wondering

698
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,240
how you knew State Preceptor was in the prison.

699
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,240
I found out from a brother in the prison.

700
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,240
The night before,

701
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,240
Cuiwei secretly sent State Preceptor to the prison.

702
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,240
Can he be trusted?

703
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,240
Ten years of friendship.

704
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,240
He must be trusted.

705
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,240
Okay.

706
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,240
Please do me a favor.

707
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,240
Let's eat.

708
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,240
Don't eat.

709
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,240
Don't eat.

710
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,240
Don't eat.

711
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,240
Don't eat.

712
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,240
Don't eat.

713
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,240
Don't eat.

714
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,240
Don't eat.

715
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,240
I did see State Preceptor in the prison.

716
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,240
Although I didn't see him properly,

717
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,240
he looked like State Preceptor.

718
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,240
It seems we're going to take him to the prison.

719
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,240
What's your concern?

720
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,240
Jiangning saw it.

721
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,240
The incident is at the level of the water.

722
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,240
He was locked in a cell alone.

723
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:18,240
He prepared everything for the meal.

724
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,240
Meal?

725
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,240
Do you know how he took the bowl and the chopsticks?

726
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,240
It's the same as common people.

727
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,240
Left hand takes the bowl, right hand takes the chopsticks.

728
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,240
No.

729
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,240
Master uses his left hand to take the chopsticks.

730
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,240
The person in the prison is not Master.

731
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,240
It seems the prison is a trap.

732
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,240
So,

733
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,240
it's Lv Houchi who used Master as his second son

734
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,240
to lure Changjue to the palace.

735
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,240
I'm ashamed.

736
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,240
If it weren't for Prime Minister Shen and Princess,

737
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,240
you would have been in a good position.

738
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,240
We almost

739
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,240
have been fooled by Lv Houchi.

740
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,240
If Master wasn't in the prison,

741
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,240
where would he be?

742
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,240
What's the biggest feature of you

743
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,240
fighting against Lv Houchi these years?

744
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,240
Greed.

745
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,240
Too suspicious.

746
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,240
You've learned a lot.

747
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,240
I have a plan.

748
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,240
Lv Houchi still doesn't know that

749
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,240
Tao Hua and I are on the same side.

750
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,240
She will be able to find out

751
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,240
if Lv Houchi is still in the prison.

752
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,240
If she is,

753
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,240
I will be able to find out

754
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,240
if Lv Houchi is still in the prison.

755
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,240
If she is,

756
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,240
she will be able to find out

757
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,240
if Lv Houchi is still in the prison.

758
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,240
If she suddenly knows

759
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,240
that we are already in the prison,

760
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,240
but we didn't go to the prison

761
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,240
to rescue the State Preceptor,

762
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,240
but to send someone

763
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,240
to stall outside the prison.

764
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,240
What would she think?

765
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,240
Lv Houchi will think

766
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,240
that we already know

767
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,240
the real address of the prison.

768
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,240
So we will send someone to

769
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,240
check it out in person.

770
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,240
Then we just have to follow them

771
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,240
and we will be able to find Master.

772
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,240
That's right.

773
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,240
The prison is very dangerous.

774
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,240
Lv Houchi's life is much more dangerous than ours.

775
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,240
Everyone, don't be careless.

776
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,240
Yes.

777
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,240
No matter what,

778
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,240
we must rescue Master tomorrow.

779
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,240
We must save Lv Houchi

780
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,240
and make him give us the antidote.

781
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,200
The

782
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,200
The

783
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:30,200
The

784
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,200
The

785
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:38,200
The

786
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,240
I will make it clear first.

787
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,240
This is a poison-like drug.

788
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,240
Have you thought it through?

789
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,240
Prime Minister,

790
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,240
can we wait until tomorrow

791
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,240
to rescue the State Preceptor

792
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,240
and then send the antidote after we get Lv Houchi?

793
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,240
Maybe we can find the silver goods

794
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,240
from Lv Houchi's hands.

795
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,240
It's not easy to rescue the State Preceptor

796
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,240
in a bad situation tomorrow.

797
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,240
If we can't find the silver goods

798
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,240
after we get Lv Houchi,

799
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,240
we can try another drug today.

800
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,240
In the future,

801
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,240
we can also help Dr. Mei

802
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,240
with developing the antidote.

803
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,240
Prime Minister.

804
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,240
Prime Minister.

805
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,240
Dr. Mei,

806
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,240
did you fail again?

807
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,240
This drug is useless again.

808
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,240
I'm afraid that we can't find

809
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,240
the silver goods' substitute drugs.

810
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,240
I will find them.

811
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,240
I will find them.

812
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,240
I will find them.

813
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,240
I have found the silver goods.

814
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,240
Dr. Mei, please don't give up.

815
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,240
Continue to take the medicine.

816
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,240
You have too much poison in your body.

817
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,240
And the poison of the antidote,

818
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,240
don't talk about taking the medicine.

819
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,240
You may die of poison at any time.

820
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,240
Prime Minister,

821
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,240
is it really worth it

822
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,240
to be so unworthy?

823
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,240
It's worth it.

824
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,240
It's worth it.

825
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,240
Lv Houchi,

826
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,240
you are the son of my father.

827
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,240
Tomorrow, you will be paid

828
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,240
for your death.

829
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,240
The flower blooms, you know nothing

830
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,240
The beauty of the flower can't be ignored

831
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:02,240
The flower falls, the north wind blows

832
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,240
The city is in a mess, like a poem

833
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,240
The petals are wet with the rain

834
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:12,240
The heart is broken, the end is near

835
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:15,240
The flower falls, the tears fall

836
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,240
The flower falls, the tears fall

837
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,240
The flower falls, the tears fall

838
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,240
The flower falls, the tears fall

839
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:26,240
The heart is torn, there is no where to go

840
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:39,240
The will is struggling in the mud

841
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:46,240
Regret is killing in despair

842
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,240
The flower is withered, the heart is broken

843
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,240
No more need to tell

844
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,240
How to love

845
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,240
Love crazily

846
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,240
Love crazily

847
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,240

Love crazily

Love crazily

851

Love crazily

852

Love crazily

853

Love crazily

854

Love crazily

855

Love crazily

856

Love crazily

857

Love crazily

Love crazily

Love crazily

Love crazily

861

Love crazily

862
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,240
Love crazily

863
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,240
Love crazily

864
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,240
Love crazily

865
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,240
Love crazily

866
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,240
Love crazily

867
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,240
Love crazily

868

Love crazily

869
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,240
Love crazily

870
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,240
Love crazily
