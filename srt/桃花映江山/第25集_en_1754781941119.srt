(Adapted from the novel "Peach Blossoms
Reflecting the River and Mountains")

16
00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:40,980
(by Bai Lu Cheng Shuang)

17
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,900
=Episode 25=

18
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,440
(Examination Hall)

19
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,080
Easy, easy.

20
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,210
Be careful with that.

21
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,160
Put it over there.

22
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:56,980
Yes, that's the spot.

23
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:58,080
Put

24
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,560
three tables on that side.

25
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,890
That one. Turn it sideways.

26
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,200
Yes, like that.

27
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,770
Wang Xi.

28
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,070
- Hey, Wang Xi.
- That's right.

29
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,840
Yes, Your Highness.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,530
Go prepare some rations.

31
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:10,880
These candidates have come
from all over the country.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,530
Especially those from poor families,

33
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,000
some might not have eaten a thing.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,640
I'll also set up a barrel
of spring water.

35
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,580
They can drink with a ladle
if they're thirsty,

36
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,970
and take food as needed.

37
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,650
That sounds like a good plan.

38
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,580
Go on and get everything ready.

39
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,320
Yes, Your Highness.

40
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,360
I'll see to it right away.

41
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:28,860
Come with me.

42
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,990
Make sure there's enough food
for all the examinees.

43
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:44,860
You go ahead.

44
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,580
Stick to the plan.

45
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:57,900
Don't stop me.

46
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,420
Hu, think this through.

47
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,770
I said, don't stop me!

48
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,300
If I don't stand up,

49
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,460
who will?

50
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,530
Hu, what about your family?

51
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,000
It's because of them

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,490
that I can no longer keep this quiet.

53
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:10,420
Li,

54
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,650
if you stop me again,

55
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,740
don't blame me for forsaking
our years of friendship.

56
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,650
What are you two doing?

57
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,480
Why are you arguing
in front of the exam hall?

58
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,620
You two barely study to begin with,

59
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,530
and now you're spreading rumors?

60
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:23,740
You're just afraid of failing.

61
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,370
So you're stirring up trouble

62
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,680
and bringing others down with you.

63
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,340
What did you say?

64
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,020
What do you think you're doing,
shouting in the examination hall?

65
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:30,650
Just leave.

66
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:31,900
I...

67
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,900
Just go.

68
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,460
Excuse me, mister.

69
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:43,650
Your Highness.

70
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,970
What were you arguing about just now?

71
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,370
Lately, there have been rumors

72
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,370
about Prince Wuhen selling
exam questions.

73
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,900
But there's no proof.

74
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,140
It's taken years to reopen
the imperial examination.

75
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,940
We can't let it all fall apart
over hearsay.

76
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,020
How about this?

77
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,770
Then do your best to prepare.

78
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,180
I'll look into

79
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:04,530
this matter.

80
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:19,180
(Chunyue Pavilion)

81
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,100
Little lady, are you drunk already?

82
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,370
Come on, drink more.

83
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,180
Your friend isn't here yet.

84
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,660
Forget about him.

85
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,180
If you don't like the food or wine,

86
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:33,930
I will replace everything for you.

87
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,220
Money's not a problem for me.

88
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,930
Your Highness,
you're so dashing and generous.

89
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:47,810
Wuhen.

90
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,570
Your Highness.

91
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,450
Oh, Wuxia.

92
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:58,810
What brings you here?

93
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,690
Ladies, could you give us a moment?

94
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,330
Why should they leave?

95
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,490
There's nothing here to hide.

96
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:12,570
Besides,

97
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,570
with a beauty like this in my arms,

98
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,300
I can even put up

99
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,810
with your pompous talk.

100
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,860
You two, leave us.

101
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,930
I need to talk to my brother.

102
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,660
Mu Wuhen,

103
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,690
do you know what crime you've committed

104
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,130
for selling the exam questions?

105
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,480
Mu Wuxia, who do you think you are?

106
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,720
- Let's go.
- Coming in here to throw your weight around?

107
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,780
Someone's messing
with the integrity of the exams.

108
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:12,810
Of course, I'll step in.

109
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,380
(Examination Hall)

110
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:23,930
Next.

111
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,420
Sir,

112
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,370
I'm Li Dian, styled Kui'an.

113
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,250
From Qufu.

114
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,660
Words alone are no evidence.

115
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,060
Where's the travel slip issued
by your commanding official?

116
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,010
Next.

117
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:39,810
Next.

118
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,370
Only half a slip?

119
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,130
I can't even read the writing.

120
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:45,980
It's invalid.

121
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:47,130
Move along.

122
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:50,540
(Li Dian, Scholar of Humble Origins)
Sir, I was robbed on the road.

123
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,130
They took everything.

124
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,420
I risked my life

125
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,890
to grab back my slip.

126
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,980
That's how it was torn in half.

127
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,450
I'm not afraid of being laughed at.

128
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,370
- But I begged all the way here.
- Next.

129
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,080
I don't care
if you flew here on a crane.

130
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,440
I only care if you have your slip.

131
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,180
One that is not torn, get it?

132
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,660
It has been twenty years.

133
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,740
I finally have the opportunity
to retake the exam.

134
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,100
The people in my village
are counting on me.

135
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,570
If I can't sit the exam,

136
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:17,180
how will I ever face them again, sir?

137
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:18,570
That's your problem,

138
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,780
not mine.

139
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,660
I'm only a clerk.

140
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,130
Don't call me "sir."

141
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:24,690
Move along now.

142
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:25,490
Sir...

143
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:26,370
Don't waste time.

144
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,370
Sir, is there a way...

145
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:27,930
Next.

146
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,180
This slip is not fake, sir.

147
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:30,740
Next.

148
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,370
I...

149
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:44,860
Excuse me, mister.

150
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:46,890
Could you explain

151
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,120
what Laozi meant

152
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,010
by "Heaven and Earth show no mercy,
treating everything as insignificant"?

153
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:52,490
What do you think it means?

154
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,010
This is from the Dao De Jing,

155
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,420
Chapter Five.

156
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,250
It means that the world is abiding

157
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,930
by natural law,

158
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,920
favoring no one

159
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,220
and letting things grow freely.

160
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,130
Though it sounds merciless,

161
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,370
it reflects the truth of nature.

162
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,690
The Dao follows its course

163
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,740
without interference.

164
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:14,660
Well said.

165
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,180
You're too kind.

166
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,690
I'm only a poor scholar
from the countryside

167
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,930
with little learning.

168
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,890
And now I can't even take the exam.

169
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,300
Who says you can't?

170
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,740
But my slip...

171
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,380
This exam is to select talent,

172
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,090
not to chase slips of paper.

173
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,260
Wang Xi.

174
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:49,260
Yes?

175
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:50,540
Someone,

176
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:51,610
take him away.

177
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,090
Have mercy, Your Highness.

178
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:57,640
Make sure Li Dian's name

179
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,060
- is registered.
- Your Highness.

180
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,060
Yes, Prince Wuxia.

181
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,610
You haven't taken the exam,
nor earned a title.

182
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:08,420
I can't accept such a formal bow.

183
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:09,380
Prince Wuxia.

184
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,780
Even if I fail this time,

185
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,180
I'll return to retake the exam.

186
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,180
From this day on,
I consider you my patron.

187
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:18,260
You...

188
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:23,900
Then it's a promise.

189
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,330
If you all truly have talent,

190
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:28,690
I, Mu Wuxia,

191
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,260
will be your patron.

192
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,330
All I ask is that, when you enter court,

193
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,680
you remain upright, loyal,

194
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,280
serve the country with all your heart,

195
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,900
and bring peace and prosperity to Qi.

196
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:41,090
Prince Wuxia.

197
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,540
If I'm ever appointed,

198
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,610
I'll be a beacon of integrity.

199
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,660
I won't let you down.

200
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,890
- We will do the same.
- We will do the same.

201
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,330
Imperial Guards! Make way!

202
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:11,380
Prince Wuxia.

203
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,020
What brings the Imperial Guards here?

204
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,480
By His Majesty's order,

205
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,280
you are to return to the residence
and refrain from receiving visitors.

206
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:21,210
Father?

207
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,900
Last night, Prince Wuhen was found dead.

208
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,180
A report claims you were involved.

209
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:41,380
Your Majesty,

210
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,090
Prince Wuhen

211
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,690
was my sister's only remaining son.

212
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:48,060
For the sake
of the Qin family's loyalty,

213
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:52,810
I beg Your Majesty
to punish Prince Wuxia.

214
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,090
Look at me.

215
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,380
Tell me.

216
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,210
Did you see Wuxia kill him?

217
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:16,090
The matter is under investigation.

218
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,140
Your Majesty,

219
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:19,900
multiple witnesses confirm

220
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,850
that the two princes had an argument.

221
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,020
Wuhen was found dead
in a tavern soon after.

222
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,090
Your Majesty,
please seek justice for Wuhen

223
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:29,780
and punish Prince Wuxia.

224
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:35,300
May Your Majesty see this
with clear judgment.

225
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,900
- May Your Majesty issue an edict
- May Your Majesty issue an edict

226
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,800
- and bring the culprit to justice.
- and bring the culprit to justice.

227
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,780
I've already lost one son.

228
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,140
Now, you're asking me

229
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,210
to give up another?

230
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,810
Get out. All of you.

231
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,610
If you don't leave,

232
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,570
I'll see you executed first!

233
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:35,850
Your Majesty.

234
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,140
Your Majesty.

235
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,420
Quick. Bring my pills!

236
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:43,810
The pills.

237
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:45,180
Yes, Your Majesty.

238
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,090
Wuhen.

239
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:53,780
Wuhen...

240
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,210
Wuhen...

241
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:20,300
Your Majesty.

242
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,300
Wuhen

243
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,730
may not have been the most capable.

244
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,970
But he was still my son.

245
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,020
First, it was Wugou.

246
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:40,540
Now,

247
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:41,690
it's Wuhen.

248
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:44,020
One by one, they're all gone.

249
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:49,420
I call myself "the lonely king"
every day.

250
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:52,260
Will I end up truly alone,

251
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:57,020
with no one left to call my own?

252
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,060
How could that be?

253
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,420
Your Majesty,

254
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,810
you still have me.

255
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,380
Luckily, I still have you.

256
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,060
Your Majesty, the Left Chancellor
requests an audience.

257
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,210
I will not see him.

258
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,180
Your Majesty,

259
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,570
he's your most trusted official.

260
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:28,690
How can you not see him?

261
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:38,260
He must have come for Wuxia.

262
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:40,970
My dear,

263
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,180
this fratricide

264
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,730
must not go unpunished.

265
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,420
Or else Qi will fall.

266
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:51,900
Let him in.

267
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,020
Go on ahead.

268
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,570
Then I'll take my leave first.

269
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,380
Bring my pills.

270
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,020
Here it is, Your Majesty.

271
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:36,500
You may go.

272
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,930
Summon the Left Chancellor.

273
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,210
Greetings, Your Majesty.

274
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:52,140
Do you know of the tragedy
that befell the Zhao State?

275
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:54,930
I do not.

276
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,420
In the chaos of the Five Kingdoms,

277
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,810
the Zhao State was the strongest.

278
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,080
But their royal family destroyed itself
through infighting.

279
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,780
Eventually, with no heirs left,

280
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,300
the state was divided.

281
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,500
Indeed, fratricide is truly
the greatest tragedy.

282
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,730
But from what I know of Prince Wuxia,

283
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,570
he would never do such a thing.

284
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,020
And yet so many have testified.

285
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,810
Are you here trying

286
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,560
to protect a wolf in sheep's clothing?

287
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,420
I've taken many lives
of such people in my day.

288
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,380
I don't dare dispute Your Majesty.

289
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,140
But this case is riddled with suspicion.

290
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,300
May I interrogate Prince Wuxia myself?

291
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,520
I've already ordered

292
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,120
that no one is to enter his residence
or seek audience with him.

293
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,260
Then may I at least assist
with the investigation?

294
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,380
You can't be distracted now.

295
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,300
The imperial exam is near,

296
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,180
and Wuyin has only just been appointed.

297
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:38,810
Go and assist him.

298
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:40,970
Prince Wuyin?

299
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,800
I've appointed him
as the chief examiner.

300
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,610
Meng Zhongyan is reinstated
to his former post

301
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,090
and appointed as a co-examiner

302
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:49,930
to assist Wuyin in overseeing
the imperial examinations.

303
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:53,570
You may go.

304
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,330
Yes, Your Majesty.

305
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:08,520
(Shen Residence)

306
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,220
If we can't see Prince Wuxia,
we won't be able to find out the truth.

307
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,150
The investigation will be all
the more difficult.

308
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,980
We have to investigate,
however hard it gets.

309
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,090
There's no way
Prince Wuxia is the killer.

310
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:20,540
Should we go to the scene now

311
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:21,700
and look for clues?

312
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:22,410
No.

313
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,470
The Imperial Guards
have already intervened in this matter.

314
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,170
They are on high alert during the day.

315
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,610
We can go tonight.

316
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,130
For now, let the word out

317
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,170
that I'm too busy with the exam

318
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:34,130
to receive guests.

319
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,540
We must uncover the truth

320
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,780
before the exams begin.

321
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,130
If we don't, all our efforts

322
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,500
will be in vain.

323
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,300
Understood. I'll go now.

324
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,860
(Meng Residence)

325
00:17:58,330 --> 00:17:59,020
Ms. Zhenzhen.

326
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,300
Search the place.

327
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:24,400
Zhenzhen, what's going on?

328
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,890
If you needed something from me,

329
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,170
a message would have sufficed.

330
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,800
Why bring your noble feet
into my lowly courtyard?

331
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,230
Does Prince Wuhen's death
have anything to do with you?

332
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:33,940
That was His Majesty's son.

333
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,220
Even if I have the courage,

334
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,500
I wouldn't dare do such a thing.

335
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,480
Then why were you sneaking
around Chunyue Pavilion

336
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,800
and slipping away just as quietly?

337
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,410
Prince Wuhen died that night.

338
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,650
I'm sure you've heard

339
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,060
it was Prince Wuxia
who barged into the tavern

340
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,920
and fought with Prince Wuhen that night.

341
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,330
In a moment of rage,
he accidentally killed Prince Wuhen.

342
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,460
So, was it really a gentleman's fury

343
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,940
that turned deadly?

344
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,410
What are you hiding in your hand?

345
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,330
Nothing.

346
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,740
Where did you get this?

347
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,890
Are you trying to ruin the Meng family?

348
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:21,650
No, I'm not.

349
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,940
It's only a plain jade pendant.

350
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:35,260
"Regret not the past,

351
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,570
take righteousness as profit."

352
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:54,020
Congratulations on your new role
as the Chief Examiner.

353
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,650
And to Right Chancellor Meng
for his reinstatement too.

354
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,740
The Mengs rise once more
to lead the noble clans.

355
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:01,500
Have a seat.

356
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,650
You know I prefer peace and quiet.

357
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,940
Your father will bear much

358
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,980
of the burden of this exam.

359
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,500
The Meng family stands ready
to serve Your Highness.

360
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,130
We trust you'll watch over us in return.

361
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,460
"A gift from heaven unclaimed
brings misfortune,

362
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,780
a chance ignored becomes a curse.

363
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,260
Miss the moment,

364
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:35,410
and you'll pay the price."

365
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,890
Wuhen and I

366
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:41,850
were always close.

367
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,300
Wuxia may be my brother too.

368
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,740
But he has completely lost his mind.

369
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,780
I won't let anyone clear his name.

370
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:01,460
As for that lowly pawn
who got caught in the crossfire,

371
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,090
I assume I don't need to spell out

372
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,740
what should be done?

373
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,460
Your Highness,

374
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,460
there's one more thing that troubles me.

375
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:27,090
Speak.

376
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,370
From what I've gathered,

377
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:32,090
this exam only happened

378
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,170
thanks to Shen Zaiye,

379
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,540
not Prince Wuxia.

380
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,810
I still suspect Li Jiaohan's case

381
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:41,650
is linked to him.

382
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,300
So

383
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,810
I believe Shen Zaiye and Prince Wuxia

384
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,980
have some secret connection.

385
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,370
A valid point.

386
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,940
But don't worry.

387
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,330
I already have someone watching him.

388
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:01,700
You planted a spy?

389
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:04,060
By Shen Zaiye's side?

390
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:05,940
Let me tell you a secret.

391
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:10,330
Jiang Taohua is currently staying
in my residence.

392
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,980
Princess Chengping? In your residence?

393
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,220
It's just as you have predicted.

394
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,090
Shen Zaiye came to rescue her.

395
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:24,410
Jiang Taohua,

396
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,650
I knew you wouldn't die so easily.

397
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:29,460
What's the next step, Master?

398
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:34,260
Why would Jiang Taohua remain
at Prince Wuyin's residence?

399
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,540
She hit her head
when she fell from a cliff.

400
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,570
She is still mentally disoriented

401
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,810
and has lost her memories.

402
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:49,220
Now she follows my every word.

403
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:10,780
Your Highness,

404
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,650
why did you summon me?

405
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:14,890
Sit.

406
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,300
Miss Meng,

407
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,020
I have a task for you.

408
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,940
At your command, Your Highness.

409
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,260
You've been resting for months.

410
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,650
Wouldn't it be nice

411
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,370
to stretch your legs a little?

412
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,020
A major event has shaken the court.

413
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,410
My brother Wuxia has murdered Wuhen.

414
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,940
There are witnesses
and concrete evidence.

415
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,850
There's no turning it around.

416
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:48,890
But Shen Zaiye will not let it go.

417
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,090
He'll look into it.

418
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,170
I want to know what he finds.

419
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:54,540
So I need you

420
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,570
to get close to him.

421
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,740
If there's any sign of movement,

422
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,220
report back to me immediately.

423
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,540
(Prince Wuxia would never kill
his own brother.)

424
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,460
(But why is Prince Wuyin so sure)

425
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:11,300
(Shen Zaiye will try to clear his name?)

426
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,650
What? You can't do it?

427
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:18,460
No, it's not that.

428
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,890
I was just thinking

429
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,300
it's been months since we last met.

430
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,330
Getting close to him now

431
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,160
without raising suspicion won't be easy.

432
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:31,410
His sister, Xiang Qingying,

433
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,260
is simple-minded.

434
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,370
And she's grown quite close to Wuxia.

435
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:38,740
I suppose

436
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:41,940
she might be the key.

437
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,850
Thank you for the guidance,
Your Highness.

438
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:01,700
Mu Wuxia, I swear I'll get you out.

439
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:03,610
Qingying.

440
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:14,810
Jiang Taohua? What are you doing here?

441
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:17,170
I want to visit Qingtai
at the Chancellor's residence.

442
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:20,780
Are...

443
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:23,810
Are you crying?

444
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,060
Jiang Taohua,

445
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,740
do you know

446
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,170
Mu Wuxia has been wrongly accused
of killing Prince Wuhen?

447
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,640
He's now locked up in his residence,

448
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,320
completely cut off
from the outside world.

449
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,370
Prince Wuxia?

450
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,330
You know him, Qingying?

451
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,410
Not just me.

452
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:43,940
You knew him too.

453
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,460
But you don't remember anymore.

454
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,810
Mu Wuxia always looked out for you

455
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,460
and helped you more than once.

456
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,170
After you fell off the cliff,

457
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:58,500
he even stood up for you

458
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:00,390
and had a big argument
with my brother over it.

459
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:05,090
I've heard
that Prince Wuxia is a man of honor.

460
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,650
It turns out to be true.

461
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,410
Since I have received kindness from him,

462
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,700
I cannot stand by and do nothing.

463
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,330
Wherever you're going,

464
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,300
I'm coming with you.

465
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,460
Jiang Taohua,

466
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:21,130
I didn't expect you to be so loyal.

467
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,060
I was on my way to see him.

468
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,610
Where?

469
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:29,020
Zaiye said
His Majesty gave strict orders.

470
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:31,370
No one is allowed to see Mu Wuxia.

471
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:33,220
But

472
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:35,700
no one can stop me and my sword.

473
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:37,020
Qingying,

474
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,740
barging into Prince Wuxia's residence

475
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,410
will only make things worse for him.

476
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:43,570
How about this?

477
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,700
We go and check the scene of the crime.

478
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,850
Maybe we'll find something useful.

479
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:49,570
What matters now

480
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,260
is to clear Prince Wuxia's name.

481
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:53,700
You have a point. Let's go.

482
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:54,920
I know where it happened.

483
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,740
- Come.
- Let's go.

484
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,500
(Chunyue Pavilion)

485
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:14,650
Who's there?

486
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,170
(What are they doing here?)

487
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,460
There's a noise by the river.

488
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,570
You two, check it out.

489
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:33,410
Yes, sir.

490
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:34,980
Let's go.

491
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,090
Let's use the back entrance.

492
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,090
Stop right there.

493
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:08,410
Zaiye?

494
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,130
Have you been following us?

495
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,780
Zaiye, say something.

496
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,260
Didn't I tell you to stay home

497
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:27,020
and stay out of this?

498
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,410
Mu Wuxia's still locked up.

499
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:30,850
How am I supposed to sit still?

500
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,570
And

501
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,260
what are you two doing here?

502
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,260
I just snuck out of the residence

503
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,020
and hadn't gone far

504
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,780
when I ran into her looking for Qingtai.

505
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:45,460
I told her what happened.

506
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:51,260
Zaiye, the moment she heard
Prince Wuxia was in trouble,

507
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,240
she insisted on helping.

508
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,740
So, how could I back out?

509
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,090
Besides, we came here
to look for evidence.

510
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,570
It can help to clear Mu Wuxia's name.

511
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,880
We're not here to cause trouble.

512
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,670
Even the Princess knew
to dress in disguise.

513
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,460
But you?
Just strutting around like this?

514
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:11,020
Zaiye, are you taking us with you?

515
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:14,850
Then wait for me.

516
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,130
I'll go with you.

517
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:17,740
Miss Meng.

518
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,170
Greetings, Chancellor Shen.

519
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,090
It's been a while.

520
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:29,220
Miss Meng,

521
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,810
have you remembered something?

522
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,780
Why do you say that, Chancellor Shen?

523
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,460
Do you remember

524
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:38,740
Prince Wuxia?

525
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,020
Qingying told me

526
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,720
Prince Wuxia helped me many times.

527
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,260
Of course, I'd want to return the favor.

528
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,650
But you're willing to help

529
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,500
just based on what you heard?

530
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,370
Chancellor Shen,
are you interrogating me?

531
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:55,440
Of course not.

532
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,230
Then I don't see the need
to explain myself.

533
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:01,570
Go home.

534
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,810
You shouldn't get involved in this mess.

535
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,410
I know exactly what I'm doing.

536
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:08,410
I don't need you to tell me

537
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:09,740
what I should or shouldn't do.

538
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:12,570
We clearly can't see eye to eye.

539
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,840
So there's no point in talking.

540
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,370
Very well.

541
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:21,940
In that case,

542
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:24,460
I'll go ahead first.

543
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:56,610
Where is he?

544
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,500
He has already left.

545
00:30:58,810 --> 00:30:59,850
We're splitting up.

546
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,220
Did you two argue?

547
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:02,700
Qingying.

548
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:04,480
Whatever happened between me

549
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,740
and the Chancellor in the past

550
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,260
is already in the past.

551
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:08,610
We're just strangers now.

552
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:11,090
How did you two end up like this?

553
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:12,540
Let's go.

554
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:51,130
(Prince Wuhen must've hit his head.)

555
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,810
(That's why there's so much blood.)

556
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:58,700
(These are...)

557
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,260
(Fingernail scratches.)

558
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,170
(He struggled before he died.)

559
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,650
(Prince Wuxia
has never been good at fighting,)

560
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:09,810
(and Prince Wuhen was much bigger.)

561
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:12,300
(If they fought, Wuxia would've lost.)

562
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,130
My brother must be inside.

563
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:20,780
Let's go in.

564
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:29,370
Zaiye, did you leave this door open
for us on purpose?

565
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:53,570
So, is this where Prince Wuhen was killed?

566
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,700
Mu Wuxia is not even strong enough.

567
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,330
So he couldn't have killed Prince Wuhen.

568
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:12,570
(There's blood.)

569
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:14,740
(But no signs of a fight.)

570
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,460
(Prince Wuhen)

571
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,810
(must have been attacked)

572
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:19,330
(when he wasn't expecting it.)

573
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,700
(These footprints)

574
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:48,060
(must be from the killer escaping.)

575
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,090
(The dancer from that night said)

576
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:53,370
(Prince Wuxia left through
the front door.)

577
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:55,500
Who's inside?

578
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,570
There's a light upstairs.
Go and check it out.

579
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:06,700
You, over there.

580
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:07,370
Yes, sir.

581
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:09,650
Bring more men.

582
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:10,560
Follow me.

583
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,500
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

584
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:48,340
(Shunjing Residence)

585
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,020
Your Highness,

586
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,940
I followed Shen Zaiye to the scene,

587
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:53,380
and I found a broken piece

588
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,540
of a jade pendant.

589
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,060
A broken jade piece?

590
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:57,690
What kind?

591
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,730
Something about this size.

592
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,060
All right.

593
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,500
Thank you for your hard work.

594
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,960
You should return and get some rest.

595
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,020
Yes, Your Highness.

596
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:29,770
(Hua,)

597
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:32,130
(once I've cleared the path for you,)

598
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:34,420
(you'll come back to me.)

599
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:35,650
(Right?)

600
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:42,340
