00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The Northern Courtyard of the State

4
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
is suffering from the great Qi's fatigue

5
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
and the border is not only cut off by the soldiers,

6
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
but also the people are suffering.

7
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Today, the Emperor is sick

8
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
and the Crown Prince is still young.

9
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
His this coven has a wish now.

10
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The connect will take his leave soon.

11
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,800
No matter now whether he runs away

12
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,320
or to return,

13
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,920
I will be by your side in the future.

14
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:14,000
We can decide who can return by winning his heart or not

15
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,080
in what condition.

16
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,600
That's why, tomorrow ...

17
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,200
Oh, Lord.

18
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,600
Please villain Get ready.

19
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,880
Good guns and arrows.

20
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,880
I was trapped in this deep palace for 18 years.

21
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,880
I never thought I could leave the palace alive.

22
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,480
The past is in the past.

23
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,880
The peach blossoms will surely come to repay me.

24
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,080
This is bad! This is bad!

25
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,280
The Cold Palace is on fire!

26
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,480
The Crown Prince has finally disappeared!

27
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,480
If we can't find him,

28
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,480
we'll all die!

29
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,480
A-Li, San Chi, search!

30
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,480
Search!

31
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,680
No!

32
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,680
No!

33
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,280
Look over there!

34
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,480
No!

35
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,880
Be careful!

36
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,680
Where is he?

37
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,280
No!

38
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,880
No!

39
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,280
Idiot!

40
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,880
Her Highness said she was going to live!

41
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,480
Let's go over there and take a look.

42
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,880
Go!

43
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,520
Fortunately, A-Qi prepared a

44
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,880
flashback bomb.

45
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,280
Otherwise, we would have died.

46
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,280
Let's not talk about it anymore.

47
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,280
Let's go.

48
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,280
Let's go.

49
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,880
A-Qi,

50
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,880
I still can't understand

51
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,280
why Father agreed to send people to Qinghe.

52
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,280
The other sentries

53
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,880
have not yet been authorized.

54
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,880
Why is it not important anymore?

55
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,680
Let's go.

56
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,880
Hurry.

57
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,880
Hurry.

58
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,680
A-Qi,

59
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,880
it's Zhao Guang.

60
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,080
It's so beautiful.

61
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,880
Chang Jun,

62
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,480
if we cross the river,

63
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,880
we can live a free and peaceful life.

64
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,280
Let's go.

65
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,080
A-Qi,

66
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,080
let's go.

67
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,280
Chang Jun!

68
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,080
A-Qi,

69
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,080
why did you take Chang Jun away?

70
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,480
Don't blame me.

71
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,480
A-Qi, let's go.

72
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,880
Don't make any noise.

73
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,880
Hurry.

74
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,480
Oh, no.

75
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,480
They found us.

76
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,080
Chang Jun,

77
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,480
run.

78
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,880
Don't worry, A-Qi.

79
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,880
Hurry.

80
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,480
Mother,

81
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,280
it's all my fault.

82
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,880
It has nothing to do with others.

83
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,080
Please punish me.

84
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,080
Please let Chang Jun go.

85
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,080
Is it Pan Zheng?

86
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,880
Yes.

87
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,880
He's the one who killed A-Qi.

88
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,880
Isn't it?

89
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,680
The state preceptor said

90
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,680
Chang Jun is in his early years.

91
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,080
He's been training in the army

92
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,280
and has improved a lot.

93
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,080
I'm very grateful.

94
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,680
The peace talks are going on.

95
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,480
If the war starts again,

96
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,480
Chang Jun will be the crown prince

97
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,080
as the crown prince.

98
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,080
Tell the soldiers

99
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,080
to train the crown prince.

100
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,680
Please let me in.

101
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,880
Mother,

102
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,480
Chang Jun has been in the palace for a long time.

103
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,480
He hasn't learned from his teacher.

104
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,280
He's totally ignorant

105
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,280
about the military war.

106
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,880
I'm afraid he's mistaken

107
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,880
and has made a big mistake.

108
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,080
I was wrong about the past.

109
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,520
I'm willing to

110
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,880
go to the peace talks with him

111
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,480
to exchange my body for peace

112
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,280
and share my burden with you.

113
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,880
He Qingshi entered the palace

114
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,880
and made many contacts with the courtiers.

115
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,880
We've got good news

116
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,880
to inform the North Court.

117
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,480
If someone finds out,

118
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,480
no one will save you.

119
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,080
Think it over before you say it.

120
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,280
I'm sorry, Mother.

121
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,280
I'm sorry.

122
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,680
I shouldn't have done it.

123
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,880
I shouldn't have done it.

124
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,080
I shouldn't have done it.

125
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,680
I shouldn't have done it.

126
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,680
I shouldn't have done it.

127
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,280
I'm willing to do anything

128
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,280
for the people of the North Court.

129
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,880
But Chang Jun

130
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,880
please take back Chang Jun.

131
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,480
Don't worry.

132
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,480
As long as you're obedient,

133
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,480
I'll report to Chang Jun

134
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,080
that he's fine in the army.

135
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,080
Let me go.

136
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,680
Chang Jun.

137
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,480
Let me go.

138
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,280
Let me go.

139
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,480
Chang Jun.

140
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,680
Chang Jun.

141
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,080
Let me go.

142
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:22,680
Chang Jun.

143
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,680
Chang Jun.

144
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,680
Chang Jun.

145
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:25,880
Let me go.

146
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,880
Chang Jun.

147
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,680
Let me go, Chang Jun.

148
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,880
Chang Jun.

149
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,680
Chang Jun.

150
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,080
Chang...

151
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,680
Chang Jun.

152
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,680
Chang Jun.

153
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:44,680
Chang Jun.

154
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,280
Chang Jun.

155
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:45,580
Chang Jun.

156
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,480
Chang Jun, let me go.

157
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,280
Chang Jun.

158
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,480
Chang Jun.

159
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,520
Chang Juan!

160
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,000
Ah Jie!

161
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,400
Live on!

162
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,440
Chang Juan,

163
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,160
although we're separated today,

164
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,440
as long as you keep your promise to Ah Jie,

165
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,600
and live on,

166
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,080
we'll meet again.

167
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,400
Your Highness,

168
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,560
we're at the border of Qi.

169
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,320
I wonder what's going on with the royal family of Qi.

170
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,720
It's better for them to be born innocent.

171
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,760
How can there be innocent people

172
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,760
in the royal family?

173
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,640
The Seventh Prince has four sons.

174
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,200
And I'm going to marry the Seventh Prince.

175
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,200
My mother died young.

176
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,880
And I can't be loved by the Seventh Prince.

177
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,080
I was sent to the new palace at the age of three.

178
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,080
I'll die by myself.

179
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,760
I wonder if the Seventh Prince

180
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,760
can protect you from the heat.

181
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,440
I'm afraid it's difficult.

182
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,360
Qi has been built for only a hundred years.

183
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,920
The family of the Seventh Prince

184
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,720
is still young and rich.

185
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,040
The Crown Prince

186
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,920
is the first of the Qi family, the Meng family.

187
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,840
And the second is the Qin family.

188
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,320
They support the second prince,

189
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,840
born by Concubine Qin.

190
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,520
They fight inside and out of the court.

191
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,000
The Seventh Prince is unreliable.

192
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,480
If he fails,

193
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,720
I'll be in trouble if I marry him.

194
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,360
And there's another key person

195
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,040
behind the crown prince's struggle.

196
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,920
The Left Prime Minister, Shen Zaiye.

197
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,000
He's from a poor family.

198
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,920
Ten years ago, the Seventh Prince was killed by the South.

199
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,640
He was born in the old family.

200
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,000
Since then, he has been loved by the Seventh Prince.

201
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,920
He's been a good man all the way.

202
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,800
Now he's just a child.

203
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,440
He can be the left prime minister now?

204
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,480
I heard he's very cruel.

205
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,480
He's not good at what he does.

206
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,960
Prime Minister, it's not safe here.

207
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,960
Don't let anyone get in.

208
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,680
Prime Minister,

209
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,960
the Xishu family is here.

210
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,760
In our Chou Mo's property,

211
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,800
besides the ordinary gold and silver jewels,

212
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,080
we also found a lot of money.

213
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,520
Shameless!

214
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,840
The money

215
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,360
was clearly mixed up

216
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,560
when you were searching for it.

217
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,240
What you said

218
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,920
makes me confused.

219
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,760
I've been searching for the money all the way.

220
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,400
I have solid evidence.

221
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,800
It seems that you don't need any means.

222
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:50,000
I'm afraid you don't know my power.

223
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,600
No!

224
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,600
Father!

225
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,760
Master!

226
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,760
The Seventh Prince!

227
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,560
Master!

228
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,200
The Seventh Prince!

229
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,360
How dare you kill the court official!

230
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,600
The soup is not poisonous.

231
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,480
It's just hot soup.

232
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,200
You're anxious.

233
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,000
How can you blame me?

234
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,400
The crime is a crime.

235
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,400
You're a big traitor!

236
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,400
You're a traitor!

237
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,600
Since you know I'm a traitor,

238
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,800
how can you expect me to be just and honest?

239
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,800
You're reasonable.

240
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,600
Mr. Peng,

241
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:49,200
it will be your fault.

242
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,400
Otherwise,

243
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:57,000
your whole family will be surrounded by power alone.

244
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Your stomach will be full of을

245
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,680
and even death.

246
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,700
That scene

247
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,100
isvent empty feeling.

248
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,600
Your father

249
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,280
Look.

250
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,440
Prime Minister,

251
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,840
there are so many corrupt officials in the court.

252
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,520
Why do we have to blame it on Peng Si?

253
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,560
Although Peng Si is not a corrupt official,

254
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,880
he likes to seduce women.

255
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,440
He can't find the chance to punish women.

256
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,640
It's best to use him as a bait

257
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,000
to lure him.

258
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,480
Let's go.

259
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,200
Let's go to the hook.

260
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,920
If what the Princess said yesterday

261
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,680
was wrong,

262
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,600
how could she be the Prime Minister?

263
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,040
On the contrary,

264
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,920
this is what she's good at.

265
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,360
The four princes are adults.

266
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,200
The ten families have already been in a team.

267
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,240
There's been an arms seventy

268
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,360
legislature.

269
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,000
Without the imperial council,

270
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,400
Shen Zai Ye forming an army

271
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,880
to ride thena

272
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,000
against a vicious enemy

273
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,680
with his power alone

274
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,840
would earlier be a disaster.

275
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,040
Your Highness,

276
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,080
the Taoist priest on Mount Taichang

277
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,120
calculated the auspicious time.

278
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,880
The Northern Courtyard sent a troop of gold

279
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,200
to enter the city at the wrong time.

280
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,440
How could there be a reason

281
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,640
for a princess to enter the city

282
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,840
at night?

283
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,720
This is the Qi State,

284
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,800
not your Northern Courtyard.

285
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,080
If you say it's wrong,

286
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,080
then it's wrong.

287
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,080
You...

288
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,800
Eunuch Ren,

289
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,200
don't provoke trouble.

290
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,560
The Qi State has its own way of treating guests.

291
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,200
Let's enter the city at the right time.

292
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:07,800
Yes.

293
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,720
Follow the customs and wait until the auspicious time.

294
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,160
Then we'll listen to you.

295
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,680
It's just a horse-riding position.

296
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,480
I'm afraid we won't have a good life

297
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,720
in Qi State in the future.

298
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:39,840
Your Highness,

299
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,920
we finally found you.

300
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,440
The princess is at the gate of the city.

301
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,520
Why are you still here?

302
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,040
What if something goes wrong

303
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,400
in the wedding?

304
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,200
Don't be so nervous.

305
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,440
I'm a prince who grew up in the palace.

306
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,760
It's not an important thing.

307
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,880
Even if something goes wrong,

308
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,680
no one will say anything.

309
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,160
All right.

310
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,280
The wound is healed.

311
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,600
You can fly freely

312
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,000
in the future.

313
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,600
The lovebirds still fly

314
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:16,560
even though they are not you How can I see your...)

315
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,440
You come back after a long stamps

316
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,080
The road to the euro,

317
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,760
happiness and love together

318
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,640
Please come in, my Lord.

319
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,200
We found out that the informant who was investigating the crime

320
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,200
left this matter with the person who took the lead.

321
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,200
This matter is very popular in the Dream House.

322
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,200
I think it's to lure me to meet him.

323
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,200
What is the purpose of his tricking you here?

324
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,200
No matter what the purpose is,

325
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,200
I would like to know the truth.

326
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,200
I'm here to find out the truth.

327
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,200
I'm here to find out the truth.

328
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,200
I'm here to find out the truth.

329
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,200
I'm here to find out the truth.

330
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,200
I'm here to find out the truth.

331
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,200
I'm here to find out the truth.

332
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,200
I'm here to find out the truth.

333
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,200
I'm here to find out the truth.

334
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,200
I'm here to find out the truth.

335
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,200
I'm here to find out the truth.

336
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,200
I'm here to find out the truth.

337
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,200
I'm here to find out the truth.

338
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,200
Qingtan.

339
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,200
Did you hear something?

340
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,200
Don't worry, Your Highness.

341
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,200
I think it's Channin.

342
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,200
Maybe I heard it wrong.

343
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,320
There is something behind us!

344
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,200
There is something, there is something here!

345
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,200
There is something.

346
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,560
However many people are not there,

347
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,200
that act realizes.

348
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,240
Are you ready?

349
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,000
Come forward.

350
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,040
Fire!

351
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,040
Use the fire!

352
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,160
They're afraid of fire!

353
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,160
Use the fire!

354
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,160
Hurry!

355
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:48,760
Use the fire!

356
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,440
Hurry!

357
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,400
Use the fire!

358
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,240
Use the fire!

359
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:56,760
Hurry!

360
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,280
Use the fire!

361
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,240
Hurry!

362
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,240
Use the fire!

363
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,240
Hurry!

364
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,240
Hurry!

365
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,240
Use the fire!

366
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,240
Hurry!

367
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,240
Hurry!

368
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,240
Open the door!

369
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,800
Master said that the body is like a human.

370
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,840
It's not the time yet.

371
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,240
If we all die,

372
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,240
who will be responsible for the crack of the lotus?

373
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:15,840
Masters!

374
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,040
Qian Tan!

375
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,800
They're coming!

376
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,400
Hurry!

377
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,400
They're coming!

378
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,840
Master!

379
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,880
Master!

380
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,880
Hurry!

381
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,880
Close the door!

382
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,880
Close the door!

383
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,880
Be careful, Master!

384
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,880
Master, let's go!

385
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,680
Be careful!

386
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,680
Okay.

387
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,080
Master!

388
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,880
Master!

389
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,880
Master, hurry up!

390
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,880
I'll cover you!

391
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,880
Be careful!

392
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,880
Are you satisfied with the present?

393
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,880
This is the return of one serving the Buddha.

394
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,440
Since it takes on the invitation,

395
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,760
for what you want to give a hand?

396
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,160
I, Xu Heran,

397
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,160
wanted to give Prime Minister a great present.

398
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,000
However, I also want to see

399
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
if Prime Minister is capable

400
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,640
of taking this present.

401
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,060
Allow me to guess.

402
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:37,900
For a few days,

403
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,620
I had a group of enemies

404
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,340
chasing after me.

405
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,380
They ran away.

406
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,100
I wanted to catch a few car drivers

407
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,300
and interrogate them.

408
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,740
But they were all poisoned

409
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,060
and hard to catch.

410
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:00,060
The one who ran away must not want to die.

411
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,340
But he can't live after he's gone.

412
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,500
Luckily, he wanted to use the little bit of his hand

413
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:09,620
to fight for himself.

414
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,260
You're so clear-headed.

415
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,140
I won't go around.

416
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,020
I want to use what you want

417
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,420
to exchange for my whole family's life.

418
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,260
Tell me how to exchange it.

419
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,580
I've been traveling around the world these years.

420
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,780
Leave the names of the rivers

421
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:38,900
on the paper.

422
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,140
Name them as the sun, the wind and the earth.

423
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,100
If you can figure out the details of the map,

424
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,220
I'll let you know.

425
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,100
You're so slow.

426
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,260
Are you worried that I'll be lost

427
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,580
after I get the clue?

428
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,460
I don't dare to say no

429
00:24:58,980 --> 00:24:59,860
to my whole family.

430
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,940
Since you're here to find me,

431
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,220
you should know what I'm doing.

432
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,140
Give me the painting.

433
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,540
Tomorrow,

434
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,540
someone will escort your whole family out of the city.

435
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,860
Thank you, Prime Minister.

436
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,020
Who's there?

437
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,220
Go after them.

438
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:26,780
Yes.

439
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:28,900
What?

440
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,500
Lang Xi?

441
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,340
Yes.

442
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,780
The chief of the city guards reported that

443
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,700
the princess and her maids have been sent to the mortal world

444
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,940
after they entered the city.

445
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,620
Even if they're being attacked,

446
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,180
they should leave some traces.

447
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,300
I'm afraid it's not a natural disaster.

448
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:45,620
Wang Xi.

449
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,180
Arrange a team of people

450
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,420
to go find the princess with me.

451
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:48,940
Yes.

452
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:49,500
Hurry up.

453
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,140
If you don't make the princess

454
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,100
enter the city in time,

455
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,980
she'll be in trouble.

456
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,340
Hit me.

457
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:04,660
Tell me.

458
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,500
Where is the princess?

459
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,540
If you can't find her,

460
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,540
you'll all die.

461
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,220
Why didn't you go find the princess

462
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,180
and hit her maids here?

463
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,100
She didn't even send you in.

464
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,260
Then something happened to her.

465
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,580
It's the chief's fault.

466
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,180
She should be hit.

467
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,100
Brother.

468
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,540
They're both the princess's maids.

469
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,460
They'll be my maids in the future.

470
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,060
Please don't punish them

471
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,660
for my sake.

472
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:59,020
A prince who grew up in the palace.

473
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,980
How can he be so shameless?

474
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,740
But...

475
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,820
For the sake of your wedding today,

476
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:19,540
I'll give you this face.

477
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,340
Just treat it as my gift.

478
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,660
Thank you, brother.

479
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,020
I appreciate it.

480
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,580
But...

481
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,780
The wedding is important.

482
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,620
Please go with me

483
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,060
to find the princess.

484
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,580
Send the order.

485
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,700
Split into teams.

486
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,540
Search the city.

487
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,380
Yes.

488
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,100
Where are you going, sir?

489
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,740
The darkness is coming.

490
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,420
Sir, where are you going?

491
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,820
Sir, don't go.

492
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:00,860
Sir.

493
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,660
Sir.

494
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:04,780
Here.

495
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,500
Let's go.

496
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:41,340
Is this a river-spread

497
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:01,980
volcanic mountain?

498
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,940
Who are you?

499
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,740
Aren't all the guests here

500
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,940
the guests?

501
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,940
Who are you?

502
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:03,940
Let go of me!

503
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,940
I was poisoned with the most powerful poison.

504
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:09,940
Even if you stab me,

505
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:11,940
you won't be able to save yourself.

506
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:15,940
Look at you.

507
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,940
You are not Ziyun.

508
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:20,940
Shoot out everything you know.

509
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:22,940
Shoot out everything you know.

510
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:24,940
Shoot out everything you know.

511
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:26,940
Shoot out everything you know.

512
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:28,940
Shoot out everything you know.

513
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:30,940
Shoot out everything you know.

514
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,940
Shoot out everything you know.

515
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,940
To keep you pure.

516
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:35,940
Otherwise,

517
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,940
I am not a righteous man.

518
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,940
I will take revenge.

519
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:44,940
Others can't do anything to me.

520
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:46,940
She is too wild.

521
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,940
I can't be treated like a human.

522
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:51,940
Don't pretend.

523
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,940
Lord, please look.

524
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,940
This is the princess of the Northern Courtyard,

525
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,940
Princess Chengping.

526
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,940
She looks like a good girl.

527
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:08,940
Not bad.

528
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,940
Who poisoned the Northern Courtyard Princess?

529
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:14,940
And then brought me here?

530
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,940
What a fight.

531
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,940
What a pity that the beauty

532
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:28,940
can only replace the assassin's horse name.

533
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:55,940
Princess.

534
00:31:58,940 --> 00:31:59,940
Princess.

535
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:00,940
Princess.

536
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:01,940
Princess.

537
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:03,940
Princess.

538
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:19,940
Xuanxiang.

539
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:27,940
Why is the Northern Courtyard Princess here?

540
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,940
Princess.

541
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,940
Last night in the Dream House...

542
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:57,940
Nothing happened.

543
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:20,080
But how did the

544
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:24,940
Princess, what's wrong?

545
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,940
The wedding was so big.

546
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,940
Qi State must be in an emergency call

547
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:31,940
to discuss the countermeasures.

548
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:33,940
I am not here.

549
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:35,940
The truth is,

550
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:36,940
of course, up to them.

551
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:39,940
Premier Zuo Shen is also

552
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,940
in the process of peace talks with the two countries.

553
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:42,940
He did such a ridiculous thing

554
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,940
with the Northern Courtyard Princess.

555
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:46,940
I can see that His Majesty

556
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:47,940
is very angry.

557
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,940
I am sorry.

558
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:51,940
I am sorry.

559
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,940
I beg His Majesty to pardon this person

560
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,940
to prove the prestige of our Qi State.

561
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:01,940
I beg His Majesty to value the country

562
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,940
and the people.

563
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:07,940
Listen.

564
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,940
If I don't let you go today,

565
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:11,940
I will become a bad person

566
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,940
who doesn't value the country and the people.

567
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:18,940
I don't know.

568
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:19,940
I thought they came into the Dream House

569
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,940
with me.

570
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:22,940
You still have the heart to joke?

571
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,940
Tell me.

572
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:26,940
Now the court officials are trying to

573
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,940
attack you with their weapons.

574
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:30,940
How do you explain to them?

575
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:33,940
Your Majesty,

576
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:34,940
the bedding can't be self-proclaimed.

577
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:36,940
They don't care about the facts.

578
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:38,940
The more self-proclaimed,

579
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:39,940
the more they can be used as a bait.

580
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:41,940
Since they want to set fire to the mountain,

581
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,940
I will lend them a piece of east wind

582
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:46,940
to make the fire more and more intense

583
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,940
and burn all those evil spirits

584
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:49,940
out of the original form.

585
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:51,940
What do you mean?

586
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:55,940
Your Majesty.

587
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:04,940
You mean

588
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:06,940
the most vicious people

589
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,940
may be involved in the case of the evil money?

590
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,940
Not necessarily.

591
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:11,940
After all,

592
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,940
I have too many enemies.

593
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,940
But

594
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,940
at least I was provided

595
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:17,940
with a reliable criminal.

596
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,940
The evil money is

597
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:22,940
about the national security.

598
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:24,940
Whoever is found,

599
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:26,940
must be punished severely.

600
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:29,940
Yes.

601
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:32,940
Your Highness,

602
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:33,940
you don't have to worry.

603
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:34,940
The King of Qi sent so many soldiers

604
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,940
to protect you.

605
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,940
It doesn't seem to be that bad.

606
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:40,940
Look.

607
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:43,940
Most of these guards

608
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,940
are facing the house.

609
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:47,940
It means that this is not protection.

610
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:48,940
It's not protection.

611
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:50,940
It's guarding.

612
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,940
But...

613
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,940
Your Highness, you are clearly innocent.

614
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:56,940
The truth is not important.

615
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:58,940
What's important is

616
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,940
that they want me to be innocent.

617
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:05,940
The marriage is going to be changed.

618
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:07,940
We have to prepare it as soon as possible.

619
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:12,940
It's a pity

620
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,940
that Your Highness is so innocent.

621
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,940
What's the next step?

622
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:20,940
In the eyes of others,

623
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:21,940
she has lost her innocence.

624
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:22,940
It's impossible

625
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,940
to marry the Fourth Prince.

626
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:26,940
Fortunately, the North Court is asking us

627
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,940
to choose another girl for the marriage.

628
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:32,940
I'm afraid that's the only way.

629
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,940
You go to pass the edict to the Princess.

630
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:40,940
Princess,

631
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:41,940
what are you going to do?

632
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:45,940
Princess,

633
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,940
I have to find a way to see the King of Qi

634
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,940
and keep this marriage.

635
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:50,940
Otherwise,

636
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,940
if I were to be sent back to the North Court,

637
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,940
Changjue and I

638
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:55,940
would be dead.

639
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,940
Since I'm already dead,

640
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,940
I can only prepare a battle

641
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:02,940
to ask for a living.

642
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:06,940
From now on,

643
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:08,940
Changjue and I

644
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,940
will be guarded by me.

645
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,940
The King of Qi

646
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,940
The wind blows

647
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:50,940
The sword in the city is as yellow as a poem

648
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,940
The petals are wet with the rain

649
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:57,940
The heart is broken and the sword is broken

650
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,940
The tears fall

651
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,940
The heart is broken

652
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:06,940
There is nowhere to go

653
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:11,940
Song of Chu

654
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:14,940
支持

655
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:18,940
I wish we could grow up while you all try

656
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:25,940
The only regret in desperation

657
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:33,940
I still wish him to put down the words he speaks with the apple in his tree

658
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:45,660
Even if I have to give up my life for the song of the jade bell

659
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:59,180
Who will lose the heart of a flower

660
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:02,500
Love and hate can only be eaten

661
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,220
Flowers wither, withering bad fortune

662
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:10,100
No longer need to tell

663
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:24,000
But I love you so much

664
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,280
I'm not afraid

665
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:31,520
That all disappeared
