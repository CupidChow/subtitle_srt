00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
My Girlfriend is an Alien

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Your Highness.

4
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Your Highness.

5
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Your Highness.

6
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Your Highness.

7
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Jiang Leng Hua.

8
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You're determined to kill the Queen.

9
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
If so,

10
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
don't blame me for changing your life for a life.

11
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Get up.

12
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Shen Zaiye.

13
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You're a big shot.

14
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
If you're capable,

15
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
you can shoot your men.

16
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
No.

17
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
He'll take the Princess away after he's dead.

18
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Princess.

19
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Princess.

20
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Lan's Palace

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I know you.

22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The manager of Lan's Palace, Yang Wanqing,

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
entered the palace at the age of twelve,

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and became the personal girl of the queen of the North Court.

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Eight years later,

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Lady Yingpu was kicked out of the palace

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
to make a living in Qi.

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's not a good thing.

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
and not a good person.

30
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,480
Shen Zaiye,

31
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,000
why are you still

32
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,880
a woman

33
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,120
who is always in trouble?

34
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,080
Who am I important to?

35
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,680
What's important is

36
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,040
the person you care about

37
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,600
is in my hands now.

38
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,520
No matter who you are,

39
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,200
you don't have to

40
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,360
sacrifice yourself for her.

41
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,160
I can give you

42
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,040
the promise she made to you

43
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,840
and the deal she made with you.

44
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,160
If you surrender to Qin,

45
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,760
I'll make sure you don't die.

46
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,800
Shen Zaiye,

47
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,200
no one in the whole of Qi

48
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,080
knows that you are evil and vicious.

49
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,000
If I let them go now,

50
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,320
you will only spread the evil.

51
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,360
If you don't want to see the three corpses,

52
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,400
you can withdraw your men

53
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,120
and prepare a carriage.

54
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,400
After I take them down the mountain,

55
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,720
I will let them go.

56
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,920
If you don't agree,

57
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,000
both of them

58
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,840
will die with me.

59
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,280
You are too naive.

60
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,560
Jiang Taohua is a spy in the North Court.

61
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,400
How can I care about her life?

62
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,160
There are only four people

63
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,800
who can go down the mountain alive today.

64
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,120
Shi Xiang,

65
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,560
I hope she didn't do anything wrong.

66
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,160
Please save her.

67
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,160
Jiang Taohua,

68
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,000
I really care about you.

69
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:20,060
Peony

70
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,340
Shen Zaiye,

71
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,520
don't kill him!

72
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,120
Your Highness!

73
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,560
Guards! Take Qingtai back to her mansion!

74
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,080
Let me go!

75
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,640
I'm not going back.

76
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,280
I'm going back to the North Court.

77
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,120
Tell the Crown Prince that you killed the princess

78
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,400
and let him take revenge!

79
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,080
Your Highness,

80
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,200
the princess might...

81
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,000
Say it again!

82
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,520
There's no princess.

83
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,640
So,

84
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,240
we 2

85
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,720
bounded each other

86
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,480
and set up the enemy

87
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,520
by trapping you.

88
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,620
Our lives arevitably

89
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,400
and so are our lives.

90
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,560
suitable assistant success Nichang's

91
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,280
便宜

92
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,000
If I could only see you in my dreams,

93
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,200
I would be the only one in this life.

94
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,400
Since it's come to this,

95
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,400
I'd better say goodbye.

96
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,000
After drinking this farewell wine,

97
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,800
we will never meet again in this life.

98
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,200
Zhai Lu.

99
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,600
Prime Minister.

100
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,200
The brush of Zhengcheng Pavilion

101
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,200
should be removed.

102
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,600
Yes.

103
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,200
Then, the princess' body...

104
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,200
I've said it.

105
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,800
There's no princess in Xiangfu.

106
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,200
Make the body of the play clear.

107
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,200
The one that should be kept as the main part

108
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,600
should be sealed.

109
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,200
The rest

110
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,200
should be destroyed.

111
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,480
That's not enough.

112
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,920
Vision added,

113
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,200
��러러

114
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,440
The prime minister's body

115
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,440
should be removed.

116
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,160
Take me to find it.

117
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,200
Sure.

118
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,200
Lord Xia.

119
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,400
How are we going to deal with Qingtai?

120
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,000
She plans to return back to the North Campus

121
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,000
and send troops to avenge Jiang Tauhua, right?

122
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,200
I'll wait.

123
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,800
Has the spy from Blue Team caught her in particular?

124
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,000
I know.

125
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,280
Fahr nach!

126
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,680
virtual!

127
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,940
Young Master.

128
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,160
I have many East China Co seal,

129
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,480
if nothing has been established by me and someone behind it,

130
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,240
then I'll come to ...

131
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,840
Pattern your cap!

132
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,680
4319~~

133
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,880
uncon...

134
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,160
Wait.

135
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:43,800
Wait.

136
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,440
Bastard.

137
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,640
What's this?

138
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,680
This is the new popular peach blossom makeup.

139
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,840
What's the use of this peach blossom mark?

140
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,960
I will kill you.

141
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:15,720
Wait.

142
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,800
I'm not going to solve your problem.

143
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,560
You must answer me.

144
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,520
Let's do it.

145
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,760
The spy in North Moon

146
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,120
is an Fan of Peach Bloom to uzere the identity?

147
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,080
zweite Noappa,

148
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,080
Moreover, last night, I saw her clearly.

149
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,080
Her arms were clean.

150
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,080
On the day of the execution,

151
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,080
the mark on her arms

152
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,080
was much more than those on the operas.

153
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,080
But if it was painted,

154
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,080
it's impossible that every mark is not different.

155
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,080
The same position,

156
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,080
not different depth,

157
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,080
and the same color.

158
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,080
This is my

159
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,080
fatal mistake.

160
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,080
This...

161
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,080
Master Xiang,

162
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,080
we haven't used heavy punishment yet.

163
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,080
How... How did she die?

164
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,080
The strange blood flow is a poison.

165
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,080
Could it be that the color of the mark

166
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,080
is related to the poison?

167
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,080
You've seen

168
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,080
what happened to her.

169
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,080
When we searched Yang Wanqing's residence,

170
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,080
we found a medicine box.

171
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,080
The antidote to this poison

172
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,080
may be able to cure your poison.

173
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,080
There's an antidote.

174
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,080
An antidote.

175
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,080
If you have thought about your life,

176
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,080
tell me the master behind the scenes.

177
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,080
There's only one antidote.

178
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,080
An antidote.

179
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,080
An antidote.

180
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,080
Master Zhong, the antidote.

181
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,080
Give me the antidote.

182
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,080
Give me the antidote.

183
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,080
Give me the antidote.

184
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,080
We're willing to say anything.

185
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,080
We're willing to say anything.

186
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,080
It seems that I guessed it right.

187
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,080
An antidote.

188
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,080
It's really a poison.

189
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,080
What poison did you guys get?

190
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,080
This poison...

191
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,080
This poison is called the peach-tree pill.

192
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,080
It's a kind of poison.

193
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,080
It's a poison that can destroy my body.

194
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,080
The peach flower mark is the mark of the poison.

195
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,080
It's a poison that can destroy my body.

196
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,080
If I don't take the antidote every month,

197
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,080
I'll die of a sudden death

198
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,080
and die of a sudden death.

199
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,080
But Lv Heng

200
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,080
died because of our family.

201
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,080
My parents were killed by Lv Heng.

202
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,080
I just want to see them one last time.

203
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,080
Prime Minister, it's him.

204
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,080
My children are all in Lv Heng's hands.

205
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,080
If I don't fulfill my mission,

206
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,080
they will die without a trace.

207
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,080
Prime Minister.

208
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,080
You all know it's Lv Heng.

209
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,080
What about the peach flower?

210
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,080
The peach flower is the same as us.

211
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,080
It's the most capable wife.

212
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,080
She is Princess Chengping.

213
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,080
How can she be compared to you?

214
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,080
Prime Minister.

215
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,080
Do you really think

216
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,080
the North Court will marry you

217
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,080
to a noble and noble princess?

218
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,080
Back then, in the North Court's palace,

219
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,080
Jiang Taohua gave me a bowl of medicine

220
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,080
for a bowl of medicine.

221
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,080
He knew how to match you.

222
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,080
Prime Minister.

223
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,080
Prime Minister, I found something.

224
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,080
I found this letter

225
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,080
in the dark room of Zhengchun Pavilion.

226
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,080
It should be the letter

227
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,080
from Princess's brother

228
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,080
to Jiang Taohua.

229
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,080
So Lv Heng still has a brother.

230
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,080
No wonder.

231
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,080
Lv Heng died because of our family.

232
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,080
If I don't fulfill my mission,

233
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,080
they will die.

234
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,080
Why hasn't the scout from the North Court come back?

235
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,080
The scout from the North Court sent a letter

236
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,080
to report that there were many accidents in the North Court.

237
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,080
But they should be on their way back.

238
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,080
Our guards have been searching in Mount Yuguishan for two days.

239
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,080
But we still haven't found Jiang Taohua's body.

240
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,080
The nearby boatman said

241
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,080
there were black clouds at the bottom of the cliff.

242
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,080
Once they fell,

243
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,080
they would be killed.

244
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,080
It's hard to find even their bodies.

245
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,080
Your Highness.

246
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,080
Your Highness.

247
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,080
Your Highness.

248
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,080
What happened in the tea house that day?

249
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,080
Why did you go there?

250
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,080
Someone pretended to be the princess

251
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,080
and asked me to go out.

252
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,080
But I was shocked when I saw them.

253
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,080
I was half-asleep and half-awake.

254
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,080
I heard them arguing.

255
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,080
When the princess tricked that person away,

256
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,080
she tried to wake me up.

257
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,080
When I woke up,

258
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,080
I heard the princess was...

259
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,080
Jiang Taohua.

260
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,080
What are you doing?

261
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,080
I said I was saving people.

262
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,080
But you locked me in the prison.

263
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,080
Is this what you said to believe me?

264
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,080
So,

265
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,080
she really saved people.

266
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,080
Shen Zaiye.

267
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,080
Did the princess have anything to do with you?

268
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,080
I'm talking to you.

269
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,080
Did she have anything to do with you?

270
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,080
Your Highness.

271
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,080
Jiang Taohua was really trapped by accident.

272
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,080
My brother wanted to save her.

273
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,080
Accident?

274
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,080
This is so strange.

275
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,080
How could it be an accident?

276
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,080
I don't believe it.

277
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,080
I'm afraid the princess was not killed by her.

278
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:21,740
When I thought I was 공公

279
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,080
I worked hard

280
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,720
and tell me everything.

281
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,040
Yes.

282
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,320
Prime Minister,

283
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,840
this is the whole thing I've investigated.

284
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,680
Princess Chengping has a reputation,

285
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,240
but she's not even as good as the lowest-ranking maid.

286
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,240
Prime Minister,

287
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,320
why don't we kill her right now

288
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,960
and vent our anger on her?

289
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:12,920
No.

290
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,560
The Crown Prince of Changju is still in the hands of the Empress Lv.

291
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,960
You may leave for recovery.

292
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,400
Thank you, Prime Minister.

293
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,040
I'll take my leave.

294
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:30,960
Prime Minister,

295
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,920
what should we do now?

296
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,280
Keep looking for the fake hostages.

297
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:38,800
Yes,

298
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,160
I understand.

299
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,080
An oil shortage of 50 or even more at a time.

300
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,480
Here's what I mean.

301
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:15,700
Big today's

302
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,020
Ho Lin Crypt we're going.

303
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:17,760
哦

304
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,220
You have to find the hare with big ten face in the cave that can be used

305
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,120
and repeat the 네

306

Unten three customer

307

How do you know it's not someone in the earth and I mean the

308
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,880
Extra Mountain

309
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:34,100

and we meet here pry contest.

311
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,820
Since we're drinking faithfully,

312
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,020
of course it would be good to have some fine wine with you.

313
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,980
If it's pot you'll drink it.

314
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,520
Then just keep it for the time being.

315
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,080
Thank you very much.

316
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,960
remarkable

317
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:11,720
The

318
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:12,400
and

319
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,460
Can the room I slept in a small room

320
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,060
have some room too?

321
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,260
keeping my eyes open?

322
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,760
I remember

323
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,860
you were about toえっ

324
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,060

Peывать

328
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,500
should have seen your eyes.

329
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,260
They had never seen

330
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,840
the whole morning

331
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,220
and evening.

Another bed

335
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,220
given by Left Chief.

336
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,220
Right Master relaxed

337
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:17,240

have died

343
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,280
No

344
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,260
Master

why

349
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,120
Is your husband

350
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,680
born in China?

351
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,680
He looks down on ladies

352
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,100
but for some reasons hehowl

353
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,200
and he's immature.

354
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,180
On this nutrients of Liu

355
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,800
Li is not poles to carry and light.

356
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,060
Ru,

357
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,940
when you hear the

358
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,400
call Sky,

359
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,900

Thank His Majesty.

00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,300

00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,300
My soul lies on the other side of the river.

365
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,180
I beg Buddhist to ingredientize

I'm sorry.

369
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,620
My brother has been looking for the peach blossoms

370
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,340
but there's no sign of them for so long.

371
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,260
Please bless him

372
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,540

375
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,820
I'll make sure that the immortals of the Great Luo

376
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,700
can come back to life again.

377
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,060
I'll give you ten steamed buns.

378
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,180
Your Highness.

379
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,620
You don't drink or eat meat.

380
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,180
What else can you do?

381
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,740
Miss Qingying,

382
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,740
why don't you take a look at this place?

383
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,500
This is a temple.

384
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,180
The offerings here

385
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,380
are offered to some masters,

386
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,820
Bodhisattvas and Buddha.

387
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,780
The Great Luo Gold Immortal you mentioned

388
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,500
is only available in the Taoist temple.

389
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,900
There's such an explanation?

390
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,820
Then I'll say it again.

391
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,540
Please don't mind it, Buddha.

392
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,460
I'll go and ask Yuzhu

393
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,500
for more help.

394
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,700
My brother just said something wrong.

395
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,300
Actually, it's not necessary.

396
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,260
The Buddha is a man of open mind.

397
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,020
He wouldn't just...

398
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,940
Yuzhu, come here.

399
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:49,940
Come here.

400
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,100
Give me back my book.

401
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,180
Please give my book back.

402
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,100
We finally got a girl.

403
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,140
You went up there to pretend

404
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,100
and she ignored us.

405
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,740
You're just a beggar, aren't you?

406
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,980
Go and prepare some food for me.

407
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,740
If you ruin my good news,

408
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,340
I'll tear your manuscript.

409
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,460
Look since this day,

410
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,860
we've been unaccounted for,

411
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,180
but had you sent her back earlier,

412
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,020
she should have stayed,

413
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,580
like we did.

414
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,500
I suppose

415
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,100
I should agree with you.

416
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,900
She must make it more attractive

417
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,180
in front of laugh anda customer.

418
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,220
One carries odds,

419
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,420
the stock norte commander permeates the market.

420
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,820
Whose daughter loves you?

421
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,460
She needs to blame others for being un pear-minded.

422
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:39,020
Cowards did harm to a heroine who makes wild одно oops.

423
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,460
Designed in such a bad way,

424
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,460
in such a quiet place.

425
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,660
Are you going to

426
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,940
bully men and women here?

427
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,100
My father hates this place the most.

428
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,580
I'm thinking

429
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,460
if I should report to him.

430
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:51,780
I don't dare.

431
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:52,940
I'm just joking.

432
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,380
Mr. Lin, I'll leave first.

433
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:56,980
Goodbye.

434
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:57,740
Wait.

435
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,220
Excuse me.

436
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:02,620
This brother Li

437
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,620
is my best friend

438
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,700
and my fourth prince's best friend.

439
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,380
You won't bother him again, will you?

440
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,340
What are you talking about?

441
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,420
No. No.

442
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,140
I have a piece of advice for you.

443
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,780
It's not right to break up with him.

444
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:12,980
Don't bother him again.

445
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:13,780
Otherwise...

446
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:18,020
Finally, it's done.

447
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,220
Sorry for the inconvenience.

448
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,300
I'm from Liu's family.

449
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,340
We'll be friends if we meet again.

450
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,820
I'll treat you to a meal if I have a chance.

451
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,540
Is that okay?

452
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,660
You're welcome.

453
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,540
It was just a misunderstanding.

454
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,100
I think you're all very angry.

455
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,500
How about I sing a poem

456
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,020
to show you?

457
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,300
Okay. Okay.

458
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,900
Okay. Okay.

459
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,100
A man is a man of Song.

460
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,500
He knows a lot of things.

461
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,620
He's a man of a lot of things.

462
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,860
He's a man of a lot of things.

463
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,100
He's a man of a lot of things.

464
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:02,180
I mean

465
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,740
you're all rich and powerful.

466
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,940
You're not ordinary.

467
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,780
You're a man of a lot of things.

468
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,300
You're so great.

469
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,460
You should see the girl

470
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,620
as you should.

471
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,060
You're right.

472
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:14,780
Come on.

473
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,060
Write it down.

474
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,660
Make a talisman for me

475
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,900
and hang it in my study.

476
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,460
Let's go.

477
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,620
Please go to the fourth room.

478
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,780
Goodbye.

479
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,420
Brother Li, you...

480
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,020
Why are you laughing?

481
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:37,460
By the way,

482
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,620
aren't poems always right?

483
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,340
That poem was just five sentences.

484
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,380
It's not right.

485
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,900
If those people know the five and six,

486
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,500
why don't they do things

487
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,100
without thinking?

488
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:49,940
So?

489
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,180
What are you laughing at?

490
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,900
A pile of white women.

491
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,580
They're hiding poems.

492
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,980
You're so good at

493
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,540
learning things.

494
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,980
Brother Li, you're so good at making plans.

495
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,900
You're too kind.

496
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,380
It's not good to make plans.

497
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,900
Or I should call you

498
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,900
the Fourth Prince.

499
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,580
It's just a name.

500
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,260
You don't have to be so confident.

501
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,980
You're so good at writing.

502
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,060
I'll definitely recommend you.

503
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,900
I'll go back and do some research.

504
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,300
Please don't worry.

505
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,140
Okay.

506
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,580
Your Majesty.

507
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:33,940
Why are you still awake?

508
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,820
Your Majesty.

509
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:14,940
which could behões of times of contractually

510
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:20,040
intertwined with its expiry date.

511
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:31,160
Now you know

512
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,940
I've been waiting for your reply.

513
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,220
It's been a long time.

514
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:42,060
Princess Chengping came for the peace treaty.

515
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,260
But now she's in the prison.

516
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,740
Do you want to start a war?

517
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,460
How dare you!

518
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,100
Your Majesty,

519
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,060
I don't intend to start a war.

520
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,500
After Princess Chengping was imprisoned,

521
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,180
no one was found.

522
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,900
Yingshu is still alive.

523
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,700
I'm trying my best to find her.

524
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,620
I was going to tell His Majesty after I found her.

525
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,140
But His Majesty is a big man.

526
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,540
I didn't report to His Majesty in time.

527
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,140
I should have started a war.

528
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,380
Princess Chengping is alive and dead.

529
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,180
We need to make a conclusion as soon as possible.

530
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,940
The North Campus said they would send a delegation here.

531
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,420
If we ask where Princess Chengping is,

532
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,140
we need to have an explanation.

533
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,020
You should arrange it.

534
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:30,300
You should take care of the building you built.

535
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,540
arriv

536
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,460
Yes,

537
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,820
I'll take care of it.

538
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,780
After that, the delegation

539
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,380
should have come to rebuild the Blue Woy format.

540
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,180
How dare they come!

541
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,020
Since you're here for the evolvement of Taoism,

542
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,460
sure.

543
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:09,140
I'll choose who will be theigious".

544
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,060
Send those who bought the scroll

545
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:12,860
of Taoism with this order

546
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:13,780
to North Garden.

547
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,100
Yes.

548
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:20,980
Jiang Taohua,

549
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,660
where are you?

550
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,020
You were still alive,

551
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:28,700
weren't you?

552
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,320
Mira had been causing trouble for many years.

553
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,500
But entering the Four Seasons Court

554
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,640
has left me fry,

555
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,420
or a real blows.

556
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,640
Ugh,

557
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,100
how are the four seasons phaensis too much of an issue

558
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,900
that мной tais me?

559
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,040
Is race indispensable to me since

560
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,340
I'm a female?

561
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,740
That's Eddie's tenderness to phaensis.

562
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,800
Through the interviewee,

563
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,780
she knows whether there is em็m in the court

564
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,460
or an escort in order to help you.

565
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,260
I also noticed this place.

566
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,460
So I don't understand

567
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,460
what's in the gourd.

568
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,020
Your Highness,

569
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:10,700
in my opinion,

570
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,860
Shen Zaiye is always cautious.

571
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,100
There must be a plot

572
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,140
to do so.

573
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,700
As for what he wants,

574
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,300
we have no idea.

575
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,420
Why don't we

576
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,820
send more people

577
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:22,940
to join us

578
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,380
and act accordingly?

579
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:25,700
Don't forget

580
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,100
this time, we came here for...

581
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,020
The items stop here.

582
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:34,940
Where's the fire Weapon S ор?

583
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,660
An RC set

584
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,900
will find it quickly and

585
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,740
figure out what it wants.

586
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:42,860
I'll consider it personally.

587
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,500
I was in control of

588
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,580
Lanyi Pavilion thus far in vain.

589
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,460
You're useless!

590
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,460
You're useless!

591
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,460
Your Highness, please calm down.

592
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,460
Take care of yourself.

593
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,460
Nanny Mei.

594
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,460
I'm not feeling well.

595
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:18,460
Go after the State Preceptor

596
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,460
and tell him that he'll be the supervisor from tomorrow.

597
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,460
I need to rest for a few days.

598
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,460
Yes, Your Highness.

599
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,460
Chief.

600
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,460
Do you have any leads?

601
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,460
We searched the entire valley three times.

602
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,460
We searched the entire valley three times.

603
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,460
We searched the entire valley three times.

604
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,460
But we still couldn't find it.

605
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,460
Chief.

606
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,460
We searched the entire valley three times.

607
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,460
We searched the entire valley three times.

608
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,460
But we still couldn't find it.

609
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,460
Chief,

610
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,460
how about we just...

611
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,460
I'll continue searching for someone tomorrow.

612
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,460
Hold on.

613
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,460
Go Fanyuan and Baili

614
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,460
and get me the records for the medical records of all hospitals

615
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,460
I'll check them one by one.

616
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,100
I have hope

617
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,580
in my body.

618
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,220
My Lord,

619
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,660
the records of the chief doctors of the city are here.

620
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,940
What are you looking for?

621
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,980
I've searched for so long but nothing is found.

622
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,700
What if he's already dead?

623
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,460
Master Ban...

624
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,980
Even if I fall from a high place,

625
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:08,980
I'll get hurt

626
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,340
and AUDIENCE will judge me it forever!

627
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:25,700
I'm going to the hospital.

628
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,700
I'm going to the hospital.

629
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:27,700
I'm going to the hospital.

630
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:28,700
I'm going to the hospital.

631
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,700
I'm going to the hospital.

632
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,700
I'm going to the hospital.

633
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,700

00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,700
I'm going to the hospital.

639
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,700
I'm going to the hospital.

640
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,700
I'm going to the hospital.

641
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,700
I'm going to the hospital.

642
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:40,700
I'm going to the hospital.

643
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,700
I'm going to the hospital.

644
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,700
I'm going to the hospital.

645
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:43,700

00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:49,700
I'm going to the hospital.

652
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,700
I'm going to the hospital.

653
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,700
I'm going to the hospital.

654
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:52,700
I'm going to the hospital.

655
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,700
I'm going to the hospital.

656
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,700

00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:55,700

664
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,700
I'm going to the hospital.

665
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,700
I'm going to the hospital.

666
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,700
I'm going to the hospital.

667
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,700
I'm going to the hospital.

668
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:06,700

00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,700

00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,700
I'm going to the hospital.

675
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,700
Xiaoyan, it's late.

676
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,700
Eat something before you watch.

677
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,700
One person in September.

678
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,700
Six people in September.

679
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,700
Thirteen in September.

680
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,700
Seventeen in September.

681
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,700
Twenty in September.

682
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,700
Twenty-seven.

683
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,700
I found it.

684
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,700
During the time in the Ming's Medical School,

685
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,700
I will go to the Third Prince's house

686
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,700
every few days.

687
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,700
And the Third Prince

688
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,700
has been with a group of people

689
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,700
who are obsessed with pills.

690
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,700
His health is very good.

691
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,700
I'm going to the hospital.

692
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,700
I'm going to the hospital.

693
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,700
I'm going to the hospital.

694
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,700
I'm going to the hospital.

695
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,700
What?

696
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,700
Besides,

697
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,700
even if the Third Prince is sick,

698
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,700
he should call the doctor.

699
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,700
He shouldn't be a doctor.

700
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,700
You mean

701
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:23,700
the Princess might be

702
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,700
in the Third Prince's house now?

703
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,700
I don't know yet.

704
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,700
Take Hua Xiang with us.

705
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,700
Yes.

706
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,700
Is Dr. Lin here?

707
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,700
No.

708
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,700
He went to the Third Prince's house for a check-up.

709
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,700
Let's go.

710
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,700
Chang Juan!

711
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,700
Chang Juan!

712
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,700
Stop!

713
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,700
Chang Juan!

714
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,700
Sister!

715
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,700
Please accept the Princess's peach blossom

716
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,700
as a token of respect

717
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,700
and a harmonious marriage.

718
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,700
Marry me.

719
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,700
You regret it.

720
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,700
Your Highness,

721
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,700
you're finally awake.

722
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,700
Here.

723
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,700
Your Highness, you don't even know

724
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,700
that I've been so nervous these days.

725
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,700
I was afraid that you'd fall asleep like this.

726
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,700
My crow's mouth

727
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,700
is so painful.

728
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,700
I'm sorry.

729
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,700
I'm sorry.

730
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,700
I'm sorry.

731
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,700
My crow's mouth

732
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,700
is so painful.

733
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,700
Qingtai,

734
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,700
what's wrong with me?

735
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,700
When I found you,

736
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,700
I was covered in wounds.

737
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:26,700
Your Highness!

738
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,700
Your Highness, where are you?

739
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,700
Your Highness!

740
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,700
Your Highness!

741
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,700
Your Highness!

742
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,700
Your Highness, that's great!

743
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,700
Your Highness, I finally found you!

744
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:58,700
Your Highness!

745
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,700
I've been taking good care of you these days.

746
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,700
Your wound has recovered a lot.

747
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:08,700
Your Highness,

748
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,700
that's the Mountain of Fishes.

749
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,700
Falling from the Mountain of Fishes

750
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,700
can save lives.

751
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,700
You're really lucky.

752
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,700
Mountain of Fishes

753
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,700
is the mountain

754
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:27,700
we met on our way to the harmonious marriage?

755
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,700
Harmonious marriage?

756
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:32,700
Isn't that...

757
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:36,700
needs to be decided now?

758
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:07,020
Flowers fall, the north wind blows,

759
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:11,020
the city is in a state of panic.

760
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:14,340
Flowers fall, the north rain falls,

761
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:17,940
my heart is broken and I'm lost.

762
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,820
Flowers fall, tears fall,

763
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,660
my heart is torn,

764
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:27,580
I have nowhere to go.

765
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:28,940
urgent

766
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:29,980
Agree

767
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,240
ْ

768
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:39,540
Our multitudes all reminisce our 65 years of love and hatred.

769
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:49,420
The repeated years will bring back once more the justice inherited from those who we loved and heart- spl eighteen.
