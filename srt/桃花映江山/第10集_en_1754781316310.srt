(Shen Residence)

19
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,180
Young Master, Madam,
please enjoy the tea.

20
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,000
Zhenzhen,

21
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,800
be honest with me,

22
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,040
has anyone given you a hard time

23
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,000
during your confinement?

24
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,280
Don't worry, Huaijin.

25
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,760
Though I was confined,

26
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,480
I've actually been
more at ease than usual.

27
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,040
Huaijin, you've been with
the Crown Prince daily.

28
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,840
Have you noticed

29
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,320
any unusual behavior from him lately?

30
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,000
Nothing out of the ordinary.

31
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,920
Have you noticed something?

32
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,520
Chancellor and Lady Jiang

33
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,040
have been away for several days now.

34
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,440
What?

35
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,280
Lady Jiang's maid is
guarding Zhengchun Boudoir,

36
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,240
but Chancellor and Zhan Lu
are nowhere to be seen.

37
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,960
It struck me as odd,

38
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,840
so I had my contacts investigate.

39
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,280
That's when I learned

40
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,400
there's no one in Lady Jiang's boudoir

41
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:39,960
besides her maid.

42
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,300
I suspect this has something
to do with the Crown Prince,

43
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,200
which is why I called you here
to talk about it.

44
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,920
How many days have they been gone?

45
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,840
By my count,

46
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,880
it's been five days.

47
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,240
We shouldn't jump to conclusions.

48
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,590
I'll have someone
look into it discreetly.

49
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,360
You stay alert.

50
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,320
If anything changes, send word at once.

51
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,480
Understood.

52
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,800
It's all because of us

53
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,280
that you were confined
by Chancellor Shen.

54
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,640
Don't worry about Yuetao.

55
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,200
I've sent people to bring her back.

56
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,040
She's safe now in Meng Residence.

57
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,320
But you...

58
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,920
Don't blame yourself.

59
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,680
As a daughter of Meng family,

60
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,720
this is simply my fate.

61
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,040
I'll find a way

62
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,000
to get Chancellor Shen to lift your
restrictions as soon as possible.

63
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,160
Are you even doing your job?

64
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,200
It's been so long,

65
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,680
and yet you haven't found them.

66
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,960
Your Highness, we've deployed
all available men.

67
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,360
Yujing City isn't that large.

68
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,200
I'm sure...

69
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm sure we'll hear something soon.

70
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,120
But the fact remains,
you haven't found them.

71
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,000
Stop!

72
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:43,960
Huaijin.

73
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,080
What have upset you

74
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,360
so much this time, Your Highness?

75
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:49,640
Nothing.

76
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,180
Just incompetent subordinates
failing their duties.

77
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,120
Leave us.

78
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:56,720
Wait.

79
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,600
You.

80
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,920
Inform the workers at the silver mine.

81
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,800
I want

82
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,360
500,000 taels extracted in five days.

83
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,160
Five days?

84
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,760
Your Highness...

85
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,520
You mustn't.

86
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,920
Yes, Your Highness.

87
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,320
Your Highness,
please reconsider your order.

88
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,320
Though His Majesty turned a blind eye

89
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,800
to the gambling house incident,

90
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,080
he surely suspects

91
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,360
your involvement.

92
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,600
Now is the time for discretion.

93
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,400
We cannot afford another overt move.

94
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,400
Rise.

95
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,000
I understand your frustration,
Your Highness,

96
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,720
but

97
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,720
haste makes waste.

98
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,200
These days,

99
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,640
we must act with caution.

100
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,600
Huaijin,

101
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,720
you're exemplary in all ways,

102
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,040
but you're overly cautious.

103
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,880
Do you know

104
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,300
why Father didn't press further
about the gambling house?

105
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,940
Because I have
the Meng family behind me.

106
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,780
You're the most powerful
clan in the capital.

107
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:44,510
With your support,

108
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,840
it means I hold the backing
of all the major noble clans.

109
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,560
I used to be afraid too.

110
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,200
But after that incident, I realized

111
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,840
Father fears

112
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,760
the power of the nobility.

113
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,120
Your Highness, mind your words.

114
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,880
Why?

115
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,080
It's just the two of us here.

116
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,120
I can say whatever I want!

117
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,280
Even if I made a mistake,

118
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,040
I'm still the Crown Prince.

119
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,560
And you, you're the eldest
son of Chancellor Meng.

120
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,560
As long as we stand together,
what do we have to be afraid of?

121
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,360
But silver mines differ
fundamentally from gambling dens.

122
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,360
That incident could be passed
off as a personal misstep.

123
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,520
But the mine

124
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,600
is the lifeblood of the nation.

125
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,760
You must

126
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,400
tread carefully now.

127
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,480
Any aggressive mining

128
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,720
would be most unwise
at a time like this.

129
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,440
Huaijin,

130
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,080
I know what I'm doing.

131
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,120
This discussion ends here.

132
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,560
Aside from this,

133
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,160
is there anything else you're planning?

134
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,120
Huaijin,

135
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,960
like I said,

136
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:58,960
I know

137
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,560
what I'm doing.

138
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,160
This is outrageous!

139
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,760
This isn't recruitment,

140
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,040
this is outright abduction!

141
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,280
Have they no regard for the law?

142
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,960
I'll write a petition

143
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,080
to Censor Zhou.

144
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,360
He's known for his integrity.

145
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,640
He'll help those people.

146
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,560
Then don't waste another moment,
write it now.

147
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,400
But a petition alone won't suffice.

148
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,320
We need witnesses
and tangible evidence.

149
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,320
Witnesses?

150
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,880
Our entire village will testify.

151
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,040
As for evidence,

152
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,560
tell me what you need,

153
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,440
I'll help gather it

154
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:36,960
Good.

155
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,880
So this is Censor Zhou's residence?

156
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,520
It must be.

157
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,480
I've heard he chose
this humble location specifically

158
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,960
to receive petitions

159
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,840
from villagers at any hour.

160
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,280
There's a saying about him

161
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,520
that's famous throughout Yujing,

162
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,640
'So long as a single soul
remains homeless,

163
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,760
he shall not upgrade his roof'.

164
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,560
With such integrity,

165
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,240
I believe he'll deliver
a fair judgment.

166
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,440
He's out.

167
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,540
I bring grievances

168
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,320
from all 76 households
of Tianshui Village.

169
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,960
We implore you to deliver justice
for these villagers, Censor Zhou.

170
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,680
- Yes.
- Yes, please help.

171
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,960
Please come in

172
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,920
and tell me everything.

173
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:40,760
Unbelievable.

174
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,360
They dare to kidnap citizens

175
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,080
under the guise of hiring laborers

176
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,040
right under His Majesty's nose,
forcing them into private labor.

177
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,680
Such blatant disregard of the law.

178
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,200
People of Tianshui Village,

179
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,320
I swear I shall prove
worthy of your trust.

180
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,920
We shall await your
favorable reply.

181
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,480
Thank you, Censor Zhou.

182
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:15,880
Chancellor.

183
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,680
Do you think that man and woman

184
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,350
really have a chance
at getting us justice?

185
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,440
Censor Zhou is known far and
wide as a just official.

186
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,400
I think they just might.

187
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,480
Who are this man and woman
you're talking about?

188
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,080
A pair of very good-looking folks.

189
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,720
They're back.

190
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,920
Prince Wuxia and Miss Qingying?

191
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,440
Your High...

192
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,240
Zhan Lu?

193
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,240
Young Master, Young Lady,

194
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,560
what are you doing here?

195
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,240
You tell me.

196
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,240
You went behind my back
to search for them,

197
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,680
but the person you were looking for,

198
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,440
I found them first.

199
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,000
Chancellor?

200
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,920
Come with us.

201
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,040
Who knows

202
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,320
where they have run off to?

203
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,680
None of them left a word.

204
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,960
My lady, why don't
you eat with me first?

205
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,240
(Judging by that look,)

206
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,040
(is he still mad with me for
splashing him with water?)

207
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,200
Sir!

208
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,800
Sir, I finally found you.

209
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,760
I'm sorry I'm late.

210
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,200
(Zhan Lu?)

211
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,560
Your timing is perfect.

212
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,520
You're not late.

213
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,680
Not late?

214
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,180
If we hadn't run into
him on the street,

215
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,520
he'd still be wandering around
like a headless chicken.

216
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,320
What have you been up to?

217
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,000
Everyone looks happy.

218
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,200
We heard about the villagers' plight

219
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,780
and filed a report
with the authorities.

220
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:55,320
- Thank you for helping us.
- Thank you for helping us.

221
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,240
(They filed a report
to the authorities?)

222
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,400
(Oh no. This can't be good.)

223
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,480
You two went to
report to the authorities?

224
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,480
That's right, we did.

225
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,480
Yes.

226
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,040
We submitted our
petition to Censor Zhou.

227
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,840
He's known for his
integrity and fairness,

228
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,080
and he governs with compassion.

229
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:18,840
I believe

230
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,960
we'll have a verdict soon.

231
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,360
Censor Zhou...

232
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,840
I'm afraid we'll be dead

233
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,560
before this investigation bears fruit.

234
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,000
There's no need for sarcasm.

235
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,520
I've met Censor Zhou myself.

236
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,120
He's a meticulous

237
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,080
and principled official.

238
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,000
With ironclad evidence

239
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,640
and clear facts,

240
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,320
surely he will deliver fair judgement.

241
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,160
Funny, isn't it?

242
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,940
Forced labor under
the pretense of recruitment

243
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,640
has been happening for a while.

244
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,280
And Censor Zhou has been
living in that shabby cottage for years.

245
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,640
You really believe he knew nothing?

246
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,840
This matter's roots run deep.

247
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,320
One careless move affects everything.

248
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,280
Your petition will only
alert the mastermind behind.

249
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,480
Nonsense.

250
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,480
Is that how you see the world?

251
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,920
That everyone has some hidden agenda,

252
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,300
that every official is scheming,

253
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,920
and that everything must be calculated

254
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,960
behind closed doors?

255
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,280
If that's how things are,

256
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,920
what's the point of having officials?

257
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,320
Why bother with laws?

258
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,440
Why have a royal family at all?

259
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,400
Young Master Wuxia,

260
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,920
Chancellor prefers

261
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,600
to handle things his own way.

262
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,920
That may be effective,

263
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,360
but it does hurt the innocent
during the process.

264
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,720
Since Wuxia has acted,

265
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,520
why not wait a little longer?

266
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,760
If this can be resolved
without bloodshed,

267
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,160
wouldn't that be better?

268
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,920
Without bloodshed...

269
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,400
Do you really believe such
a perfect solution exists?

270
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,160
Of course.

271
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,880
According to the law,

272
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,920
we write petitions, present evidence,

273
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,360
and the law decides

274
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,160
what's just.

275
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,640
Only this way

276
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,720
will people trust the system,

277
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,160
and lawbreakers be deterred.

278
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,280
What about what you can't see?

279
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,660
Beyond Tianshui Village,

280
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,560
there are countless
others suffering injustice.

281
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,040
Can you file petitions for them all?

282
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,640
Are you going to file a petition

283
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,720
for every single case?

284
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,920
If you don't strike at
the root of the problem,

285
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,760
all you'll end up with are more
and more villages like Tianshui.

286
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,440
But while injustice remains visible,

287
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,760
I cannot turn a blind eye to it

288
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,080
and do nothing like you.

289
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,040
I'll file those petitions one by one.

290
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,720
And case by case,

291
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,120
justice will return.

292
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,280
Censor Zhou.

293
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:18,920
Well done.

294
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,600
Rise.

295
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,400
Yes, Your Highness.

296
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,880
To be of service to you

297
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,720
is my honor.

298
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,800
So it wasn't Shen Zaiye
who filed the report.

299
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,280
Who was it then?

300
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,560
The man revealed nothing of himself,

301
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,040
but he carried noble bearing

302
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,560
and spoke with Yujing accent.

303
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,840
I took the liberty

304
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,040
of having portraits made
of the man and woman

305
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,400
leading the petitioners.

306
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,960
Go claim your reward.

307
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:14,840
No.

308
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,560
I ask for no reward.

309
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,600
All I wish is to follow you

310
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,520
wherever you lead, Your Highness.

311
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,360
Censor Zhou,

312
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,200
next year's merit evaluation
will recall you to Yujing.

313
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,400
You might consider revising

314
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
your thatched hut story.

315
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,680
Thank you, Your Highness!

316
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,520
Huaijin,

317
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,080
what do you think?

318
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,000
If you ask me...

319
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,320
Your Highness,

320
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,280
haven't I warned you time and again

321
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,520
to let the gambling house incident
end there?

322
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,360
Why did you have to make a move

323
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,480
when you didn't have a foolproof plan
to eliminate Shen Zaiye?

324
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,720
He and that concubine of his

325
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,600
burned my gambling house to ashes.

326
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,880
How could I maintain my dignity

327
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,760
if I didn't make them pay?

328
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,680
And have you succeeded?

329
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,760
Not only did you fail to kill him,

330
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,520
you even drove them
to Tianshui Village.

331
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,360
If you had told me even a day earlier,

332
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,990
we could've still
salvaged the situation.

333
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,520
We could've said you
sent men after them

334
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,400
because Lady Jiang disrespected you.

335
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,000
But now, with Prince Wuxia involved,

336
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,800
this has become...

337
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,080
An inescapable deadlock.

338
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:49,640
Huaijin,

339
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,600
what do we do now?

340
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,280
Their prolonged stay
in Tianshui Village

341
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,400
suggests they've uncovered clues

342
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,560
about the dirty money.

343
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,520
Stop the recruitment operations.

344
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,920
Abandon the village.

345
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,360
Your Highness,

346
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,360
please send assassins

347
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,800
and kill them all.

348
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,320
Chancellor, it's just as you suspected.

349
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,720
As soon as Prince Wuxia
and Miss Qingying left today,

350
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,760
Censor Zhou also left his cottage.

351
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,280
I'm afraid...

352
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,400
I anticipated as much.

353
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,400
When I investigated through
the labor recruitment scheme,

354
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,440
I noticed they seemed
aware of our probing.

355
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,320
(Labor Recruitment)
Foreman, we have a problem.

356
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,320
My name is Zhao Dashan.

357
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,680
- I'm 25.
- Vegetables! Fresh vegetables!

358
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:55,360
- You can leave now! Go, go!
- Vegetables!

359
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,760
We're not hiring anymore.

360
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,520
Move along now.

361
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,040
Not hiring anymore?

362
00:18:59,922 --> 00:19:00,320
Seriously?

363
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,220
(Not long after
Prince Wuxia filed the report,)

364
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,940
(they shut down
recruitment immediately.)

365
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,400
(The Crown Prince
must've found out I'm here.)

366
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,680
They moved so quickly.

367
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,920
It has to be Meng Huaijin's idea.

368
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:13,720
Gather our men

369
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,280
and have them converge
here immediately.

370
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,480
We must prepare for the worst.

371
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,040
Yes, sir.

372
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,360
(The Crown Prince's vigilance)

373
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,160
(means he's about to strike.)

374
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,280
(With them hidden and us exposed,)

375
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,920
(I have to lay my plans early.)

376
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,440
Your Highness.

377
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,280
You haven't eaten anything

378
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,680
since you returned.

379
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,520
Have a little something.

380
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,560
When I was little,

381
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,320
I was terribly picky about food.

382
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,280
No delicacies could tempt my appetite,

383
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,360
except for the taro
my mother used to make.

384
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,640
That, I would eat with great delight.

385
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,360
She had no choice

386
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,320
but to cook it in all sorts of ways

387
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,080
just to keep me fed.

388
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,560
But ever since she passed,

389
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,680
I haven't had it in a long time.

390
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,080
What a coincidence.

391
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:32,960
Back in Beiyuan,

392
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,680
my brother and I often ate that too.

393
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,920
No wonder you remind me so much of him.

394
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,880
Perhaps we were fated to meet.

395
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:42,920
To be honest,

396
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,280
when I first saw you,

397
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,880
I too felt an inexplicable familiarity.

398
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,240
If you don't mind,

399
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,760
you could think of me
as your younger brother.

400
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,780
And I'll think of you
as my elder sister.

401
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,400
I'd love that.

402
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,840
Young Master, are you still
troubled by what happened today?

403
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,990
When I've made up
my mind about something,

404
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,200
I don't waver.

405
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,960
When I heard

406
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,440
what you said earlier,

407
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,520
it was like a jolt of clarity.

408
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,360
Your integrity and sincerity

409
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,040
moved me deeply.

410
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,360
If this can indeed be resolved properly

411
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,960
through official channels as you said,

412
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,400
it would be most comforting.

413
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,080
However,

414
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,280
I actually agree

415
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,440
with Chancellor's position.

416
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,920
We held off from reporting this

417
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,360
from the beginning

418
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,360
because we feared collusion
between officials.

419
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,920
We'd only make things worse
if we alerted the wrong people.

420
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,880
I understand your concerns.

421
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,280
However,

422
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,240
without rules, there can be no order.

423
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,360
Without laws,

424
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,960
power knows no bounds,

425
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,240
the strong will oppress the weak,

426
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,760
and the nation will descend into chaos.

427
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,720
We who hold power

428
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,880
must abide by the law ourselves,

429
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,240
or the law

430
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,880
becomes meaningless.

431
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,720
How can we speak of governing a nation

432
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,280
without legal constraints?

433
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,920
This is precisely why I insist on

434
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,880
due process.

435
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,520
Your commitment to justice

436
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,440
puts me to shame.

437
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,520
Actually, all of this

438
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,200
was taught to me
by someone from my past.

439
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:40,960
Someone from your past?

440
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:42,920
Yes.

441
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,990
He taught me music, chess,
calligraphy, painting,

442
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,280
poetry recitation,

443
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,760
and the wisdom of the sages.

444
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,160
I'm merely following
the path he illuminated.

445
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,880
Was this person

446
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,920
one of your childhood tutors?

447
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,440
My cousin.

448
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:02,920
Your cousin?

449
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:04,680
Yes.

450
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,520
My cousin

451
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,320
was a genius.

452
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,520
He's the person I've spent
my life trying to measure up to.

453
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,920
Therefore the empire values...

454
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,760
Repeat after me.

455
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,480
Govern the nation with righteousness.

456
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,480
Wage war with strategy.

457
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,310
Win the world by keeping
the people at peace.

458
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,480
Cousin, what does that mean?

459
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,720
It means, only through
righteous governance

460
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,600
can a nation avoid chaos.

461
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,280
Only through tactical ingenuity

462
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,000
can armies secure victory.

463
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,440
And only by ruling without
oppressing the people

464
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,480
can an empire know lasting peace.

465
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,600
My cousin's family

466
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,240
were distinguished scholars,

467
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,640
generations of loyal officials

468
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,240
serving our dynasty
with unwavering devotion.

469
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,920
Yet because of my mother's incident,

470
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,800
his family was implicated
and slaughtered.

471
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,760
Kill everyone in the Xie family!

472
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:57,720
Kill them!

473
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,520
Dear!

474
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,040
Dear!

475
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:11,580
(Xie)

476
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,360
I never imagined

477
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,040
you had such a past.

478
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,800
Where is

479
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,600
your cousin now?

480
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,240
He's long gone.

481
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,840
You little brat!

482
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,320
You tricked us last time.

483
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,560
Try pulling that again today

484
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,560
and I'll skin you alive!

485
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,240
No tricks this time.

486
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,040
I fooled Shen Zaiye into
going alone to chop wood.

487
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:35,880
Sir, please...

488
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,600
What did you feed me?

489
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,360
You're going to do something for me.

490
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,320
What is it?

491
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,400
Take me to where you work.

492
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,120
No way! Absolutely not!

493
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,480
Do you really have a choice now?

494
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,040
I...

495
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,800
I know your master is
keeping an eye on you.

496
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:53,760
All you need to do is pass me
off as your servant

497
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,720
and take me in.

498
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,960
The rest isn't your concern.

499
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,680
But what about the poison?

500
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,760
Complete the task,

501
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,360
and you'll get the antidote.

502
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,920
Alright, alright.

503
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,240
Lian?

504
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:42,840
Lian?

505
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,400
Madam.

506
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,600
What's wrong?

507
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,200
I'm looking for Lian.

508
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,760
Who knows where she's run off to play?

509
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,840
It's getting dark.
Why hasn't she come home?

510
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,120
Don't worry.

511
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,560
She's probably just lost track of time.

512
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,480
You don't understand,

513
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,180
there are wild animals
in these mountains.

514
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,920
It gets dangerous at night.

515
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,400
But she's usually so responsible.

516
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,040
I don't know what
got into her this time.

517
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,520
I'd better go look for her.

518
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,200
Lian?

519
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,160
Lian?

520
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,840
Lian?

521
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,280
(That's...)

522
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:30,920
(Blood.)

523
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,120
I never forgive those

524
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,840
who betray me.

525
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,800
She may have failed
to harm me this time,

526
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:41,680
but who's to say
there won't be a next time?

527
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,520
Being young

528
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,960
is no excuse for wrongdoing.

529
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,800
(Shen Zaiye has always
lived by one rule,)

530
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,580
(better to betray others
than be betrayed.)

531
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,360
(Did he...)

532
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,560
What's the matter?

533
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,560
We haven't seen Lian all day.

534
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,320
Don't you find that strange?

535
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,440
Children lose track
of time when playing.

536
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,600
What's strange about that?

537
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,120
Lian

538
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,440
did betray us once before.

539
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,480
And your methods...

540
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,080
You think I killed her?

541
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,640
That's not what I meant.

542
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,600
I was only saying...

543
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,960
So what if I did?

544
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,600
I've always been petty.

545
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,040
I never tolerate traitors.

546
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,320
Just like you.

547
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,680
Playing the loyal ally on one hand,

548
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,680
while hiding the other half of the
Sunlight over a Thousand Peaks.

549
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,360
Were you planning
to use it as leverage?

550
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,240
Schemes like that

551
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,720
are reason enough for me to kill you.

552
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,320
You saw

553
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,080
the painting

554
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,560
in my sleeve?

555
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,720
Otherwise

556
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,920
I might never

557
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,360
have realized how masterful

558
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,320
your acting has become.

559
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,640
You had me completely fooled.

560
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,520
Truly impressive.

561
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,240
Chancellor,

562
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,120
I...

563
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:12,800
Do you

564
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:13,880
honestly think

565
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,240
I'd believe another word from you?

566
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,080
For your own safety,

567
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,520
I suggest you

568
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,080
stay put and do your work properly.

569
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,000
Granny!

570
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,320
Qingying took me to town

571
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,080
and bought me these sugar rolls.

572
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,000
It's so delicious, and we got a lot!

573
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,000
Really?

574
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,480
Have some.

575
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,800
It's alright. You can have them all.

576
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,920
Just try some.

577
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:26,880
Alright.

578
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,880
(I misunderstood him.)

579
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,960
(But where did that blood
on his robe come from?)

580
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,280
What are you doing here?

581
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,320
I misunderstood you earlier.

582
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,640
I'm here to apologize.

583
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,600
You haven't eaten since you returned.

584
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:25,920
Here, have a peach.

585
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:35,920
Chancellor,

586
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,000
I had my reasons for keeping
that half of the painting.

587
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,400
But I swear,

588
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,640
I would never do anything to harm Qi

589
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,240
or you.

590
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,200
If I break this vow,

591
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,520
may I never see my family again.

592
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,040
That's the most solemn oath I can make.

593
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,280
Do you still not believe me?

594
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,240
She is just a maid.

595
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Is she really worth this?

596
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,480
Qingtai is never

597
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,480
just a maid to me,

598
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,640
she's my family.

599
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,360
Mother...

600
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,800
Don't leave me.

601
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,720
You may go back now.

602
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,920
It's going to be a long night.

603
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,880
Why don't I come with you tonight?

604
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:43,920
Come with me?

605
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,720
Aren't you afraid

606
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,600
I'm off to commit murder and mayhem?

607
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,560
So what?

608
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,880
I was never a virtuous person
to begin with.

609
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,200
If you're out pillaging,

610
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,360
I'll be the one

611
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,360
handing you the knives.

612
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,040
Besides,

613
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,600
Lian told me

614
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,480
what you were going to do tonight.

615
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,040
You used her to find the foreman

616
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,080
and forced him
to take you to the worksite.

617
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,160
You're tracing
the source of the dirty money.

618
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,480
That's something righteous.

619
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,000
I admire you more than I can even say.

620
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,640
Why would I fear walking beside you?

621
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:25,800
Is that a yes?

622
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,000
Sir, I'm here.

623
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,400
Sir,

624
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,640
why is there an extra person?

625
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,120
What does it matter?

626
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,240
Take us there now.

627
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,040
Yes, yes, please come with me.

628
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,240
Can we really trust this man?

629
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,280
What if it's a trap?

630
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,200
You seem so calm.

631
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,400
Did you already make arrangements?

632
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:01,680
Smart.

633
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,880
I've had Zhan Lu
position reinforcements.

634
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,560
At best, we uncover the truth tonight.

635
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:10,760
At worst,

636
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,960
we buy time for the villagers.

637
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,560
Buy time?

638
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,360
What do you mean?

639
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,740
I've instructed Qingying
and Prince Wuxia

640
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,440
to standby outside the village.

641
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,080
At the first sign of danger,

642
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,520
they'll evacuate everyone.

643
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,160
Zaiye was right after all.

644
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,960
He cares about the people?
What a load of crap!

645
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,280
He's just another rotten official!

646
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,040
Good thing we were prepared.

647
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,640
Let's go warn everyone now.

648
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,240
Come on.

649
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,160
Given the Crown Prince's nature,

650
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,520
knowing we're here,

651
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,960
he'll stop at nothing to kill us.

652
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,200
He won't leave anyone alive.

653
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,080
(As I expected, they're here.)

654
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,240
Watch out!

655
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,200
They're here faster than expected,

656
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,200
which means we found the right place.

657
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,680
I just didn't anticipate

658
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,600
they'd send so many men.

659
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,440
Zhan Lu and our men
must've been held up.

660
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:39,360
Let's hope Qingying and the Prince
can evacuate the villagers in time.

661
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,040
Sir, Madam, come out!

662
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:41,960
Mr. Zhang!

663
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:42,760
Open the door!

664
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,080
Someone's here to kill everyone! Run!

665
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:49,880
Oh, no.

666
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,720
I forgot your brother's stuff.

667
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,680
Go with them first.

668
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,699
You have to hurry, Granny!

669
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,600
Come on, we have to go!

670
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,440
Kill them!

671
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,240
Look out!

672
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,720
Die!

673
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,520
You're hurt.

674
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,760
You'll hold me back. Go!

675
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:37,840
But...

676
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,280
Go.

677
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,280
Go!

678
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,080
Go after her! Don't let her get away!

679
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,120
Nowhere to run!

680
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,880
Careful, mind your steps.

681
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:03,800
Wei Wuxia.

682
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,280
Is everyone here?

683
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,600
Qingying,

684
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,560
is my granny with you?

685
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,440
Isn't she with you?

686
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:15,960
Lian,

687
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,160
listen,

688
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,080
take everyone southeast

689
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,440
through the bamboo grove.

690
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,440
There's a house there.

691
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,600
Wait for me and Qingying there.

692
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,120
We'll be right behind you, alright?

693
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,440
How do you know about that place?

694
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:28,880
Your brother told me.

695
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,480
You have to bring my Granny back.

696
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,080
Don't worry.

697
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,800
Everyone, follow me.

698
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,274
- Come.
- Come.

699
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,120
Come on.

700
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,160
Easy.

701
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:43,880
Follow them.

702
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,240
Stop right there!

703
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,400
Get her! Kill her!

704
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,120
(Jiang Taohua!)

705
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,440
There's nowhere to run!

706
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:41,520
(Oh, no.)

707
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,480
(I'm caught in the weeds.)

708
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:46,800
(What do I do?)

709
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,560
(I can't get free.)

710
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,880
(Help!)

711
00:38:58,880 --> 00:38:59,680
