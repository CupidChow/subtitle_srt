(Adapted from the novel "Peach Blossoms
Reflecting the River and Mountains")

16
00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:40,980
(by Bai Lu Cheng Shuang)

17
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,900
=Episode 27=

18
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,740
(Yiyun Residence)

19
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,760
Zhan Lu.

20
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:52,720
Yes, sir.

21
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,230
Keep an eye on Qingfeng
from Prince Wuyin's residence.

22
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,920
Wait for the right moment
and bring him in for questioning.

23
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,430
Qingfeng?

24
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,840
The footprints at the crime scene match

25
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,920
the soles of Taohua's shoes.

26
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,360
I suspect all the attire

27
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,360
at Prince Wuyin's residence
is custom-made.

28
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,390
Prince Wuhen's death

29
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,830
may be tied to Prince Wuyin.

30
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,710
Qingfeng is Wuyin's trusted aide.

31
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,200
We must make him talk.

32
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,360
But footprints alone
may not be concrete enough.

33
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,760
It's enough.

34
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,510
Meng Huairui's matter is settled.

35
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,200
But the fact that Mu Wuyin tried

36
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,600
to frame Prince Wuxia,

37
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,790
he still owes me an explanation.

38
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,020
(Imperial Prison)

39
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,880
The night Prince Wuhen died,

40
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,790
someone saw you near Chunyue Pavilion.

41
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,880
You were hiding in the shadows.

42
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,200
When Meng Huairui left,

43
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,440
Prince Wuhen was only injured.

44
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,550
It was Prince Wuyin
who sent you to finish the job.

45
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,670
Am I right?

46
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:55,200
If you don't confess,

47
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,710
can Prince Wuyin bear the crime

48
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,440
of killing his own brother?

49
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,640
I'm innocent.

50
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,790
I don't know anything!

51
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,670
Chancellor. I failed you.

52
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,200
Qingfeng took his own life.

53
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,550
Qingfeng is dead.

54
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:24,790
Now only the heavens,

55
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,110
you, and I know the truth.

56
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,830
Prince Wuyin knows nothing.

57
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,160
I'm innocent!

58
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,390
I was framed.

59
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,550
I didn't kill Prince Wuhen!

60
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,230
He hit his head by accident!

61
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:43,880
I swear I'm innocent!

62
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,710
Meng Huairui.

63
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:53,950
Ms. Zhenzhen.

64
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,830
Please, I beg you!

65
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,110
Please.

66
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,880
I've been framed.

67
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,510
Please help me!

68
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,920
From now on, I'll do whatever you say.

69
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:05,710
Please.

70
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,200
I beg you.

71
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,040
I have my parents to support.

72
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,270
Please save me, Ms. Zhenzhen.

73
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,120
My father is frail,
and my mother is sick.

74
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,470
I can't let them bury their son.

75
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,640
They're of the Meng clan.

76
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:22,200
I'll take care of them.

77
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,830
Don't worry.

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,030
Thank you, Ms. Zhenzhen.

79
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:27,910
Thank you, Ms. Zhenzhen.

80
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,880
Thank you, Ms. Zhenzhen.

81
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,240
(Huaijin,)

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,320
(is the moon you watched)

83
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,910
(as cold and distant as tonight's?)

84
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,440
(The Meng family is a huge family.)

85
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,270
(So huge that no number
of lives can repay its sins.)

86
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,880
(Meng Huairui's suicide letter)

87
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,950
(Yet, it's also so small.)

88
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,240
(Once you were gone,)

89
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,880
(it no longer felt like home.)

90
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,240
(Don't worry.)

91
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,030
(The family you gave your life
to protect,)

92
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,680
(I'll guard it with mine.)

93
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,880
Summon!

94
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,150
Right Chancellor Meng requests audience!

95
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,030
Your Majesty,

96
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,200
I failed to discipline the young,

97
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,320
which led

98
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,320
to Meng Huairui daring

99
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,350
to purchase the exam topic.

100
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,350
Please punish me,

101
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:57,880
Your Majesty.

102
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:12,760
I am willing

103
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,150
to resign from overseeing
the imperial exam,

104
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,950
return home,

105
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,560
and live out my days teaching

106
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:23,030
and serving the people.

107
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,270
I ask

108
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,590
that Your Majesty would grant this.

109
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,880
When Huaijin made his mistake,

110
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,910
you said the same thing.

111
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,200
Stepping down twice in one year?

112
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,270
It seems that the official seal

113
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,590
is too heavy for you.

114
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:22,590
The Meng clan

115
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,680
is Qi's top noble house.

116
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,270
With so many descendants,

117
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,710
a few unworthy ones are inevitable.

118
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,200
I'm getting old.

119
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,040
State affairs tire me.

120
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,110
I admit I can't manage it all.

121
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,110
Indeed.

122
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,230
The Meng family truly

123
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,870
is the top noble family in Qi.

124
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,080
Your students are spread
throughout the court.

125
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,910
No official rises

126
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,470
without passing through the Meng's gate.

127
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,200
After a hundred years,

128
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,470
even the appointment of rulers

129
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,840
is subject to the Meng's will.

130
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,080
I would never dare.

131
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,960
It doesn't make any difference

132
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,470
to you whether you resign

133
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,040
from your post.

134
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,040
But have you thought about this?

135
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,430
If the Meng family is no longer
the top noble family,

136
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,080
will the Qin and Duan families

137
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,550
let you retire in peace?

138
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,840
Or will they take the chance

139
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,520
to crush the Mengs
and never let you rise again?

140
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,710
Meng Zhongyan.

141
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,120
You can keep the Chancellor's seal

142
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,280
or leave it.

143
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,550
It's up to you.

144
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,540
(Shen Residence)

145
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,430
Shen Zaiye!

146
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,040
In broad daylight,

147
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,280
you dare arrest my man?

148
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,830
Prince Wuyin, calm down.

149
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,790
The night Prince Wuhen died,

150
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,400
Qingfeng was spotted
at Chunyue Pavilion.

151
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,160
His footprints were also found

152
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,910
at the scene.

153
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,360
Prince Wuhen,

154
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,360
I only came to purchase a jade pendant.

155
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,430
Get lost!

156
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,190
I know that jade pendant
is the exam topic,

157
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,310
and I know you've already sold it
to more than a few.

158
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,120
You...

159
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,880
You will sell it even
if you don't want to!

160
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,800
Let's see what you can bargain with now!

161
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,190
The footprints in the room

162
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,070
match Qingfeng's.

163
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,280
But rest assured, Your Highness.

164
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,790
Since Qingfeng was your trusted aide,

165
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,520
I'll treat him accordingly.

166
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,280
"Accordingly"?

167
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,310
You tortured him, didn't you?

168
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:27,880
Yes, I did.

169
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,760
It turns out Qingfeng knew a lot.

170
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,710
You forced a confession.

171
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,760
Whether it was or not,

172
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,790
that's not for you or me to say.

173
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,160
His Majesty will decide.

174
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,240
Since the Heir fell from favor,

175
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,040
His Majesty only has three sons left.

176
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,430
If His Majesty finds out

177
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,520
that you killed Prince Wuhen

178
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,880
and tried to frame Prince Wuxia,

179
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,000
I wonder

180
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,360
how disappointed he'll be.

181
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,360
Are you really going back on your word

182
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,710
and letting Jiang Taohua die?

183
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,280
I did promise the Meng family

184
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,880
I would drop the case.

185
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,040
But you and I

186
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,670
never made any deal yet.

187
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,430
What else do you want?

188
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,830
I want you to voluntarily withdraw
from overseeing the Imperial Exam.

189
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,120
I thought

190
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,910
you'd keep pushing for the antidote.

191
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,070
Do you even have something

192
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,360
that valuable?

193
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,590
Which is
why I'm asking you to do something

194
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,360
within your reach.

195
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:55,590
Wen Jin,

196
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,000
take this token and release Wuxia
from house arrest.

197
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,120
Restore his position

198
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,640
and reinstate him as chief examiner.

199
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:05,550
Your Majesty,

200
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:08,430
you had Prince Wuyin step in
for Prince Wuxia before.

201
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,240
Will there now be two chief examiners?

202
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,640
Ah, I've forgotten about that.

203
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,120
Two chief examiners
for one Imperial Exam.

204
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,640
It would be a headache
when the top scholar picks a mentor.

205
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,070
No need to worry, Father.

206
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,360
I'm willing

207
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,430
to step down from this appointment.

208
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:29,880
Step down?

209
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,070
This role is something

210
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,550
many would dream of.

211
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,040
Why give it up?

212
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,710
Father,

213
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,950
I merely stepped in to help

214
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,880
when things were in chaos.

215
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:43,880
Besides, you know

216
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:45,480
my heart is not in this.

217
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,550
Besides,

218
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,830
Wuxia surpasses me

219
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,240
in both learning and ability.

220
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,760
He's also well-respected

221
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,430
among the scholars.

222
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:58,910
So it's only right

223
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:00,760
he takes the post again.

224
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,070
You've truly grasped the scholar's path.

225
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,000
You're free from worldly ambition.

226
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,790
That pleases me.

227
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,430
You flatter me, Father.

228
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,640
I'll take my leave now.

229
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:23,670
Prince Wuyin,

230
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,910
Qingfeng's body has been sent back

231
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,160
to your residence.

232
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,760
The Chancellor selected
the finest coffin for him.

233
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,910
He also asked me
to offer his condolences.

234
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,190
He deeply regrets

235
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,880
Qingfeng's passing.

236
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,160
(Shen Zaiye,)

237
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:48,400
(you blocked my path today.)

238
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:49,590
(One day,)

239
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,710
(I'll make that path
the very steps you kneel on.)

240
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,700
(Shunjing Residence)

241
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,710
(This is for you.)

242
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,430
(Qingtai has left Qi for a month now.)

243
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:17,830
(I wonder)

244
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,880
(if she has reached there safely.)

245
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,520
(Has she found Changjue?)

246
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,190
(How is)

247
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,040
(he doing now?)

248
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,940
(Deep within the Suwu Desert)

249
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:56,240
Excuse me.
How far is it to Xingzhou, Beiyuan?

250
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,590
Not far. Just past the desert.

251
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,190
Are there
any Beiyuan military camps nearby?

252
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,070
I don't know.

253
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,120
(Don't worry, Princess.)

254
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,480
(I'll find Prince Changjue
no matter what.)

255
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,400
(If I stay idle too long)

256
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:02,070
(and anything happens,)

257
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:05,240
(I could be a burden
to Qingtai and Changjue.)

258
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,160
(If I can uncover
Empress Lv's background,)

259
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,640
(perhaps I can turn the game
in our favor.)

260
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,640
(I'm alone now.)

261
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,160
(I need an ally.)

262
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:24,300
(Examination Hall)

263
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,040
What are you doing here,
Chancellor Shen?

264
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:49,710
The exam is near.

265
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,910
If I don't get things in order now,
it'll be too late.

266
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,710
As an exam supervisor,

267
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,070
cleaning the site myself

268
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,190
also ensures no one hides
anything suspicious.

269
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,200
Thank you for saving my life,

270
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,110
Chancellor Shen.

271
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,150
Mu Wuxia,

272
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,110
don't just thank him.

273
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,920
She is the one
you should really be grateful to.

274
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,280
Greetings, Prince Wuxia.

275
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,310
I'm glad

276
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,390
to see you safe.

277
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,520
Princess Chengping?

278
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,150
You're...

279
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,630
You're alive.

280
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,520
Of course, she's alive.

281
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,000
She's the real deal. No fakes here.

282
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:05,630
But

283
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,830
where have you been all this time?

284
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:10,790
It's a long story.

285
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,550
Stop asking her so many questions.

286
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:15,480
She still doesn't remember everything.

287
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,310
Don't we have things to do?

288
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,870
Let's get going.

289
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,110
Jiang Taohua, lend my brother a hand.

290
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,720
After you returned that day,

291
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,480
did you feel better?

292
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,280
I'm fine now.

293
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,520
Thank you for your concern.

294
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,350
That's good to hear.

295
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,720
There's something

296
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,350
I'd like you to help with.

297
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:51,720
What is it?

298
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,110
I overheard Prince Wuyin call Empress Lv

299
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,310
by the name Hua.

300
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,870
He seems to treasure her bracelet
like it's sacred.

301
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,960
I just can't figure out

302
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,200
their relationship.

303
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,480
To my knowledge,

304
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,240
Prince Wuyin has never left Qi.

305
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,560
After his coming-of-age ceremony,

306
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,350
he moved straight
into Shunjing Residence.

307
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,680
I've never heard
of any women living there.

308
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,040
When I was little,

309
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,920
Empress Lv was already in Beiyuan Palace

310
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,320
and holding power over the court.

311
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,590
Since then,

312
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,590
I doubt she's had any opportunity
to come to Qi.

313
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:24,830
Let alone meet Prince Wuyin.

314
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,200
I had her background investigated.

315
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,520
Before she entered Beiyuan Palace,

316
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,080
her identity was shrouded in mystery.

317
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,480
Almost as if it were fabricated.

318
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,200
So I suspect

319
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,240
Empress Lv may have once lived
in the Qi Palace.

320
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:43,720
I'll be staying here

321
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,040
during the exam period.

322
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,440
But I'll have a trusted aide
continue investigating.

323
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,480
So you can rest easy.

324
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:50,040
No rush.

325
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,520
I appreciate your help.

326
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,200
I'll find a way to contact you

327
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,040
after the exams are over.

328
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,110
I should go.

329
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,590
What's going on between those two?

330
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,600
Confucius said,

331
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,280
"Don't look at what's improper,
don't listen to what's improper."

332
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,590
After all the trouble
my brother went through to rescue you,

333
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,480
shouldn't you be thinking
of how to repay him?

334
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,840
Do you even have a conscience?

335
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,550
Doing my part right now

336
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,390
is the best way I can repay him.

337
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,790
(Shen Residence)

338
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:44,520
Chancellor.

339
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,920
Chancellor. Imperial Physician Bai
has made a major discovery.

340
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,680
Prepare the horse.

341
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,550
Imperial Physician Bai.

342
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,280
Chancellor.

343
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,240
The antidote you gave me
for the Jiangtao Pill

344
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,870
contains a deadly poison,

345
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,040
which is extremely rare and aggressive.

346
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,200
The monthly dose

347
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:10,680
is actually used
to fight poison with poison

348
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,480
to suppress the Jiangtao Pill.

349
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:14,840
In my opinion,

350
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,550
using acupuncture to draw out the poison

351
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,310
might be another way.

352
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:20,530
All right.

353
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:22,130
All right.

354
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:29,740
(Yujing)

355
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,630
Before anyone enters
the Examination Hall,

356
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,720
you will be thoroughly searched

357
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,960
from the top of the head

358
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,200
to the soles of the feet.

359
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,790
There must

360
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,480
be no cheating this time.

361
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,000
If any of you discover

362
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,720
bribery or misconduct,

363
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,920
report it to me directly.

364
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,720
I've obtained imperial permission

365
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,440
that anyone caught cheating

366
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,000
will be executed on the spot.

367
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,700
That's great.

368
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,920
That's how it should be.

369
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:57,520
You've all likely heard

370
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,870
about the exam leak earlier.

371
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,390
To prevent it from happening again,

372
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:05,000
I've requested special orders
from His Majesty.

373
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:08,790
I will personally set the topic
on the spot this time.

374
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,440
Long live our wise ruler.

375
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,760
Prince Wuxia,
you're meticulous in your judgment.

376
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,920
- Long live our wise ruler!
- Long live our wise ruler!

377
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:27,310
Examinees, enter the hall!

378
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,920
(These humble scholars)

379
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,070
(are Qi's future.)

380
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:42,960
(There will be)

381
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,000
(no more tragedies like Jiaohan's.)

382
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:49,000
(The just world
that Mr. Nobody dreamed of)

383
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,480
(will come.)

384
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,150
You treat him as a brother.

385
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,200
But has he ever treated you the same?

386
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,960
He's never shown any special affection.

387
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,720
But he's never been unkind either.

388
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,480
He was being courteous.

389
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,590
You actually believe that?

390
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,680
What are you, a child?

391
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,040
You're not young anymore.

392
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,600
You should know how the world works.

393
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,630
In a power struggle like this,

394
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,520
it doesn't end

395
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,520
until one side falls.

396
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,630
If you don't strike first,

397
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,110
you'll always be at their mercy.

398
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:48,630
(Hua,)

399
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,310
(I'll do as you say.)

400
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,760
(I won't disappoint you this time.)

401
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,790
Return to the residence.

402
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,630
(Father,)

403
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,280
(the Examination Hall
you fought so hard to protect)

404
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,110
(is finally bearing fruit.)

405
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,520
(Memorial Tablet of Xie Guanyu)

406
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,320
(From now on,
even the humblest scholars)

407
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,760
(will have a place in court.)

408
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,110
(The monopoly of the noble clans
will come to an end.)

409
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,790
(Xie)

410
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:21,680
(I've fulfilled)

411
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,760
(your wish.)

412
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,070
(And one day,)

413
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,830
(I'll clear the name
of the entire Xie clan.)

414
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,110
(You can rest in peace.)

415
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,980
(Xie Clan Memorial Tablets)

416
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:44,780
(Examination Hall)

417
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,150
Chancellor Shen.

418
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,960
The Examination Hall
is under lockdown for grading.

419
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,920
Who dares to cause a disturbance?

420
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,000
Leave immediately!

421
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,310
Zhan Lu,

422
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,200
you've got some nerve!

423
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:48,040
I played this piece for Mu Wuxia!

424
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,280
You don't deserve to hear it!

425
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,390
Cover your ears!

426
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,200
Miss Qingying.

427
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,110
Miss Qingying.

428
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:14,870
Miss Qingying,

429
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,920
this is the grading period.

430
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,630
Don't you think playing music here

431
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,200
is inappropriate?

432
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:22,680
But I wanted to see you,

433
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,350
and you won't let me in.

434
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,070
I know how hard you've been working.

435
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,110
This is my only way

436
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,350
to help you relax!

437
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,110
Still,

438
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,830
you will disturb the others

439
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,590
by playing out here.

440
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:41,590
Fine, I'll leave.

441
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:43,680
Wait.

442
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:47,920
How about this?

443
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,870
Let's play a piece together.

444
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,000
What do you think?

445
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,590
You play the qin too?

446
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,560
All right.

447
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,950
Let's play a duet then.

448
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,630
Chancellor,

449
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,630
I found something about the person

450
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,920
you asked me to investigate.

451
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:15,920
She's from the palace?

452
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:18,520
Yes. When Prince Wuyin
was a child in the palace,

453
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:21,040
there was a maid named Hua.

454
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,310
Back then,

455
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,310
Prince Wuyin's sister,

456
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:26,150
Princess Jinrong, suddenly passed away.

457
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:27,920
He won't let anyone

458
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,280
get close to him.

459
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:32,000
Only Hua

460
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,000
was different from the rest.

461
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,310
Get out! All of you!

462
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,760
Why are you still here?

463
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:47,920
Your Highness,

464
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:50,310
my duty is to care for you.

465
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,790
Usually, it was my elder sister
who looked after me.

466
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:54,240
What's your name?

467
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,680
My name is Hua.

468
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:58,960
That palace maid,
Hua, must've had some skill.

469
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,390
She had Prince Wuyin wrapped
around her little finger.

470
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,680
But one day,

471
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,240
she just vanished for no reason.

472
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,790
There's something else strange.

473
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,760
When I went to the Imperial Clan Court
to check the records,

474
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,000
the records on Hua

475
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,310
are all missing.

476
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:23,720
Thank you, Eunuch Wen.

477
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:37,760
(Shunjing Residence)

478
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,350
Shen Zaiye, huh?

479
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,830
(Daily Record of Prince Mu Wuyin)

480
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,630
You've reached much farther
than you should.

481
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,830
Who leaked Hua's existence?

482
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:48,520
Your Highness,
I've served you for years.

483
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,000
I've never once betrayed you.

484
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,440
Heaven and earth can attest!

485
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:59,680
These are my memories with Hua.

486
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:02,680
I've kept them for years.

487
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,550
How did Shen Zaiye find out?

488
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:42,790
Could Qingfeng have said
something before he died?

489
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,680
If he had said something
about it before he died,

490
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,480
Shen Zaiye wouldn't have let me off

491
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,590
with just quitting the exams.

492
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,280
Your Highness,

493
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,520
remember that fire
in the side courtyard?

494
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,680
Shen Zaiye arrived unusually fast,

495
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,000
and Jiang Taohua never returned
that night.

496
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,440
Could

497
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,920
she know something?

498
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,400
Jiang Taohua.

499
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,920
If I hadn't needed her

500
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,590
to keep Shen Zaiye in check,

501
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,070
I would've let the poison take her
long ago.

502
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,870
Bring her to me.

503
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,200
Yes, Your Highness.

504
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,760
Greetings, Your Highness.

505
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,240
Miss Meng,

506
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,680
it's only been a few days.

507
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,390
You look well.

508
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,520
Thanks to your care,

509
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:56,720
the servants have treated me kindly.

510
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,790
That's the problem.
They've been too kind

511
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:02,110
and have let you wander

512
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,150
wherever you please.

513
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,390
So now you know things

514
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,480
you shouldn't.

515
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,480
And worse, you're remembering things

516
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,550
you shouldn't!

517
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,040
Your Highness, what do you mean?

518
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:14,790
My brother's and my life

519
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:15,920
are in your hands.

520
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:17,720
Even if I did recall something,

521
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,760
I would never betray you.

522
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,680
You have such a lovely face.

523
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,000
I can't help but feel sorry for it.

524
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,280
If I carved a few lines

525
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:34,150
and disfigured you,

526
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:37,550
would Shen Zaiye still love you
and protect you?

527
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,040
What Shen Zaiye thinks

528
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,440
has nothing to do with me.

529
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,680
All I ask is

530
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,480
that you let me and Changjue

531
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,350
live in peace.

532
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,310
If you want to survive,

533
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,200
you'd better make yourself useful

534
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,520
and keep Shen Zaiye in check.

535
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,550
Yes, Your Highness.

536
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:02,520
I'll do it at once.

537
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:14,830
Your Highness,

538
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,040
do you really trust her?

539
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,520
As long as we have the antidote

540
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,280
and Jiang Changjue in our hands,

541
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,480
Jiang Taohua won't be able
to stir up anything.

542
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,350
She'll always be Shen Zaiye's weakness.

543
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,240
(Zhengchun Boudoir)

544
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,480
To avoid alarming anyone,

545
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,040
you must stop investigating.

546
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,760
Did Prince Wuyin suspect you?

547
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,110
Prince Wuyin

548
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,240
trusts me completely now.

549
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:55,630
By the way,

550
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,870
did you receive
any letters from Qingtai?

551
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:01,720
Qingtai?

552
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,070
Didn't she go to Beiyuan
to find her family?

553
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,360
Why would she send letters
to the Chancellor's residence?

554
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,480
If she were to write to me,

555
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,640
this is the only place
she could send them.

556
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,520
She has been gone for over a month.

557
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,480
But there's still no word from her.

558
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,150
I can receive her letters for you.

559
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,070
But only if you answer one question.

560
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,550
What is it?

561
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,880
Why did you send Qingtai to Beiyuan?

562
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:25,110
If it's something dangerous,

563
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,710
I don't mind getting dragged in.

564
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,920
But I'd still like to be prepared.

565
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,040
I only asked her to find Changjue

566
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,550
in Xingzhou, Beiyuan, nothing more.

567
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,040
Don't worry, Chancellor.

568
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,400
And once she finds him?

569
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,520
I don't think

570
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:42,150
that is your concern, right?

571
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,230
Speaking of Changjue,

572
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,190
I found a letter

573
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,590
he once wrote to you.

574
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,110
I put it back where I found it.

575
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,440
Do you remember the secret compartment?

576
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:07,440
It's Qingtai.

577
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,880
Qingtai once told me about it.

578
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,440
If you're set on finding Changjue,

579
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:18,320
perhaps

580
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,480
I can help you soon.

581
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,960
Imperial Physician Bai is working on
a permanent cure for the Jiangtao Pill.

582
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,150
Once it's complete,

583
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,360
you'll be free of it for good.

584
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,270
Thank you for your help.

585
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,230
How do you plan to repay me?

586
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,230
You're

587
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:38,630
Left Chancellor.

588
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,880
You already have wealth, status,
and power.

589
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,230
What could I possibly give you?

590
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,920
How about

591
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:47,320
a simple meal with me?

592
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:49,630
What do you mean?

593
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,000
Nothing.

594
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:54,590
I just realized

595
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,550
we've never sat down for a meal

596
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:57,880
without hidden agendas.

597
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:06,400
Zhan Lu.

598
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,150
Yes, Chancellor.

599
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,480
Tell the kitchen
to prepare some ingredients.

600
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,550
Shrimps too.

601
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,590
Do you want them steamed
or sweet-and-sour?

602
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:18,360
I'll inform them...

603
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,230
I'll cook it myself.

604
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,070
Yes, sir.

605
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,960
Since you made them for me,

606
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:37,920
then I'll savor every bite.

607
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,460
(Zhengchun Boudoir)

608
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,440
Would you like to cook with me?

609
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,800
- We once...
- Chancellor Shen,

610
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,710
I can't stand the smell
of oil and smoke.

611
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,000
Very well.

612
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:11,880
Then wait here for me.

613
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,070
(This tree has deep roots
and lush leaves.)

614
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:41,920
(It blossoms year after year.)

615
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,630
(But when the storm hits,)

616
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,410
(the tree remains,)

617
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,270
(yet the flowers are gone.)

618
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,800
(So,)

619
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,670
(why cling to foolish hopes?)

620
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,270
(Pushing you out of this game)

621
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,992
(is the least I can do
for all you've done for me.)

628
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:47,710
Zhan Lu,

629
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,880
head to Xingzhou, Beiyuan,
to find Qingtai and Changjue.

630
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:52,400
Qingtai

631
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:53,670
is in Xingzhou, Beiyuan?

632
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,110
Taohua sent her to look for Changjue.

633
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:57,590
The two of them

634
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,440
mean a great deal to her.

635
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,440
Nothing must happen to either of them.

636
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,840
But Chancellor,

637
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,880
you've done so much
for the Princess already.

638
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,600
There's no guarantee she'll be grateful.

639
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,190
I don't need her gratitude.

640
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,360
I'll depart immediately.

641
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,920
Imperial Physician Bai,

642
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,440
any progress?

643
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,360
Chancellor,

644
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:30,040
I used acupuncture
to release the poisoned blood

645
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,000
and supplemented it
with qi-enhancing medicine.

646
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:35,040
One of the test subjects
has survived for over a month.

647
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:36,800
Where is he? Take me to him.

648
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:37,880
Please follow me.

649
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:45,960
All poisons

650
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,550
depend on the dose.

651
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:50,000
With proper control,
they can even help restore one's qi.

652
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:58,630
It seems this bloodletting method

653
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:01,440
can only buy time
before the poison takes effect.

654
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:05,440
To find the cure
for the Jiangtao Pill's poison,

655
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,070
I will need to try other methods.

656
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,600
Imperial Physician Bai is working on

657
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,240
a permanent cure for the Jiangtao Pill.

658
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,070
Once it's complete,

659
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,230
you'll be free of it for good.

660
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,750
(I can't give her hope)

661
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,590
(only to crush it again.)

662
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:35,960
Well done.

663
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,710
He's clearly a promising talent.

664
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,320
What can I do for you, Chancellor?

665
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,630
The imperial exams are now awaiting
the final decree from His Majesty.

666
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,960
Once the results are posted,

667
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,270
I intend to travel to Beiyuan.

668
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,520
To Beiyuan?

669
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,710
That round trip

670
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,960
will take quite some time.

671
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:00,920
What about your duties?

672
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,750
I've requested leave from His Majesty.

673
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:05,040
The Imperial Secretariat
will handle them.

674
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,270
You've served the court for years
and never once taken leave.

675
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:09,640
Are you going

676
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,280
to find Princess Chengping's medicine?

677
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:14,360
But I also want
to investigate Empress Lv.

678
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,880
I suspect everything
that had happened around the exams

679
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:17,960
is tied to her.

680
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,230
With her temperament,

681
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:22,150
she won't let such a defeat

682
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:23,800
go unanswered.

683
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:25,750
While I'm away,

684
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:26,920
take care of Wuxia.

685
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,240
Please rest assured, Chancellor.

686
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,600
I'll stay vigilant at all times.

687
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:32,880
(Taohua, don't worry.)

688
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,590
(I'll bring back the cure myself)

689
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,110
