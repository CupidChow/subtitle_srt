I can't tell you what's on my mind

178
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:03,640
I'm willing to struggle in the mud

179
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:10,640
Regret is killing in despair

180
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:17,640
I'm afraid that he will only hold my hand

181
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:22,640
Even if I have to cut myself off

182
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:27,640
I'm willing to struggle in the mud

183
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:39,640
I'm afraid that he will be oppressed by the world

184
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:46,640
Listen to what he said

185
00:04:46,640 --> 00:05:01,640
It turns out that he has a sincere answer

186
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:15,640
The End

187
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,640
Report to Master

188
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,640
After the funeral, Shen Zai also rushed to save the family

189
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:24,640
It seems that the woman is Jiang Taohua

190
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,640
But she didn't die

191
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,640
Why is she in the Third Prince's mansion for a long time?

192
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,640
Could it be that the Third Prince and Shen Zai have some kind of feud?

193
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,640
Do you want me to investigate?

194
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,640
It doesn't matter

195
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,640
The enemy of the enemy is a friend

196
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,640
Let's watch the show

197
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,640
This person may be my enemy

198
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,640
I will give you an answer

199
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,640
No need

200
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,640
I just pretend to be a false alarm

201
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:15,640
Why does the Prime Minister know that I am here?

202
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,640
His Majesty's eunuch said he saw you in the Third Prince's mansion

203
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,640
His Majesty wanted to call you to the palace to see it in person

204
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,640
Fortunately, the Third Prince has already found other women to enter the platform

205
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,640
The Prime Minister is really great

206
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,640
He can't get past you in small matters

207
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,640
There are only people who care about it

208
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,640
The imperial doctor said

209
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,640
You should go to a familiar place

210
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,640
It helps to recover your mind

211
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,640
I have to stay in the palace

212
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,640
I will go to the palace

213
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,640
I have to stay in the Third Prince's mansion

214
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,640
Looking for Qingtai

215
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,640
Yes

216
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,640
Shen Zaiye

217
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,640
Although you saved me

218
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,640
But no matter what kind of past we had

219
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,640
I have to go back and figure out

220
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,640
The relationship between the Lv Hou and the Third Prince

221
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,640
This Lv Hou really has the same eyes

222
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,640
Even the Third Prince was taken back by him

223
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,640
The poison of the ginger peach

224
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,640
Go to the Eunuch

225
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,640
Eunuch Yuan is dead

226
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,640
Now I only have the antidote in the Third Prince's mansion

227
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,640
Zhan Lu, hurry up

228
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,640
Go

229
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,640
I will go by myself

230
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,640
I'm worried about you going back

231
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,640
The Third Prince lied to you everywhere

232
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:36,640
You have no intention of going back to the

233
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,640
If I go back with you

234
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,640
For him

235
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,640
I'm really a waste

236
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,640
Goodbye

237
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,640
Jiang Dahuang

238
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,640
I will find a way to cure you

239
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,640
Help you get out of the city

240
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,640
So you don't have to live in silence

241
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,640
In the face of this world

242
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,640
Must

243
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,640
Then

244
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,640
I will go

245
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,640
I will go

246
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,640
I will go

247
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,640
I will go

248
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,640
Meng'er, just bear with it for a while

249
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,640
The doctor will be here soon

250
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,640
It's useless

251
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,640
I am the daughter of You Nian

252
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,640
Only the one who is wronged

253
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,640
He only needs to be used

254
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,640
Otherwise, it is difficult to save

255
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,640
I only ask you one thing

256
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,640
You say

257
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,640
After Meng'er is gone

258
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,640
I still ask you not to tell anyone

259
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,640
Why?

260
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,640
My brother Chang Que

261
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,640
Is in the north camp

262
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,640
I want him to think that

263
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,640
I am living well in Daji

264
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,640
So your feelings are very deep

265
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,640
Yes

266
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,640
For Chang Que

267
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,640
I would do anything

268
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,640
Take it

269
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,640
The third prince really has the antidote

270
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,640
It seems that he and Lv Heng

271
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,640
Are really partners

272
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,640
Your Highness

273
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,640
How do you have the antidote for the pill?

274
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,640
I am the owner of the Lan Yi Pavilion

275
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,640
Lan Yi Pavilion

276
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,640
I am his god

277
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,640
You are a man of no shame

278
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,640
It's him

279
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,640
Your life in the future

280
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,640
Your brother's life

281
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,640
You have it all

282
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,640
Yes

283
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,640
I will do as you say

284
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,640
When the Lan Yi Pavilion is rebuilt

285
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,640
You will be useful

286
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,640
Your Highness

287
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,640
Is this a thing?

288
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,640
No

289
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:44,640
Has the doctor talked to cousin Lailiang?

290
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,640
The doctor reminded the doctor

291
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,640
There is no hematoma

292
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,640
Or these kinds of things

293
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,640
I read it

294
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,640
He was perfect

295
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,640
Anyway

296
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,640
Your Highness

297
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,640
to the Prime Minister.

298
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,240
Yes.

299
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,480
Prime Minister,

300
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,040
what should we do

301
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,720
without the antidote?

302
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,680
I won't go to him again

303
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,040
to prevent him from causing trouble.

304
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,320
Don't worry about him.

305
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,600
When I'm done with everything,

306
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,560
I'll let you go back to your home.

307
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,280
I'll go.

308
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,160
As long as I'm at home,

309
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,440
I'll satisfy you.

310
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,120
It's just...

311
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,400
Sometimes, I'll go to your house...

312
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,080
Don't talk too much.

313
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,200
I was delayed for a day yesterday.

314
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,320
I have to find Qingtan today.

315
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,560
It's just...

316
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,440
How can I go to that house?

317
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,960
Miss Meng Ruo, time for dinner.

318
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,600
No.

319
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,000
Come with me.

320
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,440
Go?

321
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,840
Where are you going?

322
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,480
I dreamed of a giant snake coming from the sky last night.

323
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,480
I heard it from someone.

324
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,600
It's a sign of a bad situation in the mansion.

325
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,200
I want to go to the temple nearby

326
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,960
to ask for a protective talisman for the Third Prince

327
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,760
to keep the mansion safe.

328
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,480
But Lord Qingfeng told me

329
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,800
that you can't go out.

330
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,520
In this mansion,

331
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,920
is Lord Qingfeng

332
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,160
or the Third Prince the big one?

333
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,520
The Third Prince is the big one.

334
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,400
Do you know that the Third Prince

335
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,440
has always been a man of his word?

336
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,760
He had a dream about me.

337
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,320
But you stopped him.

338
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,160
I'll go to the Third Prince

339
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,320
and tell him about this.

340
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,200
If he really ruins the family business

341
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,080
that the Third Prince has worked hard for years,

342
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,080
it's not something

343
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,120
that you and I can take responsibility for.

344
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,720
Please forgive me.

345
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,280
If you want to pray in the temple,

346
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,680
I'll go with you.

347
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,720
Please.

348
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,600
Okay.

349
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:11,260
The

350
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,040
cloth room is here.

351
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,200
Miss.

352
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,760
Miss.

353
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,440
Didn't you go to the temple to pray?

354
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,800
Why are you here in the cloth room?

355
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,160
You're a little boy.

356
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,880
You really don't know women.

357
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,640
Every woman

358
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,160
wears new clothes

359
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,040
when she goes out to buy rouge and powder.

360
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,880
Who is this lady?

361
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,000
She's so famous.

362
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,240
She's so popular that

363
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,360
I'm so happy.

364
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,480
Miss.

365
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,520
Just look around.

366
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,240
Just tell me what you like.

367
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,880
Look at my mouth.

368
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,160
I'm fair-skinned,

369
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,200
beautiful and noble.

370
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,040
How can I look at such a vulgar thing?

371
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,320
This way, please.

372
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,880
This is the best part of martial arts.

373
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:58,920
Look.

374
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,360
That's it.

375
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,280
Okay.

376
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,120
Miss, this way, please.

377
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,240
You're a talented woman.

378
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,880
Why are you so excited?

379
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,440
I...

380
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,920
I'm not even a little bit shy.

381
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,960
Wait outside.

382
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,200
Miss.

383
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:23,840
Shopkeeper.

384
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,120
Do you have tea?

385
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,440
I have some cold drinks.

386
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,560
Please wait a moment.

387
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,400
I'll go get them.

388
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,680
Miss.

389
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,240
I just heated it up.

390
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,080
Miss.

391
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,960
Where is she?

392
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,480
I...

393
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,600
I don't know.

394
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,640
I'm from the Third Prince's Mansion.

395
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,920
I can't find my wife today.

396
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,960
I'm not done with you.

397
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,800
She didn't die.

398
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,840
She must have gone to the third prince's mansion.

399
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,000
Master.

400
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,920
The scout reported that

401
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,440
the princess and Yi Xiaosi left the mansion.

402
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,120
But they left Xiaosi

403
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,600
and went to the city.

404
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,160
The Third Prince never let Jiang Dahua

405
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,200
leave the mansion alone.

406
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:29,680
Zhan Lu.

407
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,360
Come with me.

408
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,240
I lost Miss Meng.

409
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,480
Please punish me.

410
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,520
You're not qualified to be a master.

411
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:43,960
Get lost.

412
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,760
It's you again.

413
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,880
How dare you come here again?

414
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,080
You're under arrest again.

415
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:17,440
photocopying

416
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,200
and selling books.

417
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,600
I will kill you.

418
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,480
Open your mouth.

419
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,640
Lv Heng.

420
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,720
Why is he in the Great Qi?

421
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,200
There are also the Third Prince's companions.

422
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,080
They are indeed a soul.

423
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,160
You have a sharp tongue and a sharp tongue.

424
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,640
I should have sent you to see Yan Wang.

425
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,920
You will not die a good death.

426
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,000
Continue.

427
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,880
If you continue to fight like this,

428
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,400
please kill him.

429
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,160
No.

430
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,800
I have to find a way.

431
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,560
No.

432
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,360
Bad news.

433
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,120
He is drowning.

434
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,280
Someone, come here.

435
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,120
Someone, come here.

436
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,400
Bad news.

437
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,120
I am the Great Qi.

438
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,200
Go and report to Master.

439
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,400
Your Highness.

440
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,520
There is a water in the backyard.

441
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,800
Master, report.

442
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,680
The fire is fierce.

443
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,680
I am afraid it will not be extinguished for a while.

444
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,240
This fire is different from the usual.

445
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,760
It may expose the identity.

446
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:01,840
Kill him.

447
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:02,800
Yes.

448
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,360
Tell everyone to leave this place.

449
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,040
Don't leave a trace.

450
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,140
ááLi Dangiáá

451
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,680
Xia bankruptcy!

452
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,560
and love

453
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,840
are gathered tonight.

454
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,980
Why are you in here?

455
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:03,960
Find out who caught Your Highness of the disciples.

456
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,720
Jiang Dahua,

457
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,920
please protect us.

458
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,120
You can't die.

459
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,420
You can't die too.

460
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,840
Jiang Dahua, please wake up.

461
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,440
Wake up.

462
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,060
I'm a coward, a coward, a coward.

463
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:22,320
I'm a coward, a coward, a coward.

464
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,960
I'm a coward, a coward, a coward.

465
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,720
So what if I'm a concubine?

466
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,260
I'm not afraid of being a concubine.

467
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,800
It's just that in the garden of the Prime Minister,

468
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,960
I'm not the only one who's missing.

469
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,240
If I could stay here for a long time,

470
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,040
stay away from the disputes in court,

471
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,040
how good would that be?

472
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,360
It's you.

473
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,360
You're the one who killed me,

474
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,360
and you're the one who wants to kill me.

475
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,560
But you're the one who saved me,

476
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,560
and you're the one who cared about me.

477
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,040
Shen Caiying.

478
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,040
I didn't expect that you and I

479
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,040
would end up like this.

480
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,040
Xiao Dahuang.

481
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,040
Qingtai. Qingtai.

482
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,040
Zhanluo is taking care of her.

483
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,040
Qingtai, hang in there.

484
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,040
Qingtai.

485
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,040
Qingtai. Qingtai.

486
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,040
Qingtai, hang in there.

487
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,040
No matter what, you have to survive.

488
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,040
Qingtai. Qingtai.

489
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,040
Qingtai. Qingtai.

490
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,040
It hurts.

491
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,040
I know. I know.

492
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,040
Don't worry.

493
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,040
I won't let Lv Houchi off.

494
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,040
I'll kill him.

495
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,040
No.

496
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:25,040
Lv Houchi is determined to be the best.

497
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,040
If he's killed,

498
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,040
you'll be in trouble.

499
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,040
Many people will die if you're killed.

500
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,040
Promise me.

501
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,040
Don't go.

502
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,040
Okay. I promise you.

503
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,040
Don't go.

504
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,040
Qingtai.

505
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,040
Hang in there.

506
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,040
You'll be fine.

507
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,040
You'll be fine.

508
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,040
Master.

509
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,040
Everyone in the yard has escaped.

510
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,040
Save them first.

511
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,040
I'll get a carriage.

512
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,040
Qingtai.

513
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,040
Don't sleep, Qingtai.

514
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,040
Qingtai.

515
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,040
Qingtai.

516
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,040
You...

517
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,040
You should be gentle, doctor.

518
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,040
Qingtai.

519
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,040
Doctor, be gentle.

520
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,040
Be gentle.

521
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,040
This is a bone wound.

522
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,040
You need to sew it.

523
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,040
It's light.

524
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,040
How can you treat it?

525
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,040
Calm down.

526
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,040
I'll get you a doctor.

527
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,040
If you need anything,

528
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,040
just tell me.

529
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,040
Go get some hot water.

530
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,040
Doctor, he might be alive.

531
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,040
The murder weapon

532
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,040
is indeed a part of his important organs.

533
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,040
Luckily, you found it in time.

534
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,040
I'll sew the organs of this girl now.

535
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,040
Because he lost too much blood,

536
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,040
we can only use drugs for now.

537
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,040
Let him rest for a while.

538
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,040
He'll be able to recover in ten days.

539
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,040
This girl should be able to survive.

540
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,040
Thank you, doctor.

541
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,040
It's okay, Qingtai.

542
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,040
Zhan Lu.

543
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,040
Qingtai.

544
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,040
Qingtai.

545
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,040
Zhan Lu.

546
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,040
Please take care of Qingtai.

547
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,040
Prime Minister.

548
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,040
Thank you for saving my life.

549
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,040
There's no need to thank me.

550
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,040
Meng Er has no power or power.

551
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,040
I can only thank you.

552
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,040
I'm thinking

553
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,040
how to capture Li Hou

554
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,040
so as not to hurt you and your brother.

555
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,040
Changjue and I

556
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,040
are in his hands.

557
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,040
If there's no way out,

558
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,040
please forgive me.

559
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,040
Now that it's come to this,

560
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,040
you still don't believe

561
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,040
that we used to...

562
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,040
If it were Shen Xiang,

563
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,040
would you believe others?

564
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,040
I said I was saving someone,

565
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,040
but you locked me in the bridal chamber.

566
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,040
Is this what you call faith?

567
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,040
I've never really believed you.

568
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,040
I've never believed you.

569
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,040
Now that they have hurt Qingtai,

570
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,040
how are you going to explain

571
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,040
to him when you return to the Third Prince's Manor?

572
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,040
The longer I leave,

573
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,040
the harder it will be to explain.

574
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,040
If Qingtai wakes up,

575
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,040
please tell me how to do it.

576
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,040
Goodbye.

577
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,040
If he knows that I've recovered,

578
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,040
he will definitely keep me.

579
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,040
If he wants to get close to the Third Prince,

580
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,040
he'll stop him from getting in.

581
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,040
Shen Zaiye,

582
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:19,040
it's best if you and I don't get to know each other.

583
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,040
You haven't returned for a night.

584
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,040
You're still in the manor.

585
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,040
You haven't returned for a night.

586
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:49,040
You're acting like a

587
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,040
You must always remember,

588
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,040
that your life and your brother's life

589
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,040
are in my hands.

590
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,040
Miss Mo'er,

591
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,040
there are two sides to things,

592
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,040
but you can't think about it again and again.

593
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,040
Do you understand?

594
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,040
I will remember it.

595
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,040
Shen Zaiye,

596
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,040
the Prime Minister and the Fourth Prince have arrived.

597
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,040
I've read the strategy.

598
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,040
You two are usually self-disciplined.

599
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,040
You're talented.

600
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,040
Then help me see

601
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,040
how his strategy is.

602
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,040
Father,

603
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,040
this strategy is

604
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,040
the highest strategy of the Anbang Empire.

605
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,040
It's just thinking and writing.

606
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:56,040
And this style...

607
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:02,040
He's just waiting for the official to be sealed.

608
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,040
This is like a filial piety to the Prime Minister.

609
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,040
Prime Minister,

610
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,040
what do you think?

611
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,040
It's a good strategy.

612
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,040
Just like what the Fourth Prince said,

613
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,040
it seems to lack some content.

614
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,040
But...

615
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,040
Your study

616
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,040
should be quiet.

617
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,040
Thank you for your advice.

618
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:44,040
I will work harder in the future.

619
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,040
Did you really do this article?

620
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,040
I'm a scholar.

621
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,040
I'm arrogant.

622
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,040
I hope you don't mind.

623
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,040
But I think...

624
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,040
Mo Huarui,

625
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,040
you're a wise man.

626
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,040
You won't be blinded by talent.

627
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,040
If you have something to say,

628
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,040
you can go back and make it up to me.

629
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,040
Then we can settle it.

630
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,040
What do you think?

631
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,040
You're thoughtful.

632
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,040
Go back and make some adjustments.

633
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,040
Then show me.

634
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,040
I'm looking forward to your great work.

635
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,040
Thank you, Your Majesty.

636
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,040
I will do my best to solve the problem.

637
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,040
I will do my best to solve the problem.

638
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,040
I won't ask for more.

639
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,040
You may rise.

640
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,040
Thank you, Your Majesty.

641
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,040
Fourth Prince,

642
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,040
Princess Lan has a family dinner.

643
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,040
You can stay.

644
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,040
I'll leave now.

645
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,040
Uncle,

646
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,040
Huarui is here to see you.

647
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,040
You should have asked me to come.

648
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,040
You're so capable.

649
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,040
How dare you sit and do it?

650
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,040
Why can't I do it?

651
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,040
I asked you to be the head of the family.

652
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,040
I heard you were in trouble.

653
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:34,040
Third Prince ran away after talking to you.

654
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,040
You're so smart.

655
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,040
I told you.

656
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,040
What can a woman do?

657
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,040
I don't understand.

658
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,040
Why did he follow you?

659
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,040
It's up to the woman

660
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,040
whether she can do it or not.

661
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,040
Let me ask you.

662
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,040
You came to see His Majesty with another article.

663
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,040
What is another article?

664
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,040
I wrote it.

665
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,040
Li Jiahan is close to Fourth Prince.

666
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,040
Do you think he will let you do it?

667
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,040
I made some changes when I was in the court.

668
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,040
He should...

669
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,040
Wen Ruo,

670
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,040
you're a different person.

671
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,040
Can't you recognize it?

672
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,040
When the Crown Prince was alive,

673
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:27,040
Meng family was the most powerful family in the court.

674
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,040
Now Meng family has no one to rely on.

675
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,040
Once there's a trouble,

676
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,040
they will be attacked by other families.

677
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,040
Can you bear the consequences?

678
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,040
I'll show you two ways.

679
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,040
First, Meng family will kidnap you and kidnap you.

680
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,040
You can be released.

681
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,040
Your Grace.

682
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,040
Your Grace, please don't.

683
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,040
Your Grace.

684
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,040
I can't bear it.

685
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,040
Your Grace.

686
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,040
Your Grace.

687
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,040
Your Grace, I have to go.

688
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,040
Then you should get it done.

689
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,040
But the ugly thing is,

690
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,040
once there's a trouble,

691
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,040
Meng family will be the first to jump out and impeach you.

692
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,040
You'll be sentenced to death.

693
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,040
I'll deal with you myself.

694
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,040
From now on, you'll do as I say.

695
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,040
I'll do as you say.

696
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,040
Can you do it?

697
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,040
I'll do it by your order.

698
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,120
The

699
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,040
today's article is a bit strange.

700
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,040
A few days ago,

701
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,040
the Fourth Prince looked very similar to the courtiers.

702
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,040
Although the two articles are a little different,

703
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,040
but the content is like a piece of art.

704
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:13,040
Could it be that Meng Huai Rui plagiarized Li Jiu Han?

705
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,040
You did this article?

706
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,040
Zhang Lu, get ready.

707
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,040
Li Jiu Han.

708
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,040
Li Jiu Han.

709
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,040
Li Jiu Han.

710
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,040
Your Grace.

711
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,040
There are traces of struggle at the wrist.

712
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,040
There's blood on the nails.

713
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,040
There's a trace of a tear on the neck.

714
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,040
Li Jiu Han.

715
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,040
You're the most talented person in the world.

716
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,040
This person is indeed unqualified and unqualified.

717
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,040
But his talent is even better than mine.

718
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,040
If this kind of person can't get the important ones,

719
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,040
how can our Qi be able to get a higher level?

720
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:04,040
Are you questioning the nine-level loyalty?

721
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,040
The nine-level loyalty was promoted back then.

722
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,040
There must be a source of its time.

723
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,040
But now, time has passed.

724
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,040
Our Qi is heavily rooted in civil and martial arts.

725
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,040
The martial arts have always been strong.

726
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,040
But because of this promotion,

727
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:21,040
so many students from the Han Sect have gone astray.

728
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:27,040
If these students have been so cold and run away from their home,

729
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:31,040
wouldn't we have committed our own mistakes?

730
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,040
So you mean,

731
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,040
we should separate the students from the students of the world

732
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:41,040
and then use them for the exam to gain the hearts of the students.

733
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,040
But if the Han Sect can get the students,

734
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,040
and the Han Sect can easily get into the official field,

735
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,040
then the world will be in chaos.

736
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:53,040
What are you trying to do?

737
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,040
You...

738
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,040
Your Majesty,

739
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,040
I have a clear vision.

740
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:05,040
I am doing this for the sake of the people,

741
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,040
for the sake of our Qi,

742
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,040
for the sake of the future generations.

743
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,040
Minister, don't get agitated.

744
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,040
The position is big,

745
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,040
but as Minister Mo said,

746
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,040
it concerns the foundation of the country.

747
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,040
We need to think about it from the beginning.

748
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,040
Let me think about it again.

749
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,040
I will give you the answer.

750
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,040
Your Majesty.

751
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,040
Leave us.

752
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,040
Yes.

753
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,040
Father.

754
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,040
An'er, why are you here?

755
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,040
Father,

756
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,040
Father,

757
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,040
are you okay?

758
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,040
Well...

759
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,040
Father,

760
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,040
are you giving up again?

761
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,040
No.

762
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,040
I have decided that

763
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,040
even if I have to risk my life,

764
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:04,040
I will find a way out for the Han Sect students.

765
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,040
I will not let those scholars

766
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,040
take away my position.

767
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,040
Minister.

768
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,040
Minister.

769
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,040
It is obvious that

770
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,040
it is a suicide by pretending to be a murder.

771
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,040
I will go to the Yujing Gate now

772
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,040
and let them handle it.

773
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,040
No.

774
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,040
You want the coroner to say that

775
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,040
Yan Cheng is a suicide.

776
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,040
Well...

777
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,040
Brother Li.

778
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,040
I know who did this to you.

779
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,040
Don't worry.

780
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,040
I will do justice for you.

781
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,040
But

782
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,040
we need to wait for a few more days.

783
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,040
Minister.

784
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,040
You are...

785
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,040
I am afraid that

786
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,040
I will be dead again.

787
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,040
Zhan Lu.

788
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,040
Take my handbook

789
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,040
and find the coroner of Yujing Gate.

790
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,040
He is going to do this.

791
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,040
Is this him?

792
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,040
How do you know?

793
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,040
It is difficult to hang the rope

794
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,040
in such a high place.

795
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,040
Is this method tiring?

796
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,040
What are you doing?

797
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,040
Don't move.

798
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,040
Well.

799
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,040
The coroner is here.

800
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,040
We will go at once.

801
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,040
Put it down.

802
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,040
Put it down.

803
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,040
Please have a look.

804
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,040
After checking,

805
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,040
this man has no

806
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,040
tied-up wounds.

807
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,040
Because

808
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,040
he used the rope to hang the rope

809
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,040
over the top of the square.

810
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,040
He hung himself on the rope.

811
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,040
You are so busy with hanging the rope.

812
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,040
Which is more convenient

813
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,040
to find that man?

814
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,040
According to this book,

815
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,040
his name is Li Jiao Han.

816
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,040
He is the most important person

817
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,040
in the Ministry of Health.

818
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,040
He is the most important person

819
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,040
in the Ministry of Health.

820
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,040
He is a student of the Ministry of Health.

821
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,040
He wants to serve the court.

822
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,040
However,

823
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,040
he died because of despair

824
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,040
because of the trouble

825
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,040
of the Shi family.

826
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,040
He would like to

827
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,040
live a new life

828
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,040
before he dies.

829
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,040
He is a hero

830
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,040
who lives for the people.

831
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,040
He is dead.

832
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,040
He is a great man.

833
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,040
The Han family's life is like a grass.

834
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,040
He was killed by the Shi family.

835
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,040
We need to live anew.

836
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,040
Otherwise,

837
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,040
themaybe would hang here.

838
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,040
This is our new school slap-off.

839
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:06,040
This is our new school slap-off.

840
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:25,040
This is our new school slap-off.

841
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,040
Brother,

842
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,040
can you see it?

843
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,120
The future of Hanmen Academy

844
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,520
is yours.

845
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,800
We want to win!

846

Of Han Han recently picked?

I'm not afraid of being oppressed by the world

908
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:09,160
Listen to what he said

909
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:21,160
It turns out that he has a love story
