00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,510
(Adapted from the novel "Peach Blossoms
Reflecting the River and Mountains")

16
00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:40,980
(by Bai Lu Cheng Shuang)

17
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,900
=Episode 26=

18
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:52,520
Your Highness.

19
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,400
(Shunjing Residence)

20
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,320
As expected, Shen Zaiye went
to the crime scene

21
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,230
and I found a broken piece
of a jade pendant.

22
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,950
A broken jade piece?

23
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,030
What kind?

24
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,590
Something about this size.

25
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,670
All right.

26
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,320
Thank you for your hard work.

27
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,880
You should return and get some rest.

28
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,830
Yes, Your Highness.

29
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,390
(When I brought up the broken jade,)

30
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,200
(Prince Wuyin looked a little uneasy.)

31
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,080
(Could that broken jade piece)

32
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,230
(be connected to him?)

33
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,160
(The broken edge matches perfectly)

34
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,480
(with the one from the crime scene.)

35
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:51,950
Your Highness.

36
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,830
Is that you?

37
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:03,640
Your Highness.

38
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:06,760
Are you still awake?

39
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,600
Who dares disturb my rest?

40
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,320
Your Highness, I was passing by

41
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,830
when I heard some noise
from your chamber.

42
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,680
Noise?

43
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,000
I heard nothing.

44
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,440
But thanks to you,

45
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,760
I'm wide awake now.

46
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,730
Calm down, Your Highness.

47
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,230
Please forgive me.

48
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,710
You can leave.

49
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,350
(What does the design)

50
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,640
(on this jade mean?)

51
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,640
(I should give it to him.)

52
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,880
(But I can't let him think)

53
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,200
(I've changed my mind.)

54
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,980
(Chunyue Pavilion)

55
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,620
(Chunyue Pavilion)

56
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:25,680
Chancellor,

57
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,760
we've questioned everyone in the tavern.

58
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,950
No one has seen this item.

59
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,240
It's a small, broken piece of jade.

60
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,510
Even if they had seen it,

61
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,030
they wouldn't know what it is.

62
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,240
(Qingtai?)

63
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,640
Chancellor.

64
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,830
(Shen Residence)

65
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:06,350
Chancellor,

66
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,510
do you think Qingtai is acting this way

67
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,030
because the Princess figured
something out,

68
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,560
but didn't want to say it outright?

69
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,390
Zaiye, why are you still standing around

70
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,910
instead of investigating?

71
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,470
Do you want to save Mu Wuxia or not?

72
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,560
Zhan Lu, get someone to send her back.

73
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,830
I don't want to go home.

74
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:26,640
What's this?

75
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,910
Miss Qingying, be careful.

76
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:29,910
That may be a clue.

77
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,240
A clue?

78
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,150
It's not a picture or a symbol.

79
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,560
It looks more like some kind of script.

80
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:45,640
I get it now.

81
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,760
Prepare the horse.

82
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,320
Where are you going? Take me with you.

83
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,880
To seek an audience with His Majesty.

84
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,080
I, Shen Zaiye, request an audience
with His Majesty.

85
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,830
Shen Zaiye,

86
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,680
didn't I tell you to stay out of this?

87
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,000
Are you looking for punishment again?

88
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,470
Your Majesty, I swear on my life

89
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,560
that Prince Wuxia did not kill
Prince Wuhen.

90
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,390
How are you so sure?

91
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,560
Your Majesty, may I be bold to ask

92
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,270
if this year's
imperial examination's essay topic

93
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,960
is "Remonstrate Not the Past.
Let Righteousness Be the Reward"?

94
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,590
How did you know that?

95
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,710
Who dared to leak the question I set?

96
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:33,990
Find out who did it.

97
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,990
I want this person's
entire family wiped out!

98
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:36,870
Your Majesty,

99
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,590
I fear this matter is linked
to Prince Wuhen.

100
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,400
Don't spout nonsense!

101
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,200
Your Majesty,

102
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,230
I found a broken jade pendant

103
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,950
at the murder scene,

104
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,750
and the topic was carved on it.

105
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,590
Shen Zaiye,

106
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,200
tell me.

107
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,680
How can you prove

108
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,400
that jade belonged to Wuhen?

109
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,320
He's dead,
and he can't speak for himself.

110
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,080
So don't go making baseless accusations!

111
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:06,710
Your Majesty,

112
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,350
before Chancellor Meng presided
over the exam,

113
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:12,470
the Ministry of Rites was dominated
by the Qin family.

114
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,830
If this jade wasn't Prince Wuhen's,

115
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,920
then it must be Prince Wuxia's.

116
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,560
But knowing Prince Wuxia's character,

117
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,320
do you really believe

118
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,560
he would cheat for personal gain?

119
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,080
So

120
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,710
if it belongs to neither of the princes,

121
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,830
then someone else must have been
at the scene.

122
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,520
Please, grant me the authority.

123
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,160
I will uncover the truth.

124
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:56,710
Granted.

125
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:05,220
(Discuss. Remonstrate Not the Past.
Let Righteousness Be the Reward.)

126
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:06,840
Chancellor,

127
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,990
the Princess is staying
at Prince Wuyin's residence.

128
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,800
Now, she still handed over a clue.

129
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,110
Whose side is she on?

130
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,200
Isn't it obvious?

131
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,400
If she's helping me,
she's putting herself in danger.

132
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,590
I need to convince her
to stay out of this.

133
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,110
But she's on guard

134
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,560
around you now.

135
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,830
Will she even listen?

136
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,680
Find Qingtai.

137
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:41,630
Qingtai.

138
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:43,400
Qingtai!

139
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,230
Qingtai.

140
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,750
Didn't you say you were busy lately?

141
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,400
How do you still have time to visit me?

142
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,080
Well, I still need to find time, right?

143
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,710
I picked up some snacks along the way.

144
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,680
Oh, Chancellor wants to see you.

145
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,350
Greetings, Chancellor.

146
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:11,950
Qingtai,

147
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,040
did you go out today?

148
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:16,470
I didn't.

149
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,110
You didn't?

150
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,760
Then why weren't you around

151
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,440
when the physician came to check on you

152
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,320
during the Si hour?

153
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,200
There was no physician
during the Si hour.

154
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,750
I did go out. So what?

155
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,040
I serve the Princess,

156
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,350
not your prisoner.

157
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,590
So you did meet the Princess.

158
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,590
Did she ask you

159
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,400
to pass me the handkerchief?

160
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:50,520
(How is he so sharp?)

161
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,870
(He figured it out immediately.)

162
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,400
Let her know

163
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,080
that I am grateful for her help.

164
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:00,200
I told you the Princess has nothing
to do with this.

165
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,590
Qingtai,

166
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,680
have you considered

167
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,240
that the Princess is risking everything
to help the Chancellor?

168
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,520
She has no one else around her.

169
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,720
If she were discovered,
who is going to protect her?

170
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,830
Qingtai.

171
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,160
I know

172
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,830
you have never thought highly of me.

173
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,630
But for Taohua's sake,

174
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,440
we should set those differences aside.

175
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,360
Qingtai.

176
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,240
(Shunjing Residence)

177
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,440
When you snuck
into Prince Wuyin's residence last time,

178
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,320
I was worried sick.

179
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,990
Have you forgotten what I told you?

180
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,520
You said you will come to me
if there's anything.

181
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,870
So, why didn't you listen?

182
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,040
The Chancellor asked me
to give you a message.

183
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,230
What is it?

184
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,870
He said

185
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,400
you're now in the enemy's den.

186
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,280
The only way
to survive is to stay out of it.

187
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,990
He's telling you to let this go.

188
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,400
Please thank him for his concern.

189
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:02,800
But I'm not doing this for him.

190
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,440
But to save Prince Wuxia.

191
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,990
Your Highness,

192
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,680
I've been staying there for a while now.

193
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,990
I don't think he's a bad man.

194
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,630
The day you fell off that cliff,

195
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,750
he was trying to save both you
and Prince Wuxia.

196
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,320
That's why he acted as he did.

197
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,440
Your Highness,

198
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,680
why won't you make peace with him?

199
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:23,990
Qingtai.

200
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,160
The truth is,

201
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,630
I've remembered everything.

202
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,080
Your Highness, you...

203
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,440
Don't tell anyone.

204
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,400
In front of him,

205
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,710
don't let him see even
the slightest sign.

206
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,520
But

207
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,040
how do you

208
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,400
truly feel about him?

209
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,320
You may act indifferent on the surface.

210
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,990
But I know your heart still holds him.

211
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,800
He may speak harshly.

212
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,160
But he clearly still cares for you.

213
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,230
If you miss each other,

214
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,920
why do you keep hurting each other?

215
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,560
Shen Zaiye and I were never meant

216
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,110
to stand on the same side.

217
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,200
He didn't know my background before,

218
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,470
and we were forced
to live under the same roof

219
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,800
while walking on eggshells.

220
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,750
Now

221
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,400
that he knows I'm a spy.

222
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,750
We're serving different masters.

223
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,520
So, how could love ever survive?

224
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,920
Since I've already left,

225
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,400
it's best we both move on in peace.

226
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,040
Your Highness,

227
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,230
I only worry

228
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,440
that you might be giving up

229
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,200
something precious.

230
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,040
What about you?

231
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,440
How's your injury?

232
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,400
Show me.

233
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,470
I've recovered. So don't worry.

234
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,170
Qingtai.

235
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,560
There's something

236
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,830
I've been thinking about for a while.

237
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,680
Now that you've recovered.

238
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:29,780
So I think it's time.

239
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,440
I can come back to protect you
whenever you need me.

240
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,080
I know that.

241
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:35,920
But

242
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:38,830
I want you to leave Qi.

243
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,830
Your Highness,

244
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,750
don't you want me anymore?

245
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,920
Though we are master and servant,

246
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,160
I have long regarded you

247
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,200
as my younger sister.

248
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,470
So, how could I not want you?

249
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,230
Your Highness,

250
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,400
since the day we met,

251
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:56,680
I vowed

252
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,400
to protect you.

253
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:09,880
You are...

254
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:16,520
That flower is not edible.

255
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,590
It'll upset your stomach.

256
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,870
Taohua, Master is here!

257
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,810
I originally saved this for Changjue.
But you can have it.

258
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,110
This is for you.

259
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,110
Master!

260
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,230
What brings you here?

261
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,230
Your Highness,

262
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:37,870
you and the Prince need

263
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,590
someone trustworthy by your side.

264
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:42,590
So I've found a young maid for you.

265
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:43,830
She's loyal

266
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,350
and skilled in self-defense.

267
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:46,520
From now on,

268
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,920
she'll serve both of you.

269
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,200
Qingtai.

270
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,200
Oh, it's you.

271
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,590
I, Qingtai, greet Your Highness.

272
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,830
I will protect Your Highness
with all my life

273
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,920
and won't let you suffer.

274
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,400
You're the only family

275
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,320
I have left in this world.

276
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:07,320
Can you

277
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,670
please not leave me?

278
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,760
I would never leave you.

279
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,320
Now,

280
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,000
I've gained Prince Wuyin's trust.

281
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:20,910
I need to stay and find the antidote.

282
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,320
I wanted you to go
and find Changjue for me.

283
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:26,080
You want me to find His Highness?

284
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:32,080
Empress Lv was watching

285
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,870
our every move.

286
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,480
One mistake would implicate Changjue.

287
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,240
But now you've escaped death

288
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,150
and you're finally out of her grasp.

289
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:44,280
Only you can go and find him now.

290
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,960
You're the only one I trust.

291
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,710
Once you find Changjue,

292
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,200
we'll leave this place behind

293
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,350
and find a quiet place.

294
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,080
No more a life of hardship
and wandering.

295
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,190
As long as I'm with you,

296
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,910
I'm willing to do anything.

297
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,630
But

298
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,870
where do I begin searching
for His Highness?

299
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,720
Changjue once wrote in a letter

300
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:16,150
that his camp is near a desert.

301
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,080
I believe

302
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,630
it's somewhere
in the northern frontier near Xingzhou.

303
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:23,240
All right.
I'll set out tomorrow morning.

304
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,390
Qian Mochen once said

305
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,430
that the Xingzhou frontier is a land
of endless sand

306
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,720
and few people.

307
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,870
The camp must be located

308
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,870
in a remote corner somewhere.

309
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,870
It won't be easy searching for Changjue.

310
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,520
Even if I have to turn over
every grain of sand in Xingzhou,

311
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:44,150
I'll find Prince Changjue.

312
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,480
Then promise me

313
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,190
not to be reckless

314
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,350
and stay safe.

315
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,430
Don't worry, Your Highness.

316
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,520
I'll keep both myself
and His Highness safe.

317
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:58,960
One more thing,

318
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,240
don't let Shen Zaiye know.

319
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:54,140
(Shen Residence)

320
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,890
Why is Qingtai still not back?

321
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,960
Chancellor, you've had a long day.

322
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:03,960
Please get some rest.

323
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,910
I'll wait for her here.

324
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,110
Qingtai, what's wrong?

325
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,350
Did you cry?

326
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,480
Thank you for taking me in
during this time, Chancellor.

327
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,590
Her Highness has granted me my freedom.

328
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,240
Tomorrow, I'll set out for Beiyuan
to search for my kin.

329
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,800
You're a busy man, Chancellor.

330
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,870
So I won't trouble you with goodbyes.

331
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,150
You're leaving?

332
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,000
Zhan Lu.

333
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,110
If you wish to go with her,

334
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:51,630
I won't stop you.

335
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,000
I'm staying.

336
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,190
Then don't

337
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,800
regret it.

338
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:03,870
I won't regret it.

339
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,430
Chancellor,

340
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,000
what do you think
the Princess is really thinking?

341
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:15,910
She wants to sever all ties with me.

342
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,520
Perhaps that's for the best.

343
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:21,080
At least,

344
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,910
she's finally out of this mess.

345
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,040
Send word

346
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,870
to search the entire city
for jade engravers.

347
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,430
Make sure it causes a stir.

348
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:32,870
And remember,

349
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,960
the jade clue didn't come
from Jiang Taohua

350
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,480
but from the craftsmen.

351
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,190
Chancellor,

352
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,960
why go to such lengths

353
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,320
for the Princess?

354
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:01,720
(Shunjing Residence)

355
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,040
The month is nearly up.

356
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,670
I've come to ask for the antidote.

357
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:07,910
I heard Chancellor Shen

358
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,800
is searching the city

359
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:11,240
for jade carvers.

360
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,670
He's trying to clear Mu Wuxia's name.

361
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,670
But I will not allow that to happen.

362
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:21,800
I can give

363
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,040
the antidote to you anytime.

364
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:24,190
But not

365
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,670
without a price.

366
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,520
Miss Meng,

367
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,870
you know what you have to do.

368
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,590
Last time I got involved
through Xiang Qingying.

369
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:35,960
Chancellor Shen didn't suspect a thing.

370
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,040
If you don't mind,

371
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:40,590
I'm willing to serve again.

372
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,320
Then go.

373
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,480
Word is he's at the jade workshop
in the south of the city.

374
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,150
Yes, Your Highness.

375
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,430
(Shen Zaiye,)

376
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,320
(when the woman you love brings pain)

377
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,440
(that cuts to the bone and pierces the heart,)

378
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,910
(can you still stand your ground?)

379
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,980
(Jade Workshop)

380
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,960
Chancellor, the Princess is here.

381
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,720
Miss Meng, it looks like

382
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,150
you still don't understand
what "staying out of it" means.

383
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,190
I'm only here to help
Prince Wuxia clear his name.

384
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:34,800
In that case,

385
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,520
why don't we split up the work?

386
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,960
That way, we can save some time.

387
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,760
Do you know
why I brought you in for questioning?

388
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:45,830
No.

389
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,320
Was Prince Wuhen a regular here?

390
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:54,080
He liked the food here.

391
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,600
He booked the same private room

392
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,760
and spent all year drinking
and enjoying himself here.

393
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,840
He spent all year drinking
and enjoying himself.

394
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,240
And in all that time,
only you served him?

395
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:06,390
I suppose he found me pleasing.

396
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,910
A beauty like you

397
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,150
is hard for any man to resist.

398
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:13,320
But

399
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:14,920
I noticed something strange.

400
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,440
(Braised Soft-Shelled Turtle
and Lamb with Pickled Amaranth)

401
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,840
See here, in the account book.

402
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,720
Recently,
these two dishes kept showing up.

403
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,190
Braised soft-shelled turtle and lamb
with pickled amaranth.

404
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,320
Soft-shelled turtle and amaranth
don't go together,

405
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,000
as they can cause stomach problems.

406
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,320
That's odd

407
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:30,150
because no customers

408
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,000
ever got sick.

409
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,430
The employee says

410
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,830
every time someone ordered
those two dishes,

411
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:39,560
(Testimony)
you were the one

412
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,720
who served them.

413
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:43,350
Then the dancer would take
the guest away.

414
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,910
And it just so happened,

415
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:47,480
after Prince Wuxia left that night,

416
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,800
someone else ordered
the same two dishes.

417
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:52,280
As expected,

418
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,240
you took this person away.

419
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,110
Aiding in leaking the exam

420
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,190
could get your entire clan executed.

421
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,590
If you tell me
who Prince Wuhen met that night,

422
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,670
I'll spare your life.

423
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,430
If I were you,

424
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,960
I would tell everything I know

425
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:09,910
to save my family

426
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:13,080
since the matter has been exposed.

427
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,670
I'll talk.

428
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:18,720
- Meng Huairui?
- Meng Huairui?

429
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,960
Zhan Lu, take Meng Huairui in now!

430
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:23,240
Yes, sir.

431
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:32,520
Zhenzhen?

432
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,190
You came alone?

433
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,280
Why didn't you bring your maid?

434
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,870
Are you going somewhere?

435
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,280
My uncle is gravely ill.

436
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,080
My mother's family wrote
to ask me to visit.

437
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:48,960
So, have your parents left?

438
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,080
Zhenzhen,

439
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:51,350
I'm in a rush.

440
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:52,830
If you'll excuse me, I have...

441
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:53,430
Of course.

442
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,430
Huairui...

443
00:25:58,670 --> 00:25:59,320
Father.

444
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:00,720
Mother.

445
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,190
I didn't kill him.

446
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,480
I only gave him a little push.

447
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:11,590
Prince Wuhen hit his head and died.

448
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,390
That day,

449
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:17,150
I went to Chunyue Pavilion
to buy the exam questions.

450
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:18,520
But before I arrived,

451
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,320
Prince Wuxia and Prince Wuhen

452
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,150
had a huge fight.

453
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,150
Prince Wuhen took it out on me.

454
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:25,280
Your Highness,

455
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,590
someone is here to see you.

456
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,630
Meng Huairui, at your service.

457
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,760
The Meng family, huh?

458
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,480
Do you think
anyone can just walk in here?

459
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,520
Prince Wuhen,

460
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:53,630
don't be so quick

461
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,760
to turn down business.

462
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:00,630
Plenty of nobles have come before me.

463
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,560
There has never been an issue.

464
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:05,830
Today, you and Wuxia came one
after another.

465
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,960
Don't tell me
this is all just a coincidence!

466
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:13,250
It truly has nothing to do with me.

467
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,870
I only came to purchase a jade pendant.

468
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:22,670
The Mengs are always full of schemes.

469
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:23,760
Get lost!

470
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:27,870
Prince Wuhen,

471
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,000
I know that jade pendant
is the exam topic,

472
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,280
and I know you've already sold it
to more than a few.

473
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:34,480
You...

474
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,960
You will sell it even
if you don't want to!

475
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,720
Let's see what you can bargain with now!

476
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:54,520
Prince Wuhen...

477
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,560
Prince Wuhen...

478
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:29,590
Zhenzhen.

479
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:31,630
Ms. Zhenzhen,

480
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:34,000
I swear I'm telling the truth.

481
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:35,720
All I did was push him.

482
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,960
I didn't know he was that weak.

483
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,350
I...

484
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:41,560
Ms. Zhenzhen,

485
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,080
even if I've committed such vile

486
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,190
and heartless deeds,

487
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,520
you know I'm a devoted son.

488
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:50,830
My parents are in your hands.

489
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,870
So, how could I lie to you?

490
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:54,760
I swear to heaven.

491
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:57,590
If I'm lying,

492
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:58,280
I will...

493
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,320
Let me and my parents meet
a terrible end.

494
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:04,000
Shen Zaiye is investigating
this himself.

495
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,190
If it leads back to you,

496
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,670
have you thought
about what to answer him?

497
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,280
I...

498
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,190
I'll tell the truth

499
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,830
and leave it to fate.

500
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:23,190
Ms. Zhenzhen, blame me if you must.

501
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,870
But please spare my parents.

502
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:25,870
Ms. Zhenzhen.

503
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,110
I ask you one more time.

504
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,760
If it leads back to you,

505
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,000
what will you answer?

506
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:35,960
I...

507
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,630
Ms. Zhenzhen,

508
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,080
I will answer
however you want me to answer.

509
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,720
Let my parents go.

510
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,720
Please...

511
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,000
Ms. Zhenzhen.

512
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:48,720
Ms. Zhenzhen.

513
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,800
As long as we catch Meng Huairui,

514
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,190
we can save Prince Wuxia.

515
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:54,910
That's right.

516
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:57,240
There are still two details

517
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,720
that are suspicious.

518
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,350
What details?

519
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,960
First,

520
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,720
the two bloodstains at the corner
of the table don't line up.

521
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,670
We need to confirm

522
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,760
whether the shape
of Prince Wuhen's wound

523
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,560
matches the ones on the table.

524
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:16,150
And the second?

525
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,440
Have you seen

526
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,760
anything shaped like a lotus?

527
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:19,800
A lotus?

528
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,960
I once saw a lotus-shaped carving

529
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,600
on the window ledge.

530
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,830
It's about two inches wide.

531
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,890
Are you all right?

532
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,390
Chancellor Shen,

533
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:37,960
I need to return now.

534
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,050
Please excuse me.

535
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,350
Miss Meng.

536
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:43,780
Jiang Taohua.

537
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:44,800
Jiang Taohua.

538
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,110
(The peach blossom mark is the sign
that the poison is activating.)

539
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,040
(If we don't take the antidote
every month,)

540
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,800
(we'll start with blood vomiting
and fainting.)

541
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,830
(Then comes sudden death.)

542
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:01,320
Someone! Get the carriage ready!

543
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:11,040
(Shunjing Residence)

544
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,830
So it turns out Wuhen died by accident.

545
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:17,150
That day, Prince Wuxia went
to confront him

546
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:19,110
about the leaked exam questions.

547
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:21,040
Meng Huairui and Prince Wuhen

548
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,560
had a dispute over it afterward

549
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,590
that led to the tragedy.

550
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,280
I've warned Wuhen before

551
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,320
to stop fooling around

552
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,960
and strengthen his body.

553
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:34,520
Or else

554
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,480
he wouldn't have died such
a miserable death.

555
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,190
Your Highness,

556
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,080
our spies at the jade workshop report

557
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,390
that Miss Meng has collapsed
from poison.

558
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,240
She's just a pawn gone bad.

559
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:49,480
It's nothing.

560
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:50,870
Please continue.

561
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:52,800
Your Highness,

562
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,800
Shen Zaiye is still combing the city
for jade craftsmen.

563
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,190
I'm worried
he'll trace the craftsman back

564
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,800
to our Meng family.

565
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,590
Oh, right.

566
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:03,350
The craftsman came from your family.

567
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:06,110
So is Meng Huairui.

568
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:07,520
I guess

569
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:10,110
Meng Huairui joined hands with Wuhen

570
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,390
for fame and fortune.

571
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,430
In the end, things went sideways,
and they argued.

572
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,760
Then someone died.

573
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,480
And what does that have to do with us?

574
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,800
The real question is,

575
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,720
will you be willing
to sacrifice a clansman?

576
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,080
That Meng Huairui deserves
what's coming.

577
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,000
What worries me now

578
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:30,430
is Shen Zaiye using this matter

579
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:31,960
to trace it further

580
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:33,670
and expose more secrets.

581
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:35,720
If he does,

582
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:37,960
we weigh the cost.

583
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:40,590
He's placing his next move on my piece.

584
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:41,870
Why should you fear?

585
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,630
(Yiyun Residence)

586
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:54,190
Someone!

587
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,590
Imperial Physician Bai, save her!

588
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,000
Chancellor, this way.

589
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,280
Imperial Physician Bai,
how's the antidote coming along?

590
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,960
Chancellor, it's still in development.

591
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,870
For now,

592
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,320
I can only prescribe
a pain-relieving powder

593
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,590
to ease her symptoms.

594
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,430
All right.

595
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:08,390
Follow me.

596
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:18,670
Chancellor,

597
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,350
Meng Huairui's residence was ransacked,

598
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,560
and he's nowhere to be found.

599
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,080
Also, Meng Zhenzhen wants to see you.

600
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,760
She said you'll regret it if you refuse.

601
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,080
If anything happens to Taohua,
report to me immediately.

602
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:28,560
Yes. sir.

603
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:31,670
Get to the point.

604
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,480
Why are you here?

605
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,800
It's been a while.

606
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:41,720
I'm here

607
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,480
to make you a deal.

608
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,160
For Meng Huairui?

609
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,150
Catching him is only a matter of time.

610
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,760
The Meng family is willing
to hand him over

611
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,480
and do whatever you want with him.

612
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:54,480
But this matter ends there.

613
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,390
You must not drag
the Meng family into it.

614
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,600
Why would I agree to that?

615
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:59,190
Because of Jiang Taohua's life.

616
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,590
I hear she's been poisoned.

617
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,040
She must be in terrible pain by now.

618
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,310
So the Meng family has sided

619
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,110
with Prince Wuyin.

620
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,790
No need for small talk.

621
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,440
Do you want

622
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,310
the antidote or not?

623
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,040
Whether it's destroyed or not

624
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:25,360
depends entirely on you.

625
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:30,270
How do I know

626
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,040
this antidote is even real?

627
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,880
How do you want me to prove it?

628
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:34,670
Test it.

629
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,960
If anything happens to Jiang Taohua,

630
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,400
I'll hold you responsible.

631
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,040
The antidote works.

632
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,310
Then I'll hand over Meng Huairui to you.

633
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:56,310
What I want isn't just a temporary fix

634
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:57,790
but the permanent cure.

635
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:00,080
Give me the permanent cure.

636
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,630
Then I'll let your family go.

637
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,190
You should've said that

638
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,840
before we tested the medicine.

639
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:05,710
You're the one

640
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:07,790
who came to make a deal.

641
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:10,590
I never agreed to anything.

642
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:13,480
Let me be honest.

643
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,190
I don't have the permanent cure.

644
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,270
All I have are these two pills.

645
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,880
If you want them,

646
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:20,750
I'll give them both.

647
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:22,560
If not,

648
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,790
next time the poison flares up,

649
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,000
she might not be so lucky.

650
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,710
Leave the antidote.

651
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,630
I want Meng Huairui taken alive
to the imperial prison.

652
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:41,040
This time,

653
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,080
I'll let the Meng family go.

654
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,880
You have my word, Chancellor Shen.

655
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,040
I'll take care of it.

656
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:04,710
Zhan Lu.

657
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,320
Yes, sir.

658
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,000
Give the pills
to Imperial Physician Bai.

659
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,160
Have him work on developing
the full cure immediately.

660
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:09,560
Yes, sir.

661
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,840
(He actually gave in for me.)

662
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,270
(Just like that,
he let the Meng family off the hook.)

663
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:21,960
Imperial Physician Bai

664
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,960
will work on the permanent cure.

665
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,880
You can rest here without worry.

666
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,190
Chancellor.

667
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,270
These will last for two months.

668
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,590
Thank you for the medicine,
Chancellor Shen.

669
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,750
I must return
to Prince Wuyin's residence now.

670
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:54,310
Very well.

671
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:18,080
(That lotus-shaped mark...)

672
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,710
(Why do Jiang Taohua's
shoe prints match)

673
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:23,150
(with the ones at the crime scene?)

674
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:24,880
(Or could it be)

675
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:27,310
(that everyone
at Prince Wuyin's residence)

676
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,880
