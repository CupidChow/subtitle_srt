1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,360
The wind and rain scatter and the clouds are still.

2
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,040
How can I live with the life

3
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,440
and the fate?

4
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,400
If I can stay with you in my life,

5
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,040
if you understand my true feelings,

6
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:54,920
I will enter the stage and fall without any regrets.

7
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,200
Even if I miss you for the rest of my life,

8
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,360
I will live through this life.

9
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:09,400
I fought for the cause and the effect of destiny.

10
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,600
Fate is like a fish that has been loved and hated for a lifetime.

11
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,600
If I can't get rid of it,

12
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,040
I'll use my life to make up for it.

13
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,920
I won't wait for the spring to come.

14
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:41,040
Amazing Girl

15
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,040
Episode 34

16
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,240
The blue button on the heart is my secret.

17
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,680
There are 48 plum blossoms.

18
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,040
The fruit egg is just made.

19
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,280
I invite you to watch the cherry blossom and hard river.

20
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,440
Lady Jiang has recovered well recently.

21
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,480
Don't worry about her.

22
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,360
Don't call her Lady Jiang again.

23
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,680
What should I call her?

24
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,240
She is the princess of the North Court.

25
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,280
You should have a book of the Qingtai.

26
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,720
Call her Princess.

27
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,720
Yes.

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,960
What is Madam doing these days?

29
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,520
Meng Hua is holding a funeral.

30
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,960
Madam is back to her mansion to attend the mourning.

31
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,320
Keep an eye on Madam and the Meng family.

32
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,760
Meng family will lose its legitimate son this time.

33
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,520
They won't give up easily.

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,640
I understand.

35
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:43,920
Attend the overall ranking

36
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,360
in this county.

37
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:44,760
In this county.

38
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,280
Endure illness

39
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,760
Old man.

40
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,440
Old man.

41
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,840
God has planted the paper

42
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:38,860
for the guilty

43
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,800
Mr. Gong

44
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,000
Father, won't you cry?

45
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,040
I want to talk to Zhenzhen.

46
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,480
You may leave.

47
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,680
Your Highness,

48
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,560
I know you have a grudge against me.

49
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,300
But it's indescribable

50
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,040
to kick your автомat out

51
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,720
for'mem passive!

52
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,720
I know you have a grudge against me.

53
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,720
But for the whole Meng clan,

54
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:17,720
it's really a helpless move to abandon your eldest brother.

55
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,720
Huaijin is the eldest son I taught.

56
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,720
But now,

57
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,720
he's sent to the hell by the white hair.

58
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,720
The pain in my heart

59
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,720
is much more painful

60
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,720
than yours.

61
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,720
If it weren't for the number of gods in the wild,

62
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,720
how could our Meng clan

63
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,720
fall to such a state?

64
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,720
Although His Majesty didn't blame me,

65
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,720
but now,

66
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,720
the Meng clan's reputation

67
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,720
is no longer

68
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,720
as good as the previous one.

69
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,720
Today, the only person

70
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,720
who came to question him

71
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,720
is no one else.

72
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,720
Look at Shen Zaiye.

73
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,720
He's been married for years.

74
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,720
When he was being cruel to our Meng clan,

75
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,720
why didn't he consider

76
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,720
the relationship between you two?

77
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,720
Meng Huaijin,

78
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,720
your biological brother,

79
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,720
my only son.

80
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,720
If you want to hate him,

81
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,720
you should hate him.

82
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,720
You can't swallow this anger.

83
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,720
I can't swallow it either.

84
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,720
He's been beaten up.

85
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,720
His life is like a sky.

86
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,720
What's the use of not swallowing this anger?

87
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,720
Like a sky?

88
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,720
He's like a sky, too.

89
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,720
He's just a villain.

90
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,720
He's been beaten up.

91
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,720
Now,

92
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,720
he's going to break our Meng clan's roots.

93
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,720
He humiliated our Meng clan.

94
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,720
Won't he

95
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,720
avenge his loss?

96
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,720
I have something

97
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,720
to tell you.

98
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,720
This thing

99
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,720
is colorless and tasteless.

100
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,720
You must kill it immediately.

101
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,720
Let Shen Zaiye

102
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,720
avenge your brother.

103
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,720
I'll kill him.

104
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,720
I'll kill him.

105
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,720
Shen Zaiye

106
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,720
avenge your brother.

107
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,720
Father,

108
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,720
you want your son to poison him.

109
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,720
You and he are husband and wife.

110
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,720
You have a chance.

111
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,720
Father, have you ever thought

112
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,720
if your son's poison fails,

113
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,720
what will happen?

114
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,720
For my brother,

115
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,720
for the Meng clan.

116
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,720
Come.

117
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,720
Now that Young Master just left,

118
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,720
why did you do this to Madam?

119
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,720
It's dangerous.

120
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,720
But Madam is so concerned about you.

121
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,720
I don't deserve

122
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,720
to be like this.

123
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,720
Otherwise, my brother wouldn't...

124
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,720
What did you do recently?

125
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,720
I didn't do anything.

126
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,720
I just ran around Zhenchun Pavilion.

127
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
I also heard that

128
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,720
you went to the palace in person

129
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,720
and asked for the princess' approval.

130
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,720
You also took her to the tea party of Princess Lan.

131
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,720
You took a concubine to the banquet in the palace.

132
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,720
How could you do this?

133
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,720
How could you let Madam be so embarrassed?

134
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,720
After my brother died,

135
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,720
no one would consider me

136
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,720
as the first wife.

137
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,720
Whether it's the husband's family or the mother's family,

138
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,720
who would care about

139
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,720
a woman who doesn't love Madam?

140
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,720
Let me check it.

141
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,720
In the maidservant

142
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,720
we had in the Prince's Mansion,

143
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,720
was there any obedient maidservant?

144
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,280
she went to work in the palace.

145
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,040
Meng family has been training her for so many years.

146
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,400
It's time to do something.

147
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,600
Are you thinking...

148
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,200
Since we can't do anything,

149
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,880
I'll make the choice.

150
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,440
I should be the one to make the choice.

151
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,200
In case it's difficult for everyone,

152
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,840
no one will blame me.

153
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,040
All right.

154
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,760
In the end,

155
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,800
we still made it this far.

156
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:16,680
Zhenlu,

157
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,520
as you recuperated,

158
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,920
I'm afraid she can't get out of the room.

159
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,800
She'll be covered with some thin sheets of silk

160
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,880
and some flowers and fruits.

161
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,280
Prime Minister,

162
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,280
how could you care so much about her?

163
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,600
You're so ungrateful.

164
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,920
She is not someone else.

165
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,400
If that's the case,

166
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,160
why don't you show her your true self?

167
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,720
You mean

168
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:45,880
Princess is stupid

169
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,520
and you still need me to tell her

170
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,640
about your feelings?

171
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,720
No.

172
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,160
You and Princess are so smart.

173
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,760
You're like a match made in heaven.

174
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,960
How could you not know

175
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,120
how much she loves you?

176
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,680
associating the mobile phone market with beauty is bad.

177
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,360
Yongxiang will definitely become famous.

178
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,320
goddess야

179
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:25,640
estyle

180
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,240
accessories

181
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:34,120
Youth

182
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:34,960
Zhanluo.

183
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,960
What's this?

184
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,180
This is a tea party

185
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,280
for you.

186
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,460
Your Grace,

187
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,760
are these silk Part-time W quieren

188
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,640
It's more delicate than the one in the Blue Wings Pavilion.

189
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,880
This is the order from His Lordship.

190
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,600
He asked the embroidered lady in the palace

191
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,520
to make it for you.

192
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,880
These jewelry and clothes

193
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,240
are not allowed to be worn

194
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,360
by the housewife.

195
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,560
I'm just a concubine.

196
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,160
It's not appropriate.

197
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:05,920
His Lordship said

198
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,440
you were supposed to be the princess

199
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,120
in the tea ceremony.

200
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,880
So these clothes and accessories

201
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,480
are naturally made by the palace

202
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,760
to match your status.

203
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,920
What did you just call me?

204
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,120
His Lordship ordered

205
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,280
from now on,

206
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,680
the whole house will be called your princess.

207
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,920
Your Highness.

208
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,640
If someone disrespects you,

209
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,080
it means disrespecting His Lordship.

210
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,080
Everything will be handled in accordance with the family law.

211
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,120
Your Highness.

212
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,080
Your Highness.

213
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,360
Your Highness.

214
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,120
After the housewife came back from the Meng Mansion,

215
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,040
she didn't come out.

216
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,960
But the maid next to her, Yue Tao,

217
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,800
secretly went to the palace

218
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,200
to build a maid named Nan Li.

219
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,360
She's the old maid of the Crown Prince's Mansion.

220
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,560
The maid in the palace?

221
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,560
Keep an eye on her.

222
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,120
Yes.

223
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,120
Put these in this one.

224
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,840
Put these next to the one behind.

225
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,040
Be careful with these.

226
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,640
The princess has arrived.

227
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,600
Your Highness.

228
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,160
Greetings, Princess Chengping.

229
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,640
Greetings, Princess Chengping.

230
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,160
You don't have to stand on ceremony.

231
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,520
Sister Meng.

232
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,480
Get up.

233
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,200
Wait, Your Highness.

234
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,520
It's a long journey.

235
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,280
If Your Highness is by the red-scented incense,

236
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,680
it must be more comfortable.

237
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,600
I'll switch with you.

238
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,360
Go to the carriage behind.

239
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:02,840
Your Highness.

240
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,560
Brother, the banquet is too boring.

241
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,800
I'll go play with the servants.

242
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,600
Your Highness.

243
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:46,680
Not bad.

244
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,920
You finally look like a princess.

245
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,640
I've had your favor in the past.

246
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,000
It's enough to offend others.

247
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,640
Now I've moved out of the position of princess.

248
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,000
I wonder what you're going to do this time.

249
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,640
You'll know when that time comes.

250
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,760
so mysterious.

251
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,200
Good.

252
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,020
Good.

253
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,880
Good.

254
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,680
I'm leaving.

255
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,540
I must go back and work.

256
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,540
Bravo!

257
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,540
One more!

258
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,540
Bravo!

259
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,540
Bravo!

260
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,540
Bravo!

261
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,540
One more!

262
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,540
Bravo!

263
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,540
Bravo!

264
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,540
Bravo!

265
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,540
Bravo!

266
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,540
Bravo!

267
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,540
One more!

268
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,540
Here comes the Prime Minister!

269
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,540
This way, please, Your Highness.

270
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,540
Greetings, Prime Minister.

271
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,540
Prime Minister.

272
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,540
Prime Minister, your seat is over there.

273
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,540
Father,

274
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,540
the scenery here is so beautiful.

275
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,540
I'd like to live with you.

276
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,540
Minister Qin, this way, please.

277
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,540
Congratulations, Minister Qin,

278
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,540
for ascending the throne.

279
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:18,540
The imperial court is the best advisor.

280
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,540
Minister Qin,

281
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,540
you are well-deserved.

282
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,540
Congratulations.

283
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,540
You are well-deserved.

284
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,540
You are all right.

285
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,540
This is retribution.

286
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,540
You deserve it.

287
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,540
You deserve it.

288
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,540
You deserve it.

289
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,540
You deserve it.

290
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,540
You deserve it.

291
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,540
You deserve it.

292
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,540
You deserve it.

293
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,540
Retribution.

294
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,540
You deserve it.

295
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,540
I'll see who will be the winner.

296
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,540
Please, please.

297
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,540
The Crown Prince was deposed.

298
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,540
Meng Hua committed suicide.

299
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,540
Meng's family is in great danger.

300
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,540
The people are here.

301
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,540
Naturally,

302
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,540
the first-class position

303
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,540
has been taken by the Qin family.

304
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,540
It seems that Meng Yongxiang

305
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,540
has already made a plan.

306
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,540
Will Meng's family

307
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,540
rise again?

308
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,540
The dynasty has been destroyed for a hundred years.

309
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,540
The family has been destroyed for a thousand years.

310
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,540
Meng's family has been

311
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,540
in the power of the court for years.

312
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,540
Naturally, it won't fall so easily.

313
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,540
I'm afraid

314
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:17,540
Meng Yongxiang

315
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,540
will be in danger.

316
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,540
I'm afraid

317
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,540
Meng Yongxiang

318
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,540
will be in danger.

319
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,540
I'm afraid

320
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,540
Meng Yongxiang

321
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,540
will be in danger.

322
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,540
But if he wants to rise again,

323
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,540
I won't give him this chance.

324
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,540
The Emperor is here.

325
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:55,540
Welcome the Emperor.

326
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,540
Rise.

327
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,540
Greetings, Your Majesty.

328
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,540
Greetings, Your Majesty.

329
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,540
You don't have to stand in line.

330
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,540
Today is a family dinner.

331
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,540
You can sit down.

332
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,540
Sit.

333
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,540
Please.

334
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,540
Please.

335
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,540
Please.

336
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,540
Please.

337
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,540
Please.

338
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,540
Please.

339
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,540
Sit.

340
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,540
Sit.

341
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,540
Thank you, Your Majesty.

342
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,540
Your Majesty,

343
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,540
in the memory of your hard work,

344
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,540
we have a special tea feast.

345
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,540
We offer the tea to you.

346
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:37,540
We hope you will enjoy it.

347
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,540
Please.

348
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:21,540
Please.

349
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,540
Please taste it.

350
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,540
Wait.

351
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,540
Please.

352
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:51,540
It's okay to drink the tea later.

353
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,540
He is so bold.

354
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,540
He must have known the tea was bad.

355
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,540
Your Majesty,

356
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:06,540
I just got some new treasures.

357
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,540
It's a good deal

358
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,540
for today's tea feast.

359
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,540
I want to present it to you.

360
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,540
It's not a rare treasure

361
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,540
that can be introduced to the Prime Minister.

362
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,540
Please taste it.

363
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,540
Yes.

364
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,540
Isn't it a glass teacup?

365
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,540
There are many glass teacups in the palace.

366
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,540
It's not rare.

367
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,540
Your Majesty,

368
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,540
the biggest difference

369
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,540
between this teacup

370
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,540
and other teacups is

371
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,540
that if the teacup is poisoned,

372
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,540
the tea will be purified and turned into a soul-chilling.

373
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,540
Your Majesty and Your Majesty

374
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,540
are a perfect match.

375
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,540
If you use this teacup to drink tea,

376
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,540
you will be much safer.

377
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,540
Please taste it.

378
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,540
Here, my dear.

379
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,540
Your Majesty,

380
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,540
I have prepared several teacups

381
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,540
for this teacup.

382
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,540
If you don't mind,

383
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,540
how about using this teacup

384
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,540
to drink tea today?

385
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,540
Your Majesty,

386
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,540
this teacup is really exquisite.

387
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,540
It's really exquisite.

388
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,540
It may be more beautiful

389
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,540
if you use it to drink tea.

390
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,540
Since you say so,

391
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,540
I'll take it.

392
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,540
My dear,

393
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,540
today's tea

394
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,540
is for the charity exhibition.

395
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,540
It seems that the Prime Minister

396
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,540
has set up the plan.

397
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,540
I'll do it then.

398
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,540
You...

399
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,540
You're muddled.

400
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,540
Here.

401
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,540
Here.

402
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,540
It's indeed the Meng family.

403
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,540
But what role

404
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,540
does Meng Zhenzhen play?

405
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,540
Leave.

406
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,540
What do you mean by this?

407
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,540
Since we're not in the court today,

408
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:09,540
we don't need to be in the official position.

409
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:12,540
Or is it because of the past

410
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,540
of the Crown Prince?

411
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,540
Do you want to make a clear line with me?

412
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,540
Father-in-law, you're being too serious.

413
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,540
I just feel sorry for the Meng family

414
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:25,540
because of Brother Meng.

415
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,540
I dare not to bother you.

416
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,540
But I'm afraid that

417
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,540
you'll be angry with me.

418
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,540
I dare not to bother you.

419
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,540
It seems that

420
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,540
I misunderstood you.

421
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,540
But the Crown Prince's plan

422
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,540
has been decided.

423
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,540
Please make it clear.

424
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,540
Here.

425
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,540
I'll take a look at it today.

426
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,540
Everything in the past is not fast.

427
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,540
It's a one-off.

428
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:03,540
Taste it.

429
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,540
Wait.

430
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,540
The tea is cold.

431
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,540
Make another pot.

432
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,540
Yes.

433
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,540
Wait.

434
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,540
But I think

435
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,540
the temperature of the tea is just right.

436
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,540
Why do you need to make another one?

437
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,540
The real tea.

438
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,540
Let me do it.

439
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,540
Prime Minister Meng,

440
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,540
what's wrong with you?

441
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,540
I've committed a crime.

442
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,540
I've made a mistake.

443
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,540
Please forgive me.

444
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,540
Jiang Dahuang,

445
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,540
what's wrong with you?

446
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,540
Jiang Dahuang,

447
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,540
what's wrong with you?

448
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,540
I'm fine.

449
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,540
I'm fine.

450
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,540
Jiang Dahuang,

451
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,540
what's wrong with you?

452
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,540
Jiang Dahuang.

453
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,540
Princess Chengping.

454
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,540
Princess Chengping.

455
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,540
Shen Haiqing,

456
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,540
what's the purpose of Princess Chengping?

457
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,540
Your Majesty,

458
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,540
Princess Chengping fainted for no reason.

459
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,540
Someone must have poisoned her on purpose

460
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,540
at the tea tasting party.

461
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,540
She tried to murder me.

462
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,540
Your Majesty, please investigate it thoroughly.

463
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,540
Send for the imperial physician.

464
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,540
Your Majesty.

465
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,540
Go to Princess Chengping's place

466
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,540
and get some tea.

467
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,540
Yes.

468
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,540
Send Princess Consort back to the palace.

469
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,540
Your Majesty.

470
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,540
I'm fine.

471
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,540
Your Majesty,

472
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,540
I've investigated it thoroughly.

473
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,540
There's poison in the tea bowl

474
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,540
of Lord Shen's secret.

475
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,540
Fortunately,

476
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,540
Princess Chengping

477
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,540
only took a small amount.

478
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,540
She's fine.

479
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:49,540
Your Majesty, please calm down.

480
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,540
Cut the arm.

481
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,540
Tell me.

482
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,540
What's the reason?

483
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,540
Your Majesty,

484
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,540
what's the reason?

485
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,540
Tell me.

486
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,540
Who ordered you

487
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,540
to poison me at the tea tasting party?

488
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,540
Please spare my life, Your Majesty.

489
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,540
It's Miss Meng.

490
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,540
It's Miss Meng who asked me to do it.

491
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,540
She gave me the poison.

492
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,540
Miss.

493
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,540
Miss, please speak.

494
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,540
Your Majesty,

495
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,540
I'm sorry.

496
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:28,540
It's all my fault.

497
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,540
It has nothing to do with others.

498
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,540
Miss Meng,

499
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,540
as the wife of Lord Shen,

500
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,540
you're the daughter of Meng's enemy.

501
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,540
What's the reason?

502
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:50,540
Shen Zan also hurt my brother

503
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,540
and favored his concubine.

504
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,540
Do you still think

505
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,540
I'm a good wife?

506
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,540
Your Majesty asked me

507
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,540
to tell him about the relationship between husband and wife.

508
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,540
But he never

509
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,540
told me about the relationship.

510
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,540
How dare you!

511
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,540
As the daughter of the imperial clan,

512
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,540
you're so vicious.

513
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,540
You should be punished

514
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,540
by the law.

515
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:14,540
Your Majesty, please calm down.

516
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,540
Nonsense!

517
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,540
Nonsense!

518
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,540
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

519
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:26,540
I've made such a big mistake.

520
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,540
I'm really sorry.

521
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,540
I shouldn't have

522
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:33,540
punished you.

523
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,540
But

524
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:38,540
I just sent away my son.

525
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:41,540
Now I only have one daughter.

526
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:47,540
I'm willing to give up my position

527
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,540
and give my daughter a chance

528
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,540
to be the Prime Minister.

529
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,540
Shen Xiao,

530
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,540
in your opinion,

531
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,540
how should we deal with this?

532
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,540
I beg Your Majesty to have mercy on me.

533
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,540
Meng's daughter is virtuous and virtuous.

534
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,540
She's kind and kind.

535
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:14,540
Today's situation is really serious.

536
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,540
It seems that

537
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,540
she's in danger today.

538
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,540
She's trying to

539
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,540
find a way out.

540
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,540
There must be a reason for this.

541
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,540
Please take care of yourself, Your Majesty.

542
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,540
I also beg Your Majesty to have mercy on me.

543
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,540
It's all my fault that I'm favored by the Prime Minister

544
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,540
and I'm too proud to do anything.

545
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,540
I was rude and rude in my mansion.

546
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,540
That's why I made you do this

547
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,540
and did something wrong.

548
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,540
I was just being impulsive

549
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,540
and I shouldn't have done this.

550
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,540
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

551
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,540
I'm responsible for

552
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,540
what happened today.

553
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,540
If I hadn't been so careless

554
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,540
and didn't make you do this,

555
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,540
I would have asked you to

556
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,540
make the decision

557
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,540
and let me and Meng's daughter

558
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,540
leave here today.

559
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,540
We'll be happy to part ways.

560
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,540
Prime Minister,

561
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,540
have you thought it through?

562
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,540
Yes.

563
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,540
After I return to my mansion,

564
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,540
I'll take Qin's maid Duan Shiyi

565
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,540
and the other two ladies

566
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,540
and leave here together.

567
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,540
Today, Princess Chengping

568
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,540
almost got poisoned.

569
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,540
She said that

570
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,540
it was because of my indecency.

571
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,540
And after spending some time with her,

572
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,540
Princess Chengping and I

573
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,540
have been in love with each other.

574
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,540
We've long been

575
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,540
in love with each other.

576
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,540
The things that Changzi has said

577
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,540
about today

578
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,540
will never happen again.

579
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,540
Prime Minister,

580
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,540
it's not just you and me

581
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,540
who have to live together.

582
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,540
Meng's daughter

583
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,540
doesn't mean

584
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,540
the Qin's daughter.

585
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:55,540
You're really worrying about the world.

586
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,540
Yes.

587
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,540
Yunxin's daughter

588
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,540
is always gentle and trustworthy.

589
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,540
She can't do such a vicious thing.

590
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,540
My lords,

591
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,540
Qin's maid Duan Shiyi

592
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,540
and the other two ladies

593
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,540
are my concubines.

594
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,540
I can leave here

595
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:09,540
according to the etiquette.

596
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,540
But today,

597
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,540
I have a death anniversary.

598
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,540
I'm lucky enough to

599
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:14,540
die in front of you.

600
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,540
Qin's maid Duan Shiyi

601
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,540
and the other two ladies

602
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,540
are my concubines.

603
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,540
They're not the ones

604
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,540
who are dependent on me.

605
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,540
I'm the one who is dependent on them.

606
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,540
It's not difficult for a daughter

607
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,540
to be a concubine.

608
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:27,540
If you two are a concubine,

609
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,540
I will treat them

610
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,540
as my own sisters.

611
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,540
My lords,

612
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,540
if Princess Chengping

613
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,540
has any problem

614
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,540
because of the fight in the back house,

615
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,540
I'm willing to

616
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,540
deal with her.

617
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,540
I'm afraid it's not easy

618
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,540
to deal with her in the back house.

619
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,540
Then,

620
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,540
I'll follow your advice

621
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,540
and make a clear decision.

622
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,540
Thank you, my lords.

623
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,540
Thank you, my lords.

624
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,540
Luo Youxiang,

625
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,540
take your daughter back

626
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,540
and train her.

627
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,540
Thank you, my lords.

628
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,540
As for this maid,

629
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,540
Zhang Li...

630
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,540
My lords, please forgive me.

631
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,540
I'm sorry.

632
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,540
My lords, please forgive me.

633
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,540
I'm sorry.

634
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,540
Father.

635
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,540
It's over.

636
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,540
I can understand

637
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,540
what you did today.

638
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,540
I shouldn't have forced you.

639
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,540
I'm sorry

640
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,540
for you.

641
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,540
It's just a official position.

642
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,540
Your safety is not important.

643
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,540
You and Huaijin

644
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,540
are my children.

645
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,540
Huaijin has saved the family

646
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,540
with his life.

647
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,540
Before he died,

648
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:20,540
he still missed you.

649
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:24,540
Although you think for yourself,

650
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,540
you're a son,

651
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,540
but you're not wrong.

652
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,540
I'm sorry.

653
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,540
I'm sorry.

654
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,540
I'm sorry.

655
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,540
I'm sorry.

656
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,540
I'm sorry.

657
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,540
But

658
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,540
it's over.

659
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,540
Come back.

660
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:57,540
I'll follow your order.

661
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,540
Master, according to the situation,

662
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,540
His Majesty won't

663
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,540
do anything to Miss.

664
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,540
Why did you give up the official position?

665
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,540
Can't you see

666
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,540
what happened today?

667
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:22,540
Without His Majesty's permission,

668
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,540
who dares to put Meng family

669
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,540
in the position of Mo Fei?

670
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,540
When did Meng family

671
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,540
suffer such humiliation?

672
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,540
Now, His Majesty

673
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,540
is not willing to

674
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,540
let Meng family

675
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,540
be the official position.

676
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,540
Now, His Majesty

677
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:40,540
has left no trace

678
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,540
to the attitude of Meng family.

679
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,540
It's better to retreat.

680
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,540
On the one hand,

681
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,540
he can leave some memories for His Majesty.

682
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,540
On the other hand,

683
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,540
he can also be the foundation

684
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,540
for the Meng family's

685
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,540
re-establishment.

686
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,540
Besides,

687
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,540
I'm old.

688
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,540
Huaijin has left, too.

689
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,540
I'm old.

690
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,540
I'm old.

691
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,540
I'm old.

692
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,540
I'm old.

693
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,540
I'm old.

694
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,540
I'm old.

695
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,540
I'm old.

696
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,540
I'm old.

697
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,540
I'm old.

698
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,540
I'm old.

699
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,540
I'm old.

700
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,540
I'm old.

701
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,540
I'm old.

702
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,540
I'm old.

703
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,540
I'm old.

704
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,540
I'm old.

705
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,540
Thank you for what you've done just now.

706
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,540
You're welcome.

707
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,820
I know

708
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:06,740
I'm willing to do it.

709
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,420
You're a smart man.

710
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,660
If there's no family to help you,

711
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,220
you wouldn't do such a

712
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,700
harmful and useless stupid thing.

713
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,860
But since you've chosen your path,

714
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,260
from now on,

715
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,700
we're not the same kind of people.

716
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,660
We don't have to share the same dream.

717
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:25,060
It's good for you and me.

718
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,220
Take care.

719
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,780
Meng,

720
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,780
can you talk to me?

721
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,540
Are you still willing to call me Meng?

722
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,180
Have you removed

723
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,980
your family lock today?

724
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:54,820
Yes.

725
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,500
Thank you, Your Highness.

726
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,980
I hope you can get real freedom

727
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,060
after removing your uncle's seal.

728
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:02,820
Now,

729
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:06,540
do you know

730
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:09,140
that since the first day you joined the family,

731
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,380
I've done a lot of things to you?

732
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,660
I made you suffer in the wedding day

733
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,460
and took you to the study

734
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,340
to prevent you from having any problems with the Prime Minister.

735
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,940
Now I'm poisoning you.

736
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:24,460
After knowing all these,

737
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,580
why are you still willing to hug me?

738
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,140
You're just doing it for the family.

739
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:33,780
I'm sorry.

740
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,260
As the daughter of Meng family,

741
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,300
I can't live

742
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,140
according to my own wishes.

743
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,460
Although I'm your mother-in-law,

744
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,220
I actually envy you.

745
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,660
Envy me?

746
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,660
We've known each other for a short time.

747
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,500
But in my heart,

748
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,300
I always feel that you and I are the same kind of people.

749
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,900
It's just that I was born in the Meng family.

750
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,260
From the very beginning, I was destined to be

751
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,540
tortured for the family's identity.

752
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,260
Although you're far away from home,

753
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,660
you don't have to be a burden to the family.

754
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,460
You just have to follow your own heart

755
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,260
and do what you want to do.

756
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,620
Such a free life

757
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,980
is not what I think.

758
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:25,900
So,

759
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,060
I made a big deal

760
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,060
on this matter on purpose.

761
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:36,020
The maid was so straightforward.

762
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,540
I guess it was arranged by you.

763
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,620
You're indeed blessed with a strange and brilliant heart.

764
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,020
In my life,

765
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,940
I have many things I can't do.

766
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,420
But today,

767
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,420
I made a selfish choice

768
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:55,260
to be with you.

769
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:57,860
In the end,

770
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,940
you, me and Mr. Xiang

771
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,580
are rational people.

772
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,820
You won't be overwhelmed by feelings

773
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,820
and will calmly judge.

774
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,300
I'm not lucky.

775
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:13,300
Between the one I married and my family,

776
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,020
I can only choose one.

777
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,660
I hope your luck

778
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,380
can be better than mine.

779
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:33,540
Take care.

780
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,420
How do you know

781
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:49,420
I'm just another

782
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:50,580
and ungrateful person

783
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:52,180
in Qi State?

784
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:06,660
Where's Mr. Xiang?

785
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,420
He left early.

786
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,140
He asked me to send you home.

787
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:14,020
It's a nice day today.

788
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:16,060
I want to go for a walk, too.

789
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:18,620
You should go back first.

790
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:39,860
Duan Yunxin.

791
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:46,780
Why are you so sad?

792
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:48,540
Are you reluctant to part with Madam?

793
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:55,260
Are you reluctant to part with Mr. Xiang?

794
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:59,900
We're not that close.

795
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:04,380
We're not close because we were in the same position

796
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:05,140
and had the same interests.

797
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:06,060
We're rivals.

798
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:08,020
From now on,

799
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,660
we're sisters.

800
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,060
Come to my house more often if you have time.

801
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:15,100
Aren't you sad at all?

802
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:18,660
The daughter of the Shi family

803
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:20,060
is unworthy of marriage.

804
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:21,940
In this case,

805
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:23,380
you should protect yourself.

806
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,380
In this world,

807
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,140
the one who should love you the most

808
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:31,180
is yourself.

809
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:34,980
Madam Qin.

810
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:37,380
The carriage has arrived.

811
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:39,580
Don't call me Madam Qin.

812
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:40,660
Call me Miss Jieyu.

813
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:42,820
Yes, Miss Jieyu.

814
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:43,420
I'm leaving.

815
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:47,960
Why...

816
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Why are you...

817
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:53,500
You...

818
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,300
When you turn around

819
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:08,100
and no phone hands slot blocked,

820
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:11,040
the stranger's heart

821
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,280
friendlier

822
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,760
than grass.

823
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:18,980
Thoughts

824
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:23,180
Always in the night

825
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:24,980
The happier

826
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:27,180
The more afraid

827
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:33,580
Your eyes are like stars in the sky

828
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:36,180
Clear and transparent

829
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,380
Shining in the sky

830
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:44,380
Because of you, the world is a scenery

831
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:47,980
Warm and happy, the wind blows

832
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:51,180
Write down the love

833
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:54,780
Even if we separate, we will never stop

834
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:57,980
Life and death

835
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:01,780
Those simple and ordinary morning

836
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:04,380
My dream

837
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:07,780
Three times a week

838
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:11,180
I want to be with you

839
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:15,480
Those memories float in the blood

840
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:18,280
Bit by bit

841
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:21,980
The once without unfortunate destiny

842
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:25,380
Never end

843
00:47:41,180 --> 00:48:04,100
Said the one who lock is the

844
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:05,580
secret

845
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:37,580
The Love by Hypnotic

846
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:45,580
I wish to grow up in the muddy fields

847
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:52,580
Regret is in the despair

848
00:48:52,580 --> 00:49:00,580
I still wish to hold the flowers in my arms

849
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:11,580
Even if I have to cut myself into pieces, how can I sing with my soul?

850
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:25,580
Who has lost the heart of a flower?

851
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:28,580
Love and hate can only be eaten

852
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:38,580
The flowers wither, the white snow falls, no more notice

853
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:50,580
How can I love the crazy love?

854
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:57,580
I'm not afraid to be tamed by the five realms

855
00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:04,580
I used to listen to her, what she said was related to the flowers

856
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:15,580
It turns out that she has the answer of love
