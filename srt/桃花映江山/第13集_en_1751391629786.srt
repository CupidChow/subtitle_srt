1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:17,240
Her tea arrives at the

2
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,680
Decaya falls into yesterday's questions

3
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,420
Try to knock away the wind and clouds

4
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:39,740
I wait for your last goodbye

5
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,640
If we're choice of crushed memories

6
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,000
If you follow my sincerity

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,280
Only good friends and Badness

8
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:29,280
The Long Ballad

9
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,280
The Long Ballad

10
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,280
The Long Ballad

11
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,280
The Long Ballad

12
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,280
The Long Ballad

13
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,280
Episode 16

14
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,280
Father,

15
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,280
we used to hunt the bamboo ourselves.

16
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,280
It's not easy to get the people's flags this year.

17
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,280
Why don't we have a competition?

18
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,280
Let's see who can hunt more.

19
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,280
Your idea is good.

20
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,280
Your Majesty,

21
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,280
how about a competition?

22
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,280
Let's see

23
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,280
the style of our Qin men.

24
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,280
Since Princess Lan thinks it's fun,

25
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,280
let's do it this way.

26
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,280
Today is the Spring Hunting.

27
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,280
Whoever can get the first prize

28
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,280
will be the winner.

29
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,280
Give him the prize.

30
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,280
Your Majesty is wise.

31
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,280
I heard that you are good at martial arts.

32
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,280
I wonder if you can get the first prize today.

33
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,280
We don't know the result yet.

34
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,280
Do you want to compete?

35
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,280
Shen Zaiye,

36
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,280
I was the enemy yesterday.

37
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,280
I won't let you win today.

38
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,280
I'm looking forward to it.

39
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,280
Your Majesty,

40
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,280
the first prize is yours.

41
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,280
I'll give it to you.

42
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,280
Thanks.

43
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,280
Your Majesty,

44
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,280
you can go now.

45
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,280
I'll go now.

46
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,280
Go.

47
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,280
Go.

48
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,280
Go.

49
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,280
Go.

50
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,280
Go.

51
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,280
Go.

52
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,280
Go.

53
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,280
Go.

54
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,280
It's very risky.

55
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,280
Please be careful.

56
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,280
Go.

57
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,280
I want to see

58
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,280
if you are more strong

59
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,280
than me.

60
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,280
Go.

61
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,280
Shi Wan, stop.

62
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,280
Let me go.

63
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,280
Go.

64
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,280
I'm scared.

65
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,280
Please be careful.

66
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,280
Go away.

67
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,280
Go away.

68
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,280
Are you okay?

69
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,280
People say

70
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,280
that the dragon is born to be a dragon, the phoenix is born to be a phoenix.

71
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,280
I usually see that you are not so arrogant.

72
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,280
You are quite brave.

73
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,280
It's late.

74
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,280
Go back with me.

75
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,280
Let's see what they have got.

76
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,280
Your Highness.

77
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,280
Are you crazy?

78
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,280
You can't do any martial arts.

79
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,280
What if you are killed by a horse?

80
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,280
I can't just watch you fall down

81
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,280
from the horse.

82
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,280
What if you fall down?

83
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,280
I'm good at martial arts.

84
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,280
I can't fall down.

85
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,280
What's wrong?

86
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,280
My foot.

87
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,280
This way.

88
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,280
This way.

89
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,280
Does it hurt here?

90
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,280
It should be fine.

91
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,280
It's just a sprain.

92
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,280
Why are you here?

93
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,280
I...

94
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,280
I just want to find a quiet place

95
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,280
to read a book.

96
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,280
Then you disturbed me.

97
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,280
It's all my fault.

98
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,280
I'm so ashamed.

99
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,280
Your Highness, are you okay?

100
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,280
This horse is too fierce.

101
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,280
It almost hurt you.

102
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,280
We'll deal with it right now.

103
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,280
Wait.

104
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,280
It's just a sprain.

105
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,280
Don't be like this.

106
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,280
It's okay.

107
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,280
dehydration

108
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,280
Report!

109
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:03,780
The

110
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:13,780
Demon descend from Heaven coffee

111
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,200
Your Highness

112
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:42,400
The prince

113
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,440
Her Majesty

114
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,120
I'll watch the deputy switched

115
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,160
Your Highness

116
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,260
But she could not속

117
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,760
Wen Rob bd

118
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,880
For me,

119
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,880
previewing is rare

120
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,160
Let her leave

121
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,140
Get up

122
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,200
Meet 100

123
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,220
Usually pass

124
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:07,940
Get up

125
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,900
between you and Prime Minister Shen.

126
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,860
He's always a clear target.

127
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,100
He's a man of his word.

128
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:30,700
Are you sure?

129
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,340
Although there's some distance,

130
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,500
I've noticed that

131
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,740
the horse riding action of Prime Minister

132
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,420
is different from today.

133
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,500
If he's not Prime Minister,

134
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,460
and acts like a man of his word,

135
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,820
what's his motive?

136
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,460
Dinner's ready!

137
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:53,860
Dinner's ready!

138
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,100
We've searched everywhere!

139
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,260
How can we eat?

140
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,340
It's the Spring Festival.

141
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,820
The Crown Prince has given you a holiday.

142
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:02,740
You're still arguing

143
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,780
without a proper meal.

144
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,300
I'll let you get married.

145
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,100
I'll let you eat.

146
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,580
You won't eat, will you?

147
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,660
Oh, no.

148
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,340
Chen Zhen,

149
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,340
there's something

150
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,580
you need to do for me.

151
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,500
You're so bad!

152
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:31,820
Eat!

153
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,780
Eat!

154
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:38,780
Eat!

155
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,580
Eat!

156
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,580
Eat!

157
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:00,780
What's wrong, Huaijin?

158
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,660
Something happened.

159
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,300
It's not Shen Zaiye.

160
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,220
He was fake.

161
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,220
What?

162
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,940
Shen Zaiye didn't go to

163
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,380
the Miner's to find the Miner?

164
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:09,860
Don't worry.

165
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,180
I'll send someone to

166
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,180
suppress the Miner

167
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,180
and kill Shen Zaiye.

168
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,060
If we can kill him,

169
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,260
there won't be any consequences.

170
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,140
Okay.

171
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,500
Meng Huaijin, where are you going?

172
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,420
Someone just reported

173
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,540
Meng Huaijin was checking the hunting ground

174
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,500
in front of the tent.

175
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,700
Did he find out

176
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,740
that we were acting strange?

177
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,860
If you continue to pretend to be Prime Minister,

178
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,580
he might have already been suspicious.

179
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,940
He seems gentle,

180
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,700
but he's actually cruel

181
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,700
and obsessed.

182
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,940
What about you, Lady Jiang?

183
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,580
I'll go to the Fourth Prince to help Prime Minister.

184
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,580
We'll split up.

185
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,580
Take five people to guard the cave

186
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,380
to prevent any miscalculation.

187
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,020
Yes.

188
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,580
Open the door.

189
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,180
Yes.

190
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:03,860
Come out! Hurry!

191
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:04,860
Hurry up!

192
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,620
Let's go!

193
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,460
Let's go!

194
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,060
Sir,

195
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,420
you... you are...

196
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,260
It's urgent.

197
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,100
Let's go out first.

198
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:12,780
Thank you, Sir.

199
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,380
Follow up, everyone.

200
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,180
Thank you, Sir.

201
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:14,900
Hurry up!

202
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,620
Hurry up!

203
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,620
Hurry up!

204
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,620
Hurry up!

205
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,380
Sir,

206
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,580
you are...

207
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,420
It's urgent.

208
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,420
Let's go out first.

209
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,100
Thank you, Sir.

210
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:23,780
Follow up, everyone.

211
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,660
Thank you, Sir.

212
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,660
Thank you, Sir.

213
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,660
We're saved.

214
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,660
We're saved.

215
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,380
Hurry up!

216
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,180
Be careful!

217
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,380
Back up!

218
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,540
Get up!

219
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,860
Take the things and block the way!

220
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:49,940
Get the boxes!

221
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,820
Hide behind the boxes!

222
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:54,980
Let's go!

223
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:18,660
Slide!

224
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,500
Fourth Prince!

225
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,740
Do you think

226
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,820
it's hard to sell it?

227
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,420
I'll get you an umbrella.

228
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:30,900
No need.

229
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,020
There are no rules

230
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,300
except for the mansion.

231
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,820
There are many people here.

232
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,460
You're a noble lady.

233
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,860
Don't be watched.

234
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,340
I'll go find some medicine to remove the mosquitoes.

235
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,660
Don't worry.

236
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,500
It's almost time

237
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,860
to go to the funeral.

238
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,380
His Lordship is not here.

239
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,740
We're sisters.

240
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,860
Let's chat.

241
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,660
Go up.

242
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,060
Stop.

243
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,300
Don't let them come.

244
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,300
My lord.

245
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,340
You're a good man.

246
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,500
I beg you.

247
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:25,460
Take them out

248
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,580
and let them come back.

249
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,380
Make them happy.

250
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,540
Okay.

251
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:31,980
I promise you.

252
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,620
My lord.

253
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,620
Save us.

254
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:48,980
Please.

255
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,140
Please don't kill us.

256
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:50,660
My lord.

257
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,500
Save us.

258
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,100
My lord.

259
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,020
Save us.

260
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:53,500
Save us.

261
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,500
We don't want to die.

262
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,420
We don't want to die.

263
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,180
My lord.

264
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,220
Please save us.

265
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,780
Save us.

266
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,860
My lord.

267
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,100
We don't want to die.

268
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,380
Shifu.

269
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,580
Chicken.

270
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,380
Kill them!

271
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:27,100
The King's Avatar

272
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,100
Episode 16

273
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,100
The Crown Prince is in heaven.

274
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,940
The Crown Prince is coming.

275
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,700
Why doesn't the Prime Minister make any move?

276
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,500
Sister.

277
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,380
It's too sunny today.

278
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,580
My head hurts from the sun.

279
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,900
I want to go back and rest.

280
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,340
What?

281
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,180
You always call me sister.

282
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,940
But you don't even want to stay with me for a while.

283
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,180
Today,

284
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,860
I just want you to watch the competition with me.

285
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,860
What if I have to leave today?

286
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,860
A woman should marry a man.

287
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,580
If her husband is not around,

288
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,780
her concubine will listen to her mother.

289
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,180
If you dare to leave now,

290
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,580
I'll go to see her right away

291
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,100
and tell His Majesty

292
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,900
that you are spoiled and disrespected your mother.

293
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,700
But my head really hurts.

294
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,180
I want to go back and rest.

295
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,500
His Majesty

296
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,820
won't be so heartless, right?

297
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,700
Yes.

298
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,900
His Majesty is always right.

299
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,740
If we make a scene,

300
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,980
he will definitely call the Prime Minister back

301
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,540
and beat us 50 times.

302
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,220
But

303
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,860
is that what you really want?

304
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,660
I envy the Prime Minister

305
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,180
for the whole hunting ground.

306
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,220
You are so brave.

307
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,420
Lady Jiang,

308
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,300
I heard that you are good at chess.

309
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,100
They will have another competition soon.

310
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,620
Why don't you go and check the chess pieces?

311
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,140
Let's have a match.

312
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,020
Why don't you go hunting?

313
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,940
It's fun to play chess and shoot arrows.

314
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,260
Now, with the rules,

315
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,780
it's boring.

316
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,860
Let me compete with you.

317
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,420
It's good for me and Lady Jiang

318
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,580
to play chess and taste tea together.

319
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,580
But the chess pieces are so ordinary.

320
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,180
Don't you think I'm not bad?

321
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,340
You are worse than your Prime Minister.

322
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,220
He is the bad chess piece that His Majesty personally ordered.

323
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:09,580
Lady Jiang,

324
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,580
you still want to be the witness for the Prime Minister?

325
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,380
I won't invite you.

326
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,740
Take back what you have bought client.

327
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,820
I'm returning to my tent and exchange a piece of clothes.

328
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:40,900
I will be back soon.

329
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,060
No hurry.

330
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,620
Lady Jiang, go ahead.

331
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,780
Thank you, Your Highness.

332
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,080
You' going down.

333
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,900
Quiet, witty, game,

334
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:17,300
and

335
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,780
Kill him.

336
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:19,820
You'll be rewarded.

337
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:20,620
Go!

338
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,340
He's still alive.

339
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,620
Kill him!

340
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,940
The time is up.

341
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,500
The hunting is over.

342
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,020
There are 35 princes

343
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,300
and 36 ministers.

344
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,060
It's a blessing for us

345
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,020
to have such a brave and good warrior

346
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,380
as your father's subject.

347
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,260
This Shen Ai Qing

348
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,060
is the first time I've seen him.

349
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,500
He's so handsome.

350
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,780
He's so handsome.

351
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:12,980
He's so handsome.

352
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,260
He's so handsome.

353
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,460
He's so handsome.

354
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,780
He's so handsome.

355
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,980
The first time I saw him

356
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,020
was when I saw his

357
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,660
archery skills.

358
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,020
Wu Gou,

359
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:25,220
you still need to work hard.

360
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,460
Father,

361
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,340
I'm not inferior to Prime Minister Shen.

362
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,780
But since Prime Minister Shen is tough,

363
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,140
why didn't he show up?

364
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,660
Is he not interested

365
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,580
in your talent?

366
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,100
Should I ask him

367
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,460
to come here?

368
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,860
I thank you.

369
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:04,940
Shen Ai Qing,

370
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,940
those are all yours.

371
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,620
Thank you for your kindness, Your Majesty.

372
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,500
Thank you for your kindness, Your Highness.

373
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,860
Thank you for your kindness, Your Majesty.

374
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,460
Thank you for your kindness, Your Majesty.

375
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,780
Thank you for your kindness, Your Majesty.

376
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,020
Everyone,

377
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,740
follow me to see

378
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,220
Shen Ai Qing's talent.

379
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,620
Go.

380
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,860
Your Highness,

381
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,740
it's me.

382
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,160
Come.

383
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,260
retaliate.

384
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,620
Thank you, Your Highness.

385
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,540
Go.

386
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,340
Your Highness.

387
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,060
Qingtan.

388
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,940
You go outside and guard.

389
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:41,940
Don't let anyone get close.

390
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:42,660
Yes.

391
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,020
We've rescued her.

392
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,220
Thanks to Your Highness's timely notice.

393
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,540
When I went there,

394
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,220
those people were already settled.

395
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,740
That's great.

396
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,580
Xiaolian can finally reunite with her brother.

397
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,180
Other husbands said

398
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,180
Xiaolian's brother

399
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,820
exchanged all the wages

400
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,220
for this with her brother.

401
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,860
He thought Xiaolian would look good with it.

402
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,020
He was worried about Xiaolian and her grandmother.

403
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,540
He wanted to escape alone.

404
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:23,980
Catch him.

405
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,260
Stop.

406
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:34,500
Run.

407
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,580
But those guards found him

408
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,500
and beat him to death.

409
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:47,460
You...

410
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:55,900
Your Highness.

411
00:24:59,220 --> 00:24:59,900
Your Highness.

412
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,180
What's wrong?

413
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,860
Xiaolian can't wait for her brother anymore.

414
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,220
Tell me.

415
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,660
Will Changjue

416
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,740
come back?

417
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:18,820
No.

418
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,500
Your Highness, you have to cheer up.

419
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,060
You're different from Xiaolian.

420
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,860
Changjue is waiting for you in the North Court.

421
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:28,620
Yes.

422
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,980
Changjue must be waiting for me.

423
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,460
By the way, Your Highness.

424
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:36,580
There's one more thing.

425
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:38,540
I just heard

426
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,500
the conversation between Shi and Mu Huaijin.

427
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,500
They sent someone

428
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,940
to kill the Prime Minister.

429
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,220
Lord Meng, Your Highness.

430
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,100
Bad news.

431
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,380
The Prime Minister sent someone

432
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,740
to take all the officials away.

433
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,900
I told you

434
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,500
to kill them.

435
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,100
Now Shen Zan has the evidence.

436
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,020
We have to play it safe.

437
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,260
What do you want?

438
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:06,660
Give me some time.

439
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,940
I'll figure something out.

440
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,500
I

441
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,500
can't wait to find out your plan.

442
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,420
Shen Zan is also a passer-by.

443
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,860
He died in the sword fight.

444
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,100
Why are you in such a mood?

445
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:32,900
Why do you ask me out?

446
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,380
Although the situation has been arranged,

447
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,780
if you didn't inform the Fourth Prince in time,

448
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,620
the dungeon wouldn't have been so smooth.

449
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,500
You're being serious.

450
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,700
I'm just following the plan.

451
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,940
Just like what you said in the mine.

452
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,380
Since we're here together,

453
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,700
we have to leave together.

454
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,260
How can I just

455
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,740
watch you

456
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,260
alone in the trap?

457
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,340
Jiang Tahuo.

458
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,340
Jiang Tahuo.

459
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,140
Now,

460
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,900
I finally

461
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,420
saved you once.

462
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,700
Jiang Tahuo.

463
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,660
Jiang Tahuo.

464
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,820
Are you fine?

465
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,660
Your Highness.

466
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,500
I'm so sorry.

467
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,020
It's okay.

468
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,420
I was just thinking.

469
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,060
Spell on it.

470
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,340
Princess.

471
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,340
I'm sorry.

472
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:18,940
Fu'er.

473
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:19,860
Father.

474
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,180
Zhang Lu.

475
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,180
Where's the imperial doctor?

476
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,140
Where's the imperial doctor?

477
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,060
Why hasn't he come yet?

478
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,540
Coming.

479
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,660
The imperial doctor is here.

480
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,820
Don't worry, Your Highness.

481
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,260
Imperial doctor Li is good at medicine.

482
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,220
He's good at archery.

483
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,220
He'll make you safe and sound.

484
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:48,980
Thank you, Your Highness.

485
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,340
Thank you, Your Majesty.

486
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,660
I'll save Lady Jiang.

487
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,860
It's good that she's fine.

488
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,460
I can rest assured.

489
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,740
These people are really bold.

490
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,700
They dare to attack the royal hunting ground.

491
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:21,940
Your Majesty.

492
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,140
Lady Jiang was punished on behalf of me.

493
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,420
If it weren't for her,

494
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,660
I would have been shot.

495
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,740
Your Majesty, please investigate this matter thoroughly.

496
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,100
Your Majesty.

497
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:37,620
I'm sorry.

498
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:38,700
I'm sorry.

499
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,060
Please.

500
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,420
Even if you don't mention it,

501
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,220
I won't let them off.

502
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,540
I must make them pay.

503
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,460
Commander Zhang.

504
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,380
Yes.

505
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,020
No matter what,

506
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,660
find the assassin for me.

507
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:56,420
Yes.

508
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:01,380
Search.

509
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,500
Search.

510
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:03,540
Hurry.

511
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,660
Keep searching.

512
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:06,540
Yes.

513
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,460
Hurry.

514
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,260
Go.

515
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:12,580
Go.

516
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,100
How is it?

517
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,780
Did you do the assassination?

518
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:26,940
I didn't do it.

519
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,740
I found the assassin at first.

520
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,580
But I let him go later.

521
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,180
After all, I don't want to cause trouble

522
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,220
under the eyes of my father.

523
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:41,220
You don't believe me?

524
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,260
A tiger won't die.

525
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,220
It's a shame to be hurt.

526
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:55,020
With the means of God,

527
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,340
I didn't kill him this time.

528
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,140
I shouldn't act rashly

529
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,340
in the next period.

530
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,860
Will you agree to be my wife?

531
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:05,500
Yes.

532
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:06,860
I will.

533
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:08,980
When did I

534
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,020
never agree to what my cousin said?

535
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,460
Without solid evidence,

536
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,380
based on your status,

537
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:16,860
you don't need to agree.

538
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,780
I will write to my father

539
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,180
and ask him to come here as soon as possible.

540
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:24,940
It's strange.

541
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,580
Who did this assassination?

542
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,180
It doesn't matter who did it.

543
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,500
It must be Shen Zai.

544
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,580
He offended many people outside.

545
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:41,100
But the lady blocked him.

546
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,380
He is really a traitor.

547
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,540
Your Highness, take the medicine.

548
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,740
How can you recover without taking the medicine?

549
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,420
What kind of doctor is he?

550
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,300
Didn't he say he would recover after being stabbed?

551
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,540
Why is Your Highness having a fever?

552
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,060
I'll do it.

553
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,220
Don't bother.

554
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:19,180
not only to see Son Tianluo

555
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,220
not only thinking

556
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,340
about how to protect himself

557
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,420
I'm afraid...

558
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,500
I heard there's a temple nearby.

559
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,860
I'll go beg for Princess.

560
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,140
It's just an abandoned temple.

561
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,300
There's no firewood there.

562
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,460
It's no use begging.

563
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:46,660
Besides,

564
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,500
it's very dangerous for the night.

565
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,860
Don't get yourself into trouble.

566
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,660
When you think about what you've done for me,

567
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,380
your gait will get catalytic.

568
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,940
It's only first time for you.

569
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,260
Since I met you,

570
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,780
I feel nothing for first time.

571
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:29,900
In theину,

572
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:34,540
I just dressed as the建筑達 Creative點

573
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,580
Take your place.

574
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,420
Take your place.

575
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,740
Where neste of His Highness Bo July that day

576
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:41,940
Ten greater talents

577
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,740
When the Crown Prince is moved to the Meng family,

578
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,740
he must be in the military with my name.

579
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:51,020
Only then can His Majesty understand the family's roots.

580
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:54,140
I never thought Jiang Daohua

581
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,820
would be on my side.

582
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:15,740
If we don't share our sorrows,

583
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:21,540
I'm not the one who can't be the one to be feared.

584
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:26,740
No matter how many times I have to beg you to send me away,

585
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,740
I don't dare to.

586
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,140
Jiang Daohua is a man of fire.

587
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,340
He's willing to be my enemy.

588
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,940
I know I'm a sinner.

589
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,740
But I'm not worthy of being a man of fire.

590
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,740
I only ask for Buddha's blessings.

591
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:44,540
Jiang Daohua can wake up safely.

592
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,740
I only ask for Buddha's blessings.

593
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,740
ró

594
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,940
strange.

595
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,540
How did you get to my state?

596
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,660
Xiang Yu.

597
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,740
It's good that you're awake.

598
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:19,900
I'll bring the moss in.

599
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,820
It's above North Face.

600
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,700
This is not a突破洞.

601
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,620
It's a feeling of carbuncle.

602
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,380
You care too much for this feeling.

603
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:57,660
Shunzhi,

604
00:37:58,980 --> 00:37:59,240
don't make this

605
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,620
in front of duck widows.

606
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,160
This place is too big of a big problem.

607
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,340
Haoyue真的很熱,

608
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:07,980
I'm scared.

609
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,140
Her Highness is awake.

610
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,020
Your Highness, I knew you would be fine.

611
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,100
After Lady Jiang woke up,

612
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,620
you can finally relax.

613
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,260
By the way,

614
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,220
His Highness has been hiding in the tent

615
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,220
and not leaving the house.

616
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,980
He's quite calm.

617
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,700
He won't be calm soon.

618
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:25,660
Besides,

619
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,020
although Lady Jiang is awake,

620
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,660
she's still weak.

621
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,300
She has to know nothing about the assassination

622
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,380
before she can rest well.

623
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,380
No one can disturb her.

624
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,220
Do you understand?

625
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,180
Don't worry, Your Highness.

626
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,620
Your Highness, the porridge.

627
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,900
What's wrong?

628
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,180
You don't recognize me?

629
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,460
Your Highness, you don't know

630
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,620
that His Excellency came back with you.

631
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,100
I thought...

632
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:00,860
I thought you...

633
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,420
I haven't saved him yet.

634
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,660
How could I let anything happen to myself?

635
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:08,500
I just heard

636
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,180
the talk between His Highness and Meng Huaijin.

637
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,180
I was surprised to see the truth.

638
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,820
I've known about this.

639
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,540
I'll prepare for it.

640
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,380
Qingtai,

641
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,180
help me grind the shards.

642
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,100
Yes.

643
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,380
Blocking the arrows

644
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,900
is just a way to rest.

645
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,540
This is too dangerous.

646
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,580
How can you risk your own safety?

647
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,420
I have to bet once.

648
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:47,660
I can't just

649
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,340
make a good deal

650
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,860
and cooperate with Meng Huaijin.

651
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:52,620
I want to make him

652
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,700
the biggest opportunity

653
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,940
to get rid of Lv Heng.

654
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,660
But

655
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:01,420
the medicine and the imperial physician

656
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,540
came too soon.

657
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:05,860
It's like I was prepared for it.

658
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,220
But

659
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,580
Your Highness, you don't even know

660
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,100
how serious you were

661
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,500
when you rushed up there that day.

662
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,100
It was really unbearable.

663
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,620
Even I

664
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,460
thought you really liked

665
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,020
the incense.

666
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,260
I was so scared.

667
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,620
I've been in a coma for a while.

668
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,340
Is there anything unusual

669
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:27,980
about Shen Zaiye?

670
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:30,060
I'm angry when you mention it.

671
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,820
You just happened to

672
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,940
run away with the stove.

673
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,460
You're so cunning.

674
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,020
You don't know what you're doing.

675
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,500
Your Highness was so badly hurt

676
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,500
to save him.

677
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,060
He was not anxious at all.

678
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,180
Your Highness,

679
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,500
I think your plan

680
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,580
failed.

681
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:46,860
You were

682
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:47,980
beaten for nothing.

683
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,940
are jobs closed.

684
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,500
I won't share the burden.

685
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,020
You discorded with me

686
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,340
and started speaks in His Highness's ear.

687
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,940
You mean

688
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,180
you brought the pork

689
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,100
to relieve Wy said.

690
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:34,740
Yes.

691
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,820
этихணwords with her.

692
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:38,100
Let's go.

693
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:43,780
Your Highness,

694
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,020
Qingying,

695
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,340
you're here.

696
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,940
My brother didn't want me to disturb you.

697
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,740
But you asked me to come here.

698
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,260
You can't blame me.

699
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:53,780
Come on.

700
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:54,940
Sit.

701
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,140
You have to explain it to my brother this time.

702
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:58,420
Or he'll punish me again.

703
00:41:58,620 --> 00:41:59,300
Of course.

704
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,140
Qingying,

705
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:06,540
I'm sorry.

706
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,380
You know I'm seriously injured.

707
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,500
You shouldn't be so happy.

708
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:11,540
You even brought meat to visit me.

709
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,540
You're so thoughtful.

710
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:14,540
Of course.

711
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,540
I'm the most thoughtful one.

712
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,900
I've been in a coma for so many days.

713
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:23,620
I've caused you trouble.

714
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:24,940
I didn't scare you, right?

715
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:25,940
How could you?

716
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,180
You think I scared you?

717
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,820
But I heard from Qingtai

718
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,100
that even the imperial physician felt it was serious.

719
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,540
It's really serious.

720
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,420
My brother, who doesn't believe in the Buddha,

721
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:47,300
went to the temple and prayed for your safety.

722
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:48,940
Luckily, you saved him.

723
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:49,820
Listen to me.

724
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:57,980
Qingying,

725
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,780
it's too noisy to be roasted in the tent.

726
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,900
Your Highness's injury hasn't fully healed.

727
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,260
And it'll be more troublesome if it gets wet.

728
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:07,820
It's just a barbecue.

729
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,340
It won't be that easy to get wet.

730
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:12,740
All right.

731
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:14,820
I'll go play with you.

732
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:15,380
What do you think?

733
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:16,580
I'm not done yet.

734
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:17,620
Let's go.

735
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,060
No, I'm not done yet.

736
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:20,420
I'll call someone to clean it up.

737
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:20,940
Wait.

738
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:21,420
Let's go.

739
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:22,460
How can I finish it?

740
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:30,180
Is this Miss Qingying

741
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:31,580
trying to kill Her Highness?

742
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:33,340
Oh my goodness.

743
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:38,900
Are you all right, Your Highness?

744
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,060
Qingtai,

745
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:43,340
my plan has worked.

746
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:45,540
A person like her

747
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:47,820
is willing to go to the temple for me.

748
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:09,540
The flowers bloom without knowing it.

749
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:12,540
The beauty of flowers can't be ignored.

750
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:15,140
The flowers fall,

751
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:16,740
the north wind blows.

752
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:20,140
The city is in a state of panic.

753
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:23,940
The petals are drenched in the rain.

754
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:27,340
My heart is torn.

755
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:29,140
The flowers fall,

756
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:31,140
the rain falls.

757
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:33,140
The tears fall.

758
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:35,140
The flowers fall.

759
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:36,740
The tears fall.

760
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:38,740
The heart is torn.

761
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:43,740
There is nowhere to go.

762
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:56,340
I wish to grow up in the muddy fields.

763
00:44:56,740 --> 00:45:03,740
Regret is in the despair.

764
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:06,540
I still hope that

765
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:10,940
the flowers in my arms will bloom.

766
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:15,140
Even if I have to cut myself,

767
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:22,140
I will sing this song to you.

768
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:36,740
Who will lose the heart?

769
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:40,340
Love and hate can only be eaten.

770
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:42,140
The flowers wither,

771
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:43,940
the heart is torn.

772
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:50,940
There is no need to tell.

773
00:45:54,940 --> 00:46:01,940
Waiting for the crazy love to come.

774
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:03,640
I'm not afraid of being

775
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:09,140
tamed by the five realms.

776
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:11,140
I'm quiet.

777
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:13,140
The words he said

778
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:16,140
are related to the words.

779
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,140
It turns out that

780
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:28,140
he has a heart of gold.
