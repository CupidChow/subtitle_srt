1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,700
My Girlfriend Luzi

2
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,720
Episode 19

3
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,720
The more you buy, the more you can get.

4
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,320
Taobao Shankou invites you to see the world of peach blossoms.

5
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,760
Prime Minister, this is it.

6
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,000
The place of the Northern Courtyard is Luocheng.

7
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,560
I'll go in first.

8
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,200
You take five people to look around the city.

9
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,600
The rest, wait outside.

10
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,800
Do you want me to change your clothes?

11
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:20,760
No need.

12
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,720
If anyone in the city recognizes me,

13
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,360
whether it's an enemy or a friend,

14
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,040
they are all the people I'm looking for.

15
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,720
Gaozong

16
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,440
The peach blossom I only caught in my lifetime

17
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,640
can never be plants or super months

18
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,680
except for that when you are out and about.

19
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,520
But the almighty god

20
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,760
has given me another chance to get it.

21
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,640
I made great progress

22
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,160
despite the publishers' criticism.

23
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,120
I won't let you be alone again.

24
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,160
The heart in the season

25
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,120
becomes desolate like the seperate,

26
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:33,120
I'm afraid that she will only embrace the flowers in the roadside

27
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:41,120
Even if I have to cut the flowers to death, I will still sing a song for her

28
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,120
Qingtan

29
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,120
Princess

30
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,120
Princess, why are you here?

31
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,120
I'm here to see you

32
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,120
I'm here to see you

33
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,120
Princess

34
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,120
Welcome, Fourth Prince

35
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,120
General Dong, please get up

36
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,120
General, you are on the border

37
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,120
You protect our country and the people are safe and sound

38
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,120
You have done a lot of work

39
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,120
I shouldn't have been so generous

40
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,120
You are so kind

41
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,120
I have prepared a feast for you

42
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,120
I will give you a welcome

43
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,120
Please come in

44
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,120
I want to discuss with you about the bandits

45
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,120
As for the feast, I will depend on the soldiers

46
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,120
How is it?

47
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,120
You are interested in the people and are diligent in the affairs

48
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,120
I admire you

49
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,120
Please come in

50
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,120
Let's talk in the tent

51
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,120
General, I received a report on the way

52
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,120
that the bandits have fled to the north

53
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,120
I wonder how is the situation now

54
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,120
Your Highness

55
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,120
The bandits have fled into the north

56
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,120
If I send more troops to chase them

57
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,120
I'm afraid that they will provoke a war between the two countries

58
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,120
I can only guard the border

59
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,120
If the bandits dare to attack again

60
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,120
I will be very worried

61
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,120
I will take the risk

62
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,120
Guard the border

63
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,120
If the bandits dare to attack again

64
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,120
I will make sure that they will not regret it

65
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,120
What about the people who are caught in the north?

66
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,120
I will send someone to

67
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,120
make a pretext for the families of the people

68
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,120
The sage says

69
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,120
Love the people should love your children

70
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,120
If your own children are affected by this

71
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,120
are you just going to deal with it?

72
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,120
Your Highness

73
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,120
There are only dozens of people who have been attacked

74
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,120
If I send troops

75
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,120
and really provoke a war between the two countries

76
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,120
I'm afraid that the people who are affected by it

77
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,120
will be tens of millions of people

78
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,120
I hope that Your Highness will consider it

79
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,120
Don't cause trouble

80
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,120
and let down the Lord's cultivation of you

81
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,120
I understand what you said

82
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,120
But everything has its own changes

83
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,120
What I want to do is to save the people

84
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,120
And what you want to do is to send a group of people

85
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,120
to pretend to be the people

86
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,120
As long as we remove the military uniform

87
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,120
who will know that they are civil soldiers?

88
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,120
I'm just a martial arts master

89
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,120
I don't have much to say

90
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,120
General, you should learn from the current Prime Minister

91
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,120
to learn the power of power and change

92
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,120
Your Highness

93
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,120
The duty of the border is heavy

94
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,120
How can you leave the duty?

95
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,120
Besides, you are not in the military

96
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,120
I can't obey you

97
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,120
Mu Wu Xia

98
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,120
I always thought that you didn't like my brother's behavior

99
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,120
I didn't expect that the imperial examination

100
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,120
has changed you so much

101
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,120
I'm not a man who obeys the rules

102
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,120
I can learn from other people's habits

103
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,120
But the people are in trouble

104
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,120
How can I ignore it?

105
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,120
How about this?

106
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,120
We'll leave in a hurry

107
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,120
and sneak into the North Campus

108
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,120
and act accordingly

109
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,120
Your Highness, are you okay?

110
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,120
I'm fine

111
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,120
I'm fine

112
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,120
Your Highness, your safety is the most important

113
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,120
You can't take risks

114
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,120
Don't you see what His Majesty means?

115
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,120
His Majesty sent you here

116
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,120
to eliminate bandits

117
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,120
It's actually for your military merit

118
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,120
It's for your future

119
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,120
How can I not feel it?

120
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,120
But compared to the safety of the people

121
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,120
my future is nothing

122
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,120
What if the people have been killed long ago?

123
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,120
Then I have to do it with no regrets

124
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,120
Okay, I've made up my mind

125
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,120
Mu Wu Xia, I support you

126
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,120
I'll go with you

127
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,120
It's dangerous

128
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,120
Qingying, are you sure you want to go with me?

129
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,120
As long as we can save the people

130
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,120
no matter how dangerous it is

131
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,120
we can do it together

132
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,120
Your Highness, we've arrived in Luocheng

133
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,120
Commander Cui reported that

134
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,120
both Shen Zaiyi and Jiang Taohua have entered the city

135
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,120
Mu Wu Xia

136
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,120
Commander Cui asked you to go to the city

137
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,120
and you'll know

138
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,120
I'll go with you

139
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,120
Your Highness, the people are coming

140
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,120
If you want to hook me, you need me

141
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,120
You must catch Jiang Changjun

142
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,120
Before it gets dark, none of these people

143
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,120
can let go of me

144
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,120
I'll go with you

145
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,120
Yes, Your Highness

146
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,120
I'll go with you

147
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,120
Your Highness

148
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,120
I'll go with you

149
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,120
Your Highness

150
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,120
Your Highness

151
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,120
Your Highness

152
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,120
I'll go with you

153
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,120
Qingtai

154
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,120
Did you meet Changjue

155
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,120
and meet him again?

156
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,120
I went to the market every day

157
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,120
but I never saw the crown prince again

158
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,120
According to your Highness

159
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,120
Changjue is waiting for the execution in Luocheng

160
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,120
Do you know where the prison is?

161
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,120
I've been there

162
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,120
but I didn't see the crown prince

163
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,120
Even the chief officer Deng Xiao

164
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,120
and I searched in secret

165
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,120
but I didn't see the crown prince

166
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,120
So Changjue is not in Luocheng?

167
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,120
Your Highness's military law

168
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,120
is just a talk

169
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,120
between Shen Zaiye and me

170
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,120
Your Highness, it's not like that

171
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,120
I observed that the city's defense is difficult

172
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,120
Besides, the crown prince is being watched

173
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,120
It's not easy to escape

174
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,120
Maybe he can't get out of the city

175
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,120
so he'll find a place to hide

176
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,120
You just said

177
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,120
Changjue is in Luocheng

178
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,120
and he's protecting others

179
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,120
It's possible that someone

180
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,120
hides him

181
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,120
Let's ask them

182
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,120
Maybe we can find out

183
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,120
where Changjue goes

184
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,120
It's better than

185
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,120
we're so clueless now

186
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,120
Okay

187
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,120
Let's go

188
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,120
By the way

189
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,120
When did you meet Zhan Long?

190
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,120
Six days ago

191
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,120
So

192
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,120
you've been in Luocheng for six days

193
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,120
Yes

194
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,120
So

195
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,120
Shen Zaiye knows

196
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,120
I asked you to find Changjue

197
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,120
so he asked Zhan Long to come to you

198
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,120
I said so many cruel words

199
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,120
He still came to Luocheng

200
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,120
after all

201
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,120
Your Highness

202
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,120
Don't you want the prime minister to come?

203
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,120
Isn't it good for him to help us?

204
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,120
No, it's a trap

205
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,120
I don't know what Lv Hou

206
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,120
and the third prince want to do

207
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,120
I have to come for Changjue

208
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,120
even if it's a fire

209
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,120
But he's different

210
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,120
I don't want him and me

211
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,120
to be in danger together

212
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,120
Your Highness

213
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,120
Why are you so stubborn?

214
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,120
Since it's so dangerous here

215
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,120
we should find the crown prince

216
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,120
and leave here as soon as possible

217
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,120
Zhan Long's flag

218
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,120
Premier

219
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,120
It's you, miss

220
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,120
Lady Liu

221
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,120
Is the imperial physician back?

222
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,120
He should be coming soon

223
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,120
Lady Liu

224
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,120
Can we go in and wait for the imperial physician?

225
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,120
Please come in

226
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,120
Mother

227
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,120
We have a guest

228
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,120
A guest?

229
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,120
Princess

230
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,120
Get up

231
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,120
Princess

232
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,120
You still remember me?

233
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,120
How can I forget

234
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,120
how much the queen of Helan

235
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,120
has taken care of me?

236
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,120
We were in Luocheng

237
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,120
and were raised by the crown prince

238
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,120
But

239
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,120
I heard that

240
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,120
you were in Qi State

241
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,120
and were killed

242
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,120
Why?

243
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,120
It's a long story

244
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,120
I came here today

245
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,120
for Changjue

246
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,120
Your Highness

247
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,120
I heard from the lord

248
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,120
that the crown prince was missing

249
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,120
Nothing else

250
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,120
It seems that the lord and the lord

251
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,120
are back

252
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,120
I'll go and welcome them

253
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,120
Your Highness

254
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,120
Lady Liu, please get up

255
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,120
Your Highness

256
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,120
I never thought

257
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,120
I could see you again

258
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,120
in my lifetime

259
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,120
Some time ago

260
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,120
someone said that

261
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,120
the princess was killed by a fall

262
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,120
How could I believe

263
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,120
such a nonsense?

264
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,120
Then I heard from the crown prince

265
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,120
that you were still alive

266
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,120
I was relieved

267
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,120
Your wife just said

268
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,120
that she didn't know that I was still alive

269
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,120
You saw Changjue recently

270
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,120
She told you that

271
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,120
I was still alive

272
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,120
Right?

273
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,120
Lord

274
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,120
Just tell me

275
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,120
whatever you know

276
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,120
The princess is the princess's sister

277
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,120
You can't hide it from the princess

278
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,120
I can't hide it from the princess

279
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,120
After the crown prince escaped

280
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,120
I hid the crown prince

281
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,120
Your Highness

282
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,120
Please sit for a while

283
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,120
I'll go and invite the crown prince

284
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,120
Okay

285
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,120
So you don't know

286
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,120
where Taohua is?

287
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,120
Is she okay now?

288
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,120
Don't worry, Your Highness

289
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,120
The princess is with Qingtai

290
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,120
But after the princess saw Qingtai

291
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,120
she didn't say a word to me

292
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,120
Until they returned to the house

293
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,120
I came back by myself

294
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,120
You won't listen secretly?

295
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,120
It's strange

296
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,120
Nothing happened since I entered the city

297
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,120
Nothing happened?

298
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,120
It's not good if nothing happened

299
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,120
If Lv He really wants Taohua's life

300
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,120
it's the most valuable thing to break the antidote

301
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,120
But he used Changjue as an excuse

302
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,120
to lure Taohua here

303
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,120
The target should be me

304
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,120
But I was alone in the city for a long time

305
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,120
I didn't find an assassin

306
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,120
Did you see Changjue?

307
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,120
Qingtai said that the crown prince was missing

308
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,120
He seemed to have been looking for him in the city for a long time

309
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,120
For Lv He

310
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,120
a living Jiang Changjue

311
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,120
is more likely to be a bait than a dead Jiang Changjue

312
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,120
He is not here

313
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,120
just for death

314
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,120
Zhang Lu

315
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,120
You and I go to find Taohua and Changjue

316
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,120
Make sure they don't fall into Lv He's hands

317
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,120
Yes

318
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,120
Commander

319
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,120
We found the traces of Jiang Changjue

320
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,120
He is going to the Guards of the Guards

321
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,120
The Guards

322
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,120
Jiang Taohua is there too

323
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,120
It's enough

324
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,120
Take a few people

325
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,120
and catch them all

326
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,120
Yes

327
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,120
Princess

328
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,120
Why don't you go inside and rest for a while?

329
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,120
welcomed

330
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:22,120
Sis

331
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:22,760
Sister!

332
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,720
I want to go!

333
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,720
Sister!

334
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,000
I want to go!

335
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:50,840
Sister.

336
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,440
I have reached the end

337
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:19,240
to make it

338
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,080
He's not telling me anything.

339
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,720
What're you talking about?

340
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,800
You two are comm symbol.

341
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,760
Chow.

342
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,160
I miss you so much.

343
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,240
Ma Jue.

344
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,740
I like you too.

345
00:18:49,240 --> 00:19:02,960
The

346
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,320
security gift

347
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,960
of Seungri.

348
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,800
Look out.

349
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:19,920
Stop.

350
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,640
Be careful.

351
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,400
No.

352
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,760
If this continues, Shen Zanying and Chang Jue

353
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,720
won't last long.

354
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,640
Qin Tai, Yan Fei.

355
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,520
Shen Zanying.

356
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,240
Qin Tai, cover Young Master.

357
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,880
Hurry, retreat.

358
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,160
Thank you.

359
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,120
Shen Zanying.

360
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,840
You're here.

361
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,960
Do you know that Lv Hou brought you here

362
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,200
to kill you?

363
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,480
I know.

364
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,600
Chang Jue has been rescued.

365
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,120
We have to leave here now.

366
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,400
Okay.

367
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,280
You're all useless.

368
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,720
You caught Shen Mei and even scared her.

369
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,760
How can I explain to her?

370
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:18,920
Commander Cui.

371
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,760
Although we were killed by Shen Zanying,

372
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,800
we've confirmed that

373
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,640
the Jiang's are all here.

374
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,800
They're meeting with Shen Zanying.

375
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,040
What should we do now?

376
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,280
Keep an eye on them.

377
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,480
If they find out that they're leaving the city,

378
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,560
report to us at any time.

379
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,040
Prepare for the best.

380
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,000
Don't let them

381
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,240
see your good performance at night.

382
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,120
Yes.

383
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,200
Yes.

384
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,120
Commander Cui said

385
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,880
we must arrange these things.

386
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,000
You go that way, I'll go this way.

387
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,560
Okay.

388
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,080
He could not begin to leave in the morning.

389
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,800
probably lives in Ziyue.

390
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,400
In 17 data,

391
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,760
in theie Tellmusic A.

392
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,880
he's all alone.

393
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,600
He must be part of Lv Hou's

394
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,980
Beggar clan.

395
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,040
It's impossible for him to disappear in bam bam.

396
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,240
This person must be the death of Empress Lv.

397
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,640
It seems that there are more people in the city.

398
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,640
Could it be that Empress Lv wants to trap us in Luo City and kill us?

399
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,840
There are so many people in Luo City. How could she be so cruel?

400
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,840
A person who is cruel can't understand the situation.

401
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,640
We should be careful.

402
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,640
I won't let you go. Why are you...

403
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:11,440
In this world, there is nothing more painful than seeing your enemy in person.

404
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,440
Struggling.

405
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,440
It's more satisfying.

406
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,440
If that's the case, using Empress Lv's personality,

407
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,040
she might be able to guard the capital.

408
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,440
She must be in Luo City too.

409
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,640
Your Highness, everything is already well-planned.

410
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,040
We can only wait for your order and they will be crushed to pieces.

411
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:38,640
By then, there will be no one to stop you.

412
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,840
Very good. Let them taste the taste of ashes.

413
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,040
Prime Minister, the carriage is ready.

414
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,840
Prime Minister, you should leave.

415
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:57,040
The people of the North Campus are in trouble. The royal family should take responsibility.

416
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,440
You don't need to take the risk.

417
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,240
Zhan Lu, Wu Jiang, the plan has changed.

418
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,640
You go and take the security outside the city.

419
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,240
Prepare to take the side. I will stay in the city and find a way to break the trap.

420
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,040
We must help the people of Luo City get through this.

421
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,040
Understood.

422
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,440
This is the North Campus.

423
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,240
As the Prime Minister of the Great Qi, you shouldn't do this.

424
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,640
For the sake of the palace and the sake of death, I should do this.

425
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,440
I will go and tell the Prime Minister of the Great Qi about this.

426
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,640
If he orders, we can have more helpers.

427
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,240
Okay. Let's split up.

428
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,240
Deng Xiao Wei.

429
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,840
Jiang Cheng Jue?

430
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,640
I am so sorry.

431
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,640
I am sorry.

432
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,240
Deng Xiao Wei.

433
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,640
Jiang Cheng Jue? I have been searching the whole city for you.

434
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,840
I have already sent someone to come.

435
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,640
Aren't you curious why I came?

436
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,640
Luo City will be in great trouble.

437
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,840
Do you know that the entire city of Luo City

438
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,640
has disappeared in the last ten days?

439
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,240
No.

440
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,640
I will go find the death nephew.

441
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,760
Deng Xiao Wei, Frederick,

442
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,440
not Kong Xiao.

443
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,040
Deng Xiao Wei.

444
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,640
He has disappeared!

445
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,040
The day of his disappearance is in the past.

446
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,640
Why do you do this?

447
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,840
Brother Deng Xiao Wei made this临Samrain Stuart Danυχ.

448
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,440
I only need the name .

449
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,440
Brother Deng Xiao Wei.

450
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,440
I am so sorry.

451
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,040
I will take the throne and kill the people in the city immediately.

452
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,440
How can I trust you?

453
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,240
If nothing happens, I will believe your rumors and kill the people.

454
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,040
During this time, the street will be left behind.

455
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:53,440
Are you going to drag me to be your back?

456
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,040
We are going to the Heaven's Light Festival!

457
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,640
We are going to the Heaven's Light Festival!

458
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,840
My Northern Courtyard's Heaven's Light Festival is to pray for peace.

459
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:13,440
But Lv Heng is acting the opposite way.

460
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,840
We must find out when the explosives were exposed.

461
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,240
We can't let Jiajie be left behind.

462
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,240
This way.

463
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:37,640
Prime Minister, what do you think is wrong with this place?

464
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,640
If Lv Heng wants to use the explosives,

465
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,440
he will surely look for some hidden places to hide these missing items.

466
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,040
There are indeed missing items here.

467
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,440
Tell me. When are you going to act?

468
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,240
What is the signal of your actions?

469
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,040
The death.

470
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,240
Let's go look elsewhere.

471
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,640
Prime Minister,

472
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,440
your wound is a little bruised.

473
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,040
It's just a small wound. It's not serious.

474
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,840
It's more important to break the spell. Let's go.

475
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,040
Let's split up and look for clues.

476
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,640
Prince, come and have some.

477
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,040
I'm fine.

478
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,640
I'm fine.

479
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,440
I'm fine.

480
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,240
I'm fine.

481
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,240
Prince, have some.

482
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,840
Eldest Brother, have some.

483
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,640
Okay. I just cut it.

484
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,840
Come, Prince, please enjoy.

485
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,440
Eldest Brother,

486
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,840
have you seen any strange people in the city recently?

487
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,640
Strange people? I haven't met them much.

488
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,840
But people like you and Miss,

489
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,840
they have come quite a lot.

490
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,240
Who is it?

491
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,840
A'Hua.

492
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,240
A'Hua.

493
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,440
Leave us first.

494
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,040
Yes.

495
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,440
A'Hua.

496
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,040
Why are you here?

497
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,840
I entered the city early.

498
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:19,040
I just want to spend a day with you.

499
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,440
A'Hua, are you happy to see me?

500
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,640
Happy?

501
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,040
If someone hits you, you'll cause me trouble.

502
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:34,440
I will never allow my plan to go wrong.

503
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,840
A'Hua, let me ask you.

504
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,640
Do you miss me a little?

505
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,640
Even a little?

506
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,240
Didn't we meet each other when we were in our prime?

507
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,040
But you said that this is a matter of prime.

508
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:56,040
I miss Chengji since I haven't seen you for a day.

509
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,840
You will make me distracted here.

510
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,440
Go back to Qi immediately.

511
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,640
Why are you in such a hurry?

512
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,440
Everything is about the big picture.

513
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,040
I need you here now.

514
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,840
We will have a long future.

515
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,840
Why is your heart always about the big picture and the plan?

516
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,840
You never cared about me.

517
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,440
So, there's the real reason for this.

518
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,580
If Yuan usefulness god

519
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,440
gives you courage and0

520
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,640
the證と起 Generation,

521
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,840
there's bound to be a great Creature in Chengji.

522
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,840
Work hard.

523
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,240
Office won't be ohge brd.

524
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:54,040
But urgentlyno.

525
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,720
there is such a thing as three hours to be alive meet you

526
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,320
who wants your life

527
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,280
you think

528
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,600
three hours is too long

529
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,520
I'm afraid, go

530
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,960
I come to you

531
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,480
as long as to be with you

532
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,960
do you want to say something

533
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,920
about me

534
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,560
Push it forward for a while more.

535
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,160
What if it overflows?

536
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,160
The D 라는 yard will be ruined very soon.

537
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,320
Everything will be ruined.

538
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,720
That's why I asked Shen Zai to search there.

539
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,880
It's said Du Ji closely guarded it.

540
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,960
That's known as looking for the error of collarbone on the shank.

541
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,360
There's no day after tomorrow.

542
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,040
Let's go.

543
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,040
We don't have much time.

544
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,040
What for?

545
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,040
To control your big picture.

546
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,040
Didn't you say that

547
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,040
you still need a signal?

548
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,040
Ah Huo.

549
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,040
Ah Huo.

550
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,040
Young Master,

551
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,040
buy a lamp.

552
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,040
I guarantee that this lamp will work.

553
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,040
You guarantee that it will work?

554
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,040
This is the wedding lock of our North Court.

555
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,040
Write down your wish

556
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,040
and stick it on the lamp.

557
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,040
The higher the lamp flies,

558
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,040
the more likely your wish will come true.

559
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,040
Then,

560
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,040
I'll buy one.

561
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,040
Okay.

562
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,040
Wish you a happy marriage.

563
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,040
There are too many wishes.

564
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,040
Which one should I write?

565
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,040
Will it be too greedy?

566
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,040
Mu Xia,

567
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,040
what wish do you have?

568
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,040
I hope

569
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,040
to find Liu Kou soon

570
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,040
and save the people.

571
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,040
I also hope

572
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,040
that the state of Qi will be prosperous.

573
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,040
This is not a wish.

574
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,040
Don't you want to be my mother?

575
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,040
I'll write it myself.

576
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,040
Stop looking.

577
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,040
Turn around.

578
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,040
Okay.

579
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,040
I hope to find Liu Kou soon

580
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,040
and save the people.

581
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,040
I also hope that the state of Qi will be prosperous.

582
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:56,040
I also hope that my brother and the princess will be together forever.

583
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,040
Also,

584
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,040
I also hope that Mu Wu Xia and I

585
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,040
will be happy forever.

586
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:24,240
The

587
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,840
principle itself

588
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,040
follows the words of Song.

589
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,040
If they are wrong,

590
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,040
we forget to ask Wo 로ā

591
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,040
to go to the зем cuidado

592
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,040
and leave the enemies.

593
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,040
That is

594
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,240
I'll go over there. Wait for me here.

595
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,840
Be careful.

596
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,440
Let's go. Next room.

597
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,840
You just noticed.

598
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,640
He kept looking up at the sky.

599
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,640
Maybe he's waiting for the signal to act.

600
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,840
The signal in the sky?

601
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,440
In the middle of the night,

602
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,840
you can't see the enemy.

603
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,440
Really?

604
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,040
Flowers fall, the north wind blows

605
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:50,040
The city is in a state of panic

606
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,240
The petals fall, the north rain falls

607
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,840
The heart is broken, the end is near

608
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,840
Flowers fall, tears fall

609
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:06,040
The heart is torn, there is nowhere to go

610
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:11,340
Mind

611
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:17,740
Wish in you, extracted from the Soul

612
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:24,360
Regret of the desperate

613
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,840
I still think of her

614
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:33,320
creepy words

615
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:37,520
Even if I have to cut myself into pieces,

616
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:45,120
I will still sing with my soul.

617
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,720
Who can lose the heart of a flower?

618
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,320
Love and hate can only be eaten.

619
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,320
The flower withers, the heart is broken.

620
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:12,320
No more need to tell.

621
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:24,320
Waiting for the wild love.

622
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:31,520
Not afraid to be oppressed by the world.

623
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:38,920
Waiting for the words she said.

624
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:49,920
It turns out that she has the answer of love.
