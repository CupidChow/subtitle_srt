1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,440
The wind and rain scatter and the clouds are still.

2
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,680
How can I leave behind the life and death?

3
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,640
If I could stay with you in my life,

4
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,280
if you could understand my true feelings,

5
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:55,080
I would go through all the hardships without any regrets.

6
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,440
Even if I have to spend my whole life with you,

7
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,720
I would go through all the hardships without any regrets.

8
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,440
I have fought for love.

9
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,640
Fate is called love and hate.

10
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,600
I will not compromise.

11
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:27,640
I will not wait for the spring when I am in tears.

12
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:36,980
Love,

13
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,200
Dreams,

14
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,600
and Just City

15
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,920
Let's ask about them.

16
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,640
Maybe we can find out where Changjue daily goes.

17
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,000
It's better than just being intelligent like this.

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,940
Okay.

19
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:51,900
Let's go.

20
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:16,120
The

21
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,080
Soft Ver Mother

22
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,220
Shen Zaiye

23
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,040
If you can get through this,

24
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,200
I...

25
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,960
You must be careful.

26
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,240
You too.

27
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,480
Guards,

28
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,520
put away these stones.

29
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,880
It's dangerous!

30
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,960
Everyone, get out of the city!

31
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,840
There's a flood!

32
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,560
It's dangerous!

33
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,680
There's a flood!

34
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,680
Get out of the city!

35
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,480
It's dangerous!

36
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,440
Get out of the city!

37
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,360
There's a flood!

38
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,560
Get out of the city!

39
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,880
There's a flood!

40
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,560
Get out of the city!

41
00:03:40,560 --> 00:04:09,260
Waner

42
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,280
when will you be able to share the lantern with Hua?

43
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,040
If you put all these gold coins on the national market,

44
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,240
Qi State

45
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,320
would already be yours.

46
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,800
But I just want to be yours.

47
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,560
Then you have to behave.

48
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,600
The plan has already begun.

49
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,200
I arranged the secret guards

50
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,040
to place the gunpowder in every corner of the city.

51
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,880
When the lantern starts to fall,

52
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,840
the signal will be to light the gunpowder.

53
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,240
This time,

54
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,400
I will kill them all.

55
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,680
After the market is built,

56
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,840
no one can stop us from being together.

57
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,320
The signal has been sent.

58
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,360
Let's go.

59
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,320
We have to get out of the city quickly.

60
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,360
Hurry up.

61
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,360
High Liverpool.

62
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,880
There's water!

63
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,920
There's water!

64
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,440
There's water!

65
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:35,880
Hurry.

66
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,160
Quick! Go and save the people.

67
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:37,760
There's water!

68
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,600
Help!

69
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,560
Save my child!

70
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,120
Save my child!

71
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,840
Help!

72
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:45,760
Help!

73
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,760
Help!

74
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,320
Help!

75
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,760
Help!

76
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,680
Help!

77
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,440
Help!

78
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,160
Hurry up!

79
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,160
Help!

80
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,000
Help!

81
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,320
Help!

82
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:56,920
Help!

83
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,400
Help!

84
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,240
Help!

85
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,080
Help!

86
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,360
Help!

87
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,760
Don't touch the door!

88
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,800
It's the back door!

89
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,760
Hurry up!

90
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,920
Help!

91
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,400
Hurry up!

92
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,400
Help!

93
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,400
Help!

94
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,600
Your Highness!

95
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,200
Save me!

96
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,000
Your Highness, hurry up!

97
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,200
The door is open!

98
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,800
Hurry up!

99
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,880
Move aside!

100
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,400
There are so many explosions in the city.

101
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,520
Deng Xiaowan, wake up!

102
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,560
Xiaowan, there are fires everywhere in the city.

103
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,340
Someone took the

104
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,440
Empress Dowager's token and took over the city gate.

105
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,480
What?

106
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,920
How is that possible?

107
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,080
When the Empress Dowager's gate is closed,

108
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,080
no matter the people in the city

109
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,360
or you and me,

110
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,320
I'm afraid we'll all die in this city.

111
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,360
Deng Xiaowan,

112
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,920
you can't satisfy the Empress Dowager

113
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,520
by counting down to two.

114
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,200
You can't protect the people in your heart.

115
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,000
Everyone, listen to my order.

116
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:03,840
Yes.

117
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,480
A team of people will go to save the fire.

118
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,120
The rest will follow me and the Lord

119
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,240
to save the people

120
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,800
and separate from the city gate.

121
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,600
Yes.

122
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,400
Now the smoke is so strong

123
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,080
that only the ancient snake

124
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,680
can lead everyone to the city gate.

125
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,680
Get down!

126
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,440
Get down!

127
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,120
Get down!

128
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,800
Get down!

129
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,440
Water!

130
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,440
Water!

131
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:38,880
Water is coming!

132
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,400
Get up, all of you!

133
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,280
Get up!

134
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,640
Get up, all of you!

135
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,120
Get up, all of you!

136
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,040
Get up, all of you!

137
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,480
Hurry up!

138
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,200
More water!

139
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,240
Listen to the sound of the drum.

140
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,560
Run to the outside city!

141
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,440
To the outside city!

142
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,080
Run!

143
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,080
Watch the road!

144
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,040
Watch the footstep!

145
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,800
Protect the people!

146
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,920
Who is that?

147
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,200
Who?

148
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,000
Are you okay, пыт Everyone?

149
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,640
Arrange these ^^

150
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,040
Hurry.

151
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,160
Put them back in the bag.

152
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,340
I will kill all sisters.

153
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,600
Your Highness.

154
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,620
Everyone is going out.

155
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:21,920
Let's go.

156
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,320
It's Lv Heng.

157
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,160
Let's go.

158
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,440
Hua.

159
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,520
Jiang Taohua saw us.

160
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,200
You go out of the city first.

161
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,800
Everything is in order.

162
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:51,800
Hua.

163
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,040
Let me go, Lv Heng.

164
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,040
Let me go, Lv Heng.

165
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,640
Be quiet.

166
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,520
Get down.

167
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,040
Heng.

168
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,360
I won't run away from you.

169
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,960
Why?

170
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,120
You're in the wrong position.

171
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,640
If I don't get rid of you,

172
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,880
how can I become the master of the harem?

173
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,480
Hua.

174
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,560
You go first.

175
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,240
I'll go first.

176
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,480
You go first.

177
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,160
I'll go first.

178
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,960
I'll go first.

179
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,760
I'll go first.

180
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,600
I'll wait outside the city.

181
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,760
Stop her.

182
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,160
No one is here.

183
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,240
Go.

184
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:30,800
Master.

185
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,640
Jiang Taohua.

186
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:45,880
Be careful.

187
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,760
The one who is in charge of the gate

188
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,680
is called Cuiwei.

189
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,240
He is Lv Heng's confidant.

190
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,720
You are really good at predicting things.

191
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,640
Lv Heng's guards

192
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,240
must be waiting for him to leave the city.

193
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:05,960
Yes.

194
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,920
Your Highness.

195
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,640
Go.

196
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,320
Protect Her Highness.

197
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,440
Your Highness, go this way.

198
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,040
Hold on.

199
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,600
Stop them.

200
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,720
Master, water is coming.

201
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,400
Master.

202
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,640
Master.

203
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,080
Be careful.

204
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,280
We met Lv Heng.

205
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,760
Her Highness was taken away by Mu Wuyin.

206
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,800
Master, you go save Her Highness.

207
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,480
We'll go with you.

208
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,040
Lead the way.

209
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,600
Okay.

210
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,880
Your Highness, you are frightened.

211
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,360
Please forgive me.

212
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:16,960
It's okay.

213
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,960
I knew Shencaiye's secret guard

214
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,840
was out of the blue.

215
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,600
So I sent a lot of people.

216
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,480
Your Highness.

217
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,560
Since you have left the city safely,

218
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,560
should we seal the gate immediately?

219
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,680
Give him another one.

220
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,080
Your death is coming.

221
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,360
Why don't you remember

222
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,360
your past life?

223
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,680
Otherwise, you won't have time.

224
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,600
You should tell yourself

225
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,680
what you said.

226
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,000
Or you'll be too hasty

227
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,120
to play for yourself.

228
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,160
With you in my hand,

229
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,200
Shencaiye can be my partner.

230
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,600
I feel sorry for you.

231
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,600
Your death is coming.

232
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,560
You still don't understand.

233
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,160
Someone else took your life.

234
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,760
That person

235
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,040
just left you here.

236
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,080
As the saying goes,

237
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,640
people know death is coming.

238
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,720
It's good to be careful.

239
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,560
But Your Highness

240
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,440
seems to be in a bad state.

241
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,600
You are talking nonsense.

242
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,520
You don't know the face of the person.

243
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,840
Do you really know

244
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,120
what kind of person Ahua is?

245
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,480
You told Shencaiye.

246
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,240
Tell me.

247
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,680
What else do you know?

248
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,680
I not only know his name,

249
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,920
but also his past.

250
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,880
During my life in the North Court,

251
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,800
I realized that I was more sincere

252
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,240
than you thought.

253
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,080
If you talk about my understanding,

254
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,720
I'm far better than you.

255
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,080
If you don't treat me sincerely,

256
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,360
even if we live close together,

257
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,080
it doesn't make any sense.

258
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,480
It's all fake.

259
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,240
Jiang Taohua,

260
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,320
you can't understand

261
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,480
my past with Ahua.

262
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,800
She just died

263
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,240
after your sister died.

264
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,040
You took advantage of her

265
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,920
and believed it was true?

266
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,560
Jiang Taohua, I'm warning you.

267
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,840
Don't slander Ahua.

268
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,840
She is the best person in the world.

269
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,040
She deserves the best in the world.

270
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,720
Your Highness is a virtuous person.

271
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,520
You don't owe anything to me.

272
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,320
I guess you will take the initiative

273
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,480
to take the power.

274
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,680
Even if Ahua

275
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,080
was sincere to you,

276
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,640
the Lv Heng

277
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,720
has become cold-blooded.

278
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,480
She only cares about power.

279
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,000
Anyone

280
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,080
can be her teacher.

281
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,160
Including you.

282
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,520
You can't fight against yourself.

283
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,640
You can't give up.

284
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,560
We've been in the desert for years.

285
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,800
We can only do what you want

286
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,560
when we succeed.

287
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,760
Nonsense.

288
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,880
She is my Ahua.

289
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,160
She never changed.

290
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,480
Can't you hear

291
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,000
the cries of the people?

292
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,160
They are not wrong.

293
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,600
They will be pushed into hell

294
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,160
by your Ahua.

295
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,680
Where are you, my son?

296
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,720
My son.

297
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,080
They are gone.

298
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,480
They are gone.

299
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,560
They are just some ants.

300
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,960
You said they are ants.

301
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,400
They are just ants.

302
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,240
Are you

303
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,920
just a peacock used by Lv Heng?

304
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:15,320
Or

305
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,240
you don't want to face them

306
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,840
and admit it?

307
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,040
You've been delayed for a while.

308
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,560
Will she really wait for you?

309
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,200
She will.

310
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,480
She will wait for me.

311
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,120
She will wait for me.

312
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,120
She will.

313
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,600
Your Highness.

314
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,360
Everything is ready.

315
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,040
But His Highness hasn't arrived yet.

316
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,760
The most important thing is to seal the gate.

317
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,040
Yes.

318
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,080
Go.

319
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,480
Mu Yin.

320
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,440
I gave you a chance.

321
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,680
You failed.

322
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,480
Have you found the whereabouts of Lv Heng?

323
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,840
We lost him.

324
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,840
The gate is closed.

325
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,840
The gate is closed.

326
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,840
The gate is closed.

327
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,840
Let me in.

328
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,360
My body is still inside.

329
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,840
Let me in.

330
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,320
No.

331
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,560
If we seal the gate,

332
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,000
they will be inside the city.

333
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:46,760
Go.

334
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,720
Go to the gate with me.

335
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,120
Close the gate.

336
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,240
Close it.

337
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,720
Go back.

338
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,320
Let us out.

339
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,040
Let us out.

340
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,760
Let us out.

341
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,480
Why are you staring at the gate?

342
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,120
Let us out.

343
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,920
Let us out.

344
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,800
Back off.

345
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:17,600
Back off.

346
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,400
Let us out.

347
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,280
Let us out.

348
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:59,120
ond title

349
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,200
Go tell Her Majesty

350
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,840
that I am here.

351
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,320
Open the gate.

352
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,000
Third Prince is here.

353
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,480
Open the gate!

354
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,760
Wake up, Mother.

355
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,000
This is the real face of Lv Hou.

356
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,680
Mother.

357
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,800
Do you really know

358
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,280
what kind of person A'Hua is?

359
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,320
Lv Hou has become

360
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,600
cold-blooded and ruthless.

361
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,040
Anyone

362
00:20:47,600 --> 00:21:02,100
can be his top

363
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,840
of the Three Wolves.

364
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,600
A'Hua.

365
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,520
Lv Hou is still here.

366
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,080
Don't you want me anymore?

367
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,000
Go.

368
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,360
Your Highness.

369
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,120
Are you hurt?

370
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,400
I'm fine.

371
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,440
Lv Hou has sealed the gate.

372
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,760
What should we do?

373
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,680
It's okay.

374
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,960
You shouldn't be so persistent.

375
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,280
Is it worth it to die here?

376
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,760
It's worth it.

377
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,640
Your Highness.

378
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,360
I'm fine.

379
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,480
Come on.

380
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,680
Are you hurt?

381
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,440
I'm fine.

382
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,240
Come on.

383
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:10,880
Help me.

384
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,480
Fourth Prince, where is Qingying?

385
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,000
Brother.

386
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,240
Lv Hou has lured you here.

387
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,640
Your Highness.

388
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,800
This is the Fourth Prince of Qi.

389
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,880
This Fourth Prince

390
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,320
is my benefactor.

391
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,920
Thank you for taking care of me.

392
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,160
I'm very grateful.

393
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,360
Your Highness.

394
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,360
You're a good person.

395
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,160
I'm not the only one who did this.

396
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,880
I'm a good person.

397
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,640
But I've trapped everyone

398
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,920
in this small city.

399
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,640
Fusheng.

400
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,240
Fusheng.

401
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,600
The gate is sealed.

402
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,400
We'll all die in the city.

403
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,240
I'm here.

404
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,880
Thank you, benefactor.

405
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,520
Thank you.

406
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:12,840
Everyone.

407
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,320
Has anyone seen Deng Xiaowei at the gate?

408
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,280
No.

409
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,160
She's Lv Hou's dog.

410
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,080
How could she care about our lives?

411
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,960
Yes.

412
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,480
She killed us.

413
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,520
No one cares about us.

414
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,080
Your Highness.

415
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:31,760
Your Highness.

416
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,200
We can't sit here and wait for the soldiers.

417
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,200
Chang Juan.

418
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,840
Where are the armory in the city?

419
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,080
We need to find some weapons to break through the gate.

420
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,760
The armory is right behind the Xiaowei Mansion.

421
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,600
The key

422
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
must have been kept by Deng Xiaowei.

423
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,280
Your Highness.

424
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,880
The sound of the blast

425
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,120
came from the Xiaowei Mansion.

426
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,840
I'm afraid the armory

427
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,400
has been blown up.

428
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,840
Let me go.

429
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:05,880
Brothers.

430
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,240
Kill them.

431
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,840
The only way to break through the gate

432
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,360
is to

433
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,040
fight for our lives.

434
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,760
Charge.

435
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,080
Let's unite

436
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,240
and fight together.

437
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,680
Fight them.

438
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,120
Fight.

439
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,840
From the back.

440
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,240
Slough of the soldiers on the march.

441
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,720
Rest your body, Dainail.

442
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:42,240
Music切, please.

443
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:50,360
From the wisdom loving,

444
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,200
powerful sons,

445
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,740
inspire and

446
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,820
stand tall to be high!

447
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,500
Shen Yun!

448
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:02,860
What are you doing?

449
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,660
Take care of the stand and help us out!

450
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,340
Guys!

451
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:22,800
The peerless

452
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,300
I won't leave you!

453
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,540
I'll hand him over

454
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,840
to you!

455
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,360
Hurry.

456
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,780
Die!

457
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,600
Oo

458
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:41,620
Too many

459
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,400
There is too many people

460
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,120
Jin Tam!

461
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,080
Save them.

462
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,640
Come.

463
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,360
Gyажи.

464
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,040
Come.

465
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,800
Watch out, Ouyang Hua.

466
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,040
Come.

467
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Hua, come with me.

468
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,080
Take care of her first.

469
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:39,600
Okay.

470
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,320
Zhao Shi.

471
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,880
This shield is unbreakable.

472
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,600
As long as the soldiers and soldiers are here,

473
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,020
we can suppress our attack.

474
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,400
We might as well use the internet these days.

475
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,200
Use this Roxor Heart to�all festival

476
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,120
and blow thex a path for everyone.

477
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,520
In case our consort can't defeat you?

478
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,640
I've asked Zhan Lu's Kevin J you three

479
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,480
go deal with the troop on the汽 창ed building.

480
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,600
Let's go!

481
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,080
Get out of here, or I'll blow your met competed with某一队。

482
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,080
There will no rest!

483
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:26,960
Ngel ça fait,

484
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,000
Ngel ça fait,

485
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,480
you master's got!

486
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,360
Let's go!

487
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:46,800
Come on,

488
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,640
let's do this for Jiyang.

489
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,840
You're no match for me.

490
00:29:51,440 --> 00:30:03,400
Hurry and move out of our way.

491
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,280
Get rid of these faithful soldiers!

492
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:13,920
We can't do this.

493
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,200
He has that cocktail knife!

494
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,640
Let me handle him then.

495
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,240
Qingying, cover me.

496
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,840
Mom, be careful.

497
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,440
Brother, be careful.

498
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,320
Don't let her get close.

499
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,320
Kill her.

500
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,640
Qingying,

501
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,640
this distance is enough.

502
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,440
Qingying,

503
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,440
go back.

504
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,440
Kill her.

505
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,040
The city gate has been broken.

506
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,440
Prepare to break the gate.

507
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:45,840
Cover me.

508
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,840
Kill her.

509
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,840
Kill her.

510
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,040
Go.

511
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,440
Go.

512
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,440
You can get out.

513
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:35,200
The true lover

514
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,240
comes like this.

515
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:43,240
Shixiao.

516
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:44,440
Shixiao.

517
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,960
The gate is dying outside.

518
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,040
We can't go out.

519
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,040
I'm so scared.

520
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,600
Brother, what should we do?

521
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:54,800
Let's break the gate.

522
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:55,800
Okay.

523
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:17,600
You...

524
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,000
I'll cover the people in the city.

525
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,880
I'll go to help him.

526
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,080
Huo. Huo.

527
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,880
Be gentle. Protect the princess.

528
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,320
Okay.

529
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:40,920
Be careful.

530
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,480
Qingying,

531
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,920
you go to cover the people.

532
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,280
Okay.

533
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,480
The rest of you, go with me.

534
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,880
Please take care of the rest.

535
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:57,840
Princess, you...

536
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,400
No.

537
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,520
I don't want everyone to worry about me.

538
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,640
Go.

539
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,240
No.

540
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,400
The antidote is still in the city.

541
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:05,800
I'll go get it.

542
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,280
No.

543
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,720
The fire is so big.

544
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,080
It will be paralyzed at any time.

545
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,080
Go.

546
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,080
Jin.

547
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,000
Why don't you go?

548
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,040
Princess, he...

549
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,040
It's okay.

550
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:14,600
It's okay.

551
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,800
Changxun, let's go together.

552
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,360
How about this?

553
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,880
You go to the quarry first and wait for me.

554
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,200
I'll go to cover the people in the city.

555
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,160
I'll meet you immediately.

556
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:22,560
Don't worry.

557
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,000
Okay.

558
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,040
Be careful.

559
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:25,880
Be careful.

560
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,600
Go.

561
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,080
Go.

562
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:40,680
Are you okay, everyone?

563
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,000
Mother.

564
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,400
Are you okay?

565
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:41,600
Go.

566
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,280
Everyone, run.

567
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,000
The gate is open.

568
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,240
Go.

569
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:43,760
Everyone, run.

570
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,320
Hurry up.

571
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,600
Go.

572
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,440
Protect them.

573
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,160
Hurry up.

574
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,440
Everyone, run.

575
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:49,840
Hurry up.

576
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,440
The escapee is here.

577
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,120
Hurry up.

578
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:51,880
Go.

579
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,160
Everyone, stop.

580
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,160
The gate is open.

581
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:56,920
Let's run.

582
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:57,520
Hurry up.

583
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,400
Stop.

584
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,520
Hurry up.

585
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,120
Hurry up.

586
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:09,960
Keep up.

587
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,720
Mother, hold on.

588
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:14,800
Mother.

589
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,440
Be careful.

590
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,240
Hold on.

591
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,000
It's okay.

592
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,560
It doesn't hurt.

593
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,600
Your hand is really soft

594
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,680
when you hold a pen and write.

595
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,960
Unlike ordinary men,

596
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,040
you have thick skin.

597
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,280
Could it be that

598
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,800
you have held other men's hands?

599
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
My brother.

600
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,440
My father has been using my brother

601
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,360
to fight with weapons since he was a child.

602
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,560
He couldn't protect us

603
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,480
without good martial arts.

604
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,120
Then,

605
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,360
what did Shen Xiang look like when he was a child?

606
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,160
My father said

607
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,480
my brother was like his name since he was a child.

608
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,560
He was very wild.

609
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,840
You little bastard.

610
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,760
Take it off.

611
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,000
If you don't take it off today,

612
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
I'll beat you to death.

613
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:20,880
Take it off.

614
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:21,880
Yes.

615
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,120
Thank you.

616
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:39,640
Little devil.

617
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,480
What a coincidence.

618
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,320
You stole my money.

619
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,440
Who is in the child?

620
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,200
Uncle.

621
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,560
You.

622
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,000
Give me the money.

623
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:46,560
I'll give it to you.

624
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,240
Be gentle.

625
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,320
Stop.

626
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:51,920
Go.

627
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,360
Go.

628
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:52,880
Stop.

629
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,760
Do you want to learn martial arts?

630
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,840
Then you have to pay my respect.

631
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,000
My name is Xiang.

632
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,120
My name is Zhen Ao.

633
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,720
I've been walking in the martial arts world

634
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,320
for a lifetime.

635
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,360
Master.

636
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,640
Please accept my respect.

637
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,120
Come on.

638
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:10,720
Get up.

639
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,760
Good boy.

640
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,040
This is my only daughter.

641
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,200
Her name is Qingying.

642
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,800
Then she is my junior sister.

643
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,320
Good.

644
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,760
Later,

645
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,360
my father took us to the martial arts world.

646
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,000
My brother is very good.

647
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,200
He can understand what my father teaches.

648
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,520
He can also understand it.

649
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,800
Not only that,

650
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,600
he also likes to tell me the big truth.

651
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,760
What is to govern the country with the political power,

652
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,840
govern the country with...

653
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,600
Anyway, I can't think of anything.

654
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,040
Govern the country with the political power,

655
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,160
use the army with the flag,

656
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,640
and conquer the world with the world.

657
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,000
What does this mean?

658
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,160
It means that the country will not be in chaos

659
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,200
if the country is governed by the political power.

660
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,840
The army will win the war

661
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,840
if the flag is used with the flag.

662
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,520
Mu Xia.

663
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,200
I'm talking to you.

664
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,240
Why are you so blank?

665
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:03,800
Oh.

666
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,240
I'm just thinking

667
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,000
that you suffered a lot when you were young.

668
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,280
So my brother protected me.

669
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:15,760
My brother said

670
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,640
he knew how hard it was to endure those hard days,

671
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,400
so he tried his best to give me a stable life.

672
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:32,920
Hit it!

673
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,320
Easy! Hit it!

674
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,280
Hurt it, too!

675
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,520
What's wrong with you?

676
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,560
Just hit it.

677
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,440
six ha Zha!

678
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,040
Haven't you if you've done it,

679
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,600
Daydream is a little tough.

680
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,600
Forget it, if it's already been a bad experience for you,

681
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,800
if you're already forward in our marriage.

682
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,360
We'll become husband and wife at an old age,

683
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,480
we'll never see each other again.

684
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,920
I'm practicing 좀 Iente …

685
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,120
I'm just κά�n' uh …

686
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,360
You can still practice some martial arts.

687
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,480
It's no big deal to you to practice some martial arts.

688
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,440
I have no work to do.

689
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,200
Dad, I'll go.

690
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,600
I come here

691
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,000
as a man who knows a lot of women.

692
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,880
Oh, don't you leave me alive and dying,

693
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,560
Look after Dan Son,

694
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:12,880
I love you,

695
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,160
But I didn't help her,

696
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,240
Listen to me,

697
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:32,840
Let's go.

698
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:48,480
Prime Minister,

699
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,560
Her Highness didn't tell the Crown Prince

700
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,720
about the poison.

701
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,000
She didn't want to hurt His Highness.

702
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,520
Fine.

703
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,200
I won't tell His Majesty.

704
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,720
Just tell me where the antidote is.

705
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,160
Her Highness must not want to

706
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:58,840
take your life.

707
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,600
Qingtan,

708
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,760
if you keep delaying,

709
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,680
once the antidote is burned,

710
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,600
it will be too late.

711
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,840
Don't hesitate. Tell me.

712
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,360
The antidote

713
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,600
fell off

714
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,680
when we fought with Lv Houchi.

715
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:15,800
It should be

716
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,520
near the Jiufang of the Qiao family.

717
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,280
Jiufang of the Qiao family?

718
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,400
Take good care of Tao Hua.

719
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,560
Hold it.

720
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,200
Go upstairs.

721
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,640
Her Highness went to the city to find the antidote.

722
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:44,960
Prime Minister,

723
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,160
I'll help you find it.

724
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,320
Great!

725
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:43,840
Run quickly.

726
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:34,760
Love and hate can only be one

727
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:38,560
Flowers wither, the heart is broken

728
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:45,560
No need to tell me anymore

729
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:56,560
Waiting for love, still crazy to think of her

730
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:04,560
Not afraid to be misunderstood

731
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:11,560
Believe me, what she said is related to the flower

732
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:22,560
It turns out that she has a heart of gold
