=Episode 13=

18
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,560
Father,

19
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,480
we usually hunt for fun every year.

20
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,040
Now that everyone's gathered,

21
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,120
why don't we turn it into a competition

22
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,920
and see who bags the most?

23
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,800
That's not a bad idea.

24
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,400
Your Majesty,

25
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,280
why not turn it into a contest?

26
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,560
Let's see the prowess
of Qi's finest men.

27
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,880
If that's what you want,

28
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,240
so be it.

29
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,520
Whoever earns

30
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,480
the top score today,

31
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:32,880
I

32
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,320
shall reward the winner

33
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,440
with the Ferghana horse.

34
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,590
- Your Majesty is wise indeed!
- Your Majesty is wise indeed!

35
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:45,030
Chancellor Shen, I've heard you excel
in civil affairs and martial skills.

36
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,360
Do you think you'll take the lead today?

37
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,040
It's too soon to tell.

38
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,640
Your Highness, do you wish to compete?

39
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,200
Shen Zaiye,

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,360
I underestimated you yesterday.

41
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,280
But I won't go easy on you today.

42
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,320
I'll look forward to it.

43
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:33,640
- Hyah! Go! Hyah!
- Hyah! Hyaah! Hyah!

44
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,680
Be very careful.

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,990
Make sure you're not seen.

46
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,920
This is a dangerous move.

47
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,080
Be extra careful.

48
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,760
Whoa!

49
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,440
Easy now!

50
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,880
Easy!

51
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,480
Let's see

52
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,520
if your stubbornness

53
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,840
or my whip takes over!

54
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,040
Go!

55
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,760
Easy!

56
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,760
The horse is out of control! Help me!

57
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:43,880
Easy!

58
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,960
Hyah! Hyah! Hyaah!

59
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,200
The horse's gone wild!
Clear the way!

60
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,400
Watch out!

61
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:52,960
Hold!

62
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,520
Stop!

63
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,000
Get out of the way!

64
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,200
Are you all right?

65
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,680
They say

66
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,360
greatness runs in the family.

67
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,480
Prince Wuxia may seem mild.

68
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,760
But he's got courage.

69
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,520
I'm tired.

70
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,320
Come back with me.

71
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,400
Let's see what trophies
everyone's caught.

72
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,660
My dear, come.

73
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,520
Mu Wuxia, are you out of your mind?

74
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,000
You don't even know martial arts.

75
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,240
What if the horse trampled you?

76
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,240
Well, I couldn't just watch

77
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,720
you fall off the horse.

78
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,640
What if something bad happened?

79
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,680
I'm trained in martial arts.

80
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,520
A little fall won't hurt me.

81
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,400
What is it?

82
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,000
My ankle...

83
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,840
Over here.

84
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:19,880
Does it hurt here?

85
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,760
It's nothing serious.

86
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,760
It's just a sprain.

87
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,290
What were you doing here anyway?

88
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,120
I...

89
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,760
I only wanted a quiet place

90
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,560
to read.

91
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,680
Then you showed up and disturbed me.

92
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,360
It's that horse's fault
for making me lose face.

93
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,440
Miss, are you hurt?

94
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,680
That horse is too wild.

95
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,720
It could've hurt you badly.

96
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,960
We'll put it down right away.

97
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,120
Wait.

98
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,200
It was only spooked.

99
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,600
There's no need for that.

100
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,560
It's all right.

101
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,800
Report!

102
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,480
Prince Wugou has two more kills!

103
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,960
- Prince Wugou has two more kills!
- Prince Wugou has another two!

104
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,060
(Mu Wugou. 7)

105
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,400
Report!

106
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,400
(Shen Zaiye. 10)
Chancellor Shen adds three more!

107
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,440
Your Highness, I found it!

108
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,040
Found it.

109
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,320
Come.

110
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,200
Report!

111
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,320
(Shen Zaiye. 10)
Prince Wugou has another two kills!

112
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,760
Report!

113
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,440
(Shen Zaiye. 15)
Chancellor Shen has 15 kills!

114
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,320
Report!

115
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:45,960
(Mu Wugou. 19)

116
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,120
(Shen Zaiye. 22)
Chancellor Shen has 22 kills!

117
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,280
Chancellor Shen is impressive indeed.

118
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,360
A true scholar and warrior.

119
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,840
Who knew his skills
in archery and riding

120
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,080
were this sharp?

121
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,160
It looks like the prize will go to

122
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,720
either Prince Wugou or Chancellor Shen.

123
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,720
He always sets his sights

124
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,920
and never misses.

125
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,480
Are you certain?

126
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,180
There may be some distance.

127
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,480
But I've seen
Chancellor Shen's archery before.

128
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,080
His technique today feels off.

129
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,280
If that's not him,

130
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,120
and this is just a decoy,

131
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,480
what exactly is he plotting?

132
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,560
Your meal is ready! Time to eat!

133
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,740
Come and get your food!

134
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,120
The food has gone bad!
How are we supposed to eat this?

135
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,200
Prince Wugou let you rest

136
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,600
because of the spring hunt.

137
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,950
You have the opportunity to rest,
but you are making a fuss about it.

138
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,120
Complaining, huh?

139
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,080
Not eating, huh?

140
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,740
Are you going to eat it or not?

141
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,600
Not eating, huh?

142
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,600
This is bad.

143
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,360
Zhenzhen,

144
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,880
I need you to do something for me.

145
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,600
Eat it even if the food is spoiled!

146
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,920
Take this for not eating.

147
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,800
Are you eating or not?

148
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,920
Not eating, huh?

149
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,960
That'll teach you to be picky.

150
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,720
Still not eating?

151
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,480
Take this!

152
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,110
What's wrong, Huaijin?

153
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,760
We have trouble.

154
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,560
That's not Shen Zaiye.

155
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,660
Someone's impersonating him.

156
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,320
What?

157
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,280
Could he have gone to find those miners?

158
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,640
Calm down.

159
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,080
I'll send some men
to the mine holding site

160
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,000
to kill him now.

161
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,960
If we can kill him,
we'll be rid of the threat for good.

162
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:12,960
Good.

163
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,320
Where is Meng Huaijin headed?

164
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,280
Someone just reported

165
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,780
that he's going back to the camp
to check the hunting's spoils.

166
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,800
Do you think he's getting suspicious?

167
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,070
You keep playing the role
of Chancellor Shen.

168
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,640
He may already be onto us.

169
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,920
He may look calm and gentle.

170
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,600
But when he strikes,
it's swift and merciless.

171
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,920
And you?

172
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,790
I'm going to find Prince Wuxia
to help Chancellor Shen. We'll split up.

173
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,480
Guard the cave entrance.
Don't let anything go wrong.

174
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,240
Yes, sir.

175
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,760
Unlock the prison gate.

176
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,280
Yes, sir.

177
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,280
Out you go, now!

178
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,120
- Let's go.
- Let's get out of here.

179
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,240
Sir,

180
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,600
you are...

181
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,360
No time to explain. We'll talk later.

182
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,080
Thank you!

183
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,640
Everyone, keep up!

184
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,400
Thank you, sir!

185
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,570
We're saved! We're finally saved!

186
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,560
- Hurry.
- Let's go.

187
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,320
Hurry.

188
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,080
Watch out!

189
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,400
Fall back! Take cover!

190
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,360
Run!

191
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,800
Block them with something.

192
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:43,790
Use the crates!

193
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,560
Get behind something!

194
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,080
Leave no one alive!

195
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,360
(Prince Wuxia.)

196
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,880
Good afternoon, Zhenzhen.

197
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,080
Do you also find the weather hot?

198
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,680
Let me find you an umbrella.

199
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,200
No need.

200
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,480
No need for all the formalities
when we're out here.

201
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,080
This place is full of bugs.

202
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,640
You're delicate by nature.

203
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:34,980
Let's not get you bitten by any.

204
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,400
Let me get you some repellent.

205
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,880
No need to trouble yourself.

206
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,080
It's nearly the Shen hour.

207
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,720
Since Chancellor Shen isn't here,

208
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,960
why don't we chat for a while?

209
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,720
Go! Break through their line!

210
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,600
Hold the front! Don't let them in!

211
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,520
Sir,

212
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,400
you're a good man.

213
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,680
Please,

214
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,640
get them out of here.

215
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,600
Help them return to their families.

216
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
All right. I promise you.

217
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,600
Please help us.

218
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,360
Save us!

219
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,440
We don't want to die.

220
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,160
Please save us, kind sir.

221
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,200
Please save us.

222
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,520
- Help us.
- I don't want to die.

223
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,320
- Save us.
- I don't want to die here.

224
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,240
Kind sir...

225
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,840
- I'm begging you.
- Please save us.

226
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,640
Please save us.

227
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,120
Kind sir.

228
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,160
We don't want to die.

229
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,040
- Sir!
- Sir!

230
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,240
Kill him!

231
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,800
- Kill!
- Kill!

232
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,820
(Mu Wugou. 27)

233
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,580
(Shen Zaiye. 35)

234
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,240
Prince Wugou adds another two kills!

235
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,080
It looks like
Prince Wugou is catching up.

236
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,680
Why hasn't Chancellor Shen
made a move yet?

237
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,640
Zhenzhen,

238
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,400
this sun is too much.

239
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,520
I'm starting to get a headache.

240
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,840
I think I'll head back to rest.

241
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,480
What's this?
You usually address me intimately.

242
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,400
But now you won't even accompany me

243
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,160
a little longer?

244
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,480
Today,

245
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,000
I want you to watch
the rest of this match with me.

246
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,800
What if

247
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,960
I insist on leaving now?

248
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,320
You're a married woman now.

249
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,800
With your husband absent,

250
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,960
the legitimate wife calls the shots.

251
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,480
If you walk away,

252
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,520
I'll go straight to His Majesty

253
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,120
and accuse you

254
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,040
of being arrogant

255
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,760
and disrespectful.

256
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,920
I am feeling quite unwell

257
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,240
and would like to get some rest.

258
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,640
Surely His Majesty

259
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,760
wouldn't be so harsh?

260
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,040
His Majesty has always been thoughtful.

261
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,960
If we start arguing,

262
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,960
he'll likely summon Chancellor Shen

263
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,480
and give us both fifty lashes.

264
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,120
But

265
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,760
is that what you want?

266
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,840
Out of all the men at this hunt,

267
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,380
the one I envy most is Chancellor Shen.

268
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,240
A beauty on each arm.

269
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,440
Lady Jiang,

270
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,480
I hear you're quite skilled at chess.

271
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,470
The competition won't be over
anytime soon anyway.

272
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,780
Why don't we head to the tea room

273
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,120
for a match?

274
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,040
Your Highness,
why aren't you joining the hunt?

275
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,000
Horseback archery used to be for fun.

276
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,440
Now, it's full of rules and rankings.

277
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,920
So it has lost its charm.

278
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:42,840
Let Wugou
and Chancellor Shen fight it out.

279
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,600
I'm quite happy sitting, drinking tea,
and playing chess with you.

280
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,560
I'm afraid I'm not very good at chess.

281
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,040
I hope you won't mind.

282
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,400
You can't be worse than Chancellor Shen.

283
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,280
Even His Majesty says
he's hopeless at chess.

284
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,560
Madam,

285
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,990
you still need to watch over things
for Chancellor Shen.

286
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,410
So I won't be inviting you along.

287
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,440
I'll go back to the tent to change,

288
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,360
and I'll be right back.

289
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:33,760
No rush.

290
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,400
Lady Jiang, do as you wish.

291
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,400
Thank you, Your Highness.

292
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,420
Get yourselves together!

293
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,640
He's already out of energy.

294
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,360
Kill him
and you'll be handsomely rewarded!

295
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:14,800
Charge!

296
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,760
Those who are alive,
fight your way out with me!

297
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,880
Time's up! The hunt is over!

298
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,160
Prince Wugou has 35 kills.

299
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,600
Chancellor Shen has 36 kills.

300
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,400
Father, you have a subject
with such skill and valor.

301
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,200
He's truly a blessing to Qi.

302
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,280
When I first met

303
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,960
Minister Shen,

304
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,690
it was exactly this mastery in riding
and archery that caught my eye.

305
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:16,920
Wugou,

306
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,840
you still have to work hard.

307
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,120
Father, I admit I'm no match
to Chancellor Shen.

308
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,600
But since Chancellor Shen won,

309
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:25,920
why hasn't he shown himself?

310
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,400
Could it be the prize
isn't good enough for him?

311
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,960
Shall I go bring him here

312
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,360
to explain?

313
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,360
I humbly thank Your Majesty.

314
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,600
Minister Shen,

315
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,040
these prizes

316
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,600
are yours.

317
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,280
Thank you, Your Majesty.

318
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,390
And thank you,
Prince Wugou, for yielding.

319
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:13,680
Everyone,

320
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,240
let's go and see Minister Shen's prize.

321
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,200
Let's go.

322
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,440
Prince Wugou.

323
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,320
I win.

324
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,160
Lady Jiang, please, go ahead.

325
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,990
Thank you, Your Highness.

326
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,280
Princess Taohua.

327
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:35,000
Qingtai, wait outside and keep watch.

328
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,000
Don't let anyone come near.

329
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,760
Yes, Your Highness.

330
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:39,960
Were they rescued?

331
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,510
Thanks to your warning,
I got there just in time.

332
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,560
When I arrived,

333
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,240
they had just moved everyone to safety.

334
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,800
That's wonderful.

335
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,520
Lian will finally be reunited
with her brother.

336
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,240
The other workers said

337
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,040
Lian's brother

338
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,040
used all his wages

339
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,200
in exchange for this.

340
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,840
He thought
it would look beautiful on her.

341
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,200
He was worried about Lian and Granny.

342
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,520
So he tried to escape alone.

343
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,080
Get him!

344
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,440
Stop right there!

345
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,740
Trying to run, eh?

346
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,840
But the guards caught him

347
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,520
and beat him to death.

348
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,000
Beat him to death!

349
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,120
Your Highness.

350
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,320
Your Highness, what's the matter?

351
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,040
Lian

352
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,840
will never see her brother again.

353
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,320
Do you think...

354
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,840
Do you think Changjue

355
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:10,760
is...

356
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,120
No.

357
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,760
You must stay strong, Your Highness.

358
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,440
You're not like Lian.

359
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,960
Prince Changjue is still waiting
for you in Beiyuan.

360
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:22,720
You're right.

361
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,160
Changjue is waiting.

362
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,800
Your Highness,

363
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,840
there's one more thing.

364
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,680
I just overheard
Prince Wugou and Meng Huaijin.

365
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,720
They've sent someone

366
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:39,120
to assassinate
the treacherous Chancellor today.

367
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,520
Official Meng. Your Highness.
I have bad news.

368
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,990
Chancellor Shen just sent some men
to rescue all the miners.

369
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,040
I told you

370
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:50,640
we should've killed them.

371
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,160
Now, Shen Zaiye has the evidence.

372
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,960
We're finished now.

373
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,400
Where are you going?

374
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,040
Give me some time.

375
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,280
I'll find a way to settle this.

376
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,720
I have

377
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,840
no patience to wait anymore.

378
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,800
The moment Shen Zaiye shows his face

379
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,160
will be the moment he dies by an arrow.

380
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,280
To what do I owe the honor
of your invitation?

381
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:28,980
Though everything was arranged
in advance,

382
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,320
that prison rescue
wouldn't have gone so smoothly

383
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,320
if you hadn't notified
Prince Wuxia in time.

384
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,690
You're giving me too much credit.

385
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,760
I only did what the plan required.

386
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,920
Just like you said in the silver mine.

387
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,520
Since we came together,

388
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,800
so we leave together.

389
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,400
There's no way

390
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,080
I'd let you walk

391
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,280
into danger alone.

392
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,080
Jiang Taohua.

393
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:14,960
Jiang Taohua!

394
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,680
Now,

395
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,490
I've finally saved you

396
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,000
for once.

397
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,640
Jiang Taohua,

398
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,520
Jiang Taohua!

399
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,240
Your Highness!

400
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,280
Zhan Lu, get the medicine!

401
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:47,800
Yes, sir.

402
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,440
Knife.

403
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:12,820
Hold her steady.

404
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:13,840
All right.

405
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,000
Zhan Lu,

406
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,560
where's the imperial physician?

407
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,880
Why isn't he here yet?

408
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,800
There, he's here.

409
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,880
He's here.

410
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,060
Chancellor Shen, don't worry.

411
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,630
Imperial Physician Li is highly skilled,
especially in treating arrow wounds.

412
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,480
Lady Jiang will pull through.

413
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,850
I'll leave it to you,
Imperial Physician Li.

414
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:08,360
Thank you for saving Lady Jiang's life,
Your Majesty.

415
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,600
As long as she's safe,

416
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,240
you can rest easy now.

417
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,560
The audacity of these people.

418
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,660
How dare they attack someone
inside the royal hunting grounds!

419
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:18,760
Your Majesty,

420
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,980
Lady Jiang took the arrow meant for me.

421
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,200
If not for her,

422
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,280
I would've been the one being shot.

423
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,360
Please, I beg Your Majesty

424
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,600
to investigate this thoroughly.

425
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:32,990
Minister Shen,

426
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,240
rise.

427
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,520
Even if you don't bring this up,

428
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,280
I would never let this go.

429
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,600
Someone will pay the price.

430
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,630
Commander Zhang.

431
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,500
Yes, Your Majesty.

432
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,160
Find me that assassin

433
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,680
at all costs!

434
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:50,690
Yes, Your Majesty.

435
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:55,400
Search everywhere!

436
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,600
Keep searching!

437
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:57,760
Move it!

438
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,760
Search this area!

439
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:00,800
Yes, sir.

440
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,600
Keep moving!

441
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,680
Search the area!

442
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:14,390
What is the situation outside?

443
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,880
Was this your doing?

444
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:20,920
No, it wasn't me.

445
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,760
I did hire the assassins at first.

446
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,520
But I called it off.

447
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,120
It wasn't worth the risk,
especially under Father's nose.

448
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,200
You don't believe me?

449
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,780
If you strike a tiger
but fail to kill it,

450
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,320
it'll bite back.

451
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,160
With someone like Shen Zaiye,

452
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,520
but we fail to take him out.

453
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,320
During this time,

454
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,600
we must stay quiet for now.

455
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,080
Can I trust you to lie low?

456
00:30:59,160 --> 00:30:59,560
Yes.

457
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:00,920
I promise.

458
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,200
When have I ever

459
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,280
said no to you?

460
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,680
There's no solid evidence.

461
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,680
With your position,

462
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,080
you don't need to worry.

463
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,920
I will write to my father

464
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,760
and request him to come
as soon as possible.

465
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,280
It's strange, though.

466
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,920
Who ordered the attack?

467
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,400
Who cares?

468
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,880
Shen Zaiye probably

469
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,360
has enemies everywhere.

470
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,920
It's a pity that the little concubine took
the hit instead.

471
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,160
Talk about devotion.

472
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,440
Your Highness, drink the medicine.

473
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,440
If you don't, you won't get better.

474
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,240
This physician is useless.

475
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,430
Didn't he say she would be fine
after removing the arrow?

476
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,520
Why is she still burning up?

477
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:01,760
Let me do it.

478
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,040
No need to trouble yourself.

479
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,240
Isn't your only concern

480
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,360
your own survival?

481
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,480
Lady Jiang still hasn't woken up.

482
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,120
If this keeps up,

483
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,080
I'm afraid...

484
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,280
I heard there's a temple nearby.

485
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,600
I'll go and pray for Her Highness.

486
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,120
That place has been abandoned for years.

487
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,200
No worshipers pray there anymore.

488
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,040
It's useless.

489
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,600
Besides, Chancellor Shen hates
anything to do with superstition.

490
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,700
You'll only make him angry.

491
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,160
(Since the witchcraft scandal,)

492
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,860
(I've never believed
in gods or spirits.)

493
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,560
(But today,)

494
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,320
(I've come)

495
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,840
(for one reason alone.)

496
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,900
(When I plotted with Prince Wuhen
to stage that assassination,)

497
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,800
(I knew if I wanted
to take down Prince Wugou)

498
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,560
(and the Meng family,)

499
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,680
(I had to use myself as bait.)

500
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:44,990
(Only then will His Majesty finally
be willing to uproot the aristocracy.)

501
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,000
(But I never imagined Jiang Taohua)

502
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,800
(would take that arrow for me.)

You're awake.

532

Chancellor Shen...

533
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,080
It's all right now.

534
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,320
I'll go get Qingtai.

535
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:01,640
She's awake.

536
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:02,990
Her Highness is awake.

537
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,880
Your Highness,
I knew you would be okay.

538
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,040
Now that Lady Jiang is awake,

539
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,440
you can finally rest easy.

540
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,040
By the way,

541
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,240
Prince Wugou has been holed up
in his tent lately.

542
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,290
He didn't even step outside.

543
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,760
He sure can hold it in.

544
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,440
He won't be patient for long.

545
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,400
Also,

546
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,800
although Lady Jiang is conscious,

547
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,640
she remains very weak.

548
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,240
She mustn't hear a word
about the assassination attempt.

549
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,390
So she can recover in peace.

550
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,420
No one should disturb her.

551
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,000
Understand?

552
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:29,190
Chancellor Shen, rest assured.

553
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,760
Your Highness, have some congee.

554
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,350
Why are you looking at me like that?

555
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,400
Don't you recognize me?

556
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,600
You have no idea
what I went through.

557
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,800
When Chancellor Shen carried
you back here,

558
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,360
I thought...

559
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,080
I thought we lost you.

560
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,500
Changjue hasn't been rescued yet.

561
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,860
How could I possibly
let anything happen to me?

562
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,560
I overheard Prince Wugou
and Meng Huaijin.

563
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,310
They plan to kill the Chancellor today.

564
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,080
(Since I know what's coming,)

565
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,680
(I've prepared in advance.)

566
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:17,600
Qingtai,

567
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,440
smooth out the edges
of this shard for me.

568
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,460
Yes, Your Highness.

569
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,600
(Taking that arrow)

570
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,280
(was simply to play along
with their plan.)

571
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,480
But that was far too dangerous!

572
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,400
How could you risk your life like that?

573
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,320
I had to take the gamble.

574
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,520
I cannot rely on cooperation

575
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,600
and submission to survive.

576
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,880
I want him to be the key

577
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,880
that breaks me free
from Empress Lv's control.

578
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,320
(But)

579
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,400
(the medicine and physician
did arrive suspiciously fast.)

580
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,640
(Almost as if they were expecting it.)

581
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:03,880
But

582
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,280
you may not realize it.

583
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,200
When you rushed forward that day,
you looked so sincere.

584
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:09,980
It really didn't seem like
you were acting.

585
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,600
Even I almost believed

586
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,580
that you had actually fallen
for the Chancellor.

587
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,120
You scared me half to death.

588
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,480
I was unconscious for days.

589
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,720
Did Shen Zaiye do anything unusual?

590
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,880
Just thinking about it makes me mad.

591
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,760
The moment you started to recover,

592
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,560
he and Zhan Lu vanished without a word.

593
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,400
They were sneaking around,

594
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,690
and who knows what they're up to.

595
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,880
You nearly died saving him.

596
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,590
But he didn't even look
the slightest bit worried!

597
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,440
Your Highness,

598
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,800
I think your plan didn't work.

599
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,240
You took that arrow

600
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,280
for nothing.

601
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,790
Chancellor Shen told us not
to disturb Princess Taohua.

602
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,360
But she asked me to come

603
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,400
and keep her company.

604
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:23,960
So you're saying

605
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,880
you brought this barbecue

606
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,280
just to lift her spirits?

607
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,960
Of course.
We'll be chatting and grilling meat.

608
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,760
Let's go.

609
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,560
Prince Wuxia, Qingying.

610
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,080
You're here.

611
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,720
My brother said not to disturb you.

612
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,880
But since you invited me,
this doesn't count as my fault, right?

613
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,320
Come.

614
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:51,590
Have a seat.

615
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,940
You better explain this clearly
to my brother.

616
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:54,960
Or he'll punish me.

617
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,000
Of course, I will.

618
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,560
You know I can't eat meat

619
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,600
because of my injuries.

620
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,720
But you brought a barbecue just for me.

621
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,640
That's thoughtful of you.

622
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,680
Of course.

623
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,480
I'm nothing if not considerate.

624
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,000
I've been unconscious for days.

625
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,720
I'm sorry for troubling everyone.

626
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:19,000
I hope I didn't scare any of you.

627
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:19,960
Scared? Please.

628
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,160
Do you think I get scared that easily?

629
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,880
But Qingtai said

630
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,120
even the physician thought
it was serious.

631
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,520
It was serious.

632
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,600
Even my brother,
who never believed in gods or spirits,

633
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:41,690
went all the way to a temple to pray
for your recovery.

634
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,120
Luckily, you're tough enough

635
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:43,760
to pull through.

636
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,080
Miss Qingying,

637
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,560
grilling in the tent

638
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,920
is really too smoky.

639
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,840
Princess Taohua is still recovering.

640
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,440
And if a fire starts,

641
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,440
it'll be chaos.

642
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,960
It's just barbecue!

643
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,550
It's not like it'll go up in flames.

644
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:06,880
All right. That's enough.

645
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,920
Let's play pitch-pot instead.

646
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,520
What do you think?

647
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,760
But the meat's not done yet.

648
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,840
Come on. Let's go.

649
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,120
No, it's not cooked yet.

650
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,520
I'll send someone to clean up.

651
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:15,560
Come on. Let's go.

652
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,700
Let me finish grilling first.

653
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,680
Is Miss Qingying trying
to smoke you in here?

654
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:27,440
For heaven's sake.

655
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,760
Are you all right, Your Highness?

656
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,400
Qingtai, my plan worked.

657
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,680
For someone like him,

658
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,760
he actually prays for me in a temple.
