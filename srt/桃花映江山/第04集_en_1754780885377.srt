00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,510
(Adapted from the novel "Peach Blossoms
Reflecting the River and Mountains")

16
00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:40,980
(by Bai Lu Cheng Shuang)

17
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,900
=Episode 4=

18
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,530
We've been on the road
since the first hour of mao.

19
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:56,370
I haven't had a single bite or sip

20
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:57,810
this whole way.

21
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,930
It's fine that you didn't
bring some snacks.

22
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,490
But the least you could do
is offer me some water, right?

23
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,530
This journey to Luyeyuan takes us

24
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:10,090
through remote wilderness
the entire way.

25
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:11,850
Heavy meals would make it

26
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:13,050
inconvenient for you.

27
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:14,850
But it's not inconvenient for you?

28
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,090
I'm a man. I can take care of it easily.

29
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:18,490
The Crown Prince's banquet

30
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:19,810
will have fine wine
and delicacies aplenty.

31
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,130
You'll dine well enough there.

32
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,850
(Luyeyuan)

33
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:31,970
The scenery here is quite lovely.

34
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,090
I came specifically to enjoy the rain.

35
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,050
Lady Jiang, if you're interested,

36
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:37,570
you're welcome to explore the area.

37
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,370
After such a long journey,

38
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:41,290
I'm worn out.

39
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,930
May Qingtai and I rest instead?

40
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:45,410
As you please.

41
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,450
(No matter how clever you are,)

42
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,450
(there's no way you can
escape this deadly trap.)

43
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:14,730
Admiring the scenery?

44
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:19,290
Since when does Shen Zaiye
have the leisure for such things?

45
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,970
He brought me here alone this time.

46
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,010
Could this be a trap?

47
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:25,650
That scheming minister

48
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,850
wouldn't dare try anything
so brazen in broad day light.

49
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,420
(Luyeyuan)

50
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,050
These crab cakes and jujube kernel tea

51
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,610
were specially prepared for you
by Master.

52
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:46,010
Please enjoy.

53
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:02,450
It's clean.

54
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:08,650
This too.

55
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:18,650
This jujube tea actually
tastes quite nice.

56
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,810
The crab cakes are perfect too,
savory with a touch of sweetness.

57
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:22,970
Try it, Your Highness.

58
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:33,450
Don't drink that!

59
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35,050
What's wrong?

60
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,410
I just remembered something.

61
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,650
When I was 12,

62
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,730
Empress Lu received a tribute
of sea crabs from merchants

63
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:45,690
and gifted them all to me.

64
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,410
The crabs were delicious,

65
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,130
but after eating them,
I suffered days of violent diarrhea.

66
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:51,370
I almost died.

67
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:52,930
Then...

68
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,730
You mustn't touch these
crab cakes, Your Highness!

69
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,370
Like you, at the time,

70
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,330
I thought that the crab was the problem.

71
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,130
I ran crying to Father, making a scene,

72
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:04,970
and ended up grounded for a long time.

73
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,050
He said I was making
trouble over nothing.

74
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:09,530
Later,

75
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,690
a young eunuch from the South

76
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:12,490
took pity on me

77
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:13,770
and discreetly told me the truth.

78
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:15,730
There was nothing
wrong with the crab itself.

79
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,450
But when eaten together
with jujube kernel tea,

80
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,490
it causes violent diarrhea.

81
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,810
From then on, I understood one thing.

82
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,250
If someone wants to harm you,

83
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:27,250
they don't necessarily
need to use poison.

84
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:28,530
No wonder!

85
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,330
We set off so early,

86
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:31,170
and that treacherous chancellor

87
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,250
deliberately starved us on the journey.

88
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,490
This was his trap all along.

89
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,170
He assumed

90
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,570
a northern princess like me,

91
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,330
even if familiar with crabs,

92
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,050
would be too pampered to know

93
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,570
this obscure poisonless poison.

94
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:46,290
But why

95
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:49,210
is he trying to give you diarrhea?

96
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:53,810
So, that means

97
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,570
you've inspected everything

98
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:00,890
in the study?

99
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,770
By custom,

100
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:03,850
the Crown Prince's banquet

101
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,490
should be attended by the mistress
of the house as your companion.

102
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:08,890
You're meticulous and sharp.

103
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:10,530
I trust you more.

104
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,050
These crab cakes and jujube kernel tea

105
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,690
were specially prepared for you
by Master.

106
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:23,090
He's trying to get rid of me
using the Crown Prince.

107
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:25,130
Chancellor,

108
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:26,770
Wanniang has delivered the food.

109
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:28,410
Tell Wanniang

110
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:29,690
she must be patient.

111
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,050
The Crown Prince hasn't arrived yet.

112
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:32,890
We cannot afford to slip up.

113
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,450
He won't touch me
before the Crown Prince arrives.

114
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,290
He's waiting for the food
to take effect.

115
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,890
When I fall ill and keep
excusing myself during the banquet,

116
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,410
he'll find his chance to kill me

117
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:49,930
and pin it on the Crown Prince.

118
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,410
But you just married him.

119
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:53,370
How would he dare?

120
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:54,370
What wouldn't he dare?

121
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,130
The one to bear the blame
would be the Crown Prince.

122
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:59,210
When it comes down to it,
a living crown prince

123
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,930
or a dead princess
sent for marriage alliance,

124
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,170
who do you think

125
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,410
Emperor Qi will value more?

126
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:06,970
As for Shen Zaiye,

127
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:10,410
if his newly-wedded concubine
were to be killed by the crown prince,

128
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,010
the Emperor might even feel
obligated to compensate him.

129
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,970
Such a brilliant plan,
three birds with one stone.

130
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:20,770
Your Highness,

131
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:21,890
let me fight

132
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:22,690
our way out then.

133
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,170
Let's get out of wretched Qi!

134
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:24,770
No.

135
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,130
Changjue is waiting for me.

136
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:29,610
What should we do?

137
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,370
We can't just do nothing
and let him kill you.

138
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:38,730
Chancellor, Wanniang reported

139
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:40,490
that the princess is
showing poisoning symptoms.

140
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:43,970
Based on the dosage,

141
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,410
it wasn't supposed
to take effect so soon.

142
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,570
How come it's starting already?

143
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,370
Perhaps Lady Jiang's constitution
is weak from travel fatigue.

144
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:54,570
Then we move up the plan.

145
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:55,690
Tell Wanniang to act now.

146
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,330
When the Crown Prince arrives,

147
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,490
find some way

148
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:59,410
to dirty his robes.

149
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,130
Then lead him to
Jiang Taohua's quarters to change.

150
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:03,730
Then,

151
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,050
with Jiang Taohua dead

152
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,010
and the Crown Prince changing clothes
in the same room,

153
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,850
what better setup for
an accidental killing?

154
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:10,170
Understood.

155
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,290
This bout of diarrhea
came on so suddenly.

156
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:23,650
Is the privy

157
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,290
still far away?

158
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,450
Worry not, Your Highness.

159
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,130
We're almost there.

160
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:51,650
Your Highness, watch out!

161
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,730
Your Highness, Shen Zaiye is so vicious.

162
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:58,930
How are we going to turn this around?

163
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,610
I'll feign poisoning symptoms later

164
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,690
to lower his guard

165
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,090
and lure him into carrying out his plan.

166
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,970
When he goes to greet the Crown Prince,

167
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:08,810
that will be our chance to escape.

168
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,210
But this plan is incredibly risky.

169
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:13,530
Our survival

170
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:14,890
depends on you now, Qingtai.

171
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,130
You should cut off the hand
of that useless servant

172
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,010
who didn't watch where he was going.

173
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,730
That'll teach obedience.

174
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,050
What a shame about my robes.

175
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,650
Your Highness, don't let such
a trivial matter ruin your mood.

176
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:37,890
Once changed,

177
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,890
I'll drink with you till dawn breaks.

178
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,210
Then you'd better start with
three cups as punishment.

179
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,780
(Serene and elegant)

180
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:08,850
This way, Your Highness.

181
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:17,890
(Why has nothing happened?)

182
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:24,890
(Wanniang?)

183
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,930
(Jiang Taohua!)

184
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,210
Your Highness, watch out!

185
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:01,170
Chancellor.

186
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,130
Search every corner of
Luyeyuan for Jiang Taohua.

187
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:05,570
Kill her.

188
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:06,450
Yes, sir.

189
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:08,770
But what should we do if Lady Jiang

190
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:09,330
has escaped Luyeyuan?

191
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:10,490
She has no one to rely on.

192
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:11,730
She'll surely try to seek
protection from His Majesty.

193
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:13,410
We must intercept her
before she reaches the city.

194
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:13,890
Yes, sir.

195
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:15,730
What about the Crown Prince?

196
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:17,050
I'll keep him occupied.

197
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,730
Notify the Chancellor

198
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:39,530
that we've found the Princess.

199
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:40,410
Yes, sir.

200
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,170
Where are we going, Your Highness?

201
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:45,650
To Yujing City.

202
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:48,570
When that treacherous chancellor
realizes he has failed,

203
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,410
he'll search everywhere for us.

204
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,810
Should we hide in
the mountains for a while

205
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:53,650
and wait it out?

206
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:55,890
Since he has decided to kill me,

207
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:57,170
he won't stop until he succeeds.

208
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:00,890
There's only one person
who can save our lives.

209
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:09,570
(Qingtai,)

210
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,410
(you must hold off the pursuers for me.)

211
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,090
(Before I can find the one
person who can save us,)

212
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:14,490
(I'll need leverage.)

213
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,210
(Leverage?)

214
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:16,970
(Yes.)

215
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:18,490
(Something that will
convince that person.)

216
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,170
(Rest assured, Your Highness,)

217
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,730
(I'll buy you the time you need,)

218
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,050
(even if it costs me my life.)

219
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,970
Once we sell off this half a pig leg

220
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,210
and this jar of pig's blood today,

221
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:41,650
we'll treat ourselves
to a proper feast in town!

222
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:42,130
Sounds nice!

223
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:43,930
(Pig's blood?)

224
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:12,570
Oh, no.

225
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:13,730
We've been tricked!

226
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:19,170
Who is it?

227
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,410
Coming!

228
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:27,250
I am Princess Chengping of Beiyuan,

229
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:28,690
Jiang Taohua.

230
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:31,330
I request an audience with Prince Wuxia.

231
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:32,770
You...

232
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,500
(Luyeyuan)

233
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,410
They say the Princess of Beiyuan
is a peerless beauty.

234
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,610
Since you brought her
here for the banquet,

235
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,250
why are you hiding her away?

236
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:49,730
Unfortunately,

237
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,090
Lady Jiang fell ill as
soon as she arrived.

238
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,090
I was worried she might
pass her illness to you,

239
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:55,690
so I had her rest away from the hall.

240
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:57,530
Never mind then.

241
00:13:58,410 --> 00:13:59,690
I came to see you today

242
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,370
for other matters anyway.

243
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,210
Your Highness, an emergency
demands my attention.

244
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:13,250
I'm afraid today's banquet
will have to end here.

245
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:14,330
Hold on.

246
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:18,210
It took me two hours to get here.

247
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:20,130
The audacity of you

248
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:21,850
to just leave me here like this

249
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:22,890
before the food

250
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:24,930
is even served.

251
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:27,410
The matter is urgent.

252
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:28,770
I only hope for
your understanding, Your Highness.

253
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:31,530
What if I refuse to be understanding?

254
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:33,810
Then do as you please.

255
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,250
That wretched lowlife.

256
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,130
He's not even worthy to
be a footstool beneath me.

257
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,050
The nerve of him to treat me like that!

258
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:51,690
Please spare me, Your Highness!

259
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:52,690
Your Highness,

260
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:53,690
such rage will only harm your health.

261
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:56,010
Save your strength for dealing
with Chancellor Shen instead.

262
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,450
Teach him a lesson.

263
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:04,890
Your Highness...

264
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:21,650
You're right.

265
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,890
Shen Zaiye is utterly insolent.

266
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:28,050
There's no need to keep testing him.

267
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,490
He wants to investigate dirty money?

268
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,130
Let him.

269
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:36,210
When he hits a dead end,

270
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,690
he'll end up tangled in his own web.

271
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:40,810
Yes, Your Highness.

272
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,530
Chancellor, I made a mistake.

273
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,810
I mistook the disguised Qingtai
for Lady Jiang

274
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,250
and failed to stop her.

275
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:50,450
Please punish me.

276
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:54,770
I underestimated her after all.

277
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,330
She went into the city...

278
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,370
But not to see His Majesty.

279
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:01,410
Who else in Yujing City

280
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,250
could she possibly turn to for help?

281
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,610
Chancellor!

282
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:09,290
I've been looking all over for you.

283
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,330
Prince Wuxia has summoned you
to his residence.

284
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:17,170
(So she's turned to
Prince Wuxia for help.

285
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,340
(Langhua Residence)

286
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,410
How is she?

287
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,250
My skills are limited.

288
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:30,730
For now, I've only managed
to stop the bleeding.

289
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,370
To fully treat her,

290
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,850
I need to prepare
anesthesia powder first.

291
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,770
I'll stitch the wound
once it takes effect.

292
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:42,730
How can you smile

293
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:44,970
while so badly injured?

294
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:47,610
I just thought of something.

295
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,010
When I was little,

296
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:52,290
every time I got hurt,

297
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,050
my younger brother

298
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,770
would be the one to panic and worry.

299
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:01,690
Here in Qi, I have no family.

300
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,610
Seeing your concern just now,

301
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:07,210
it felt so familiar.

302
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:10,570
Careful.

303
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:11,730
Yes, Your Highness.

304
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,410
I may have three brothers in name,

305
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:18,650
but I grew up in a remote palace

306
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:21,210
and rarely experienced
the warmth of kinship.

307
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:23,410
Affection runs cold in a royal family.

308
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:27,050
For you to have
such a bond with your brother,

309
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:28,570
it's rare and precious.

310
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:30,770
Siblings

311
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:32,490
are fate's gift,

312
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,210
but also choice.

313
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,730
Back at Zuimeng Pavilion,

314
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:39,930
when I was abandoned by everyone,

315
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,330
it was you

316
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:44,410
who spoke for me.

317
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,130
And now, caught in yet another storm,

318
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,170
you saved me once again.

319
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:50,890
For all that you've done,

320
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:54,410
please accept my deepest gratitude.

321
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:56,330
There's no need for this.

322
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:00,170
I only did what
my heart told me was right.

323
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:02,170
But

324
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,690
how did you end up so badly injured?

325
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:06,810
Chancellor and the Crown Prince

326
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,810
arranged to meet at Luyeyuan today.

327
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,370
Chancellor brought me along.

328
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,330
But we were ambushed by assassins.

329
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,770
I lost sight of Chancellor in the chaos.

330
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:20,610
I see.

331
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,370
You've been on your
own in a foreign land.

332
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:26,610
It can't have been easy.

333
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,530
If you'd accept help from
an unimportant prince like me,

334
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:30,250
you can come to me

335
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:31,290
if you ever need help again.

336
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:33,090
Thank you, Your Highness.

337
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:38,610
Physician.

338
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:40,370
Physician.

339
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,170
Is the medicine ready?

340
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,010
Your Highness, there's no need.

341
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,850
This wound isn't
something fit to be seen.

342
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:50,330
I'd rather return

343
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,130
and tend to it myself.

344
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:53,930
Is it really unfit to be seen

345
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:55,730
or are you afraid to show a wound

346
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:58,050
that doesn't exist?

347
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:00,930
Chancellor...

348
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,290
Have you gotten so used
to raiding people's homes

349
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:08,930
that you now barge
into others' residences

350
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,250
like they're your own?

351
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,810
I heard Lady Jiang was here,

352
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:14,810
and I came urgently to find her.

353
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:16,650
Forgive me

354
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,530
if I have offended you, Your Highness.

355
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:20,330
Lady Jiang,

356
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,050
if you're done with this charade,

357
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:23,890
we're leaving.

358
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:36,850
I'll return with you now.

359
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:38,130
Your Highness.

360
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:41,810
She's gravely injured!

361
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:44,530
It's one thing that you
won't show concern,

362
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:46,650
can't you at least
let her recover in peace?

363
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,290
Your Highness, please calm down.

364
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:51,890
Jiang Taohua,

365
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:53,650
you may fool others,

366
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,930
but not me.
I was born in the countryside.

367
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,650
That blood reeks.

368
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:00,930
It's clearly not human blood.

369
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:09,850
I'm not even human

370
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,410
in your eyes now.

371
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,050
What more is there to say?

372
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,050
Shen Zaiye,

373
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:18,930
as a minister,

374
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,570
you throw your weight around in court,

375
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:21,570
daring fate and inviting disaster.

376
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:22,770
As a husband,

377
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,130
you shirk your responsibilities
and treat her with complete neglect.

378
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:27,010
What right do you have
to treat her like this?

379
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:27,410
You...

380
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:45,610
I thought

381
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,490
those assassins at Luyeyuan

382
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:51,090
came for you, Chancellor.

383
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,410
That I was merely collateral damage.

384
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:56,650
But now I see

385
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:59,770
you ordered my death yourself.

386
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:01,690
Well then,

387
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:03,370
take it.

388
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,050
Shen Zaiye,

389
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:07,970
others may fear you,

390
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:09,610
but I don't.

391
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:11,730
The attempt on the princess's life,

392
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:13,650
I will see justice done.

393
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:24,050
(I knew ordinary tricks
wouldn't fool you,)

394
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,050
(so I had to wager real flesh)

395
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,210
(to fight for a chance to live.)

396
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,970
(Now that I have
Prince Wuxia's protection,)

397
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:48,930
(let's see how you can)

398
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:50,930
(kill me now, Chancellor Shen.)

399
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:55,730
Chancellor Shen,

400
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:58,250
the princess is your concubine.

401
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:00,250
By rights, I shouldn't meddle in it.

402
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:01,810
But given what happened today,

403
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,090
I can no longer stand aside.

404
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:04,650
Tell me,

405
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:06,770
was the attack on the princess

406
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:08,170
in any way connected to you?

407
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,330
I suggest you think carefully
before answering.

408
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,490
Don't try to deceive me

409
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:13,250
with courtly tricks.

410
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:16,890
Yes.

411
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,690
I regret ever supporting

412
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:23,650
her request

413
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:24,610
to marry you in court.

414
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:26,930
A princess was willing to marry you

415
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:28,250
as a concubine.

416
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:30,570
I thought you'd at least
treat her better.

417
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,010
I never imagined you'd take
the tactics you use

418
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,570
against your political rivals

419
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:35,810
and turn them on a woman.

420
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:36,530
You are...

421
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:38,330
You're utterly despicable.

422
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:43,850
Your Highness,

423
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,410
not everything in this world

424
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,450
is simply black or white.

425
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:51,130
Sometimes, doing the wrong thing

426
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,090
is the only way to
reach the right outcome.

427
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:55,170
I admire

428
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:56,410
your righteousness.

429
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:59,770
But even if you want to act
out of justice and compassion,

430
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:01,810
surely you can't keep Jiang Taohua

431
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:03,330
hidden away in your residence forever?

432
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:07,410
If you intend to take her back,

433
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:09,810
you must give me your word right now,

434
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:11,930
that you'll protect her from now on.

435
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:12,970
Remember this,

436
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:15,690
if anything happens to her,

437
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:17,130
I'll hold you responsible.

438
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,530
And if it comes to it,

439
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,770
I'm still Father's son.

440
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:23,890
Even if I have to risk my life,

441
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,610
I will make sure you pay for it.

442
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:31,650
What are you smiling at?

443
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:34,210
Nothing.

444
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:36,290
You have my word.

445
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:39,530
Forgive me, Your Highness.

446
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:42,010
Lady Jiang absolutely
refuses to take the anesthesia.

447
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:43,850
She insists on staying
conscious for the stitching.

448
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:45,370
I can't bring myself to do it.

449
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:46,930
You can only treat her fully

450
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:48,810
after the suture?

451
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:49,650
Yes.

452
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:52,290
I'll do it then.

453
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:54,850
You're not going to
hurt her again, are you?

454
00:23:57,530 --> 00:23:59,170
Your Highness, didn't you
just say it yourself?

455
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:02,010
If anything happens to Jiang Taohua,

456
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:03,530
you'll hold me accountable.

457
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:04,690
Right now,

458
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,330
I'm the last person who wants her dead.

459
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:09,370
Besides,

460
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,770
the imperial physicians
won't arrive in time.

461
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:12,890
Unless you'd prefer

462
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:14,650
to stitch her yourself, Your Highness?

463
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:19,770
I'll allow you to treat her.

464
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,250
I'll ask you one last time.

465
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:38,250
Are you sure you don't
want the anesthesia?

466
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:40,170
Yes.

467
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:44,850
Since you've chosen to endure the pain,

468
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:47,170
endure it to the end then.

469
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:07,490
Tell me,

470
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,250
how did you figure it out?

471
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,450
The pairing of crab
and jujube kernel tea.

472
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:15,290
I've had it before.

473
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:18,450
Then you're quite lucky.

474
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:21,250
If I were truly lucky,

475
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:23,250
I wouldn't be lying here like this.

476
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:33,890
There are countless
powerful figures in Qi.

477
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:37,250
Why did you choose
to turn to Prince Wuxia?

478
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,930
It was a gamble.

479
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:41,930
If I had

480
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:43,890
headed straight for the palace today,

481
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:46,330
I wouldn't have made it past your men.

482
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:49,410
So I chose the unexpected path instead.

483
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:51,810
And the truth shows

484
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:54,690
I won the bet.

485
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,130
Take a break.

486
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:12,850
No need.

487
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,130
Stopping and starting again

488
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:17,650
makes it easier to lose consciousness.

489
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:19,850
And what if you do?

490
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:24,410
Chancellor,

491
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,410
you already know the answer.

492
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,570
Losing consciousness is easy,

493
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:33,010
but I might not wake up again.

494
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,210
So you refused to take anesthesia

495
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:39,290
because you were worried
I might poison you again.

496
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:41,410
A princess of Beiyuan

497
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,970
is living like a bandit queen.

498
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,090
You've had it hard, haven't you?

499
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:47,530
If I hadn't,

500
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:49,410
how else

501
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:52,010
could I possibly survive in a world

502
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:53,890
filled with wolves and tigers?

503
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:57,610
Shen Zaiye,

504
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:59,250
do you really know how to suture?

505
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:00,930
I do.

506
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:03,690
It's just that your furious face

507
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:06,290
is far more pleasing than your

508
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:07,970
pretentious act.

509
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:08,930
You...

510
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:17,432
♪Alone I enter the game,
every move made with no regret in me♪

511
00:27:17,842 --> 00:27:22,002
♪Though shackles bind
my soul and chain my form♪

512
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:24,898
♪I've walked through
life and death before♪

513
00:27:25,293 --> 00:27:31,010
♪I fear not fate's cruel temptations,
I've severed every cause♪

514
00:27:32,066 --> 00:27:36,008
♪In this life our threads entwined,
in love and pain we crossed♪

515
00:27:36,466 --> 00:27:39,208
♪But I'll keep my word
no matter the cost♪

516
00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:41,869
♪Forged in stardust and flame♪

517
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:47,128
♪I rise with an unyielding frame♪

518
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:05,370
You should've waited
for the imperial physicians.

519
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,210
It's better to let me stitch it.

520
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:08,570
It'll heal faster this way.

521
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:11,050
After all,

522
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:13,690
stitching up the dead is easy.

523
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:15,890
It's the living that make it difficult.

524
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:18,250
Physician.

525
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:20,210
Come in and dress the wound.

526
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:22,650
Yes, sir.

527
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:28,810
Your stitching

528
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:30,530
will leave her a scar.

529
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:32,010
It won't be pretty when it heals.

530
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:34,610
That spot was only
ever meant for my eyes.

531
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:36,570
It won't scare anyone else.

532
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:38,930
You don't need to be so on edge.

533
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:41,130
I've given my word to Prince Wuxia

534
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:42,730
that I'd keep you alive.

535
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:45,930
Get some rest.

536
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:02,770
(For the first time,
I feel I've met my match.)

537
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:05,690
(Who knew it'd be the
Princess of Beiyuan.)

538
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:16,660
(Shen Residence)

539
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:20,290
Chancellor,

540
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:22,010
Lady Jiang has been
unconscious for quite some time.

541
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:24,690
Shall I call for another physician?

542
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:25,570
No need.

543
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:26,770
She's out of danger now.

544
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:28,690
With some proper rest, she'll recover.

545
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:30,050
Also,

546
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:31,890
while Lady Jiang is recuperating,

547
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:32,930
all household provisions

548
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:34,610
are to prioritize Zhengchun Boudoir.

549
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:37,490
Anyone in the residence who shows
the slightest neglect shall be punished.

550
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:38,610
Understood.

551
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:42,330
Don't leave me.

552
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:04,530
Mother,

553
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,130
don't leave me.

554
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:11,530
Mother,

555
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:12,330
it's strong!

556
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:14,850
This is Ling wine from our Hao City.

557
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:17,210
It's made from lake water,

558
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:19,530
with drifting duckweed
and floating moss.

559
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:20,810
It's fierce and aromatic.

560
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:22,850
You'll understand when you're older.

561
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:25,850
It tastes far better than
those bland tribute wines

562
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:26,810
we get in the palace.

563
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:28,770
Mother,

564
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:29,570
it's so beautiful!

565
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:31,130
You want it?

566
00:30:31,192 --> 00:30:31,592
Yes.

567
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:36,010
But Father says girls
shouldn't touch such things.

568
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:38,370
How much for this?

569
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:39,330
That one?

570
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:40,650
It's not for sale.

571
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:42,450
It's a prize.

572
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,250
See that bell over there?

573
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:45,970
As long as you can it,

574
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:47,490
that becomes yours.

575
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:49,690
Mother, it's so far.

576
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:51,210
I can't even see it clearly.

577
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,610
Can we really hit it?

578
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:54,210
Shopkeeper,

579
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:54,970
let me have a try.

580
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:06,890
That was amazing, Mother!

581
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:09,570
Men are like eagles
soaring through the skies,

582
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:12,050
but women are
the wild horses of the plains.

583
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:13,530
Neither is lesser than the other.

584
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:15,050
Remember this, Taohua,

585
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:16,770
whatever you want to do,

586
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:18,410
you can do it.

587
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:21,370
To me,

588
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:23,730
you are the bravest,
most wonderful girl.

589
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:25,850
Mother...

590
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:36,170
Yuetao,

591
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:38,450
all these years you've
accompanied me in this household,

592
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:41,090
have you ever seen that look
on Chancellor's face?

593
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:43,290
Don't overthink it, Madam.

594
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:46,450
We used Lady Jiang to spy on his study.

595
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:47,690
And days later,

596
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,130
she's nearly assassinated.

597
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,290
The timing is suspicious.

598
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:52,370
I know.

599
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:54,810
Chancellor must be involved

600
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:56,730
in Lady Jiang's assassination.

601
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,130
But from what I saw just now,

602
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:02,290
his feelings for her didn't seem fake.

603
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,050
My husband

604
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,650
was born to be a statesman.

605
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:12,650
Affection means nothing to him.

606
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:14,610
Whoever stands in his way

607
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:16,730
must die.

608
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:20,210
We'd better send the stuff out

609
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:22,530
before Chancellor finds out.

610
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,700
(Zhengchun Boudoir)

611
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:36,690
That treacherous chancellor
is acting all different toward you.

612
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:38,850
Is he cooking up

613
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:40,450
a new plan?

614
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:44,010
We can't keep playing defense forever.

615
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:49,690
I have to find a way

616
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:51,730
to keep him in check

617
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:53,970
and take control of my situation.

618
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:57,450
But your poison
is about to act up again.

619
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:59,130
Your priority should be
getting the antidote.

620
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:01,170
Should we hurry
and send the painting out?

621
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:15,530
(I'm drawing them out)

622
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:17,570
(from memory.)

623
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:07,610
Give this to Yang Wanqing.

624
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:09,130
Tell him it contains

625
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:11,170
the Sunlight over
a Thousand Peaks scroll

626
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:12,170
Empress Lu is looking for.

627
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:15,730
But the lockdown
on the estate hasn't been lifted.

628
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:18,890
No one is allowed to leave.

629
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:23,250
But they never said people
couldn't come in, did they?

630
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:25,290
True,

631
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:27,930
but no visitors have come either.

632
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:31,570
Unforbidden means permitted.

633
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:33,410
Anyway,

634
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:35,890
if you want to open a window,

635
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,010
you have to make them believe

636
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,650
you'll blow the whole roof off.

637
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,420
(Shen Residence)

638
00:34:47,930 --> 00:34:48,610
Let me out!

639
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:50,010
Let me out!

640
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:50,770
Why can't I go out?

641
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:51,530
Whose order is it?

642
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:52,330
Miss Qingtai.

643
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:53,050
Miss Qingtai,

644
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:54,170
please understand.

645
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:55,770
Chancellor gave strict orders

646
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:57,810
that no one is to leave the estate.

647
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,770
My lady just regained
consciousness after a serious injury.

648
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,170
She's homesick,

649
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:02,770
and all she wants is
a taste of Beiyuan pastries.

650
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:04,290
And now you're telling me

651
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:05,090
you can't even grant her that?

652
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:07,210
Didn't Chancellor say

653
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:08,490
we were to be well cared for?

654
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:10,810
And look at you,
you're rejecting our request.

655
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:12,930
Aren't you afraid he'll punish you
when he finds out?

656
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:13,930
Let me out!

657
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,010
Let me out!

658
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:15,530
Taohua.

659
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:18,530
Taohua,

660
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:20,090
I don't have the authority

661
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:21,090
to let anyone leave the estate.

662
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:22,170
Whatever you are craving for,

663
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:23,210
just tell the kitchen to make it.

664
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:24,850
You really think Qi's cook is capable

665
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:26,890
of making our Beiyuan pastries?

666
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:29,490
To think she's a princess,

667
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:31,610
throwing tantrums over snacks

668
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:34,050
right after Chancellor gave the order.

669
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:36,210
No sense of the bigger picture at all.

670
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:37,290
What a disgrace.

671
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:40,050
Having just escaped death,

672
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:43,450
I still feel shaken.

673
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:45,970
I can't help but miss home.

674
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:48,810
Please forgive my weakness.

675
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:51,370
So much for prioritizing
Zhengchun Boudoir

676
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:54,210
when they deny even basic comforts!

677
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:55,410
Qingtai.

678
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:57,930
The fault lies not with Madam,

679
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:01,050
but with those meddlesome,

680
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:02,490
troublemaking servants.

681
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:04,450
Lady Jiang,

682
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:05,290
what's that supposed to mean?

683
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:07,330
I'm just following orders.

684
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:08,410
Whose orders exactly?

685
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:10,210
Chancellor clearly said

686
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:11,210
anyone who slights Her Highness

687
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,050
shall be punished.

688
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:13,890
Jiang Taohua,

689
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:16,570
just because you're slightly injured

690
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:17,170
doesn't mean you can...

691
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:19,650
Your Highness!

692
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:25,010
Lady Qin, how could you attack her?

693
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:25,930
What is this?

694
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:28,210
Your princess clearly fell by herself.

695
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:29,325
- Nonsense!
- Everyone saw it.

696
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:31,170
I saw it with my own eyes
that Lady Qin pushed her!

697
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:32,090
- Stop making lies now.
- I'm going to kill you!

698
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:32,490
Enough!

699
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:35,330
We mustn't ruin the harmony here.

700
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:37,010
Tell Chancellor about this.

701
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:38,530
Let him decide what's to be done.

702
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:47,810
Since Lady Jiang is feeling homesick,

703
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:49,050
let her have her way.

704
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:51,530
But leaving the estate
is out of the question.

705
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:52,730
Whatever she's craving for,

706
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:54,610
have someone bring it in.

707
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:00,170
The same goes for the other ladies.

708
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:01,370
If they lack anything,

709
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:03,730
have Madam arrange it all together.

710
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:04,730
Yes, sir.

711
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:07,250
Chancellor,

712
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:09,690
ever since Lady Jiang was attacked,

713
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,090
her personality really has changed.

714
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:13,610
Changed?

715
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:16,610
She's just stopped hiding her tail.

716
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:18,490
The fox has shown its true face.

717
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:23,170
(You're not the one I was looking for,)

718
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:24,930
(but you've been
trying to stir up trouble.)

719
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:27,730
(Very well, you'll be my bait then.)

720
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,330
Stop. What's your business here?

721
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:34,890
I'm delivering food.

722
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:37,890
Madam, is there anything you need?

723
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:39,530
Chancellor said no one
is to be overlooked.

724
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:40,890
Madam would like...

725
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:41,330
Yuetao.

726
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:43,930
Thank Chancellor for me.

727
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:46,090
I have everything I need.

728
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:49,690
Pass him the food.
You're not allowed to enter.

729
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:51,370
Yes, sir.

730
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:06,890
Madam, why did you...

731
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:07,850
This is a setup by Chancellor.

732
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:10,370
He's begun to suspect me.

733
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:13,250
And now, he's even
laid a trap to draw me out.

734
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:15,050
That just proves
how critical this item is.

735
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,010
We can't lose it.

736
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:18,090
But given the situation,

737
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:19,410
it's unlikely we'll
get out of the estate.

738
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,410
We'll have to find another way.

739
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:23,970
Since Chancellor is suspecting us,

740
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:25,850
maybe we should just give up this time.

741
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:30,570
No.

742
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:33,130
My family's fate is tied
to the Crown Prince's.

743
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:35,130
I can't take that risk.

744
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:36,450
But...

745
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:39,650
Shouldn't you think
about your future too?

746
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:42,770
I know how you feel about Chancellor.

747
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:44,970
But if this plan really succeeds,

748
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,730
there won't be any chance
left between you and him.

749
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:51,650
My future...

750
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:54,610
As the eldest daughter of Meng family,

751
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:58,370
I exist only for the clan's legacy.

752
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,930
There has never been a future for me.

753
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:04,650
I must find a way

754
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:07,450
to get this item out.

755
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:10,450
What is this?

756
00:39:10,962 --> 00:39:12,370
(Zhengchun Boudoir)
(Sunlight over a Thousand Peaks)

757
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:14,730
If what Her Majesty said is true,

758
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:17,290
and Chancellor Shen is secretly keeping
the Sunlight over a Thousand Peaks

759
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:19,130
painted by Xue Ran,

760
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:20,650
then this is the same painting.

761
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:52,170
However, the brushwork in
the painting varies too much.

762
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:53,610
They clearly weren't
done by the same person.

763
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:56,970
Most likely, that treacherous
chancellor had someone forge it

764
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:58,570
and placed it in his study on purpose

765
00:39:58,570 --> 00:39:59,690
to bait someone out.

766
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:01,210
What does that mean?

767
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:03,330
Don't worry, Wanqing.

768
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:04,850
If Shen Zaiye resorted to this tactic,

769
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,610
it means the real painting
isn't in his possession.

770
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:09,130
Please tell Her Majesty

771
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:10,690
to be a little patient.

772
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,410
I'll work with Shen Zaiye

773
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,610
to find the real painting.

774
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:23,210
Her Majesty always said
you were clever.

775
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:25,650
Seems she was right.

776
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:28,650
But Your Highness,

777
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:30,970
perhaps you should

778
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,290
rely less on petty tricks.

779
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,610
This antidote will only keep the
poison at bay for a month after all.

780
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:38,450
You won't bluff
your way through next time.

781
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:39,770
Don't worry, Wanqing.

782
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:41,610
I know what I'm doing.

783
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:46,530
Madam surely is composed.

784
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:49,770
This would've been
the perfect opportunity,

785
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:50,770
yet she hasn't made a move.

786
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:52,250
She just spends her days
sipping tea, admiring flowers,

787
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,130
practicing calligraphy,
and playing the zither.

788
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:54,250
We can't make a move

789
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:55,370
until she makes hers.

790
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:56,930
Now we're stuck in a stalemate.

791
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:58,610
Please announce my arrival.

792
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:01,050
I've come to personally thank Chancellor

793
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:02,210
for his thoughtfulness.

794
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:03,210
Let her in.

795
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:11,890
Thank you.

796
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:33,010
The shopkeeper said

797
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:36,050
this is the most popular style right now

798
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:38,170
among noble ladies in Yujing.

799
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:39,690
Take a look.

800
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:40,490
Do I look good?

801
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:44,970
This fabric costs
ten taels of gold per foot.

802
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:48,090
You certainly didn't hold back.

803
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,370
You might actually think it's a bargain

804
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:54,130
once you hear what I have to say.

805
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:59,330
You're different today.

806
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:02,610
Almost as if you've gained some

807
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:04,050
confidence.

808
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:09,290
I just happened to learn
a little secret of yours.

809
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:12,890
Knowing my secrets

810
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:15,210
is rarely a good thing.

811
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:19,610
I've been reflecting these past days.

812
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:21,730
What could I have possibly done

813
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:23,610
to make you want me dead?

814
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:26,330
After thinking it through,

815
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:29,530
I suppose it must've been the day

816
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:31,050
I accidentally entered your study

817
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:34,850
and disrupted your trap
to lure someone out.

818
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:38,930
The bait was those paintings.

819
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:41,690
Plus the lockdown on the estate,

820
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:45,850
someone must've taken
the painting you were after.

821
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:50,410
Go on.

822
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:52,890
You could've traced the mastermind

823
00:42:53,570 --> 00:42:55,530
through the servant I identified.

824
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:57,450
But strangely,

825
00:42:57,930 --> 00:43:00,690
after his death, nothing happened.

826
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:06,130
That tells me the person behind it
is someone you can't touch

827
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:09,250
or won't touch.

828
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:10,970
Jiang Taohua,

829
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:13,370
you were raised in the palace.

830
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:17,290
Surely you know this,
the more curious you are,

831
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:19,290
the faster you die.

832
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:23,330
Of course I know.

833
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:26,610
But I'm just a helpless woman
in a foreign land.

834
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:28,730
If I want to survive,

835
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:30,770
my only choice is to work with you.

836
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:34,810
If I can help you

837
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:36,770
recover that painting,

838
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:39,410
will you grant me your protection?

839
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:45,330
You want to work with me?

840
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:48,010
Wouldn't it be good to have some help?

841
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:53,450
Only sheep and cattle travel in herds.

842
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:55,770
But I...

843
00:43:56,490 --> 00:43:57,850
I walk alone.

844
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:03,490
Jiang Taohua,

845
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:06,250
I acknowledge your cleverness.

846
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:09,290
You're even brave and resourceful.

847
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:14,650
But so what?

848
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:17,450
As a princess of royal blood,

849
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:20,130
you're reduced to wounds and scars,

850
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:22,650
begging for a chance to live

851
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:25,570
as nothing more than a concubine.

852
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:30,890
Judging by the current situation,

853
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:32,930
you and Madam

854
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:34,530
have reached an impasse.

855
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:36,570
You're not getting that painting

856
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:38,010
until she surrenders it.

857
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:41,050
But I have a way to break that deadlock.

858
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:45,370
I pledge myself to your service.

859
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:49,050
The question is, will you give me

860
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:51,330
the chance to walk beside you?
