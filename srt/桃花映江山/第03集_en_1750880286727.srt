A thousand сравnitions, mile and tide dispersed dieses clouds

00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,800
This longness to interrupt a ;)

A Language of Hall's persone

6
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,040
You all be the only thing I want

7
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,700
If you will understand what I want

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:57,040
the existence in my heart cannot be.

9
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,040
My Girlfriend is an Alien

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,040
Episode 16

11
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,040
These people are so cruel.

12
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,040
Enough.

13
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,040
You can't even find the real eye.

14
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,040
Which one do you want?

15
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,040
I want it.

16
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,040
What kind of person is that?

17
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,040
I want to get a needle in my knee.

18
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,040
If I want to get a needle in my knee,

19
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,040
my legs will be broken.

20
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,040
We've lived in the Cold Palace for years.

21
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,040
We've been used to this kind of dirty tricks.

22
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,040
But I feel sorry for you.

23
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,040
We've just been released from the tiger's den.

24
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,040
We're in the wolf's den again.

25
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,040
It's much better here than in the North Campus.

26
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,040
I've been told that

27
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,040
at least I can escape,

28
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,040
hide,

29
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,040
or even fight back.

30
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,040
It's not like I have to endure everything

31
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,040
for Changjue

32
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,040
in front of the Empress.

33
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,040
We should tell this to Prime Minister Shen

34
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,040
and let him be the one in charge.

35
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,040
Tell him?

36
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,040
Maybe he's the one who released the needle.

37
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,040
Of course.

38
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,040
Mrs. Meng might be the one.

39
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,040
Lady Duan and Lady Qin

40
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,040
are both suspicious.

41
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,040
Why did she do that?

42
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,040
To test my bottom line,

43
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,040
my ability,

44
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,040
and my purpose.

45
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,040
If we didn't get

46
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,040
her permission to enter this door,

47
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,040
it wouldn't be so hard.

48
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,040
Everyone under the door

49
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,040
will follow her color

50
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,040
and follow her.

51
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,040
What should we do

52
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,040
if we don't get her permission?

53
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,040
When facing a villain,

54
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,040
we should lower our guard

55
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,040
and lower our guard.

56
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,040
When facing others,

57
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,040
we should be more careful.

58
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,040
It's not good to be too obedient.

59
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,040
Anyway,

60
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,040
let's calm down the villain first.

61
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,040
It's not a problem to establish a clan here.

62
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,040
Your Highness,

63
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,040
it's almost time for the marriage ceremony.

64
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,040
It's been two days.

65
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,040
Why hasn't the Prime Minister come yet?

66
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,040
The first one to enter the door is Lady Qin.

67
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,040
Mrs. Meng is the one who will be the one to check on her.

68
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,040
Now,

69
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,040
it's her turn.

70
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,040
Your Highness,

71
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,040
everyone in the mansion is watching you tonight.

72
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,040
Are you really not going to the marriage ceremony?

73
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,040
Why?

74
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,040
You want to go?

75
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,040
Did you find out

76
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,040
that the thing that night

77
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,040
had nothing to do with her?

78
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,040
A weak princess

79
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,040
with great intentions

80
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,040
came to the flag from far away

81
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,040
and fell into the back yard of the vile man.

82
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,040
She was helpless.

83
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,040
It's okay.

84
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,040
It's more suspicious.

85
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,040
I know

86
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,040
if she is planning something more.

87
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,040
Prime Minister,

88
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,040
Lady Jiang's maid, Qingtai, wants to see you.

89
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,040
The Princess said

90
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,040
that the Prime Minister is busy with his work.

91
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,040
She won't disturb him.

92
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,040
Tonight's wedding ceremony

93
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,040
will also let the bride

94
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,040
prepare according to the situation

95
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,040
of the Prime Minister's absence.

96
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,040
What bride?

97
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,040
The Princess doesn't know the customs of the wedding.

98
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,040
She's afraid of making a mistake.

99
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,040
She asked His Majesty

100
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,040
to send a maid from the palace

101
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,040
to be the bride.

102
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,040
Tonight, the marriage ceremony

103
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,040
will be arranged by her.

104
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,040
So she was waiting for me here.

105
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,040
Open the window.

106
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,040
In case that the people outside

107
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,040
can't see it clearly.

108
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,040
Why are you sighing?

109
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,040
Don't worry.

110
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,040
I've moved the maids.

111
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,040
She will come.

112
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,040
I'm not afraid that she won't come.

113
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,040
The situation is so chaotic.

114
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,040
I'm afraid that she will make trouble to the Princess.

115
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,040
I can't even keep watch on her.

116
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,040
She will only come

117
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,040
when she comes.

118
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,040
I'm afraid that she will make trouble to the Princess.

119
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,040
She will only come

120
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,040
when she comes.

121
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,040
Greetings, Prime Minister.

122
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,040
I'm from the Xue family.

123
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,040
Please inform the Prime Minister.

124
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,040
Xue family?

125
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,040
Yes.

126
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,040
I've never heard of it.

127
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,040
Just inform the Prime Minister.

128
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,040
A man named Xue

129
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,040
is here to see Nuo.

130
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,040
He will definitely see me.

131
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,040
I'll take you to the side hall.

132
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,040
Okay. Thank you.

133
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,040
Greetings, Prime Minister.

134
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,040
Get out.

135
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,040
I'm so happy

136
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,040
that you're here.

137
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,040
What?

138
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,040
Didn't you put so much effort

139
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,040
to let me come?

140
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,040
You're too impatient.

141
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,040
This fan

142
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,040
will be opened

143
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,040
after the groom

144
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,040
sends the blood fan.

145
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:55,080
You're so

146
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,040
obsessed with acting.

147
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,040
Aren't you afraid

148
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,040
that you will be lured into it?

149
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,040
The peach blossom is so sincere to the Prime Minister

150
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,040
that it's very clear to the world.

151
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,040
How can it be the act?

152
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,420
According to madam Song's instruction.

153
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,540
According to madam Song's instruction.

154
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,660
At your service,

155
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,660
everything in Qingnong is good.

156
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,660
But nothing'shirgter the proper norms,

157
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,140
or else my Qi will be killing that rules.

158
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,760
Madam Song,

159
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,100
you grew up in the North PL queen's palace

160
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,200
so you're not used to it anymore.

161
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,600
Mr. Per Hollow is very busy

162
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,680
and he is also willing to welcome when we come to us.

163
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,240
I'm quite happy with that.

164
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:36,720
How about having

165
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,080
I'm ashamed to say this.

166
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,680
What matters is the princess.

167
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,120
Please, Madam,

168
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,880
do as the rules.

169
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,760
Why is the princess

170
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,080
carrying a plate of pork?

171
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,120
I heard it's the custom in the North.

172
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,240
But our lord doesn't eat pork.

173
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,000
Pork is good.

174
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,160
It's rich in nutrition and good for the body.

175
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,520
Immortal,

176
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,680
take the chopsticks.

177
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:33,400
you have a tomorrow

178
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,160
You gave lot of surprises to the peach blossoms.

179
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,440
I have no power to return the peach blossom.

180
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,960
I can only choose the biggest blessing

181
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,000
to give to you.

182
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,120
This new wife is really virtuous.

183
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,360
Please eat it.

184
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,440
You're right!

185
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,320
Your aunt wants to rear you.

186
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,120
That's lying.

187
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,840
She's a nut.

188
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,280
She's taking his place.

189
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,720
You...!

190
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,720
Go away!

191
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,600
Lie!

192
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,800
I'm dying!

193
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,200
You are dead!

194
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,520
I should have left!

195
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,360
My death goes on!

196
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,600
How am I 38?

197
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,600
I'm afraid it's not easy to drink the wine.

198
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,280
Since you're not kind,

199
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,600
don't blame me for dealing with you.

200
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,600
Peach blossoms are not good for alcohol.

201
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,960
Drink less.

202
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,040
Don't mind it.

203
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,240
Don't you always respect me?

204
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,040
Or you're not satisfied with this marriage?

205
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,720
Since it's a drink,

206
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,760
I'll share it with you.

207
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,320
You're generous and gentle.

208
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,080
You're a perfect match.

209
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,320
You'll be a perfect match.

210
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,200
This is great.

211
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,520
I have to tell Madam.

212
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,120
I have to tell my wife, too.

213
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,560
I've informed her.

214
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,680
The Prime Minister is taking the concubine today.

215
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,440
He's a little late.

216
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,240
He'll be here soon.

217
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,280
Have some tea.

218
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,320
I'll come to visit you tomorrow.

219
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,560
I'll leave a message now.

220
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,520
Beside them.

221
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,080
Be careful.

222
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,080
Zhiyanälment

223
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,740
Why don't you send Meng Ping out and help him?

224
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,440
Then only they will know

225
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm great

226
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,080
but I'm no better

227
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,080
Yes.

228
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,120
Yanyi.

229
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,520
You haven't taught the opening ceremony

230
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,240
to a lady in the north house?

231
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,320
Yes.

232
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,480
However...

233
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,480
Your Highness, yougirlshorin

234
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,120
married into and modeled after me.

235
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,480
Why did you get so twisted

236
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,360
at the critical moment?

237
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,800
I didn't get twisted.

238
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,160
We were just passing by.

239
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,200
I didn't think we would be able to get away.

240
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,640
There's something in the ball.

241
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,880
It's just a small feature of the South Moon.

242
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,880
It will make people's mind and mind are confused

243
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,680
and they will be obsessed with the truth.

244
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,360
Since you don't believe in peach blossoms,

245
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,360
you can ask me anything you want.

246
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,360
Why did you get so twisted at the critical moment?

247
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,600
Tell me.

248
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,320
Why did you get so twisted at the critical moment?

249
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,880
Peach blossoms are princesses who are not favored.

250
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,080
I was forced to come here to marry you.

251
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,120
I thought I would be able to get away with it for the rest of my life.

252
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,520
But the night at the Drunken Dream House

253
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,520
gave me a new hope.

254
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,640
Prime Minister Shen died in the imperial court.

255
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,120
The court was in a chaos.

256
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,080
Peach blossoms fell in love with Prime Minister Shen at first sight.

257
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,000
The world says I'm evil and cunning.

258
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,520
I'm evil and evil.

259
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,800
Aren't you afraid?

260
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:45,960
I am.

261
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,800
But if I don't have any means to stop the thunder,

262
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,840
I will be unworthy of the world.

263
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,200
I'd rather be a little worse.

264
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,520
It's better than being trampled by someone else.

265
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,320
You're as cunning as a snake.

266
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,280
Do you have no other home

267
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,720
after you marry him?

268
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,920
I swear

269
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,360
to marry him a heartless and सかいer salon than you.

270
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,440
But the reason I'm alive

271
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,180
is to get my ass married to him.

272
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,760
You'd better not have any other thoughts.

273
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,400
I won't tolerate it.

274
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,720
Your Highness, are you all right?

275
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,760
I'm fine.

276
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,840
That bastard fed you medicine again.

277
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,080
He's really something.

278
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,640
I've done a good thing

279
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,600
since I was in the West Talisman.

280
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,280
Maybe the poison of the Peach Blossom Pill

281
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,520
has blocked the effect of other poisons.

282
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,080
I did make some mistakes initially,

283
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,160
but it'll be over soon.

284
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,760
Since Heaven granted us this opportunity,

285
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,320
please stay with him.

286
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,160
What did that man, Yue'er, ask Zienü

287
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,200
Is there anything wrong

288
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,600
with the Tuzhen Valley in the southern region?

289
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:05,800
My Lord.

290
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,120
What's up?

291
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,440
Xue Ren is dead.

292
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,600
When we found him,

293
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,240
he was thrown into the Wudang Sect.

294
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:18,920
Did you find the painting?

295
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,240
No.

296
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,840
I've searched the area around him.

297
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:22,880
My Lord.

298
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,480
The victim's life

299
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,720
was a sharp knife wound.

300
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,040
The knife was not deep.

301
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,640
It wasn't killed by Dali.

302
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,600
There was no sign of

303
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,960
any resistance.

304
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,240
I guess

305
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,600
he was killed again after being bewitched.

306
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,000
The black soil is...

307
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,000
For the firework,

308
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,280
I especially sent a lot of black soil

309
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,800
to the north for my family.

310
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,320
How could the blood

311
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,160
have been found in Xue Ren's blood?

312
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:01,960
Could it be...

313
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,320
Zhan Lu.

314
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,560
Seal off the school.

315
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,760
Everyone is prohibited from going out.

316
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,920
Only those who disobey the order

317
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:07,760
are allowed to go out.

318
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:08,960
Yes.

319
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:11,880
My Lord has ordered

320
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:12,720
to seal off the school.

321
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:14,960
But My Lord,

322
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,120
what's next?

323
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,560
The enemy is in my way.

324
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,800
What should I do?

325
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,040
The stage is set.

326
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,080
Are you afraid that the opera will not come?

327
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,320
You just need a few more weapons.

328
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,760
Put the message I have out.

329
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:31,720
Yes.

330
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,360
My Lord.

331
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,200
Do you think they will come back

332
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,440
if they get the message?

333
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,040
It's not necessary to say if they come.

334
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,640
If there is no movement,

335
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,520
I'm afraid there is only one person

336
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,760
who can hold his breath in the mansion.

337
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:03,160
The

338
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,160
Meng Ping reported that

339
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,200
you got the painting of Xue Ren.

340
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,840
What if Xue Ren really left

341
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,720
other clues?

342
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,560
Or the inner robe he was hiding

343
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,800
was a fake?

344
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,080
Then we are...

345
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,680
It's possible that the inner robe

346
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,640
you were holding was a fake.

347
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,280
Have you seen it near the study?

348
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,880
The guard near there

349
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,200
has increased a lot.

350
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,040
So I can't find a chance to get in.

351
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,240
You are not obsessed with the formation.

352
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,320
You just want to lure the snake out of the cave.

353
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,560
Let's take advantage of the situation

354
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,520
and get the message.

355
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,960
Let's see what you are up to.

356
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:39,840
The study.

357
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,120
The flower garden.

358
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,240
The room that was in the room before.

359
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,240
This is the place where

360
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,160
Madam and the wife live.

361
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,920
The maids and servants

362
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,480
live here.

363
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,640
The painting is all done.

364
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,680
The princess is right to be wronged.

365
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,040
But such an important thing

366
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,600
is hidden in the room.

367
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,880
I guess it's either the study or the bedroom.

368
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,200
Let's go and check it out.

369
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,480
No.

370
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,840
It's too obvious.

371
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,560
We can only go to one place.

372
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,160
Where is the guard room?

373
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:13,840
The study.

374
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,080
The Maids and the Maids

375
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,640
Lord Xiang asked Madam Jiang to go to the study.

376
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,600
Did Lord Xiang ask me to do something?

377
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,200
Why are you telling me this?

378
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:34,880
I see.

379
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,600
Wait outside.

380
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,800
I'll go in by the hand.

381
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:38,880
Yes.

382
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,960
The Maids and the Maids

383
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,240
Your Highness.

384
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,000
We were just going to the study to find the painting.

385
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,200
And we are here.

386
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,360
How can there be such a coincidence?

387
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,920
Even you think there is a problem.

388
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,440
It means it's not a big deal.

389
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,720
Your Highness.

390
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,760
It's hard for us to get close to the study.

391
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,800
Let's just go with the flow.

392
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,160
Let's use the arrangement of the person behind us

393
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,320
to check it out.

394
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,480
Since someone wants to use me as a scapegoat,

395
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,080
the rouge is not my gold medal.

396
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,600
That's the study.

397
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,280
Lord Xiang asked Madam Jiang to wait in the room for a moment.

398
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,760
She'll be here soon.

399
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,080
There's still a short way.

400
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,560
Won't you lead me there?

401
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,480
There are many important things in the study.

402
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,080
Only the guards can enter the study.

403
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,920
I dare not come close.

404
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,680
You may leave.

405
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:50,800
Yes.

406
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,760
Jiang Taohua went to the study.

407
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,760
Although Jiang Taohua's mother-in-law

408
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,720
was in the Zhencheng Pavilion when the accident happened,

409
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,840
it's impossible.

410
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,840
The murderer deliberately

411
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,120
led her to test the truth.

412
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,240
Who took her there?

413
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,760
The murderer.

414
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,480
The murderer.

415
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,080
The murderer.

416
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,560
The murderer.

417
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,560
The murderer.

418
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,560
The murderer.

419
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,560
The murderer.

420
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,560
The murderer.

421
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,560
The murderer.

422
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,560
The murderer.

423
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,560
The murderer.

424
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,720
Who took her there?

425
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,400
I saw Madam Jiang coming from the small room alone.

426
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,920
She must have prepared

427
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,400
the route of the study.

428
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,560
So many flowers.

429
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,080
Which one is the Sunset Wind?

430
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,560
Each flower has different strokes.

431
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,440
It's from different people.

432
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,040
But the print on it

433
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,520
is all called Xue Ran.

434
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,520
Don't worry about it.

435
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,640
Write down the flowers.

436
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,920
Let's go back to the forest to check them.

437
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,080
The Dark Pavilion.

438
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,160
Master Xiang.

439
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,520
I have no time to play with you.

440
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,520
Tell me.

441
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,080
Who told you to come here?

442
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,080
Tell me.

443
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,560
Who told you to come here?

444
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,560
I came here just for a small thing.

445
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,080
The peach blossoms just came in for a day.

446
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,280
How could I know her name?

447
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,640
You should remember the appearance.

448
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,680
If you recognize her,

449
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,040
I believe you came here

450
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,800
because you were deceived by someone.

451
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,960
If the peach blossoms recognize her,

452
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,880
I'm afraid she will be hated again.

453
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,600
If you want to set an enemy for the peach blossoms,

454
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,600
you should make it clear.

455
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,340
Put it in a bowl.

456
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,160
A trap.

457
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,840
Besides,

458
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:59,520
there are only paintings in this study.

459
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,920
It's not your place.

460
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,120
Have you checked it?

461
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,360
The peach blossom has been standing here

462
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,440
and never moved.

463
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:13,960
That's good.

464
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,120
Your Highness.

465
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,520
No.

466
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,160
I should call you Madam Jiang now.

467
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,320
You don't have to worry about it.

468
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,360
Don't think that

469
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,160
you can take advantage of it.

470
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,120
You can't deny it.

471
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,920
I can find it out.

472
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,800
It's just

473
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,080
a waste of time.

474
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,040
But by then,

475
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,440
Madam Jiang's suspicion

476
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,920
will be exposed.

477
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,040
Do you believe it?

478
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,840
Even if one day

479
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,400
you die in a sudden,

480
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,720
I will still be your Prime Minister.

481
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,560
As for your petty thoughts,

482
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,000
no matter what it is,

483
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,720
it's not important.

484
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,000
The things you did today are all here.

485
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,800
It's up to you whether you can find it or not.

486
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:08,560
Jiang

487
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,120
has been 30 times over and over again.

488
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,120
Have you found out

489
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,040
who was really the one

490
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,880
whoü?

491
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,800
I will give you an auspicious medicine at last.

492
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,080
Everyone, raise your right foot.

493
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,080
It's him.

494
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,080
How dare you slander me?

495
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,080
I didn't sleep early today.

496
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,080
I didn't go to find you.

497
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,080
I saw that

498
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,080
there were people guarding the house

499
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,080
after it was dark.

500
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,080
Who went out after it was dark?

501
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,080
I don't know how you disguised yourself,

502
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,080
but it must be you.

503
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,080
Mother told me that

504
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,080
one can change anything.

505
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,080
Only the way to walk can't be changed.

506
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,080
Your left side is badly damaged.

507
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,080
What's strange is

508
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,080
your right foot is used to using the inner side.

509
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,080
As for your right foot,

510
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,080
it's badly damaged.

511
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,080
If I'm not wrong,

512
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,080
the outside of your right foot

513
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,080
is the part of the ankle

514
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,080
that has been injured.

515
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,080
He's so smart.

516
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,080
He was injured two years ago.

517
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,080
I took care of him.

518
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,080
Yes.

519
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,080
I was injured.

520
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,080
I'm not lying.

521
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,080
But...

522
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,080
You might have been hurt.

523
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,080
I was hurt.

524
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,080
I was hurt.

525
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,080
Your Highness,

526
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,080
it's possible that

527
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,080
Lady Jiang

528
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,080
framed me

529
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,080
after she saw my shoe.

530
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,080
It was just raining a few days ago.

531
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,080
The mirror you took me to

532
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,080
is still a little muddy.

533
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,080
You can check it now.

534
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,080
Maybe the footprint is still there.

535
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,080
You'll know when you compare it.

536
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,080
Take it down.

537
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,080
I'll check it myself.

538
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,080
Your Highness,

539
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,080
she's dead.

540
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,080
Your Highness,

541
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,080
she's dead.

542
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,080
There's a footprint there.

543
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,080
Why didn't you say so earlier?

544
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,080
I did that to her.

545
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,080
If this person is innocent,

546
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,720
Now he has committed suicide for his crime.

547
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,920
Can you prove his innocence?

548
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,640
Yes.

549
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,920
But can you tell me

550
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,480
why you still want to go to the study

551
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,040
when you think he is suspicious and keeps a secret?

552
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,840
Why do you still want to listen to him?

553
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,280
I suddenly received a message from the Prime Minister.

554
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,120
I was confused

555
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,520
because I didn't know what to do.

556
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,120
Thank you, Your Highness.

557
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,720
The eunuch was always angry.

558
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,720
And the painting is so important.

559
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,280
He threatened to

560
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,760
just put Princess Nangu in the study.

561
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,960
Since my mother passed away,

562
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,600
I've seen too many people with evil intentions.

563
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,880
There are people who want to harm me,

564
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,080
and people who want to torture me.

565
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,640
And there are people who want to kill me.

566
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,600
Yesterday, in the study,

567
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,560
he seemed to have found out that I had been in the dark.

568
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,760
We can't be careless

569
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,400
about Shen Zaiye.

570
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,840
Do you need me to prepare something in advance?

571
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,360
The matter has not been revealed yet.

572
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,600
Tai Chi people are worried about the sky.

573
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,080
They only know how to paint and bury their worries.

574
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,120
Just be careful these days.

575
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,400
Okay. I'll listen to you.

576
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,000
Why did you come to me this morning?

577
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,800
I know you have good tea here.

578
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,240
So I came to ask for a cup of tea.

579
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,200
Did you sleep well last night?

580
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,520
No wind or rain.

581
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,960
I slept well last night.

582
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,840
Last night, there was a noise in the mansion.

583
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,080
You still could sleep soundly

584
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,520
and rest in peace.

585
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,680
I really admire you.

586
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,920
What happened last night?

587
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,960
A bold and timid servant

588
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,560
invited Madam Jiang to the study.

589
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,600
I don't know what the purpose was.

590
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,520
This person's name is Meng Ping.

591
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,320
He is a servant in the door.

592
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,320
Do you remember him?

593
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,520
He is usually timid and timid.

594
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,960
He has always been honest.

595
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,640
How could he do such a thing?

596
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,360
It's just the people behind the scenes.

597
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,880
I've checked the strategy.

598
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,400
If we find him,

599
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,480
how should we punish him?

600
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,400
You really asked me.

601
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,760
Although I'm in charge of the central government,

602
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,760
I don't know how to handle it properly.

603
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,960
I know.

604
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,400
There are people who are suspicious.

605
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,880
We should punish them.

606
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,400
After so many years,

607
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,520
you still can only drink

608
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,400
the old ginseng that you want to send again.

609
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,000
Madam.

610
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,240
Ye Tang,

611
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,080
you are suspicious of me.

612
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,920
Send that painting out as soon as possible.

613
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,840
You will be punished for your misdeed.

614
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,320
Yes.

615
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,160
Keep an eye on Meng Zhenzhen.

616
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,720
We will report every move.

617
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,520
What about the peach blossoms?

618
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,160
Your Highness,

619
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,640
Suyang card is a green card.

620
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,880
There are fried eggs,

621
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,600
fried sweet potato, fried sweet potato,

622
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,800
and fried meat.

623
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,600
Your Highness, let's eat.

624
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,960
Go get the silver needle.

625
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,320
Don't bother.

626
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,520
A few days ago,

627
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,760
Madam Jiang was shocked.

628
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,160
To make up for it,

629
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,760
she specially learned these Northeastern cuisine

630
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,720
to make up for Madam Jiang's pain.

631
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:47,840
Meng Xiang is kind and loving.

632
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,240
The peach blossoms are beautiful.

633
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:50,300
Every minute is worth a try.

634
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,160
I'm worried that you have anermanic visa.

635
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,120
If you want to kill the peach blossom,

636
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,280
you have many ways.

637
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,920
Why bother to risk your life?

638
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,520
I know some of them.

639
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,320
But I'm curious.

640
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,560
The noble ladies in the imperial capital

641
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,040
are usually used to making friends.

642
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,960
You're the princess of the North Court.

643
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,600
How can you be so secretive?

644
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,080
I'm the princess of the North Court.

645
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,400
I'm always watched by others.

646
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,360
So I have to be more vigilant

647
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,040
in everything.

648
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,680
What do you think?

649
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,800
But since you're married into the Prime Minister's Mansion,

650
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,960
you don't have to be so vigilant in the future.

651
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,640
These dishes are a reward for your contribution to Meng Ping.

652
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,920
Tomorrow, the crown prince will have a banquet in the Luye Garden.

653
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,200
You can go with me.

654
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,920
The crown prince's banquet is a ritual.

655
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,560
Madam should accompany you.

656
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,160
Didn't you say that

657
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,600
you're the princess.

658
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,200
You're more considerate and thoughtful

659
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,680
when you behave.

660
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:12,960
Besides,

661
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,200
I'm more relieved

662
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,720
when you're thoughtful.

663
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,520
Don't mind it.

664
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,000
Just get ready.

665
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,040
Your Highness,

666
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,920
the prime minister just showed his conscience today.

667
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,520
He's even a good talker.

668
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,840
There's always a demon in the world.

669
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,000
Tomorrow, the crown prince will have a banquet.

670
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,400
We must be careful.

671
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,200
Tomorrow's news.

672
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,000
Then how's your preparation for tomorrow's news?

673
00:38:59,160 --> 00:38:59,960
Premier,

674
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,120
as your Wife,

675
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:04,240
Lady Nian is a Northland princess,

676
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,720
and she hasn't been married for seven days.

677
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,160
If anything bad happens,

678
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,840
how should You Majesty tell the Oirat500?

679
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,120
It's the crown prince's move.

680
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,320
Why should I explain?

681
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:16,800
Got it?

682
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:45,840
The flowers bloom, but you don't know

683
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,840
The beauty of the flowers can't be missed

684
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,840
The flowers fall, the north wind blows

685
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,840
The city is in a state of panic

686
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,840
The petals are wet with the rain

687
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:03,840
The heart is broken, but the seed is still there

688
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:07,840
The flowers fall, the tears are all over the heart

689
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:12,840
There is nowhere to go

690
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:24,840
The wish is struggling in the mud

691
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:31,840
Regret is in despair

692
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:36,920
The sea is full of flowers under the

693
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,840
flowers in the arms

694
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:43,840
Even if I have to give up my life

695
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:48,840
I will sing with the clouds

696
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,840
Who lost the heart of the flower

697
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,840
Love and hate can only be a branch

698
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:12,840
The flower withered, the heart was broken

699
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:18,840
No more notice

700
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:29,840
Waiting for the sea to be crazy like him

701
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:36,840
Not afraid of being surprised by the world

702
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:45,840
Listen to what he said

703
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:55,840
It turns out that he has the answer of his heart
