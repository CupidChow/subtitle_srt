00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Episode 18

3
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Be careful.

4
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Be careful.

5
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Put this over there.

6
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yes.

7
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Put three tables over there.

8
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
That table is...

9
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's a little bit...

10
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Wang Xi.

11
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Wang Xi.

12
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Your Highness.

13
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Go and prepare some food.

14
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The students are coming.

15
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Especially those poor students.

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
They might be hungry.

17
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm preparing a pot of spring water.

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Get the food yourself.

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
If you're thirsty, you can get the bottle.

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
That's more convenient.

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Go and prepare.

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Okay.

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'll go and prepare now.

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Come with me.

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Prepare more food for the students.

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You go.

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Do as planned.

28
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Don't stop me.

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Brother Hu, think again.

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I said don't stop me.

31
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm not in hell.

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm not in hell.

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Brother Hu, think about your parents.

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I can't hide this from them

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
just because I think of them.

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Brother Li, if you stop me again,

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
you'll blame me for not respecting our friendship for many years.

38
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What are you two doing?

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Why are you shouting in the park?

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You two don't usually go to school.

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Now it's just a storm.

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You're afraid you can't get into the exam.

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You just want to turn the water over

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
and drag someone else down.

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
What did you say?

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What's going on in the park?

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Go.

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Go.

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Brother.

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Fourth Prince.

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You two had a fight because of the river.

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
There's been some rumors lately.

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
They say that the second prince sold the exam.

54
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But they're all innocent.

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's not easy to open a science show.

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm afraid we can't let them destroy it.

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Then you can prepare yourself.

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'll handle these things.

59
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Is the little lady drunk?

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Drink more.

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Someone hasn't come yet.

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Don't worry.

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
As long as these dishes are not to your taste,

64
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'll spend them on you.

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
What I have now is money.

66
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You're really lucky.

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Second Brother.

68
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Your Highness.

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Fourth Brother.

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What can I do for you?

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You two can hide for a while.

72
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Why should we hide?

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I have nothing to hide.

74
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Besides,

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I have Wen Xiang and Ruan Yu.

76
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I can bear your bad smell.

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You two can leave first.

80
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I have something to talk to Fourth Brother.

81
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You sold the exam.

82
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Do you know what you did?

83
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Mu Wu Xia.

84
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
What are you?

85
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
How dare you talk back to me?

86
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Someone publicly provoked the science show.

87
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I have to go.

88
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Next.

89
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Sir.

90
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm Li Dian.

91
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm from Kuian.

92
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I have nothing to say.

93
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,120
Where is the

94
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,000
recording of the order of the Suoxia?

95
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Next.

96
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Next.

97
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Monitor.

98
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You're here to see me?

99
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm here to see you.

100
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm here to see you.

101
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm here to see you.

102
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Monitor.

103
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I can't read the words.

104
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm not going to talk.

105
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You can go.

106
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Sir.

107
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I was robbed on the way.

108
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I was robbed.

109
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I tried my best

110
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
to get the recording.

111
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
That's why I only have the recording.

112
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Sir.

113
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm not afraid of you laughing.

114
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I came here for food.

115
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I don't care if you're a guest.

116
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I only care about the record.

117
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
A good record.

118
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Understand?

119
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's been twenty years.

120
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I finally have to wait for the science show.

121
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You're so kind to me.

122
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
If you don't mind,

123
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
how can I go back to my hometown?

124
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's none of my business.

125
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm just a layman.

126
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I dare not call myself a gentleman.

127
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Please make yourself at home.

128
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Sir.

129
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Don't waste your time.

130
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Sir, look.

131
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Next.

132
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
This is the real record.

133
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Next.

134
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Sir.

135
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Please tell me.

136
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
What did Lao Zi say?

137
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Heaven and earth are inhuman.

138
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Everything is a dog.

139
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
How should we interpret it?

140
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
This is from the Tao Te Ching.

141
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's called the fifth chapter of Tao Te Ching.

142
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It means that

143
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
everything in the world

144
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
has its own rules and rules.

145
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
The sky is not biased, the earth is not monotonous.

146
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
The human is free to grow.

147
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Although this is a heartless story,

148
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
it's a story of misinterpretation and change.

149
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's a story of misinterpretation and change.

150
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Tao Te Ching

151
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
is a place where misinterpretation and change are real.

152
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Tao is natural.

153
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's not interfered with.

154
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Good.

155
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Brother, you're too kind.

156
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's just that the village is poor.

157
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's not a big deal.

158
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's not a reference now.

159
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Who said you're not a reference?

160
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But my note...

161
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
This time, the imperial examination

162
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
is for talents,

163
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
not this note.

164
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Wang Xi.

165
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Yes.

166
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Guards, take him away.

167
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Come.

168
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Hurry up and write down

169
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Li Dian's name.

170
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Yes, Fourth Prince.

171
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You're not admitted to the imperial examination.

172
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I can't stand you

173
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
for being a monk.

174
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Fourth Prince.

175
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
If I don't get into the exam

176
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
as others do,

177
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'll definitely come back to take the exam.

178
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm sure of your decision.

179
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You...

180
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Then it's settled.

181
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
If you have real talent and knowledge,

182
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I, Mu Wu Xia,

183
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
am willing to be your teacher.

184
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I hope that after you enter the world,

185
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
you can be upright and loyal,

186
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
and care for the world,

187
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
and help our country to be prosperous and prosperous.

188
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'll be very grateful.

189
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Fourth Prince.

190
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
If I get into the exam,

191
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'll definitely come back to take the exam.

192
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I won't ruin your heart of cultivation.

193
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
We won't be afraid.

194
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
The imperial guards are here.

195
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Move.

196
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Fourth Prince.

197
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Why are the imperial guards here?

198
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
We're here on His Majesty's orders.

199
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Please return to your residence and take a look.

200
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Father.

201
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Your Highness.

202
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Last night, Second Prince was killed.

203
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Someone reported that it was you.

204
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You're here to die?

205
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Please don't be so sad.

206
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Your Highness,

207
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I was just thinking about you.

208
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm sorry.

209
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I really didn't want to see you like that.

210
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I was wrong.

211
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm sorry.

212
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm sorry.

213
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Your Highness,

214
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm sorry.

215
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm sorry.

216
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm sorry.

217
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Your Highness.

218
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Your Highness,

219
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm sorry.

220
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm sorry.

221
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,400
Which eye of yours saw the Fourth Prince kill her?

222
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,400
This matter needs to be investigated

223
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,200
Your Majesty

224
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,880
All the witnesses have admitted

225
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,000
that the Fourth Prince was fighting with the Second Prince

226
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,160
Then the Second Prince was found dead in the Ninth Building

227
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,920
Please punish the Fourth Prince for the Second Prince's wrongdoing

228
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,200
Your Majesty, please

229
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,760
Your Majesty, please give the order

230
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,480
to punish the real murderer

231
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,720
I have already lost a son

232
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,160
Do you still want me to kill another son?

233
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,160
Get out

234
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,480
Otherwise

235
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,800
I'll take your lives

236
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,160
Your Majesty.

237
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,160
Your Majesty.

238
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,160
Go and get the elixir for me.

239
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,160
Get the elixir.

240
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,160
Yes.

241
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,160
Wu Hen.

242
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,160
Wu Hen.

243
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,160
Wu Hen.

244
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,160
Your Majesty.

245
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,160
Your Majesty.

246
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,480
Although he's brought Goodnight back,

247
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,240
there's nothing going on anymore.

248
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,200
I'm glad to be back.

249
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,440
However,

250
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,000
though there are no 수�onis

251
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,280
he's necessarily my son.

252
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,360
to marry me.

253
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,280
How could it be?

254
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:00,720
My Lord,

255
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,040
you still have me.

256
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,640
It's lucky that I have you.

257
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,680
My Lord,

258
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,320
Premier Zuo wants to see you.

259
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,440
I don't want to see you.

260
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,400
My Lord,

261
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,560
Premier Zuo is in the heart of the disaster.

262
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,720
Why don't you want to see him?

263
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,360
He must be here for nothing.

264
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,040
My dear,

265
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,040
I'm a miserable man.

266
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,760
I must be strict.

267
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,440
Or the atmosphere will be ruined.

268
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:51,920
Call him in.

269
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,240
You go first.

270
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,760
I'll leave you alone.

271
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,900
Go to see the bastard.

272
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,400
I won't wait any longer.

273
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,560
Bring my octagons.

274
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,360
My Lord.

275
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,680
You may leave.

276
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,040
Summon the Prime Minister.

277
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,200
Greetings, Your Majesty.

278
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,120
Do you know the state of Zhao is in danger?

279
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,000
I'm dumbfounded.

280
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,480
The state of Zhao is the strongest

281
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,880
in the five states' chaos.

282
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,920
But they are both in a state of chaos.

283
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,840
The state has no power.

284
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,320
So they are divided into other states.

285
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,480
It's really terrible to be in a state of chaos.

286
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,760
But according to my understanding of the Fourth Prince,

287
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,680
he will never do such a thing.

288
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,000
You have so many witnesses.

289
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,880
Do you still want to be the only one to guarantee

290
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,640
that the person who played the role of a tiger

291
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,600
has killed countless people in my life?

292
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,440
I dare not.

293
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,160
But there are many doubts about this matter.

294
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,440
Can I interrogate the Fourth Prince in person?

295
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,960
I have ordered

296
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,400
that no one is allowed to enter the mansion

297
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,200
and meet with him.

298
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,320
Can I participate in the investigation?

299
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,360
If you want to, you can do it.

300
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,400
The situation is critical now.

301
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,320
The third prince is also ordered to do so temporarily.

302
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,920
You should help him first.

303
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,760
The third prince?

304
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,720
I have ordered him to be the examiner.

305
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,360
Meng Zhongyan will be the official.

306
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,840
I also order him to be the examiner

307
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,840
and help Wu Yin to make a joint effort.

308
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,480
You can leave now.

309
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,160
Yes, Your Majesty.

310
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,440
It's hard to find out the truth

311
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,280
before we see the Fourth Prince.

312
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,840
No matter how hard it is,

313
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,240
the murderer can't be the Fourth Prince.

314
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,520
Why don't we go to the scene now

315
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,800
and see if we can find any clues?

316
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,640
No.

317
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,520
The Imperial Guards have intervened in this matter.

318
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,320
It's very strict to watch the day.

319
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,880
We will find out tonight.

320
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,320
Send out the message to the outside world

321
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,400
and tell them that I should be busy with the imperial examination

322
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,360
and not to see the guests.

323
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,000
This matter must be found out before the examination begins.

324
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:37,840
Otherwise,

325
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,200
everything we do

326
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,720
will be exposed to the east.

327
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,520
I understand. I'll go now.

328
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,080
Miss.

329
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,960
Miss sorting him out.

330
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,240
Nope.

331
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,440
Search it.

332
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,400
Why did he go back to the Spring Moon House and leave?

333
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,760
His Highness died that night.

334
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,080
Miss.

335
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,920
You should have heard it.

336
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,200
That night, the Fourth Prince rushed to the Jue Lou.

337
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,600
He had a big fight with the Second Prince.

338
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,880
He was impulsive.

339
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,600
He killed the Second Prince by accident.

340
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,240
Could it be that the gentleman was violent and killed the person?

341
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,680
What are you hiding?

342
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,640
Nothing.

343
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,240
Miss.

344
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,920
I find you can't tell the truth.

345
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,520
Why?

346
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,560
Do what?

347
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,760
Why?

348
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,280
Let's get into troubles.

349
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,680
How did you have such a thing?

350
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,760
You are merpleck the Meng family by death.

351
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,400
It is just a normal woman,

352
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I will do it.

353
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,560
Congratulations, Your Highness.

354
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,560
Rong Sheng is the master of the exam.

355
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:59,120
Congratulations to Prime Minister Meng for taking the post.

356
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,120
Meng family is the head of the family again.

357
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,120
Please sit.

358
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You know I like quietness.

359
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I have to thank you for this exam.

360
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Since you are the head of the family,

361
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I hope you can take care of me.

362
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Heaven does not take, but it is taken.

363
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
If you do not win, you will be taken.

364
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
My brother and I have a deep relationship.

365
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Although he is my brother,

366
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
he is a heartbroken lunatic.

367
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I will not allow anyone to help him.

368
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
As for that heartless and despicable chess piece,

369
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
how should I deal with it?

370
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I should not say more.

371
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Your Highness, there is one more thing I am a little worried about.

372
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Tell me.

373
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
According to the news I got from the meeting,

374
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
the examination was not done by the Fourth Prince.

375
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
It was Shen Zaiye who did it.

376
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I still doubt that Li Jauhan's case is related to him.

377
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:49,000
So I always feel that Shen Zaiye has something to do with the Fourth Prince.

378
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You are right.

379
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
But you do not need to worry about it.

380
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I will arrange a spy to be with him.

381
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
A spy?

382
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
To be with Shen Zaiye?

383
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
You do not know that

384
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
the peach blossom is in my house now.

385
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Princess Chengping is in your house?

386
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
As you expected, Shen Zaiye came and saved the person.

387
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
The peach blossom, I knew you would not die so easily.

388
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
What else do you want?

389
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
But why does the peach blossom stay in the Third Prince's house?

390
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
He fell off the cliff and hurt his head.

391
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
He was not clear about it.

392
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
He still does not remember the past.

393
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Now he is listening to me.

394
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
You want to see Shen Zaiye?

395
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
You want to see him?

396
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
You want to see him?

397
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I want to see him.

398
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Okay, I will ask him.

399
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Your Highness.

400
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,280
I'll do as you say

401
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,560
You've been resting for a long time

402
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,000
Do you want to go out

403
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,840
and do some activities?

404
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,360
Recently, there's a big event in the court

405
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,240
My fourth brother

406
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,680
killed my second brother

407
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,200
There are evidence and evidence

408
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,280
and it's hard to prove it

409
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,280
But Shen Zai must not do that

410
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,480
He's a spy

411
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,560
I want to know how he'll do it

412
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,880
So I'm sorry for you

413
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,520
Find a chance to approach him

414
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,680
If there's any problem

415
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,240
you must report to me

416
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,160
Fourth Prince is not a brother

417
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,160
But why are you sure

418
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,360
Shen Zai will also mention the case?

419
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,280
What?

420
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,640
You can't do it?

421
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,360
No

422
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,720
I'm just thinking

423
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,240
I haven't seen him for months

424
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,240
How to approach him

425
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,720
and not let him suspect

426
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,480
Shen Zai's sister, Xiang Qingying

427
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,240
is simple

428
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,360
and she's close to my fourth brother

429
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,680
I think

430
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,960
maybe she's a breakthrough

431
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,920
Thank you for your advice

432
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,380
Here

433
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,880
If you do something right

434
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,920
I'll follow you

435
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,440
Thank you

436
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,480
Wait, kicked out

437
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,720
Wang Sheng

438
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,760
Their letters

439
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,960
You cried?

440
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,120
Cheng Dao Wan.

441
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,760
You don't know.

442
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,280
Mu Wu Xia was wronged to kill Second Prince.

443
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,520
Now he's locked in the mansion.

444
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,320
The relationship is over.

445
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,520
Fourth Prince?

446
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,480
You know Fourth Prince?

447
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,480
Not only me.

448
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,040
You know him too.

449
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,520
But you don't remember.

450
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,640
Mu Wu Xia helped you a lot.

451
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,240
After you were beaten,

452
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,560
she went to my brother's mansion.

453
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,160
I heard that Fourth Prince was righteous.

454
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,800
It seems true.

455
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,400
Since I've been favored by Fourth Prince,

456
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,840
I can't just sit around.

457
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,560
I'll go with you wherever you want.

458
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,720
Jiang Dao Wan.

459
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,800
I didn't expect you to be so righteous.

460
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,800
I'm going to see him.

461
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,400
Where?

462
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,800
My brother said that he was going to tell me.

463
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,240
No one can see Mu Wu Xia.

464
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:35,440
But no one can stop me.

465
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,760
Qingying.

466
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,280
Now you're locked in the mansion.

467
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,280
It'll only bring more trouble to him.

468
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,320
How about this?

469
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,320
Let's go to the crime scene first.

470
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,560
Maybe we can find some useful evidence.

471
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,600
The most important thing now is to prove that Fourth Prince is innocent.

472
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,320
That makes sense.

473
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:53,760
Let's go.

474
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,920
I know where the crime scene is.

475
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,720
Let's go.

476
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:14,920
Who's there?

477
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,920
Why are they here?

478
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,320
Why are you so quiet?

479
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,320
Go and check it out.

480
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,120
Yes.

481
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:30,720
Let's go.

482
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,920
Let's go to the back door.

483
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,320
Stop.

484
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,600
Brother.

485
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,320
When did you follow us?

486
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,720
When did you come?

487
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,720
Brother, say something.

488
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,920
I told you to stay in the mansion.

489
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,720
Don't interfere with the Fourth Prince's business.

490
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,720
Mu Wu Xia is still locked in.

491
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,520
How can I sit still?

492
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,920
What's going on with you two?

493
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,720
I sneaked out of the mansion and didn't go far.

494
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,520
I met him looking for Qingtai.

495
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,120
I saw him looking for Qingtai.

496
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,120
He's not here.

497
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,120
He's not here.

498
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,720
I don't know what's going on with him.

499
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,120
I don't know what's going on with him.

500
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,120
I don't know what's going on with him.

501
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,120
I don't know what's going on with him.

502
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,320
I don't know what's going on with him.

503
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,320
Brother, you have to help me.

504
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,120
I can't back off from the crime scene.

505
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,120
Besides, we're here to find evidence.

506
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,520
We can prove Mu Wu Xia is innocent.

507
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,720
There will be no trouble.

508
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,520
The princess knows that it's a fake.

509
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,320
Do you just let it go?

510
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,120
Then you have to wait for me.

511
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,120
I'll go with you.

512
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:17,920
Miss Mu Er.

513
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,320
Greetings, Prime Minister Shen.

514
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,320
Long time no see.

515
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,320
Miss Mu Er.

516
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,120
Do you remember anything?

517
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,920
Why do you say that?

518
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,520
You...

519
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,920
You remember the Fourth Prince?

520
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,120
Qingying told me that

521
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,720
the Fourth Prince helped me many times.

522
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,320
I have to repay him.

523
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,720
I just heard that

524
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,520
you helped me.

525
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,520
Are you investigating me?

526
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,520
Of course not.

527
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,320
Then I don't need to explain anything.

528
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,720
Go back.

529
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,720
You shouldn't get involved in this.

530
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,720
I know what I'm doing.

531
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,320
You don't need to tell me

532
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,920
what to do and what not to do.

533
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,720
We're not in a hurry.

534
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,920
It's fine to say more.

535
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,520
Okay.

536
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,120
Since that's the case,

537
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,520
I'll go first.

538
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,920
Where's my brother?

539
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,720
Prime Minister Shen left first.

540
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,920
We're on separate ways.

541
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,320
Did you two fight?

542
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,920
Qingying.

543
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,920
No matter what happened between me and Prime Minister Shen,

544
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,320
now that the time has come,

545
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,720
we're just strangers.

546
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,320
How did you two become like this?

547
00:30:58,920 --> 00:30:59,920
Let's go.

548
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,320
I'll go with you.

549
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,720
I'll go with you.

550
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,120
I'll go with you.

551
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,120
I'll go with you.

552
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,120
I'll go with you.

553
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,120
I'll go with you.

554
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,120
I'll go with you.

555
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,120
I'll go with you.

556
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,120
I'll go with you.

557
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,120
I'll go with you.

558
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,120
I'll go with you.

559
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,120
Let's go.

560
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,920
I think Second Prince had such many poisons

561
00:31:45,520 --> 00:32:11,120
because of the hat

562
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,120
he's definitely not our opponent.

563
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,280
Fifth Brother must be inside.

564
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,080
Let's go in.

565
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:27,720

Fifth Shek Chen,

00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,720
Deng Chao is there.

570
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,120
Is this where Second Prince was killed?

He's Team warden.

572
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,400
Teacher is symphonic and Formless.

00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,040
It's impossible to practicing to kill him.

574
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,520
There is a large bloodstain on his face.

575
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,760
But there is no sign of fighting.

576
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,920
Second Prince must have been poisoned

577
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,560
without any protection.

Your Highness, I followed Shen Zaiye to the crime scene.

592
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,800
I also found a jade.

593
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,720
A jade? What jade?

594
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,920

The sword in the city is as yellow as a thorn.

606
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:18,120
The petals fall into the heart of the jade.

607
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:22,120
My heart is broken and I'm broken.

608
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:25,120
The tears fall and my heart is torn.

609
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:31,120
There's nowhere to go.

I hope that I can grow up in your eyes.

612
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:50,120
Regret is in despair.

613
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:58,120
I still hope that the flowers in his arms will bloom.

614
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:10,120
Even if I have to give up my life for the song.

615
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:23,120
Who loses the heart of a flower?

616
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:27,120
Love and hate can only be eaten.

617
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:31,120
The flower withers and the heart is broken.

618
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:37,120
There's no need to tell.

619
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:49,120
How can I still be crazy about him?

620
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:56,120
I'm not afraid of being oppressed by the five realms.

621
00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:03,120
I'm still holding on to the words he said.

622
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:15,120
It turns out that he has the answer to his heart.
