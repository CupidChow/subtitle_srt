(Adapted from the novel "Peach Blossoms
Reflecting the River and Mountains")

16
00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:40,980
(by Bai Lu Cheng Shuang)

17
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,900
=Episode 18=

18
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,820
(Qinfang Tea House)

19
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,640
Wait.

20
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:16,880
What?

21
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,200
Jiang Taohua,

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,080
you keep making excuses
and refusing to act.

23
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,280
Yet,

24
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,600
you dare to stop me
when I take matters into my own hands?

25
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,040
I dare not.

26
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,160
There are too many eyes here.

27
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,760
If you act here,

28
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,880
Shen Zaiye will trace it back
to Lan Boutique.

29
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,280
If Lan Boutique falls,

30
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,160
all of Her Highness's years

31
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,280
of careful planning in Qi

32
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,560
will be ruined.

33
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,120
It's hardly worth paying

34
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,000
such a heavy price

35
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,520
for one Prince Wuxia.

36
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,160
I suppose

37
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,720
you have another idea?

38
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,120
That day in the Imperial Library,

39
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,480
this incense was only lit for a moment

40
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,280
before Shen Zaiye's appearance forced us

41
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,680
to extinguish it.

42
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,200
Why not

43
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,320
continue to use it?

44
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,960
As long as we light it,

45
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,000
before a single stick burns out,

46
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,600
Prince Wuxia

47
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,320
will be dead.

48
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,520
Rest assured.

49
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,680
It was only lit for a moment.

50
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,600
That will not affect its potency.

51
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,120
It had better be that way.

52
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,520
You always have your little tricks.

53
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,080
I will stand outside the door myself

54
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,240
until this incense finishes burning.

55
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,240
Chancellor, Wang Xi just reported.

56
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,080
Prince Wuxia went out of the residence

57
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,520
at Princess Chengping's invitation

58
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,560
and suddenly disappeared.

59
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,720
It happened all too suddenly. He fears...

60
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,160
Where's Princess Chengping?

61
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,280
She also left the residence
and headed to a tea house.

62
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,320
Yang Wanqing is there too.

63
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,600
Chancellor, our people are ready.

64
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,040
But Princess Chengping promised
she would not harm Prince Wuxia.

65
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,600
We worried there was a misunderstanding,

66
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,600
so we did not act rashly.

67
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,040
Do you think it's a misunderstanding?

68
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,720
We'll know once we get there.

69
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,360
Enough time has passed.

70
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,160
The poison in there is enough

71
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,080
to kill Prince Wuxia.

72
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,320
Now you can rest easy.

73
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,840
You did not disappoint
Her Highness this time.

74
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,280
Rest assured.

75
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,280
I will report this to Her Highness
and recommend a reward for you.

76
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,240
I failed last time.

77
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,480
This is merely my atonement.

78
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,680
I dare not expect a reward.

79
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,800
Her Highness is always strict

80
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,600
with rewards and punishments.

81
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,440
If you do it right,
you should be rewarded.

82
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,040
But if tomorrow

83
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,200
I don't hear news of Mu Wuxia's death,

84
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,200
then you must have played tricks again.

85
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,520
I will report it to Her Highness.

86
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,920
I assume you're perfectly aware
of what will happen

87
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,800
to you and Prince Changjue then.

88
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,680
Of course.

89
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,680
Hup!

90
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,600
Hup!

91
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:15,680
Prince Wuxia!

92
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,400
Prince Wuxia! Prince Wuxia!

93
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,280
Wake up!

94
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,000
Prince Wuxia!

95
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,720
Add more flour, Your Highness.

96
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,320
Otherwise the poison will be too strong.

97
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,200
No.

98
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,920
Yang Wanqing is cautious.

99
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:34,920
She'll notice

100
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,080
if there's too much flour.

101
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,160
We must be clever

102
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,920
if we want to fool her.

103
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,360
Thank goodness, he's still alive.

104
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,660
(Xie)

105
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,110
(Why is the handkerchief
from Shen Zaiye's hidden compartment)

106
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,040
(on Prince Wuxia?)

107
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,840
My cousin

108
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,520
was a genius.

109
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,640
He's someone I spent my life chasing.

110
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,800
Where he is now?

111
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,920
He has long been gone.

112
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,640
(Could it be)

113
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,360
(that Shen Zaiye is the cousin)

114
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,840
(Prince Wuxia keeps talking about?)

115
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:11,920
Your Highness!

116
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,680
Jiang Taohua.

117
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,240
What are you doing?

118
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,440
Saving a life.

119
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,520
Your Highness! Your Highness!

120
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,280
Chancellor, it's Soulsever Incense.

121
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,280
Take Prince Wuxia back for treatment.

122
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:30,720
Yes, sir.

123
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:32,800
Here.

124
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,120
When has Soulsever Incense

125
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,120
ever been used to save anyone?

126
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,160
If you already think

127
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,440
I tried to kill him,

128
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,640
why waste words?

129
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,680
Take her away!

130
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,160
Jiang Taohua,

131
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,200
you said you wouldn't harm Prince Wuxia.

132
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,480
Tell me who is behind this

133
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,440
and what happened today,

134
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,000
and I will let you go.

135
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,120
I said I was saving him,

136
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,890
and you threw me
into the interrogation room.

137
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,280
Is this how you show trust?

138
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,480
Soulsever Incense claims the soul
with a breath.

139
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,280
Prince Wuxia lies unconscious.

140
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,080
He has a knife wound on his neck.

141
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,280
You stood nearby with a blade.

142
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,840
Tell me how I am supposed to trust you.

143
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,920
If that is how it is,

144
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,240
even if I told you who was behind it,

145
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,440
would you not think

146
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,480
I was making it up

147
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,640
to save myself?

148
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,640
You overestimate yourself

149
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,680
and underestimate me.

150
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,680
I'll ask you one last time.

151
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:00,920
Who is

152
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,880
behind this?

153
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,280
No one ordered me.

154
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,440
Jiang Taohua.

155
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,000
You should think carefully
before you answer.

156
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,960
I have thought carefully.

157
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,680
You and I will never

158
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,600
truly trust each other in this life.

159
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,120
So

160
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,760
we might as well speak plainly.

161
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,520
If you want to torture me,

162
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,640
go ahead.

163
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,120
You think I won't?

164
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,000
Why?

165
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,920
Why Prince Wuxia?

166
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,360
You know how well he treated you.

167
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,000
Is your heart made of stone?

168
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,600
You should know by now.

169
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,400
Someone like me

170
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,200
will say anything

171
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,240
to survive.

172
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,640
I will kill anyone to live.

173
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,560
How ruthless you are.

174
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,920
I suppose if you die

175
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,800
by my hand today,

176
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,080
you will have no complaints.

177
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:25,840
Of course.

178
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,800
Throwing oneself into the fray

179
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,560
and losing one's life

180
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,360
is nothing unusual.

181
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,760
Did you not

182
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,520
also gamble your life

183
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,600
at the hunting grounds?

184
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,880
That arrow was suspicious.

185
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,080
And the medicine to stop the bleeding
came so quickly.

186
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,240
If you had not prepared in advance,

187
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,320
how could it have arrived in time?

188
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,520
Just because
I held a piece of porcelain to my chest,

189
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,560
you thought I was sacrificing myself
to protect you.

190
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,600
Shows how little

191
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,760

in your life.

196
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,920
I'm far less ruthless

197
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,040
than you.

Chancellor.

208
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,520
How is Prince Wuxia?

209
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,720
The imperial physician says
he did not inhale much poison.

210
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,800
He will wake in a few days.

211
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,420
Exactly how many

212
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,680
depends on His Highness's body.

213
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,880
Spread the word that tomorrow

214
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,960
Prince Wuxia will go to Yugui Mountain.

215
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,000
You want to draw out the snake
from its hole?

216
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,800
Better to end the threat now

217
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,160
than to spend a lifetime on guard.

218
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,760
Tomorrow, lead our men yourself
to lay the trap.

219
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:45,920
Understood.

220
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,080
Chancellor.

221
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,440
She refused to speak.

222
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,960
We had no choice but to use the whip.

223
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,560
Cease this!

224
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,280
- Chancellor.
- Chancellor.

225
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,120
Take her back to Zhengchun Boudoir.

226
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,120
I'll interrogate her myself.

227
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,780
(Shen Residence)

228
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,280
Your Highness!

229
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,920
I'll get you some medicine.

230
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,440
That won't be necessary.

231
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,400
I've already treated myself.

232
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,520
He did this to you.

233
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,960
I'll kill him!

234
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,680
Qingtai.

235
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,680
If you lose,

236
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,120
you should accept the consequences.

237
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,920
Can't we please stop this?

238
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,280
I don't want to see you get hurt again.

239
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,440
Now's not the time for tears.

240
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,120
We have more important things to do.

241
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,120
How is Prince Wuxia?

242
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,040
You did not come back,

243
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,520
so I went to check on things.

244
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,880
Prince Wuxia is fine.

245
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,760
Tomorrow, he will go to Yugui Mountain.

246
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,520
Impossible.

247
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,640
Even though I switched the incense,

248
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,400
he should be sleeping
for at least a day and a night.

249
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,600
Shen Zaiye must have
spread false information

250
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,640
to lure us out.

251
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,600
This could be an opportunity.

252
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,720
I'll use his trick against him.

253
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,560
I must see Yang Wanqing at once.

254
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,000
But if he learns

255
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,680
we went to Yang Wanqing,

256
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,440
he might...

257
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,600
There is no future

258
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,160
to speak of between him and me.

259
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,960
Yugui Mountain's winding paths

260
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,160
are perfect for an ambush.

261
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,200
They won't let this chance slip away.

262
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,720
Rest assured, Chancellor.

263
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,160
Our men are already in position.

264
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,720
Chancellor.

265
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,320
Zhengchun Boudoir sent a letter.

266
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:48,960
Chancellor.

267
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,220
(A Letter of Parting)

268
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:03,580
(From Jiang Taohua)

269
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,560
Chancellor,
the operation is about to begin.

270
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,330
We should avoid
unnecessary complications.

271
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,280
I want to see

272
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,280
what she is up to.

273
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,320
This lip rouge contains a sedative.

274
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,920
Your Highness must use it with care.

275
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,360
I've already been poisoned
by the Jiangtao pill.

276
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,840
This won't affect me.

277
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,720
Go and make the preparations.

278
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,000
He should be arriving soon.

279
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,000
Jiang Taohua.

280
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,400
Is this what you wanted to tell me?

281
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,520
Things have come to this.

282
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,000
If we keep going,

283
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,200
we will only grow to resent each other.

284
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,040
Better to part ways

285
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,520
and each seek happiness.

286
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,480
I invited you tonight

287
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,280
for a final farewell drink.

288
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,000
Finish this cup

289
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,160
and we are done.

290
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,240
Your true identity is unknown.

291
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,240
You tried to harm a prince of Qi

292
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,200
and threaten the state of Qi.

293
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,040
Your list of crimes
is too numerous to list.

294
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,320
Do you think you can just walk away

295
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,480
with a simple divorce?

296
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,760
Never!

297
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,560
It's because I'm already disgraced

298
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,840
that I want a divorce

299
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,480
to keep you safe.

300
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,480
You think you're doing this
to protect me?

301
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,880
Do you remember when we first met?

302
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:37,960
From that moment,

303
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,160
our fate was sealed.

304
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,440
Never close,

305
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,000
yet never free.

306
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,680
I forced

307
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,560
this marriage upon you.

308
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,920
Ending it now

309
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,360
is following the will of Heaven.

310
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,200
Do you regret

311
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,560
marrying me?

312
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,000
I may have lost the game,

313
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,520
but I do not regret my moves.

314
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,520
Do you remember our days

315
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,640
in Tianshui Village?

316
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,320
They were short,

317
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,880
but they were the happiest days

318
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,720
of my life.

319
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,720
If I could,

320
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,240
I'd leave it all behind

321
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,240
for a quiet life.

322
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,520
Farming, weaving,

323
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,520
raising chickens and ducks.

324
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,680
A simple,

325
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,800
peaceful life

326
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,800
would be blissful.

327
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,160
But you've turned my life upside down.

328
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,240
Now you want to leave

329
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,360
and find peace

330
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,520
somewhere else?

331
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,800
Remember this, Jiang Taohua.

332
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,520
I'm not someone you can just call on
and cast aside.

333
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,320
This marriage

334
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,840
was your choice.

335
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,560
Even if it leads nowhere,

336
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,600
you have to see it through with me.

337
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,800
Living day in and day out
with someone you don't trust

338
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,800
only brings misery and suffering.

339
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,640
Haven't you already learned that

340
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,000

00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,160
Only those who intend

375
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,720
to harm Prince Wuxia will be there.

376
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,320
Understood.

377
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:15,740
(Lan Boutique)

378
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,360
You are bold,

379
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,960
showing up here.

380
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,280
Qing.

381
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,160
Let's talk inside.

382
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,400
Walls have ears.

383
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,520
Mercy!

384
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,560
Yesterday,
it was Shen Zaiye's sudden arrival

385
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,160
that saved Mu Wuxia's life.

386
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,360
You are exceptionally sharp

387
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,640
and resourceful.

388
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,440
I must admit I'm no match for you.

389
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,480
But even fools have their ways.

390
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,680
I'll let the results speak
for themselves.

391
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,320
No matter how harshly

392
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,360
I was tortured yesterday,

393
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,680
I never uttered a single word.

394
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,640
I snuck out and came here

395
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,920
as soon as I could.

396
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,240
I just want to redeem myself.

397
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,200
My brother's and my life

398
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,920
are both in Her Highness's hands.

399
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,080
I dare not betray her.

400
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,160
Mu Wuxia will be going
to Yugui Mountain today.

401
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,600
I request your aid.

402
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:51,440
(Can this situation be resolved)

403
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,000
(if Prince Wuyin is made
to know that I,)

404
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,200
(not Prince Wuxia,)

405
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,520
(was the one)

406
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,600
(who caught him in the act that day?)

407
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,840
There is one more thing

408
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,920
I must confess.

409
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,280
I know

410
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,320
who killed Eunuch Ren.

411
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,080
Nonsense.

412
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,600
I stumbled upon it by accident.

413
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,280
I was so scared

414
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,600
I did not dare admit it.

415
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,160
Then I received the order

416
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,560
to assassinate Mu Wuxia.

417
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,880
I assumed

418
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,200
it is related to Eunuch Ren's death.

419
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,880
I have thought on this for days.

420
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,400
Who Her Highness trusts,

421
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,680
I should be loyal to as well.

422
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,080
I'm willing to devote everything to him.

423
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,240
I did not

424
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,120
intend to disobey.

425
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,320
Please relay my intentions.

426
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,240
Plotting against a prince

427
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,320
is no small matter.

428
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,880
Perhaps it is best to wait

429
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,120
and act cautiously.

430
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,400
Do what you're supposed to do,

431
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,040
and watch your tongue.

432
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:14,800
Princess Chengping.

433
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,320
I know you and Mu Wuxia
are close as siblings,

434
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,280
but Mu Wuxia must die.

435
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:23,920
Otherwise,

436
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,160
it will be Prince Changjue who dies.

437
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,760
I understand.

438
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,320
Forgive me, Your Highness.

439
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,920
I was remiss in my duties.

440
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,440
I shouldn't have trusted her that day.

441
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,720
But if

442
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,840
what Jiang Taohua said just now is true,

443
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,480
should we still kill Mu Wuxia?

444
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,920
If chaos erupts,

445
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,720
will it ruin Her Highness's plans?

446
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,640
Prince Wugou has been deposed.

447
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,840
Only us three remain.

448
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,780
Prince Wuhen has
the Qin family behind him.

449
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,440
We can't touch him for now.

450
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,480
I always thought my fourth brother
kept a low profile

451
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,760
and went unnoticed by everyone.

452
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,760
To think he was so close with Shen Zaiye

453
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,600
all along.

454
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,600
If that's the case,

455
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,160
whether what Jiang Taohua said

456
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,560
is true or false

457
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,200
no longer matters.

458
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,120
What matters is that

459
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,480
my fourth brother

460
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,560
must die.

461
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:10,860
(Langhua Residence)

462
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,080
Your Highness, you're awake!

463
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,840
What happened to me?

464
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,440
It's all Jiang Taohua's fault!

465
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,800
That ungrateful woman

466
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
tried to kill you.

467
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,280
She poisoned you

468
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,720
with the Soulsever Incense.

469
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,880
We were wrong about her.

470
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,400
Thankfully,
Chancellor Shen arrived in time

471
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:38,840
and saved you.

472
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,560
I'll help you.

473
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:44,560
Slowly.

474
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,560
Your Highness, save your words.

475
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,480
Don't damage your throat further.

476
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,400
Please rest.

477
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,960
I'll fetch the imperial physician.

478
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,160
Prince Wuxia, wake up!

479
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,000
Prince Wuxia!

480
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,120
He's still alive.

481
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:08,640
I remember

482
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,520
Jiang Taohua...

483
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,040
What are you doing?

484
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,480
Saving a life.

485
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,440
I have to find Chancellor Shen.

486
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,520
Your Highness.

487
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,600
Fresh flowers

488
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,600
for sale.

489
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,040
Have a look.

490
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,400
Fresh flowers.

491
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,160
Please have a look.

492
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,400
Fresh flowers for sale!

493
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,680
Have a look at my flowers, Miss.

494
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,320
They're nice.

495
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,720
If you like them, buy one.

496
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,560
All right.

497
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,360
Here you go. Take care.

498
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:31,840
Go!

499
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,400
Go!

500
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,080
Go!

501
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,000
Qing.

502
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,120
Worry not.

503
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,040
I will not gamble with my life.

504
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,080
There will be no mistakes this time.

505
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,480
Look.

506
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,320
Yugui Mountain's cliffs are steep.

507
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,840
The summit is towering and dangerous.

508
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,440
Beside here is a bottomless abyss.

509
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,400
Below,

510
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,160
the river is fast and fierce.

511
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,040
If something falls from there,

512
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,200
even the strongest stone

513
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,040
will shatter to pieces.

514
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,680
If Mu Wuxia falls,

515
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,880
even if he lives,

516
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,920
he will be battered to bits

517
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,480
by the jagged rocks.

518
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,040
I trust I don't need to explain

519
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,600
the gravity of today's plan to you.

520
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,320
I understand

521
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,680
the stakes.

522
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,720
If anything goes wrong,

523
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,480
please step in.

524
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,360
That goes without saying.

525
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,760
We share the same goal, after all.

526
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:10,120
Shen Zaiye wants to pretend
to be Prince Wuxia to lure them out.

527
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,920
We will use that

528
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,920
to draw out Yang Wanqing

529
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,080
and kill her.

530
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,040
That will save Prince Wuxia's life
for now.

531
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,680
If Empress Lv asks,

532
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,200
we can blame everything

533
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,760
on Shen Zaiye.

534
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,520
There is a dangerous path

535
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,840
on the mountain.

536
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,280
I will act there.

537
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,960
While I go find Yang Wanqing,

538
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,920
you modify the carriage

539
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,720
and hide nearby.

540
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,320
If I succeed,

541
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,280
I will send a signal.

542
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,320
When you see it,

543
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,560
join me immediately.

544
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,360
Otherwise, the driver might turn on me.

545
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,120
Your Highness,

546
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,880
can I not stay in the carriage

547
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,200
with you?

548
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,240
Yang Wanqing doesn't trust me.

549
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,360
She won't come with me

550
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,000
if she sees you.

551
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:02,640
Qing.

552
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,040
We must hurry.

553
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,960
Mu Wuxia is probably already
at the summit.

554
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,040
Speed up the carriage.

555
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,200
Yes.

556
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:15,920
Go!

557
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,600
Go!

558
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,440
Go!

559
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,280
Go!

560
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,040
I never thought

561
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,360
you would actually dare attack me

562
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,640
for Mu Wuxia's sake.

563
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,320
If Prince Wuyin had not been cautious,

564
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,560
you would have gotten me today.

565
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,080
Don't fool yourself into believing

566
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,880
you're the smartest person in the world,

567
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,920
and that everyone else is just a puppet

568
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,360
you control.

569
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,600
As cunning as Shen Zaiye is,

570
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,400
would he really let Mu Wuxia out

571
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,800
after learning he was nearly killed
at the tea house?

572
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,920
You even came to me about it.

573
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,760
That only made it more suspicious.

574
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,400
Easy!

575
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,840
Prince Wuxia?

576
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,400
Prince Wuxia!

577
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,920
What did you do to him?

578
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,120
What is he doing here?

579
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,520
If you can lure
the snake out of its hole,

580
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,040
why can't I just wait patiently
for the rabbit to come to me?

581
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,840
The foolish boy

582
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,760
was still recovering,

583
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,320
yet he was so eager to clear your name.

584
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,480
We grabbed him
as soon as he left his residence.

585
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,640
And your maid, Qingtai.

586
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,960
She's quite skilled
in Beiyuan's secret mechanisms.

587
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,000
So I had someone make a copy.

588
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,440
"Beiyuan spy Jiang Taohua

589
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,920
tried to harm a prince of Qi,

590
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,400
caught by Qi's Left Chancellor
Shen Zaiye

591
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,880
and executed on the spot."

592
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,600
A story with no mention of Lan Boutique.

593
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,960
Clean and perfect.

594
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,560
Don't you think?

595
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:14,880
Princess Chengping!

596
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,440
Her Highness was framed!

597
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,280
She didn't try to kill Prince Wuxia!

598
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:19,760
Unhand me!

599
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,440
If she were innocent,

600
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,960
she would not be here.

601
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,160
Let me go! Release me!

602
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,720
Your Highness! Your Highness!

603
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,800
Your Highness! Your Highness!

604
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,640
Prince Wuxia?

605
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,200
Your Highness! Your Highness!

606
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,560
Your Highness!

607
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,000
Your Highness! Watch out!

608
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,360
Neither of you

609
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,480
is leaving alive!
