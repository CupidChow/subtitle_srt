1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,480
The End

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,520
wanna light up the mitral moon

3
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,120
tonight

4
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,600
Keep a Channel

5
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:10,420
Sparrow

6
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,360
I know tempers are firewood.

7
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,800
It's more useful to track around.

8
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,040
God outsideLAUGHS,

9
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,440
please tell us.

10
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,040
You're my second chance.

11
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,240
Have I dropped the candy?

12
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,240
I'm weak.

13
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,240
The firewood in the firewood house

14
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,240
is all branches picked from outside.

15
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,240
When I saw it, I cut some wood this morning.

16
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,240
I haven't even rest a bit until now.

17
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,240
You just let me take the gold.

18
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,240
Since you're here,

19
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,240
let me wipe your sweat.

20
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,240
Go, go, go.

21
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,240
What?

22
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,240
You want me to wipe his sweat?

23
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,240
No need.

24
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,240
I'll do it myself.

25
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,240
Okay.

26
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,240
Come, come, come.

27
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,240
Come and eat.

28
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,240
Coming.

29
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,240
Grandma Xiao Lian.

30
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,240
Yesterday we went around the village.

31
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,240
We really like the wildness of the countryside.

32
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,240
I wonder if we can stay a few more days

33
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,240
and ask around the horse carriage to Yujing.

34
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,240
How can we?

35
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,240
We said we'd only stay for one day.

36
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,240
What's the big deal?

37
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,240
If you like it,

38
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,240
we'll just stay here.

39
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,240
Let Xiao Lian help with the horse carriage.

40
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,240
This child is always running around.

41
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,240
I don't want it.

42
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,240
What are you doing?

43
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,240
Don't laugh.

44
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,240
This child is just like this.

45
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,240
It's okay.

46
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,240
Don't worry, Ming Lang.

47
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,240
The farm work in our house

48
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,240
will be on me these days.

49
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,240
Thank you so much.

50
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,240
You're welcome.

51
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,240
Honey, take a break.

52
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,240
Have some water.

53
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,440
I'll leave in one day.

54
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,640
You don't listen to me.

55
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,080
It's you.

56
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,480
You're so easy to fool.

57
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,240
I'll keep an eye on you

58
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,600
and see what you want to do.

59
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:35,760
Sit.

60
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,080
Okay.

61
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,960
You've been crying all morning.

62
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,640
Drink some water.

63
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,120
Here.

64
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:48,440
Thank you.

65
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:53,880
Here.

66
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,280
Although the village is poor,

67
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,440
the villagers are all at ease.

68
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,320
If we could stay here

69
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,480
and stay away from the court,

70
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,080
it would be great.

71
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,360
The light of the garden is long-lasting.

72
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,560
But not everyone

73
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,200
is qualified to stay away from the court

74
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,200
and be a free bank.

75
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,640
The village is high-ranking.

76
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,080
There must be many things that are not allowed.

77
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,200
But sometimes,

78
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,840
keeping a desire

79
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,760
is keeping a piece of pure land

80
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,840
in the heart.

81
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,640
What do you think?

82
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,520
It's not like you're doing it.

83
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,520
Maybe

84
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,440
you're doing what you want to do.

85
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,280
Jiang Taohua,

86
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,640
if you weren't the princess of Northland,

87
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,600
it would be great.

88
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,360
Miss,

89
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,960
I didn't mean to make it difficult for you.

90
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,560
It's true that the Prime Minister is not here.

91
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,520
No one can make the decision.

92
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,400
You should go back to your room and rest.

93
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,760
My brother is not here.

94
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,960
Meng Zhenzhen can't handle it.

95
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,360
And you're still here to hinder us.

96
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,440
You're trying to force me

97
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,720
to stay in the mansion.

98
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,400
I'm sorry.

99
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,120
I'm sorry.

100
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,960
I'm sorry.

101
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,760
I'm sorry.

102
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,760
I'm sorry.

103
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,720
I'm sorry.

104
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,760
I'm sorry.

105
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,760
I'm sorry.

106
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,760
I'm sorry.

107
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,760
I'm sorry.

108
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,760
I'm sorry.

109
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,760
I'm sorry.

110
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,760
I'm sorry.

111
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,760
I'm sorry.

112
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,760
I'm sorry.

113
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,760
I'm sorry.

114
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,760
I'm sorry.

115
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,680
It's been so long since you were here.

116
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,680
I don't care.

117
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,200
If you don't give me a message today,

118
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,200
you won't leave the mansion.

119
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,360
Okay.

120
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,360
I won't go out then.

121
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,160
What do you mean?

122
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,080
Sorry for the inconvenience.

123
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,360
But I have no way

124
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,800
to help you with Miss Qingying's security.

125
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,880
Take Miss back to her room.

126
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,080
You must take care of her.

127
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,080
Yes.

128
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,080
No!

129
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,080
Zhan Lu!

130
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,080
I want to tell my brother about your act!

131
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,080
Zhan Lu!

132
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,080
He doesn't let me go out.

133
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,080
He is just being angry.

134
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,080
But why is my brother not here?

135
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,080
Did something happen to him?

136
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,080
I'm going to find the map.

137
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,080
Who will I give the rest to?

138
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,080
It seems that you never really cared.

139
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,080
The one who gave you the knot

140
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,080
was just a prince you wanted to have.

141
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,080
Why are you talking so much?

142
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,080
Today, my husband is very tired.

143
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,080
He is not in the mood to sleep.

144
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,080
He is not in the mood to sleep.

145
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,080
He is not in the mood to sleep.

146
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,080
He is not in the mood to sleep.

147
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,080
Today, my husband is very tired.

148
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,080
I want to cook some bamboo shoots for him.

149
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,080
But this is too much.

150
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,080
It's okay.

151
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,080
My husband likes it.

152
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,080
He is clearly scheming.

153
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,080
He is scheming.

154
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,080
But he is still so loyal and loyal.

155
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,080
He is so arrogant.

156
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,080
The police are fooled.

157
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,080
They don't even bother to save you.

158
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,080
In the future,

159
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,080
you must not be trusted.

160
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,080
Why are you not wearing your clothes?

161
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,080
You look so scary.

162
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,080
Who says I don't look scary?

163
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,080
Who says I don't look scary?

164
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,080
Did you two have a fight?

165
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,080
Go and coax her.

166
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,080
Me?

167
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,080
I am just a little girl.

168
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,080
Why would I coax a big man like her?

169
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,080
Sister,

170
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,080
be careful not to be robbed by other girls.

171
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,080
There are not many men in our village.

172
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,080
It's not easy to find one.

173
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,080
It's not easy to find one.

174
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,080
I'm not a big girl.

175
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,080
There are not many men in our village.

176
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,080
It's not easy to find one.

177
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,080
There are many women

178
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,080
who are asking about it.

179
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,080
If you don't want to end up

180
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,080
as a single woman,

181
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,080
you should cherish your husband.

182
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:53,080
These women are so blind.

183
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,080
They can fall for such a bitch.

184
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,080
You are so strong.

185
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,080
You are so strong.

186
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,080
What does it have to do with you?

187
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,080
You,

188
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,080
come to our house at noon

189
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,080
and taste our food.

190
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,080
I'm not the one who is going to be generous.

191
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,080
My girl has made a good meal.

192
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,080
She went to my house.

193
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,080
My house killed a chicken today.

194
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,080
Your girl is already engaged.

195
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,080
Why are you so thoughtful?

196
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,080
No need. I just want to be alone for a while.

197
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,080
Being alone

198
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,080
is so nice to hear

199
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,080
from you.

200
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,080
Where is your husband?

201
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,080
She heard it.

202
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,080
Be quiet.

203
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,080
He is already engaged.

204
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,080
Husband.

205
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,080
What's going on?

206
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,080
You asked her

207
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,080
to eat chicken.

208
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,080
Come and eat.

209
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,080
I saw you didn't eat

210
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,080
so I brought you some food.

211
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,080
I'm sorry.

212
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,080
I'm sorry.

213
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,080
I'm sorry.

214
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,080
I'm sorry.

215
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,080
I'm sorry.

216
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,080
You said

217
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,080
you are a prime minister.

218
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,080
Are you better at planting

219
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,080
than those people from the family?

220
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,080
Are you talking about

221
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,080
planting the land?

222
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,080
What?

223
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,080
You are so greedy.

224
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,080
Are you going to use me

225
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,080
to get some food?

226
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,080
I advise you

227
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,080
not to waste your time.

228
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,080
I'm full.

229
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,080
Remember your task.

230
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,080
Why is this man

231
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,080
so annoying?

232
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,080
Really.

233
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,080
SprATT

234
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,080
Qingying.

235
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,080
What a coincidence.

236
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,080
At the también event

237
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,080
you had a small accident.

238
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,080
Are you looking for my brother

239
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,520
I'm sorry.

240
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,880
Are you trying to sneak out?

241
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,440
Yes.

242
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,320
I'm going to find my brother and Mrs. Jiang.

243
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,560
Mrs. Jiang?

244
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,680
Did something happen to her?

245
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,600
Is she involved in the fight with the crown prince on the street?

246
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,160
She fought with the crown prince?

247
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,320
No wonder.

248
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,120
She's the one who's in a hurry.

249
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,000
Wait.

250
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,520
I'll go with her.

251
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,960
You?

252
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,560
You're a noble and you don't know kung fu.

253
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,800
It's no use going there.

254
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,320
Excuse me.

255
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,520
Have you ever seen a man

256
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,520
who's so tall, handsome, elegant,

257
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,400
and easy to see?

258
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,280
And then there's a man

259
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,640
who's about this tall.

260
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,800
No, no.

261
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,680
Okay, thank you.

262
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,920
Miss Ai Qingyi.

263
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,520
What you just described

264
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,280
is the Prime Minister?

265
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,480
Of course.

266
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,880
He's handsome, elegant,

267
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,360
and easy to see.

268
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,960
It seems that we'll never find them.

269
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,360
Why?

270
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,920
In my opinion,

271
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,800
the Prime Minister is also in this situation

272
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,160
purely because he has too many enemies

273
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,720
and is destined to be killed.

274
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,880
He's the one who's going to be the Prime Minister.

275
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,520
I think

276
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,920
he's not going to be punished for his misdeeds.

277
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,520
He's just waiting for his

278
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,760
one mistake and he'll be punished.

279
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,560
You people are so stupid.

280
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,000
You can't tell who's good or bad.

281
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,560
Okay, he's a good person.

282
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,760
Why didn't he ask about

283
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,240
the girls you saved?

284
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:01,920
Miss,

285
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,040
please save me.

286
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,040
There's a coward over there

287
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:04,840
who's been following me.

288
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,880
I'm scared.

289
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,720
Please save me.

290
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,480
What?

291
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,640
Under the bright sun,

292
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,720
how dare they do this?

293
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,680
I'll teach them a lesson.

294
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,320
Okay.

295
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,240
Please.

296
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,160
He's a young beggar.

297
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,480
If I go to the shop

298
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,160
and ask for food,

299
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,360
will he give it to me?

300
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,200
What do you think?

301
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,960
Thanks to the supporting

302
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,760
by işi z Goodbye

303
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,800
before being Luna.

304
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,840
We've made all the pants

305
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,360
in the sky

306
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,480
and wear these things.

307
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,320
Who knew this was going to happen?

308
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,680
Is it possible to hide not

309
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,040
to stand up for justice

310
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:57,960
just because people anywhere to cheat us?

311
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,560
It's not like that,

312
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,960
I just feel it easy Before the ihrini

313
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,320
future when people comes to us,

314
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,680
I can understand Niu Zen.

315
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:08,800
I'm kind of busy.

316
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,800
You mean I'm not smart?

317
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,800
Fine. I'm not smart.

318
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,800
I won't drag you down, Fourth Prince.

319
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,800
We'll split into two groups.

320
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,800
I'll go save my brother myself.

321
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,800
Miss Qingying.

322
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,800
Miss Qingying.

323
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,800
I didn't mean it like that.

324
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,800
Mo Xiang, look.

325
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,800
My brother left this mark.

326
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,800
No way.

327
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,800
That's not bad.

328
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,800
My husband and I have been in this village for a while.

329
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,800
Why haven't we seen any other men in the village?

330
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:50,800
It's all because of that cruel and evil man.

331
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,800
Shen Zaiye.

332
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,800
What does that have to do with him?

333
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,800
If it wasn't for him,

334
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,800
we wouldn't have ended up like this.

335
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,800
That's right.

336
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,800
What's going on?

337
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,800
You don't know.

338
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,800
Old Shen and his friends

339
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,800
used to live in other places.

340
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,800
They may not be rich,

341
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,800
but they were farming the land

342
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,800
that was passed down from generation to generation.

343
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,800
They were quite idle.

344
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,800
But one day,

345
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,800
an official came to us

346
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,800
and told us that the land

347
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,800
was used by the imperial court.

348
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,800
He said that the land

349
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,800
was used by the imperial court.

350
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,800
He said that we were

351
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,800
harming the land

352
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,800
and sent an official

353
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,800
to suppress us.

354
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,800
The one who was in charge

355
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,800
was Shen Zaiye, the current prime minister.

356
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,800
That's right.

357
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,800
He almost killed our village

358
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,800
with his army.

359
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,800
Fortunately, many people helped us escape.

360
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,800
We survived.

361
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,800
Under such a difficult situation,

362
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,800
they used such a lawless method.

363
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,800
You don't know.

364
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,800
Later,

365
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,800
we sent people to find out the news.

366
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,800
Only then did we know

367
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,800
that the so-called army farming the land

368
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,800
was a lie.

369
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,800
In fact,

370
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,800
some powerful officials in the imperial court

371
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,800
were interested in our ancestral land

372
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,800
and wanted to take it down.

373
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,800
That's why they framed us

374
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,800
as rebels.

375
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,800
Shen Zaiye,

376
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,800
that bastard,

377
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,800
he colluded with those powerful officials

378
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,800
and framed us.

379
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,800
Without land,

380
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,800
our life would be more difficult.

381
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,800
We could only rely on our men

382
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,800
to go out and work,

383
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,800
and go home.

384
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,800
I see.

385
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,800
The reason

386
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,800
is so complicated.

387
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,800
It's because of this

388
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,800
that I went out of the village

389
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,800
to find money to support Xiao Lian and grandma.

390
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,800
I haven't been back for a day.

391
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,800
I wonder how my brother is doing now.

392
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,200
If Uncle melts then use the garden.

393
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,280
Brother, how about I choose to go

394
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,280
and let me be as a assignedfall?

395
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,840
Don't you agree?

396
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,800
If you agree,

397
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,400
we can split up.

398
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,400
Linlun,

399
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,440
tell me.

400
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,080
I think I have a grudge with the Prime Minister.

401
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,200
Now I dare not let them know

402
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,400
our real identity.

403
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,680
Otherwise,

404
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,880
there won't be any trouble.

405
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,680
Then please learn to shut up.

406
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,000
We are on the same boat now.

407
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,440
I won't be able to vent my anger.

408
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,600
Same boat?

409
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,040
Yes.

410
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,320
So you'd better be nice to me.

411
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,960
Just treat it as a kindness.

412
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,000
Otherwise, when you are down,

413
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,160
you won't have a helper.

414
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,000
If one day I really need you to help me,

415
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,880
he is really a good man.

416
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,920
Maybe a man who is high

417
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,880
will need a day to think about the character.

418
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,080
But I have one thing I don't understand.

419
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,320
Since you are so obsessed with money,

420
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,760
why do you want to investigate it?

421
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,440
You want to ask why I do this

422
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,120
while investigating the case, right?

423
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,440
A general is a hero.

424
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,080
Don't you understand

425
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,240
such a simple reason?

426
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,320
So those villagers

427
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,960
are the victims?

428
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,520
Who let them be so weak?

429
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,040
They don't even have the ability to protect themselves.

430
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,680
No one will be weak forever.

431
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,680
They will also use the pen and ink swords

432
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,520
to protect others.

433
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,720
Yuan ه lange

434
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,880
Huo You

435
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,080
So you

436
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,720
are Shen Zai Ye who caused

437
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,760
our family to be so struggling.

438
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,280
I'm back.

439
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,920
Grandma, I'm back.

440
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,080
You're back.

441
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,040
Xiaolian.

442
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,960
Today is the auspicious day in the town.

443
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,840
Take your husband and your wife

444
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,920
to the town to find a carriage and a carriage.

445
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,920
Ask about the market in Yijing.

446
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,240
Come back early.

447
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:16,800
OK.

448
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,440
Sister, follow me.

449
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:21,880
OK.

450
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,200
Come on.

451
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,320
Let's go.

452
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,920
Xiaolian will take us to the town.

453
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:41,880
OK.

454
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,280
Xiaolian, why are you so lonely today?

455
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,840
The buns just came out.

456
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,040
New buns today.

457
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,560
Here, take it.

458
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,280
Thank you.

459
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,120
Take care.

460
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,160
Come again next time.

461
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:00,680
OK.

462
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,280
Xiaolian.

463
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,680
Xiaolian, you are not對勁 today.

464
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,840
Why it's so quiet?

465
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,820
You miss us the most.

466
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,620
Sister, there are bats.

467
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,100
Get them.

468
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:22,940
Don't let them get away.

469
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,780
Run, sister, run.

470
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,500
Xiaolian, slow down.

471
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,300
Xiaolian.

472
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,340
Xiaolian, slow down.

473
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,220
Xiaolian.

474
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,320
You...

475
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:47,960
Xiaolian.

476
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:50,840
Are you okay?

477
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,320
Xiaolian, are you okay?

478
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:55,960
Are you okay?

479
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,480
Tell me.

480
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,640
Why did you lead us to the town?

481
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,880
What are you doing?

482
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,080
Come on, get up.

483
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,200
Come on, get up.

484
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,680
Xiaolian.

485
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,320
Did you find these people today?

486
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,720
Sorry, sister.

487
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,200
Since you have agreed to their order

488
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,240
and led us here,

489
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,160
it means you must know

490
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,280
there is a group of people

491
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,280
chasing us.

492
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,040
But we haven't done anything

493
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,880
to hurt you these days.

494
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,800
Why did you hurt us?

495
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,240
Because he...

496
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,400
He is the treacherous Shen Zaiye.

497
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,120
I heard your conversation that day.

498
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,560
I just found out

499
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,000
that he is the treacherous one

500
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,080
who ruined our village.

501
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,680
If it wasn't for him,

502
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,320
I wouldn't have done my work.

503
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,680
If I hadn't done my work,

504
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,120
I wouldn't have been detained by those people.

505
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,080
Since you know my identity,

506
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,640
you should know that I am ruthless.

507
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,360
Tell me everything

508
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,120
you know

509
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,320
one by one.

510
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,120
Or else...

511
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,400
I will kill you.

512
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,400
I will kill you.

513
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,400
I will kill you.

514
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,400
I will kill you.

515
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,400
I will kill you.

516
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,400
I will kill you.

517
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,440
I will kill you.

518
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,480
All right.

519
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Don't cry, Xiaolian.

520
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,360
All right...

521
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:20,880
Don't cry.

522
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,520
All right, Xiaolian.

523
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,520
Don't cry.

524
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,160
Don't cry.

525
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,640
Look at you.

526
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,720
All right.

527
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,000
Xiaolian, can you tell me

528
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,200
Who did you get it from?

529
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,360
A few days ago,

530
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,120
some people came to the village to make a contribution.

531
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,720
Don't be anxious.

532
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,480
Line up.

533
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,280
Come on.

534
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,400
Name, Zhong Shi.

535
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,960
One contribution is high.

536
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,600
The adults in the village

537
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,000
went to the festival.

538
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,400
Including my brother.

539
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,240
Xiaolian.

540
00:26:59,240 --> 00:26:59,800
Next.

541
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,240
After my brother left,

542
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,280
you have to take good care of yourself.

543
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,560
When your brother is done with the work,

544
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,480
you can go home.

545
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,200
Brother, don't go.

546
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,280
Those people who helped the beggars

547
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,760
didn't come back.

548
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:12,800
Xiaolian.

549
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,960
Although those people didn't go home,

550
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,080
they did send back the money.

551
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,880
So it's definitely okay.

552
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,440
Okay?

553
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,600
Then remember to write a letter to me.

554
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,320
Okay.

555
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,480
Write a letter to you.

556
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,640
Since then,

557
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,920
I have no more permission.

558
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,760
Although we can receive the money

559
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,640
in advance of each month,

560
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,320
I haven't seen my brother

561
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,600
write a letter of family.

562
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,120
My brother is the most faithful.

563
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,640
He said he would write a letter of family to me.

564
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,960
He will write it.

565
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,280
If he didn't write it,

566
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,880
something must have happened.

567
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,200
I saw the people who caught you in the town

568
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,480
took my brother's head.

569
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,680
I thought

570
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,120
you are a bad person who harms the people.

571
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,320
I might as well take you there

572
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,520
and bring my brother back.

573
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,160
It's a good thing.

574
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,480
Since your brother is so important to you,

575
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,400
why did you go back on your word?

576
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,240
Although you are a bad person,

577
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,360
you are a good person.

578
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,200
I don't want to hurt you.

579
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,120
Okay.

580
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,560
I've said everything I should say.

581
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,320
The elders in the village all said

582
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,480
you are a bad person who is disobedient.

583
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,920
You are always going to take the money.

584
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,360
Now I have enough money.

585
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,440
Just do it.

586
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,040
You are so great.

587
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,440
Even the children in the village

588
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,160
know your behavior.

589
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,600
Xiaolian.

590
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,480
We won't kill you.

591
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,120
You are brave and smart.

592
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,240
If your family is locked up,

593
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,720
you will save her at all costs.

594
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,640
So you didn't do anything wrong.

595
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,120
But remember,

596
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,040
do nothing

597
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,400
without full control.

598
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,080
Don't act rashly.

599
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,200
Are you sure that

600
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,800
even if you give us to the head of the family,

601
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,880
he will let your brother out?

602
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,720
But my brother...

603
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,160
Xiaolian, don't worry.

604
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,520
Although this scoundrel

605
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,000
doesn't do good things,

606
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,240
this time,

607
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,360
he will help you

608
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,440
save your brother.

609
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,400
Really?

610
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,600
If you want to do good things,

611
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,800
don't bring me with you.

612
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,800
You are disobedient and unforgivable.

613
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,480
Although he failed to kill me this time,

614
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,400
I know it's not the next time.

615
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,200
He is innocent.

616
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,160
Let alone a child.

617
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,400
It's not his fault.

618
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,080
You have to protect her.

619
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,640
Yes.

620
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,080
Jiang Taohua,

621
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,400
don't blame me for not reminding you.

622
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,840
Be careful not to be caught by him.

623
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,960
Shen Zaiye said

624
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,040
he was not born with a fake identity.

625
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,880
He also protected me.

626
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,200
What did he experience?

627
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:34,800
He is so alert

628
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,400
to everyone.

629
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,520
What should we do?

630
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,240
The mark is broken here.

631
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,720
There seems to be someone over there.

632
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,440
Let's go.

633
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:18,960
Grandma.

634
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,520
Grandma.

635
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,680
What's wrong?

636
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,840
Your belt is loose.

637
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,520
Really.

638
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,320
Thank you, young man.

639
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,960
My wife said

640
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,320
the more loose the belt, the lighter it is.

641
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,880
Grandma, let me do it.

642
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,120
Okay.

643
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,320
Young people now

644
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,520
all have good intentions.

645
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,200
Grandma, you mean all of them.

646
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,120
Have you ever seen

647
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,720
other good-hearted young people?

648
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,640
Yes.

649
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,440
A couple came to the village a few days ago.

650
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,120
They are as kind as you.

651
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,440
Grandma, we are not...

652
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,440
We are quite different.

653
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:09,880
Be careful.

654
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,200
Be careful!

655
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,200
Be careful!

656
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,960
What a little kid!

657
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,440
Who has such a small Often scene thing?

658
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,520
Who needs a accident like this?

659
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,360
front.

660
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,800
Grandma, I'm back.

661
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,760
You're back.

662
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,280
I went to buy buns for sister.

663
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,720
Really?

664
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,200
Here, have a taste.

665
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:37,760
Okay.

666
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,680
It smells so good.

667
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:42,880
Is it good?

668
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,680
It's really good.

669
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,400
Seeing this scene,

670
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,640
do you still want to kill yourself?

671
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,480
One more bite.

672
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,840
No matter what I think,

673
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,480
Mrs. Jiang's behavior is indeed abnormal today.

674
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,920
A person who only thinks about how to protect himself

675
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,440
actually cares about other things.

676
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,640
Maybe it's a matter of time for others,

677
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,960
but for her,

678
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,200
it's the most important thing.

679
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,000
You ruined her innocence and weakness,

680
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,360
but now you're turning it around

681
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,440
and blaming her for her many tricks.

682
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,200
If someone can help her,

683
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,960
she won't do

684
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,000
such a dangerous thing today.

685
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,760
Umm...

686
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,040
How can you talk like this?

687
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,360
Then you'll be a deuxième Preferred Minister with my word.

688
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,600
Before you start working here,

689
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,680
you should've said that

690
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,200
like your masking hand,

691
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,000
you don't understand the sufferings of your lower class.

692
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,440
That's normal.

693
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,840
Grandma, why are there more bowls and chopsticks than usual?

694
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,040
Naturally, I came to find you

695
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,840
and arrived at the village.

696
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,640
So I

697
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,640
prepared more bowls and chopsticks.

698
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,440
Let's eat together later.

699
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,640
Brother.

700
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,440
Qingying.

701
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,040
Fourth Brother.

702
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:00,440
Kouzhou.

703
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,440
Fourth Young Master.

704
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,640
Why are you here?

705
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,840
We followed the signs and came all the way here.

706
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,440
We also met Grandma Xiao Lian on the way.

707
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,240
The two gentlemen are wearing my clothes.

708
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,440
I didn't know that they thought they were brothers.

709
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,640
And they said that...

710
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,840
They really look alike.

711
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:34,040
Of course, my brother is better at acting.

712
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,040
Don't stand here for others.

713
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,240
Go and cook.

714
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,040
Thank you, Young Master.

715
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,840
What happened on your way here?

716
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,640
Why did you come here?

717
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:03,840
I'm fine.

718
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,440
Thank you for your concern.

719
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,440
We are friends.

720
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,840
You don't have to be so polite.

721
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,240
Hey.

722
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,640
What are you doing?

723
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,840
I'm just going to wash the dishes.

724
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,840
I'm going to wash the dishes.

725
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,840
I'm going to wash the dishes.

726
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,840
I'm going to wash the dishes.

727
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,840
I'm going to wash the dishes.

728
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,640
Hey.

729
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,640
You are so biased.

730
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,840
You are all biased.

731
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,840
Why do you only care about Madam Jiang and not my brother?

732
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,840
She is always very cunning.

733
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,240
She can't be taken advantage of by others.

734
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,640
I guess...

735
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,840
I don't have to worry about her.

736
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,240
Madam Jiang is a good person.

737
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,840
She can attract the Fourth Young Master's good fortune.

738
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,440
What good fortune?

739
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,840
The Fourth Young Master is a man of good character.

740
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,040
It's my honor to be concerned by him.

741
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,440
She is always so obedient.

742
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,440
If I hadn't been here,

743
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,440
she wouldn't have had the chance to live in the Western Regions.

744
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,440
Although you are a bit reckless sometimes,

745
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,440
you have helped me a lot along the way.

746
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,040
Thank you, Miss Qingying.

747
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,640
Qingying.

748
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,240
The Fourth Young Master sincerely thanked you.

749
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,040
You are so rude to him.

750
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,040
You should admit your mistake.

751
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,840
No, brother.

752
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,640
Why are you helping an outsider?

753
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,440
I'm rude.

754
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,040
He doesn't seem to be very polite to you.

755
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,640
The Fourth Young Master is a man of good character.

756
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,240
How can he compare to us?

757
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,640
You said I was a man of good character.

758
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,640
Fine.

759
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,440
The Young Master cares about Madam Jiang.

760
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:18,640
I'm not a man of good character, am I?

761
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,040
You are.

762
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,440
Qingying.

763
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,240
I'm not something you can bully.

764
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,640
Qingying, you spilled water on me because of the Young Master.

765
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,240
I'm going to spill it on you.

766
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,440
It's called returning the body of a man of good character

767
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,040
by using the way of a man of good character.

768
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,440
How dare you touch my brother?

769
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,440
Wait and see.

770
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,240
You are so childish.

771
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,640
You are so childish.

772
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,840
He's angry.

773
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:43,840
Grandma.

774
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,040
Grandma.

775
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,240
Did they have a fight?

776
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,640
They are worried about the village.

777
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,640
What's wrong with the village?

778
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,540
I told you.

779
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,540
You keep watching the river bank.

780
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,440
A man of good character can't fight.

781
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,240
Give me one last stick of wax and I will have it burnt.

782
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,840
Give four sticks to me.

783
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,840
I can't help it

784
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,840
Flowers fall, the north wind blows

785
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:27,840
The city is in a mess

786
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,840
The petals are wet with rain

787
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:34,840
The heart is broken

788
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,840
Flowers fall, tears fall

789
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:43,840
I can't help it

790
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:55,840
I wish to grow up in the mud

791
00:40:55,840 --> 00:41:02,840
Regret is in despair

792
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:10,840
I still hope that the flowers in my arms will bloom

793
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:22,840
Even if I have to give up my life for the song of the chrysalis

794
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,840
Who will lose the heart of a flower

795
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,840
Love and hate can only be eaten

796
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:43,840
Flowers wither, the heart is broken

797
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:49,840
No more notice

798
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:59,840
How to love, love crazy

799
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:07,840
Not afraid of being surprised by the five realms

800
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:15,840
Listen to what she said

801
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:25,840
It turns out that she has the answer of love
