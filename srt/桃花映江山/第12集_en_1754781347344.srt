(Adapted from the novel "Peach Blossoms
Reflecting the River and Mountains")

16
00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:40,980
(by Bai Lu Cheng Shuang)

17
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,900
=Episode 12=

18
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,040
Good.

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,120
This time, we must make sure

20
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,560
Shen Zaiye and that concubine of his

21
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,120
never return.

22
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,000
Jiang Taohua,

23
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,560
you're amazing! How did you pull it off?

24
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,120
I can't believe my brother actually
brought me to the spring hunt!

25
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,520
Who was it that said they'd be a dog
if they believed me again?

26
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,990
That was a heat-of-the-moment thing.
Don't hold it against me.

27
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,280
Mu Wuxia.

28
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,360
Prince Wuxia seems to hold
some resentment toward you.

29
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,120
He's just struggling

30
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,760
to get over the hurdle in his heart.

31
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,680
So it's true what people say

32
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,840
that the Princess of Beiyuan
is deeply favored by Chancellor Shen.

33
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:04,920
Prince Wuyin.

34
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,120
Lady Jiang,
there's no need to be nervous.

35
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,160
I simply felt
a certain connection with you

36
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,600
and wished to express my greetings.

37
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,400
Oh, right.

38
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,320
Father is hosting
the Flowing Cups Banquet.

39
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,080
If fate allows it,

40
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,360
might we share a few drinks

41
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,080
at the banquet, Lady Jiang?

42
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm honored, Prince Wuyin.

43
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,400
Thank you for the invitation.

44
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,520
But she hasn't yet bathed or changed.

45
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,240
I'll take her back to our tent.

46
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,480
Mu Wuxia.

47
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,280
You're already at the hunting grounds.

48
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,320
How are you still so dull?

49
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,680
Come on!

50
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,880
Compete with me in riding and archery!

51
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,240
You don't want to leave the tent?

52
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,920
Fine, we can just play pitch-pot.

53
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,240
That's one! Your turn.

54
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,840
All right, you win.

55
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,160
You really are no fun.

56
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,880
That was just the first throw.

57
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,800
I don't need you to go easy on me.

58
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,240
Why are you so determined
to compete with me?

59
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,400
Can't you just

60
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,320
let me read my books

61
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,480
in peace?

62
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,800
I haven't seen you turn a single page.

63
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,560
You're reading the way I pretend to read
when dealing with my brother.

64
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,120
True.

65
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,480
But what good is reading, anyway?

66
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,040
Books say

67
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,520
only by acting justly

68
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,280
can one serve both nation and people.

69
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,560
Yet I trusted the wrong official

70
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,000
and caused harm to Granny,

71
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,200
with consequences like that.

72
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,560
Clearly, everything I learned
was just theory on paper.

73
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,600
When faced with reality,
it was completely useless.

74
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,480
So if there were a next time,

75
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,800
what would you do?

76
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,640
Would you become like my brother?

77
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,560
I'll admit

78
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
Chancellor Shen has a sharp mind
and good foresight.

79
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,800
But everything I was taught goes against

80
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,760
his way of doing things.

81
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,520
I can't be like him...

82
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,040
Stop.

83
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,240
Spare me the lecture.

84
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,120
You're not entirely right.

85
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,360
But neither is my brother.

86
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,360
Getting hung up over that

87
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,720
is a waste.

88
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,760
Taking action is like firing an arrow.

89
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,000
Once the bowstring is released,
there's no turning back.

90
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
But the arrow missed.

91
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,680
Then fire another.

92
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,920
Pitch-pot is scored by total hits.

93
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,760
Missing once doesn't matter.

94
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,600
As long as my method is right,

95
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,320
there'll always be another chance.

96
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,640
How do you know

97
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,200
your method is right?

98
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,000
You throw from there.

99
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,200
I throw from here.

100
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,760
As long as my aim is the pot,

101
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,920
I'll land a shot eventually.

102
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,400
Two in a row!

103
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,920
That's five!

104
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,120
(Qingying is right.)

105
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,800
(Instead of wallowing in guilt,)

106
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,080
(it's better to set a clear goal.)

107
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,200
(Maybe one day,)

108
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,520
(I'll achieve
what I've set my heart on.)

109
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,440
Leave us.

110
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,880
What's your plan?

111
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,040
I took a look on the way here.

112
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,760
Everything seems flawless
on the surface.

113
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,920
Prince Wugou has prepared thoroughly.

114
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,200
This hunting ground is huge.

115
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,680
Where are we even supposed to start
looking for clues?

116
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,160
There wasn't enough time.

117
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,320
They couldn't have made it perfect.

118
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,120
If there's a flaw,

119
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,720
we'll catch it.

120
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,120
I've already sent Zhan Lu
to investigate in secret.

121
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,520
Once the banquet starts,
we'll find an excuse to slip away.

122
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:00,880
Chancellor,

123
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,160
Prince Wuxia is here to see you.

124
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,440
Go ahead.

125
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,360
Your Highness,

126
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,920
what brings you here today?

127
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,600
What happened in Tianshui Village

128
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,960
was due
to my ignorance and incompetence.

129
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,400
I owe you
and all the villagers an apology.

130
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,520
The matter is resolved.

131
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,240
Your Highness,
you don't need to dwell on it.

132
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,320
But after what happened,

133
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,360
has anything changed in your heart?

134
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,760
No.

135
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,720
As soon as the spring hunt ends,

136
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,360
I'll return to Yujing
as quickly as possible.

137
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,000
I'll take all the evidence

138
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
and report directly
to the governor of the capital.

139
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,240
Since Qin,

140
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,040
the governor of the capital has been
one of the three highest offices.

141
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,840
It belongs to no noble faction

142
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,560
and reports straight to the throne.

143
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,840
At the same time,

144
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,360
I'll assign people to protect
the villagers of Tianshui

145
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,760
and the evidence, at any cost.

146
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,960
Your Highness still intends

147
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,600
to report it?

148
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,160
Yes.

149
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:07,800
Huaijin.

150
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,960
What is the righteous path?

151
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,120
It's the one that benefits the people
and ensures the nation's future.

152
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,760
To walk that path,

153
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,200
we first need to establish order.

154
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,120
Only then can the path stay true.

155
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,480
Xunzi said,

156
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,840
"Orderliness is the mark of structure."

157
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,000
That is the principle.

158
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,240
I believe

159
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,600
there's nothing wrong
with the law itself.

160
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,680
Nor with reporting the matter.

161
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,280
What's wrong

162
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,960
are the corrupt officials
who twist the law for personal gain.

163
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,360
The way to fix it

164
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,680
isn't to lose faith in the law,

165
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,640
but to create an environment

166
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,960
where everyone follows it.

167
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,160
The difficulty lies not

168
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,880
in making laws,

169
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,800
but in ensuring they are upheld.

170
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,200
If even a prince like me can't follow

171
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,600
and trust the law,

172
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,600
who else would?

173
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,640
Chancellor Shen,

174
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,440
do you still think
I'm hopelessly stubborn?

175
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,360
No.

176
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,880
I only hope
you never lose your convictions.

177
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,120
Your Highness.

178
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,720
Did something happen to you?

179
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,920
You seem much happier than before.

180
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,600
A moment of clarity

181
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,360
can bring great joy.

182
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,400
The world is filled

183
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,120
with all kinds of wonders.

184
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,280
Each with its own truth.

185
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,640
And if I can present the world

186
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,880
through the lens of what I believe in,

187
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,520
wouldn't that be a magnificent sight?

188
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:04,800
Wang Xi.

189
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,400
Prepare the ink.

190
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,000
Right away.

191
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:40,820
(Chronicle of Unusual Spirits)

192
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,800
What junk did Zhan Lu give me?

193
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,880
Is he mocking me?

194
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,440
I'll slice it in half!

195
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,320
The burr puzzle is easy to take apart

196
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,680
but hard to put back together.

197
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,400
You find it frustrating,

198
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,680
but you do not realize

199
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,200
the trivial matters of this world
are far more complicated

200
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,600
than this puzzle.

201
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,840
My alliance with Shen Zaiye
has two goals.

202
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,480
One, to expose
the heir's counterfeiting operation

203
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,320
and avenge Granny.

204
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,280
Two, to uncover

205
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,760
how all this ties back to Empress Lv.

206
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,320
Only then can we gain the upper hand

207
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,280
and negotiate with her on equal terms.

208
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,760
But you and the Chancellor

209
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,880
are operating right
under His Highness's nose today.

210
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,840
It must be dangerous.

211
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,160
Just let that treacherous chancellor
investigate on his own.

212
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,440
No.

213
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,120
No matter what lies

214
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,720
behind this hunting ground,

215
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,600
for the sake of Changjue and myself,

216
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,040
I have to go.

217
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,960
Prepare two sets of clothing

218
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,400
that are easy to move in.

219
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,200
Mu Wuxia!

220
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,240
Mu Wuxia!

221
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,720
I just washed these grapes. Want some?

222
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,160
Come on! The banquet's starting!

223
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:13,840
Everyone,

224
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,800
today we hold the Flowing Cups Banquet.

225
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,160
Let us play a drinking game
where we compose poetry

226
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,480
themed around flowers.

227
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,480
If you can't come up with one,

228
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,520
drink as your punishment.

229
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,320
What do you think?

230
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,066
- Good.
- Excellent idea.

231
00:13:26,237 --> 00:13:27,181
- Great.
- Splendid.

232
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,760
Very well. I shall begin.

233
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,320
Plum by the window, blossoms late.

234
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,120
Bamboo in the pond, shoots newly sprout.

235
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:36,760
Wonderful.

236
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,520
What do you think?

237
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,120
Very nice.

238
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,480
Let me give it a try.

239
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,920
Plum and willow planted by the gate,

240
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,440
a single branch bearing lovely flowers.

241
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,880
A true scholar
of the Meng family indeed.

242
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:48,880
And you,

243
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,760
Chancellor Shen?

244
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,280
Forgive my poor attempt.

245
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,240
A branch leans
across the moon-viewing tower.

246
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,560
Flowers surround the terrace of wind.

247
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,840
Excellent.

248
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,720
Thank you, Your Majesty.

249
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,640
Here, here.

250
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,120
We have good wine and good poetry.

251
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,160
Here's to everyone

252
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,520
making great catches during the hunt.

253
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:12,880
Drink up!

254
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,520
The weather is fair and bright.

255
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,680
The skies are clear.

256
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,200
The delicacies are endless.

257
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,000
Everyone,

258
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,560
drink freely and enjoy yourselves.

259
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,680
Don't let Wugou's hospitality
go to waste.

260
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,760
Thank you, Father,
for gracing these hunting grounds.

261
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,640
I'll drink to that.

262
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,600
Chancellor Shen,

263
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,680
a toast to you.

264
00:14:59,200 --> 00:14:59,840
Cheers!

265
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,440
Chancellor Shen.

266
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,240
I won't be holding back
during this hunt.

267
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:36,840
Chancellor.

268
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,040
It's time.

269
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,440
Begin the operation.

270
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,560
Chancellor,

271
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,320
I want you to feed me a drink.

272
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,960
Forgive me.

273
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,960
I shall go and change.

274
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,080
Your Majesty.

275
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,960
My concubine conducted herself poorly
in front of the court.

276
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,000
I will come offer my apologies later.

277
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,360
Come join me
for a game of chess after this.

278
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,840
Yes, Your Majesty.

279
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:40,800
Chancellor.

280
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:42,840
I'm fine.

281
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:49,960
I'm fine.

282
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:10,960
Where is it?

283
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,160
Is the spot Zhan Lu gave accurate?

284
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,840
It should be up ahead.

285
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,600
This is the place.

286
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,280
This should be the place

287
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,600
he said they buried it in a hurry.

288
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,240
We were right.

289
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,720
This is silver ore.

290
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,880
We thought the counterfeit money

291
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,120
was just cheap alloy

292
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,760
mixed in by someone.

293
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,160
We never expected it
to be a real silver mine.

294
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,800
Illegally mining silver
is a crime punishable by death.

295
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,520
How could Prince Wugou be so bold?

296
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,360
He's backed by the Meng family.

297
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,040
Nothing he does is surprising.

298
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,560
Huaijin, you're clever.

299
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,200
You left a flaw on purpose,

300
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,640
and Shen Zaiye fell right into it.

301
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,280
Next...

302
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,520
Next...

303
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,360
Chancellor Shen and his concubine, drunk,
accidentally wander into this spot.

304
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,880
Suddenly, the long-dried hot spring
begins flowing again.

305
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,160
They both fall in by accident

306
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,480
and drown.

307
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,760
Where did all that water come from?

308
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,640
Let's get out of here!

309
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,600
It was a trap.

310
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,640
We have to go.

311
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:52,960
Come on!

312
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,320
My foot's stuck!

313
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,720
Shen Zaiye!

314
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,480
Take this.

315
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:52,920
You came back.

316
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,440
Hurry!

317
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,000
Mr. Meng, we've done as ordered.

318
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,080
The cave is fully flooded.

319
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,400
Good.

320
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,480
The silver mine is well hidden.

321
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,480
Wait three to five days,

322
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,600
then send someone to recover the bodies.

323
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,040
Say they were found downstream.

324
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,000
I've arranged
for a coroner and witnesses

325
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,160
to testify before His Majesty.

326
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,960
You are certainly thorough.

327
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,680
After the spring hunt,

328
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,840
the story of Chancellor Shen and his concubine
drowning in drunken misfortune

329
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,960
will spread across Yujing.

330
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,800
We'll spread rumors

331
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,720
that their ghosts haunt this place.

332
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,760
No one will dare come near
the hunting grounds again.

333
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,280
And your silver mine

334
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,960
will be safe

335
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,840
from suspicion.

336
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,240
Brilliant plan.

337
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,480
We might raise suspicion

338
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,240
if we're away for too long.

339
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,040
Let us return.

340
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,680
This stone must weigh over 1,000 jin.

341
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,240
We won't be able to move it on our own.

342
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,800
We'll have to wait for help.

343
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,880
Jiang Taohua, stay strong.

344
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,480
Don't give up.

345
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,160
I'm not giving up.

346
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,560
How else would I avenge Granny?

347
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,960
No one stays weak forever.

348
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,960
With brushes, words, or swords,

349
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,840
they'll all learn
to protect those they cherish!

350
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,680
(Even on the brink of death,)

351
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,600
(she's still thinking of others.)

352
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,000
Prince Wugou could never come up

353
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,600
with a plan this sinister.

354
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,200
This must be Meng Huaijin's handiwork.

355
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,080
If we are

356
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,120
to die here

357
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,800
this day,

358
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,480
then though

359
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,960
we never lay together in life,

360
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,800
we will share a grave in death.

361
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,200
That, too,

362
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,880
is a bond destined.

363
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,240
When put that way,

364
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,640
it's not so terrible.

365
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,760
It was just here a moment ago.

366
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,120
Where did it go?

367
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,080
Find it!

368
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,320
Yes, Your Majesty.

369
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:14,920
Father.

370
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:19,520
Father.

371
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,600
Did you lose something important?

372
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,760
How did you know?

373
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,000
Is this the piece

374
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,920
Your Majesty was looking for?

375
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,920
I'm positive
I already captured that piece.

376
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,960
Yes, that's the one.

377
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,360
Let's continue.

378
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,520
What are you doing here?

379
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,720
Whatever does Your Highness mean?

380
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,240
Where else am I supposed

381
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,520
to be?

382
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:16,800
Your Highness.

383
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,680
Go get Huaijin.

384
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,360
Let him come see

385
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,280
this so-called "foolproof" plan of his.

386
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,040
Your Highness, please calm down.

387
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,800
Shen Zaiye just returned
to the banquet alone.

388
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,680
He didn't seem the least bit suspicious.

389
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,040
Alone?

390
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,560
Jiang Taohua is carrying a bag.

391
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,200
Could they have discovered something
in the silver mine?

392
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,520
Your Highness, please step outside.

393
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,800
There are only women inside.

394
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:03,840
Get out.

395
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,400
I said, get out!

396
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,480
I lost something very important.

397
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,200
It looks quite similar
to what you're holding.

398
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,360
This is not Your Highness's.

399
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,960
Please stop making a scene.

400
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,760
If you're so sure,

401
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,360
then you won't mind if I take a look.

402
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,000
You may inspect it

403
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,040
but please step outside first

404
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,600
so as not to disturb the others.

405
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,520
I won't be told what to do
by a concubine!

406
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,320
I'd like to see

407
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,400
what tricks you're playing.

408
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,600
How dare you!

409
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,440
Please be appeased, Your Highness.

410
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,120
This was my mistake.

411
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,960
Prince Wugou insisted

412
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,640
on barging in.

413
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,200
I couldn't stop him.

414
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,880
You dare make a fool of me?

415
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,440
Are you all right?

416
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,560
Prince Wugou,
what is the meaning of this?

417
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,480
Chancellor.

418
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,760
Consort Lan was changing clothes.

419
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,920
I was hurrying to deliver her
a change of garments.

420
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,560
Who would've thought Prince Wugou
would follow me all the way here,

421
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,240
barge into Consort Lan's tent,

422
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,200
and demand to see her clothing?

423
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,400
Insolent!

424
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,760
Are you all right?

425
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,400
You even dared intrude
on Consort Lan's private tent.

426
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,320
I'm not dead yet!

427
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,200
Father,

428
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,640
I meant no disrespect to Consort Lan.

429
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,320
It was Shen...

430
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:10,960
Your Majesty.

431
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,640
His Highness was helping me

432
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,840
search for a lost jade pendant.

433
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,320
He entered the wrong tent by mistake.

434
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,080
He had no intention
of offending Consort Lan.

435
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,160
That's right.

436
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,680
Huaijin lost his pendant.

437
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,960
I saw Lady Jiang acting suspiciously
and followed her.

438
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,440
I didn't realize
it was Consort Lan's tent.

439
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,160
Your Majesty.

440
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,400
I accidentally spilled wine

441
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,880
on my clothes earlier.

442
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,080
I asked the Chancellor's concubine
to help me change.

443
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,360
Prince Wugou barged in

444
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,320
and now claims he lost his pendant.

445
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,200
Is he accusing me

446
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,720
of stealing it?

447
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,480
How could I ever suspect you, my love?

448
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,080
You've always been so understanding.

449
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,280
You wouldn't do anything wrong.

450
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,440
It was His Highness's mistake.

451
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,520
He misunderstood Lady Jiang,

452
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,920
and ended up disturbing Consort Lan.

453
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,840
He was just nervous

454
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,360
because he cared about Your Majesty.

455
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,000
After all,

456
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,200
the security of the hunting grounds
is his responsibility.

457
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,720
I was too on edge.

458
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,840
I apologize to Consort Lan.

459
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,640
Since Prince Wugou has admitted fault,

460
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,480
I will let the matter rest.

461
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,560
So this is where everyone went.

462
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,480
I was wondering
why the banquet felt so empty.

463
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,040
Father,

464
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,600
what's the prize for tomorrow's hunt?

465
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,120
You'd better not go back on your word.

466
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,040
You insolent child.

467
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,840
You've conducted yourself poorly.

468
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,120
Since it's your first offense,

469
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,560
I'll only give you ten lashes.

470
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,560
Go take your punishment.

471
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:48,840
Let's go.

472
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,720
Forgive me, Father.

473
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,640
Chancellor and Lady Jiang

474
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,640
really do make such a loving pair.

475
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,680
I'm envious.

476
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,280
Please excuse us, Prince Wuyin.

477
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,040
Lady Jiang was startled.

478
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,600
She needs rest.

479
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,320
You even managed to involve

480
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,640
His Majesty's favored Consort Lan.

481
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,000
You've got guts.

482
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,480
Those ten lashes

483
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,320
will at least vent some of Lian's fury.

484
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:01,840
Yes.

485
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,080
This is only the beginning.

486
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,600
Prince Wugou will pay the price

487
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,720
for everything he's done.

488
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:10,880
Let's go.

489
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,360
Did you twist your ankle?

490
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,200
I'm fine.

491
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,600
Put me down!

492
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,000
All of Yujing knows

493
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,040
you're my favored concubine.

494
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,200
His concubine's injury

495
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,560
has the treacherous chancellor
worried and panicked.

496
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,280
That's the way it should be.

497
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,840
You're quite the actor.

carrying Princess Chengping?

501
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,880
The Left Chancellor

502
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,560
makes a spectacle
of carrying his concubine around.

503
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,880
How inappropriate!

504
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,200
The daughter of Meng is present too.

505
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,600
Who would've thought

506
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,960
Chancellor Shen would have
such a romantic bone in him?

No bandages.

514
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,920
Earlier, it all happened so quickly.

515
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,160
Prince Wugou was flustered.

516
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,280
If he finds out

517
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,200
I'm also injured on my hand and leg,

518
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,640
he definitely won't let it go.

519
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,200
It's all Chancellor Shen's fault.

520
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,480
Just a moment with him,
and Your Highness ended up hurt.

521
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,200
If it weren't for his careful planning,

522
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,440
I might have died

523
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,920
in that mine.

524
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,280
Chancellor!

525
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,040
It's me!

526
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,880
Why did you arrive later than planned?

527
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,240
They were still flooding the cave.

528
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,680
I was worried coming out too early

529
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,680
would ruin your plan.

530
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,240
There's no time to waste.

531
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,840
Hurry and take Lady Jiang back
to the tent.

532
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,200
I must return to the banquet.

533
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:13,960
Yes, sir.

534
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,520
The clothes?

535
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,280
Right here.

536
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,160
I'll return to the banquet with you.

537
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,160
That won't be necessary.

538
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,840
You're weak.

539
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:22,840
You need rest.

540
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:23,840
Prince Wugou

541
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,000
won't dare utter a word
even if he sees me return alone.

542
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,840
I'm fine.

543
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,040
It'll be difficult to explain things

544
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,880
if you return alone.

545
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,000
All right.

546
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,240
That was too dangerous, Your Highness.

547
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,320
If there's another time,

548
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,280
let that treacherous chancellor
act alone.

549
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,160
You mustn't expose yourself
to danger again.

550
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,640
After all the times
Prince Wugou schemed against us,

551
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:45,880
we finally got

552
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,640
a little payback.

553
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,440
Besides,

554
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:50,880
if I hadn't gone,

555
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,440
how would I have discovered
what Empress Lv was really after?

556
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,600
You figured it out?

557
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,320
It wasn't until
I reached that silver mine

558
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,200
that I understood her true objective.

559
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,320
That much money

560
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,440
is more than enough for her

561
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,480
to bribe officials in Beiyuan,
raise assassins, or even an army.

562
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,520
The silver mine
and the counterfeit money

563
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,080
all tie back to Prince Wugou.

564
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,320
Once his crimes come to light,

565
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,280
he will be deposed.

566
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,960
Then the other princes of Qi will fight

567
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,880
for the title of heir.

568
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,120
Amid the chaos,

569
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:27,360
Empress Lv will reap the benefits.

570
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,000
That's her real plan.

571
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,400
Has she lost her mind?

572
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,840
Qi has strong troops
and skilled generals.

573
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,920
They have long been waiting for a chance

574
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,840
to wear down
the exhausted Beiyuan forces.

575
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,920
All they lack

576
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,400
is a justifiable cause

577
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,120
to convince the court
to dispatch troops.

578
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,680
If Empress Lv's actions are exposed,

579
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,480
there will be no more voices in Qi
calling for peace.

580
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,440
Empress Lv is ambitious.

581
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,520
She will end up dragging
all of Beiyuan down with her.

582
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,320
We must put a stop to her.

583
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,240
Still, it's too dangerous.

584
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,400
We should go into hiding

585
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,440
and wait until the chaos is over.

586
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,840
We're already involved.

587
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,240
It's too late for us to withdraw.

588
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,040
Then again,

589
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,600
a crisis

590
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,240
may also be an opportunity.

591
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,640
If we form the right alliances

592
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,640
and coordinate well,

593
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,880
this might just become the breakthrough

594
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,960
I need to counter Empress Lv.

595
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,520
And this "breakthrough"

596
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,240
lies with that treacherous chancellor?

597
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,320
At this point,

598
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,720
Shen Zaiye is the last straw

599
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,000
we can cling to.

600
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,360
But that chancellor

601
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,240
is not someone easily dealt with.

602
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,560
We can't remain passive.

603
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,800
If we wish to win him over,

604
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,040
we must offer a token of allegiance.

605
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,680
What token?

606
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,240
One decisive move.

607
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,040
One that will leave no doubt in his mind
of my loyalty.

608
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,960
Useless pigs!

609
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,960
Forgive me, Your Highness.

610
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,800
Your Highness, please be appeased.

611
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,680
Cursing a servant to let off steam

612
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,920
is nothing unusual.

613
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,400
But you just took ten lashes.

614
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,920
Don't tear your wounds open.

615
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,800
Fortunately,

616
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,920
the guards knew to hold back.

617
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,480
They didn't dare strike too hard.

618
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,680
With medicine,
you'll be fine in a few days.

619
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,680
Jiang Taohua looked so flustered

620
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,000
I thought

621
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,400
she was hiding something important.

622
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,600
I got whipped because of her.

623
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,200
Father even criticized me
in front of everyone.

624
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,920
I am the heir!

625
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,440
He showed me no regard at all.

626
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,920
Shen Zaiye is a calculating schemer.

627
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,560
That concubine of his
is sly and adaptable too.

628
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,280
Your Highness must be vigilant,

629
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,640
or they'll lead you

630
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,800
straight into disaster
before you know it.

631
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,440
Didn't you say the plan was foolproof?

632
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,360
How did they escape?

633
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,280
There was a man-made opening
at the top of the mine.

634
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,720
Shen Zaiye must have had
a backup plan all along.

635
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,880
How are they still alive after all this?

636
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,840
We tried to kill them many times.

637
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,080
Yet, they just won't die!

638
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,640
All the more reason

639
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,120
to stay calm and level-headed.

640
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,360
What matters most now

641
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,240
is to get through the spring hunt.

642
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,760
We mustn't lose control
of the situation.

643
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,400
Am I simply to accept these lashes

644
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,000
while they walk free?

645
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,440
Patience.

646
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,120
They're in our territory now.

647
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,560
Sooner or later,
they'll drop their guard.

648
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,760
The spring hunt is tomorrow.

649
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,960
Father won't discover the mine, will he?

650
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:42,880
Rest assured.

651
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,120
Everything's arranged.

652
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,480
Do as I say

653
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,320
and all will be fine.

654
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,400
We have the physical evidence.

655
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,680
What we still need is a witness.

656
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,760
If we can find the workers
who used to be in that mine,

657
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,760
and safely escort them to His Majesty,

658
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,160
then we'll have everything we need.

659
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,280
According to Lian,

660
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,600
the overseers recruit new laborers

661
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,080
at regular intervals.

662
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,920
Such a large number

663
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,520
can't be hidden in an ordinary place.

664
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,200
Given how hastily they moved

665
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,160
and the sheer size of their group,

666
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,520
they surely haven't gone far.

667
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,080
They must be somewhere
near this hunting ground.

668
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:54,960
This is the place.

669
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,880
I'll come up with something

670
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
to rescue those laborers.

671
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,480
But to avoid raising suspicion,

672
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,640
tomorrow...

673
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,840
Do it.

674
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,640
I'll buy you as much time as I can.

675
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,360
That won't do.

676
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,120
I'll have someone else handle it.

677
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,720
I'm the most suitable one for the task,

678
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,680
and the least likely
to arouse suspicion.

679
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,520
Don't worry.

680
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,320
I'll act when the opportunity arises.

681
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,360
His Majesty gave me this as a reward.

682
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,200
I have no use for it.

683
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,720
Thank you.

684
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,840
I'll probably have duties
to attend to tonight.

685
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,600
It'll be more convenient for me
to stay here.

686
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,040
You don't have to sleep on the floor.

687
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:14,840
