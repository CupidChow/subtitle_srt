(Adapted from the novel "Peach Blossoms
Reflecting the River and Mountains")

16
00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:40,980
(by Bai Lu Cheng Shuang)

17
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,900
=Episode 36=

18
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,980
(Outside the Imperial Prison)

19
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,800
Will this plan work?

20
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,440
Even if you don't trust the Chancellor,

21
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,880
don't you at least trust
the Princess?

22
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:26,960
Report!

23
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,120
Your Highness,
they killed the guards outside.

24
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,080
But they didn't enter.

25
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,480
What?

26
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,640
I didn't see Jiang Changjue either.

27
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,600
Cui Wei, take your men
and launch a counterattack.

28
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,640
Try to capture them alive.

29
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,440
If Qian Mochen isn't enough
to lure him out,

30
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,160
we'll catch a few more.

31
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,400
Jiang Changjue
will show up sooner or later.

32
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,000
Yes, Your Highness.

33
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,400
Follow me!

34
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,560
Stop them
and buy the Chancellor some time.

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,400
Wait!

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,800
Watch them closely.

37
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,280
Your Highness,

38
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,240
I saw Qingtai

39
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,640
and Shen Zaiye's guards.

40
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,560
Jiang Taohua and Shen Zaiye
have returned to Hao City?

41
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,960
What were you doing?

42
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,600
How could you not detect even
a hint of it?

43
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,720
It was my failure in duty.

44
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,120
But

45
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,360
I didn't see them myself.

46
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,480
I only overheard the guard saying,

47
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,440
"Hold them off

48
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,800
and buy the Chancellor some time."

49
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,160
"Hold them off"?

50
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,640
Could they have discovered
Qian Mochen's location?

51
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,760
Check the hidden sand cave now.

52
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,520
Yes, Your Highness.

53
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,680
Chancellor. Your Highness.

54
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,400
As expected, Cui Wei left in a hurry

55
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,400
through the back entrance

56
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,360
with a few men.

57
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,120
They took the bait.

58
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,960
Then we should make a move
to pick up the State Preceptor.

59
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,640
Is something troubling you?

60
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,680
Is the poison acting up?

61
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:39,680
No.

62
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,280
Then what's the matter?

63
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,400
Nothing.

64
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,080
I'm just scared.

65
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,160
Taohua,

66
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,200
don't worry.

67
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,240
I'm here.

68
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:38,680
Changjue,

69
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,000
you stay here.

70
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,240
We'll go check it out.

71
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,080
All right.

72
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,400
The four of you, come with me.

73
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,000
Commander Cui.

74
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,800
Any unusual activity?

75
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,440
Commander Cui, everything is clear, sir.

76
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,480
Send a letter to Her Highness
to inform her that nothing is unusual.

77
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,480
Yes, sir.

78
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:11,960
Follow him.

79
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,080
This way.

80
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,280
Wait here.

81
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,320
Go and inform Changjue

82
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,280
and set the ambush.

83
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,240
Yes, sir.

84
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,360
(Secret transport. Palace now.)
We need to lure Empress Lv to this spot.

85
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,040
(Safe and secure.
Proceed with the siege.)

86
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,080
(Proceed with the siege)

87
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,600
Who's there?

88
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:13,840
Stop them.

89
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,760
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

90
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,680
I'll hold off Cui Wei.

91
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,760
You find Qian Mochen.

92
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,200
Be careful.

93
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:52,880
Master.

94
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,000
Master.

95
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,280
Master.

96
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:02,760
I...

97
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,760
I told An Chu

98
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,800
not to let you get involved.

99
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,760
How could I abandon you?

100
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,690
Changjue has been praying
for your safe return.

101
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,720
At least,

102
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,720
you're finally calling me
"Master" again.

103
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,160
Have you found

104
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,000
Changjue?

105
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:31,840
Yes.

106
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,240
Good.

107
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,840
The three of us
have finally put the past behind us.

108
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,840
All that's left is to reunite.

109
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,600
Your safety is all that matters.

110
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,200
I protected you

111
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,040
and your brother

112
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,160
out of gratitude to the late Empress.

113
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,080
Now,

114
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,600
I've repaid the kindness I owed.

115
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,240
So I have no regrets now.

116
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,120
You should be happy

117
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,720
for me.

118
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,160
Master,

119
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,480
you once said,

120
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,500
"True courage is knowing
something is impossible

121
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,320
and doing it anyway."

122
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,280
So today,

123
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,840
I will get you out of here.

124
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,920
Report!

125
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,160
Your Highness, we received a message
from the hidden sand cave.

126
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,840
They've called for reinforcements.

127
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,720
Mobilize everyone
and head to the hidden sand cave.

128
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,560
Yes, Your Highness.

129
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,760
Cui Wei may return at any moment.

130
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,480
Master, we must go now.

131
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,880
Unlocking the chains takes time.

132
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,600
Leave me.

133
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,320
Use your wrist as a pivot

134
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,120
and slowly release pressure
through your fingers.

135
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,920
Now! Charge!

136
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,080
Kill him!

137
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,680
(Darn it.)

138
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,640
(Of all times,
the poison flares up now.)

139
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,440
Your Highness.

140
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,480
It's an ambush!

141
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,120
Protect Her Highness!

142
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,040
Fall back! Move!

143
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,680
- Charge!
- Kill them!

144
00:13:03,848 --> 00:13:05,282
Kill!

145
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,280
(Jiang Changjue.)

146
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,600
(No, this was a trap!)

147
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,880
Kill him now!

148
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,360
If Empress Lv finds out he's alive,

149
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,600
we're dead!

150
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,360
The key

151
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,200
is a steady hand.

152
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,040
The lock's tumblers
must flow like water.

153
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:12,880
I've unlocked it.

154
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,760
Fight your way out!

155
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,880
Escort me back to the palace!

156
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:06,880
Empress Lv,

157
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,960
you caused the Luocheng massacre,

158
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,520
which led innocent people
to lose their homes and lives.

159
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,400
You murdered

160
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,440
my mother!

161
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,960
You also poisoned

162
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,800
my sister!

163
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,360
You're ruthless and heartless!

164
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,120
Heaven itself won't forgive you!

165
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:28,920
Empress Lv,

166
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,560
do you admit your crimes?

167
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,400
Who are you to judge me?

168
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,800
Whoever kills Jiang Changjue

169
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,360
will be generously rewarded!

170
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,040
- Kill!
- Kill!

171
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,200
Kill!

172
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,680
Retreat! Head east!

173
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,400
Empress Lv is here! Take her down!

174
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:56,520
Move!

175
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,040
Head north!

176
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,840
- Kill!
- Kill!

177
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:08,800
Kill them all!

178
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,400
Empress Lv, stop running!

179
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,480
Empress Lv,

180
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,320
this is your end.

181
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,560
Fate has decided it.

182
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,480
Why keep struggling?

183
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,880
Hand over the antidote,

184
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,280
and I'll leave your body whole.

185
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,360
Never.

186
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,880
If I'm going down,

187
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,440
I'm dragging Jiang Taohua with me!

188
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:18,880
Kill him!

189
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,920
Let's go to the secret tunnel
in the northwest.

190
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:40,720
Master,

191
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:41,920
this way.

192
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,680
Here, let me help you.

193
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:05,960
Master!

194
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,200
Chancellor,

195
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,440
you are...

196
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,280
I'm fine.

197
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,360
Are you all right?

198
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,760
I'm all right.

199
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,640
Master.

200
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:42,840
Master.

201
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,440
Empress Lv?

202
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,720
Stop right there!

203
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:51,640
Princess.

204
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:52,680
The antidote.

205
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,040
Go and get it.

206
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:54,960
But...

207
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:55,680
I'll be fine.

208
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:56,760
Go ahead.

209
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,440
Go.

210
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,360
Master,

211
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,760
wait for me right here.

212
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:04,600
All right.

213
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,480
Jiang Taohua,

214
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,160
we meet again.

215
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,240
Empress Lv,

216
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,680
there's no escape this time.

217
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,960
Today will be the day you die.

218
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,560
Who's to say I couldn't escape?

219
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,360
Maybe I just didn't want to.

220
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,920
You've committed countless atrocities.

221
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,080
Now, retribution has finally come
for you.

222
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,640
Retribution?

223
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,560
Oh, spare me the righteousness.

224
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,440
Who are you to stand for justice

225
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,000
and judge me as if I'm pure evil?

226
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:55,960
Listen.

227
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,040
I rose to the height of power

228
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,120
through my efforts.

229
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,680
How is that wrong?

230
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,040
You're blind to your sins

231
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,280
and shameless.

232
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,440
Empress Lv,

233
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,440
you're at your end.

234
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,000
Hand over Yinghuo.

235
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,880
So you've learned about Yinghuo.

236
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,440
That means Mei Ling is in your hands.

237
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,080
Don't trust her.

238
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,600
She won't give it to us.

239
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,560
What a touching couple you two make.

240
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,560
How disgusting.

241
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,760
Are you jealous?

242
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,320
You could've had all this.

243
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,640
My father favored you.

244
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,080
Yet you wanted more.

245
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,680
Mu Wuyin loved you deeply.

246
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,480
But you only used him.

247
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
What a joke!

248
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,120
Do you think I care about love?

249
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,760
If I were jealous of you,

250
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,240
it was your birthright.

251
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,160
Jiang Taohua,

252
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,880
you were born a princess,

253
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,200
protected by your noble family.

254
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,000
What would you know of my ambition?

255
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,840
Your father,

256
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,520
the so-called Emperor,

257
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,640
was a lustful fool.

258
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,280
Mu Wuyin was the son of an Emperor.
But he was weak and useless.

259
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,760
What do they have that I don't
besides noble birth?

260
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,280
Why should I bow to any of you?

261
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,160
I clawed my way to the top.

262
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,400
I'll rule this world!

263
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,400
No one

264
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,240
will ever step on me again!

265
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,800
Even without noble birth,

266
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,920
what makes you better than them?

267
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,080
You murdered loyal officials,
stole from the people,

268
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,840
and lived in luxury
while the people starved.

269
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,040
You've ruled Beiyuan into the ground
all these years.

270
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,400
The people are in misery,

271
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,880
and the state is crumbling.

272
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,720
Your downfall

273
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,000
is your own making.

274
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,840
What do you know?

275
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,240
You know nothing!

276
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:34,280
I had a grand vision for this land!

277
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,200
Chancellor,
no point talking sense with her.

278
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,320
She won't change.

279
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,520
Those are...

280
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,160
Yinghuo.

281
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,880
You want Yinghuo?

282
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,160
In your dreams!

283
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,240
I've already doused
this entire place in oil.

284
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,720
I'll burn Yinghuo to ash

285
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,760
right before your eyes!

286
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,840
Shen Zaiye,

287
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,960
I want you to watch
Jiang Taohua die in agony

288
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,040
because of your incompetence!

289
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,000
Finally starting to lose hope?

290
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,720
Die! All of you!

291
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,440
If it weren't for you,

292
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,440
I would've already ruled the world!

293
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,840
So long as you're dead,

294
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,640
no one in this world can stop me!

295
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,720
Taohua! Chancellor Shen! Lift this!

296
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,280
Taohua, lift it!

297
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,000
Qian Mochen, you traitor!

298
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,640
Master!

299
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,320
Taohua,

300
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,680
don't worry about me.

301
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:53,840
Just lift it!

302
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,440
You want to save her?

303
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,480
In your dreams!

304
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:12,800
Master!

305
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,760
Taohua, use more force!

306
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,440
Qian Mochen can't hold out much longer!

307
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,640
You can do it!

308
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:45,840
Go now!

309
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,440
Master!

310
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,720
Go! Run! Master! Live, Taohua.

311
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,120
Get out of here now!

312
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,240
Master.

313
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,680
You must live.

314
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,440
Go!

315
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:52,100
(Three days later)

316
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:23,560
Taohua,

317
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,400
you're awake.

318
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,200
Your Highness.

319
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:26,720
Taohua.

320
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,640
Do you want to get up?

321
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,600
Let me help.

322
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,280
Physician Mei, quickly!

323
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,320
Water...

324
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,640
Drink slowly.

325
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,800
Since Her Highness has awakened,

326
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,120
the poison from the Jiangtao Pill
must've been neutralized.

327
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:45,640
Really?

328
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,360
I'll prepare
some medicinal meals for you.

329
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,520
With a few days of rest,
you'll be back to full health.

330
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,000
Neutralized?

331
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,680
But Yinghuo was burned to ashes.

332
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:00,560
Qingtai,

333
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,240
where's the Chancellor?

334
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,600
(That day, Chancellor risked his life
to retrieve a single stalk of Yinghuo.)

335
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,061
(But it wasn't enough for both of you.)

(They're all mixed and complex.)

343
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,120
(He's now unconscious.)

344
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:57,920
(Physician Mei said,)

345
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,680
(we're just using medicine)

346
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,120
(to keep him alive for now)

347
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,909

Your Highness,

371
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,160
the Chancellor asked me

372
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
to give you this.

373
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,640
What is it?

374
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,400
Yinghuo seeds.

375
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,480
(Yinghuo needs

380
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,120

and yin-based plant.)

381
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,720

Physician Mei,

428
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,320
why hasn't he woken up

429
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,400
after taking the antidote?

430
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,640
The poison had already reached
his organs.

431
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,520
The damage it left behind

432
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,520
won't heal so easily.

433
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,600
His body is like a battlefield now.

434
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,560
The poison
and the antidote fought it out.

435
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,680
The antidote may have won the fight.

436
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,040
But what's left is a land torn by war.

437
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,680
Healing will take time.

438
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:01,760
Physician Mei,

439
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,400
is there any way to know how long?

440
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,680
That's the problem.

441
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,480
If we're lucky,

442
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,240
he could wake up tomorrow.

443
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,360
If not,

444
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,920
he may never wake again.

445
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,080
(Shen Zaiye,)

446
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,440

447
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,400

In three months,

450
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,280
snow will fall again in Beiyuan.

451
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,520
I remember

452
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,800
it snowed all the way

453
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,960
from winter into spring one time.

454
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,600
I cried and begged
to see the peach blossoms.

455
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,520
So my mother carried me

456
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,920

beneath the peach blossom tree.
