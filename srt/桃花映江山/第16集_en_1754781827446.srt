18
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:48,060
(Langhua Residence)

19
00:01:55,300 --> 00:02:01,180
(Forever)

20
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,040
Mu Wuxia.

21
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,240
You know,

22
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,880
you're actually quite good-looking.

23
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,120
Miss Qingying,

24
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,000
propriety dictates men and women

25
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,000
shouldn't be so familiar...

26
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,320
What's the harm?

27
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,040
Legend has it that any man and woman
who watch iron fireworks together

28
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,080
will stay together forever.

29
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,400
We already watched them together,

30
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,120
so shouldn't
we also stay together forever?

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,680
Only lovers can stay together forever.

32
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,280
But we...

33
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,000
Then, why don't we just become lovers?

34
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,320
I don't care.
We're going to be together.

35
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,120
Miss Qingying,

36
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,080
romance is no child's play.

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,280
If all you want is a game,

38
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,680
you should find someone else.

39
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,160
Mu Wuxia,

40
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,280
what are you writing now?

41
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,160
Nothing.

42
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,640
If you're going to bring up

43
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,520
the matter last night again,

44
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,680
don't bother...

45
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,440
No, that's not it.

46
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,120
I came to apologize.

47
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,590
If you eat this pastry,
you can't be angry anymore.

48
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,560
Eat it.

49
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,360
Not only that,

50
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,320
you must do me a favor.

51
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,600
What favor?

52
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,080
Rumor has it the Imperial Library
hides a secret door

53
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,680
and forbidden books.

54
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,400
Unfortunately,
only members of the imperial family

55
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,000
can enter.

56
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,640
Could you sneak me inside?

57
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,720
Forbidden books?

58
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,560
Maybe you shouldn't

59
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,840
read them.

60
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,560
But that's exactly

61
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,000
why they're interesting.

62
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,160
They're forbidden.

63
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:46,800
Come on!

64
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,920
Your Highness!

65
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,960
The poison has flared again.

66
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,600
We should've gone to Lan Boutique yesterday
to get the antidote.

67
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,400
He was with me all day.

68
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:43,880
Let's go.

69
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,320
To Lan Boutique.

70
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,280
Easy there.

71
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,060
(Closed)

72
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,720
Qingtai.

73
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,320
Be careful, Your Highness.

74
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,000
You've arranged such a poor operation.

75
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,040
Her Majesty has long planned this,

76
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,080
all for the sake of the silver
in the mine.

77
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,840
(That's Eunuch Ren.)

78
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,360
(What is he doing here?)

79
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,200
Now that Qi has seized the silver
into their treasury,

80
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,000
it'll require great effort to retrieve.

81
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,160
You all messed things up!

82
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,800
How am I supposed this
to report to Her Majesty?

83
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,120
Just tell her the truth.

84
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,000
(That voice...)

85
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,520
(I recognize it from somewhere.)

86
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,520
Tell the truth?

87
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,120
Easy for you to say.

88
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,640
Don't you know how much effort
Her Majesty put in?

89
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,920
I'm telling you,

90
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,240
the charge "failure to perform duties"

91
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,120
won't be dropped easily.

92
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,920
Mind your tone.

93
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,240
Just because

94
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,200
I don't observe every rule

95
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,320
doesn't mean

96
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,520
I'll tolerate disrespect from servants.

97
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,600
I came here under Her Majesty's decree.

98
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,640
I represent Her authority.

99
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,960
What can you do about it?

100
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,360
Represent Her Majesty?

101
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,560
And you think you deserve that?

102
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,060
(Lv)

103
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,880
You...

104
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,520
(That's Empress Lv's token.)

105
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,720
(Who is that man?)

106
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,240
Why do you have that?

107
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,520
Why would Her Majesty entrust you
with that?

108
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:04,560
That...

109
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,840
A mere eunuch

110
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,520
doesn't deserve
to know our relationship.

111
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,260
(Lv)

112
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:31,960
Who's there?

113
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,700
(Imperial Library)

114
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,060
(Seal)

115
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,360
Are you done?

116
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,040
What are these drawings?
Is this a martial arts manual?

117
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,480
I can't make heads or tails of it.

118
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,160
That...

119
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,200
That's not...

120
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,000
Hey!

121
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,400
Don't...

122
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,480
What's the big deal?

123
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,200
What's that noise?

124
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,320
Let's check it out.

125
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,320
We have to go!

126
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,560
Men, with me!

127
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,760
Check over there!

128
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,640
We must catch whoever sneaked

129
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,800
into the forbidden section,

130
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,960
or we'll all pay for it.

131
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,600
Any leads over there?

132
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,280
No.

133
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,320
Where could they have gone?

134
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,600
Check outside.

135
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:55,960
Let's go!

136
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,440
Mu Wuxia, they're gone.

137
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,360
Well?

138
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,680
My figure is lithe and graceful,

139
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,760
my bearing full of charm.

140
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,040
Have you had a change of heart?

141
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,480
Would you care to be my lover now?

142
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:43,720
You...

143
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,040
You're a lady. Have you no shame?

144
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,960
You should change out of those clothes.

145
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,240
What do you mean by that, Mu Wuxia?

146
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,560
Is my figure

147
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,120
that alarming?

148
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,640
Don't you dare speak of this to anyone!

149
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,500
(Lan Boutique)

150
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:28,880
Mr. Wuyin,

151
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,280
I apologize for my incompetence.

152
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:31,640
They escaped.

153
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,240
They couldn't have gone far

154
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,120
in such a short time.

155
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,200
We must find them.

156
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,360
Too much was revealed just now.

157
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,580
Even Your Highness
and Her Majesty's relationship was...

158
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,680
Your safety will be at risk

159
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,720
if they are not disposed of.

160
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,280
There's a patch of blood missing
on the door frame.

161
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,640
Whoever overheard

162
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,000
must have blood on them.

163
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,800
Check everyone
who's been near Lan Boutique

164
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,720
in the last two hours

165
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,440
at once.

166
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,240
Yes, Your Highness.

167
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,920
Please remove
your blood-stained garments,

168
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,520
Your Highness.

169
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,360
No need.

170
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,560
I must return to Lan Boutique.

171
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's imperative

172
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,280
that I get the antidote.

173
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,240
But returning there now is too risky.

174
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,400
I have a plan.

175
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:02,800
Wuxia.

176
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,080
Wuyin.

177
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,920
What are you doing here?

178
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,520
The streets are lively today.

179
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,440
I thought I'd come out for a stroll.

180
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,520
And you?

181
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,080
I was also
just wandering about the streets.

182
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,400
I got my outer robe soiled
while hurrying along,

183
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,320
so I bought a new set of clothes
to change into.

184
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,560
Hurrying along?

185
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,000
You're usually so composed.

186
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,680
What's the rush today?

187
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,560
Well...

188
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,680
I encountered an urgent matter.

189
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,720
It was unavoidable.

190
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,960
Wuyin, there are matters at my residence
that require my attention.

191
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,440
I must take my leave.

192
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,560
Have his itinerary scrutinized.

193
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,400
Yes, Your Highness.

194
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,680
Princess Chengping.

195
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,880
Prince Wuyin.

196
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,440
What's that on your sleeve?

197
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,160
It's nothing.

198
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,200
I dirtied my sleeve.

199
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,400
I must go to Lan Boutique
for a new set of clothes.

200
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,280
I'll excuse myself.

201
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,440
(A coincidence? I think not.)

202
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,200
(One of them must be the spy.)

203
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,840
You weren't summoned.

204
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,240
Why have you come here?

205
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,480
My poison flared up.

206
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,320
I have learned the task

207
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,080
Her Majesty ordered.

208
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,000
The painting concealed

209
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,720
the location of a silver mine.

210
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,200
I've marked

211
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,320
the mine's location in this letter.

212
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,840
The mine has been reclaimed
by the Emperor of Qi.

213
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,880
Please give me the antidote.

214
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,780
The matter with Prince Wugou
is already over.

215
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,160
Anyone who wanted to look into it
could have found this out.

216
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,880
You brought this news too late.

217
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,440
It's useless to Her Majesty.

218
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,880
Why would I give you the antidote?

219
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,720
I was trapped

220
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,240
at the stables

221
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,160
and couldn't pass on the message.

222
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,720
Please understand.

223
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,920
Whether you meant it or not,

224
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,200
you should know that your life

225
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,840
and your brother's life,

226
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,160
are both in Her Majesty's hands.

227
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,120
She spares no one who is of no use.

228
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,720
I understand.

229
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,120
I will give

230
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,400
my utmost

231
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,960
next time.

232
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,520
This half-dose

233
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,000
will ease the poison's grip,

234
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,560
though the pain and suffering
will persist.

235
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,840
Let this serve as penance

236
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,480
for your initial offense.

237
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,000
Do not ever

238
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,560
tarry again.

239
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,720
I understand.

240
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,960
When did you arrive?

241
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,520
As soon as the poison flared up.

242
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,000
Is there anything else?

243
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,640
You may leave.

244
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,820
(Shunjing Residence)

245
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,880
Your Highness wished to see me?

246
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,400
Be seated.

247
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,600
You're sure the blood

248
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,560
on Jiang Taohua was from the poison?

249
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,280
Yes.

250
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,720
The pain is akin
to thousands of insects gnawing

251
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,840
at your organs.

252
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,800
That can't be faked.

253
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,440
This is Soulsever Incense.

254
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,120
When lit, it dances with the wind.

255
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,440
Breathed in,

256
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,120
it severs the soul.

257
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,320
Your Highness

258
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,840
found the spy?

259
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,560
When I came out of Lan Boutique,

260
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,720
I ran into my fourth brother.

261
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,680
He looked panicked,

262
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,320
and he'd changed clothes.

263
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,680
It was him?

264
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,200
Whether it was or not,

265
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,120
he can't be left alive.

266
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,040
Wuxia has been going

267
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,760
to the Imperial Library
every day lately.

268
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,680
Give this incense to Jiang Taohua.

269
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,000
With her help,

270
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,000
things will go much smoother.

271
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,040
Also,

272
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,760
have people watch Mu Wuxia.

273
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,560
I will tolerate no mistake.

274
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,120
I understand.

275
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,320
I take my leave.

276
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,360
Oh, Wuxia,

277
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,920
I never wanted to kill you.

278
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,680
Alas,

279
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,120
fate has other plans.

280
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:49,940
(Shen Residence)

281
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,840
Yang Wanqing is despicable!

282
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,790
Only giving Your Highness
half an antidote.

283
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,520
It's fine.

284
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,160
As long as I don't die.

285
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,000
But Prince Wuyin...

286
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,520
(Lv)

287
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,120
That's no ordinary token.

288
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,960
When I was young,
I saw Empress Lv take it out once.

289
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,160
To behold that token is

290
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,440
to behold Empress Lv in person.

291
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,200
It represents great power.

292
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,520
I only saw it once in the palace

293
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,480
as a child.

294
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,080
I never thought

295
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,320
Prince Wuyin also had one.

296
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,840
So you think Prince Wuyin

297
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,320
and Empress Lv's accord

298
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,760
is no common alliance?

299
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,320
Your Highness,

300
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,960
Lan Boutique sent over

301
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,160
the latest fashionable fabrics.

302
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,600
(At the hour of Wei tomorrow,)

303
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:07,520
(see that this incense is burned
at the Imperial Library's Wuliu Residence)

304
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,400
(without fail.)

305
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,130
Chancellor, Wang Xi reports

306
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,960
that a suspicious individual
has been lurking

307
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,240
before Prince Wuxia's residence.

308
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,560
He has taken the liberty
of sketching a portrait

309
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:23,840
for your judgment.

310
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,440
When did this man show up?

311
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,560
Less than four hours ago.

312
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,240
Send more men.

313
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,640
Should there be any unusual movement,
seize him immediately.

314
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,000
Yes, sir.

315
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,800
Your Highness,
I've fetched the item you requested.

316
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:48,840
Put this on.

317
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,240
No one saw you, right?

318
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,520
Don't worry.

319
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,000
I avoided everyone on the way here.

320
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,960
The Chancellor is no longer

321
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,080
watching Zhengchun Boudoir.

322
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,920
We can come and go much more easily now.

323
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,920
Qi and Beiyuan may appear at peace

324
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,040
on the surface,

325
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,800
but beneath lies a turbulent current.

326
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,480
The future between him and me

327
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,760
remains uncertain.

328
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,640
Your Highness, I'm short-sighted.

329
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,520
I can't think that far ahead.

330
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,640
What matters to me now

331
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,880
is getting the rest of the antidote

332
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,480
from Yang Wanqing

333
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,040
to cure you.

334
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,280
The relationship
between Prince Wuyin and Empress Lv

335
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,680
leaves much to ponder.

336
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,800
This incense may well have been
arranged by Prince Wuyin himself.

337
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,720
Why would Prince Wuyin task you

338
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,280
with such

339
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,200
a baffling matter?

340
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,200
We'll have our answers

341
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,800
soon enough.

342
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,900
(A land may be wide,
yet its people define its borders.)

343
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,620
(A ruler rules with benevolence.
A minister serves with reverence.)

344
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,600
Well?

345
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,880
My figure is lithe and graceful,

346
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,880
my bearing full of charm.

347
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,160
Have you had a change of heart?

348
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,600
Would you care to be my lover now?

349
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,120
So Your Highness was reading here.

350
00:24:59,120 --> 00:24:59,520
Come.

351
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,880
Have some tea. Calm your mind.

352
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,400
Forget the tea.

353
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,200
I should head to the Imperial Library

354
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,160
at this hour.

355
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,400
I can find peace there.

356
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:20,360
Come on.

357
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,680
I just brewed this tea.

358
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,640
Won't you try some?

359
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,120
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

360
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,440
Might I know

361
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,480
who you're looking for?

362
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,160
I want him alive.

363
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:33,840
Yes, sir!

364
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,360
After him!

365
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,380
(To think such a formidable foe
dwells within the city.)

366
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,560
Out of my way!

367
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,440
What's your problem?

368
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:52,880
I was unaware Yujing concealed

369
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,880
a martial expert of your skill.

370
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,280
Speak.

371
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,760
Who sent you to spy on Prince Wuxia?

372
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,440
What do you intend?

373
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,160
No matter what my master's goal was,

374
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,040
you will never know.

375
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
He had a poison sac tied
to his tooth with thread.

376
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,080
It has been there for some time.

377
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,680
Agile,

378
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,000
trained,

379
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,520
and skilled at escape.

380
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,680
Zhan Lu.

381
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,920
You've failed in your duty.

382
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,400
An unknown force operating in Yujing

383
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,560
and you only realized when they acted?

384
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,120
I've been derelict in my duties.

385
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,200
(Prince Wuxia has always been
a prince in name only.)

386
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,880
(He holds no post)

387
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,200
(and no real power.)

388
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,760
(Who would want him dead?)

389
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,000
(And what good would it do?)

390
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,400
Chancellor.

391
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,150
Prince Wuxia never involved himself
in court politics.

392
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,800
You feared that your actions

393
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,960
might implicate His Highness,

394
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,240
to the point that you two can't even
acknowledge each other

395
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,440
and must pretend to be at odds.

396
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,440
We have gone to such lengths,

397
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,440
yet, an assassin has still been sent.

398
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,240
Is it possible that someone has learned

399
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,360
of your connection

400
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,960
and is trying to leverage him
against you?

401
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:14,920
Impossible.

402
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,440
If they really knew of my connection

403
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,000
with Prince Wuxia,

404
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,400
they would threaten me for leverage.

405
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,480
Why risk assassinating a prince?

406
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,640
Since they're skilled at staying hidden,

407
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,640
I'll do the opposite.

408
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,080
Wang Xi.

409
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,560
Starting today,

410
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,700
everything at Prince Wuxia's residence
stays the same.

411
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:35,720
Zhan Lu,

412
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,560
pull back all our men.

413
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,040
This time,

414
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,320
we're going after the big fish.

415
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:48,100
(Shen Residence)

416
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,600
Your Highness,

417
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,240
the insects were just fine earlier

418
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,360
when they smelled the incense.

419
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,560
Now they're all dead.

420
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,600
This poison is finely made.

421
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,920
At first, it releases a fragrance

422
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,600
that soothes the mind
and lowers one's guard.

423
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,760
But when the toxin
in the scent builds up,

424
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,320
it kills instantly.

425
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,920
The ashes then scatter with the wind.

426
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,080
Those bugs never stood a chance.

427
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,760
If this were used on people,

428
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,720
they would not even know how they died.

429
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,880
Such potent poison.

430
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,080
I wonder if it was made
by Prince Wuyin or Empress Lv.

431
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,520
Whoever ordered it,

432
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,440
they wouldn't waste this effort

433
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,320
on someone unimportant.

434
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:58,840
(So,)

435
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,000
(who exactly does Yang Wanqing)

436
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,760
(want me to kill?)

437
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,800
(Prince Wuxia never involved himself
in court politics.)

438
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,520
(You feared that your actions)

439
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,720
(might implicate His Highness,)

440
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,160
(to the point that you two can't even
acknowledge each other.)

441
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,680
(Yet, an assassin has still been sent.)

442
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,480
It's late.

443
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,920
What are you doing here?

444
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,080
I couldn't sleep,
so I thought I'd take a stroll.

445
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,440
What about you?

446
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,040
Drinking by yourself

447
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,040
at this hour.

448
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,440
Did someone upset you?

449
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,480
Someone touched
what they should not have.

450
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,520
Who would dare pull your whiskers?

451
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,280
Have you not

452
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,160
done the same yourself?

453
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,040
Good wine.

454
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,560
What's on your mind?

455
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,360
I was thinking

456
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,160
it's still summer here.

457
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,000
In three months,

458
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,960
snow will fall in Beiyuan.

459
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,200
You're from Qi.

460
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,000
Maybe you've never seen snow that deep.

461
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,720
The whole world turns white.

462
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,440
I remember one year,

463
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,800
Beiyuan's snow fell

464
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,800
from winter into spring.

465
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:13,160
The peach blossom tree
outside my mother's palace

466
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,800
never even budded.

467
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,120
I kept crying about wanting
to see the blossoms,

468
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,320
so she held me and watched the snow

469
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,920
under the peach tree.

470
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,000
It snows every year.

471
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,560
There's always next year.

472
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,400
Yes.

473
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,680
It snows every year.

474
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,080
Someday, I'll return to Beiyuan.

475
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,800
To see the peach blossoms.

476
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,440
To see the snow.

477
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,480
What's wrong?

478
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,080
It's nothing.

479
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,800

480
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:24,720
