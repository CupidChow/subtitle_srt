00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,510
(Adapted from the novel "Peach Blossoms
Reflecting the River and Mountains")

16
00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:40,980
(by Bai Lu Cheng Shuang)

17
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,900
=Episode 5=

18
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,880
I wonder where does Jiang Taohua

19
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,960
learn all her seducing tricks.

20
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,120
She only came to the residence
not long ago

21
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,780
but the chancellor treats her so well.

22
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,880
I only told you to pretend.

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,860
There was no need
to be so immersed in the act.

24
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,240
It has to look real.

25
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,520
If we are in love,

26
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,760
you must be

27
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,000
the most spoiled woman here, Lady Jiang.

28
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,400
I'll become the target
of everyone's jealousy

29
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,480
and everyone will be against me.

30
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,040
You are smart indeed.

31
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,610
In the future,
this will happen more frequently.

32
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,790
Just get used to it.

33
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,880
Does it include

34
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,160
taking my bed and letting me
have nowhere to sleep?

35
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,120
Lady Jiang, if you feel tired,

36
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,520
you can get on at any time.

37
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,400
I'll wait for you.

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,640
No need.

39
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,040
Zhenzhen.

40
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,080
Forgive me for saying this.

41
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,480
It's neither the new year
nor a festival.

42
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,600
Why does the chancellor
gather us for a meal?

43
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,240
This is all thanks to Jiang.

44
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,610
She has been
serving the chancellor well recently.

45
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,320
I'm sure it's livelier
to have everyone eat together.

46
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,360
Having a meal together
might be a happy occasion

47
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,040
but Jiang's behaviour is not right.

48
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,840
How can she let you sit here

49
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,240
and wait for her, Meng?

50
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,480
Exactly.

51
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,360
Chancellor.

52
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,920
You know

53
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,920
what they say about me.

54
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,080
They say I'm a princess

55
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,320
but I got married without a ceremony.

56
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:19,460
They call me cheap and an embarrassment
to my kingdom and my people.

57
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,320
I can't live like this anymore.

58
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,280
I'd rather knock myself dead.

59
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,520
That's enough.

60
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,000
Concubines of Qi have always been

61
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,160
carried inside through the side door
with a small palanquin.

62
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,160
Moreover,

63
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,600
haven't I treated you well enough?

64
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,440
Must we argue for some empty reputation?

65
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,000
It's not an empty reputation.

66
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,120
It's your attitude.

67
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,720
What did you tell me last night?

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,680
You said you'd bring me the moon

69
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,080
if I wanted it.

70
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,920
Besides, Beiyuan

71
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,800
doesn't have so many rules like Qi.

72
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,520
I only know
that if I meet the person I love,

73
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,440
I must tell everyone about it.

74
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:56,880
Nonsense.

75
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,640
If you couldn't accept it,

76
00:04:58,660 --> 00:04:59,600
why would you marry me?

77
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,400
Everything is settled now.

78
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,690
If we do the ceremony,
the Meng family will be embarrassed.

79
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,940
They say the people of Beiyuan
are straightforward and passionate.

80
00:05:11,952 --> 00:05:13,290
They love and hate without holding back.

81
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,660
I've finally experienced it today.

82
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,640
Jiang isn't an arrogant person.

83
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,240
Her request today

84
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,560
proves that

85
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,280
she cares about you deeply, Chancellor.

86
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,400
I'm very happy

87
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,800
to see how much she loves you.

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,200
I will never feel embarrassed.

89
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,560
Since Zhenzhen said that,

90
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,520
if you still stop me,

91
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,320
just don't come to me

92
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,720
and talk about love anymore.

93
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,990
My wife is virtuous
and is willing to be the kind one.

94
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,440
How can I object at all?

95
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,160
Zhenzhen,

96
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,760
you said

97
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,680
you didn't mind organizing
a ceremony for me.

98
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,480
Is it true?

99
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,560
Jiang, you are royalty.

100
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,760
If fate hadn't brought us together,
we wouldn't be relatives.

101
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,560
Chancellor,

102
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,080
when can we eat?

103
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,840
This is a new ingredient
sent here this morning.

104
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,240
Try it, Jiang.

105
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,680
Jiang, you are from the north.

106
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,720
Do you not know how to eat prawns?

107
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,240
I know how to eat prawns

108
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,120
but I don't want to.

109
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,560
However,

110
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,440
the reason is very childish.

111
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,760
I can't bear to say it.

112
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,560
Tell us.

113
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,160
When I was young,

114
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,600
my father

115
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,440
would peel the prawns

116
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,360
for my mother when I was young.

117
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,200
Back then,

118
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,720
I was deeply moved

119
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,880
by their relationship.

120
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,240
So, I've decided

121
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,790
not to eat prawns in the future

122
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,440
if they aren't peeled

123
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,160
by my husband.

124
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,640
I think

125
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,440
you'll never get to eat prawns forever.

126
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,720
The chancellor is busy.

127
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,320
He will never be free to...

128
00:08:00,338 --> 00:08:01,738
The prawn peeled by my husband

129
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,120
is extremely delicious indeed.

130
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,760
I want another one.

131
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,240
If my mother knows about this
in the underworld,

132
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,400
she will surely feel glad for me

133
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,040
for finding a man

134
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,080
who's as good as my father.

135
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,040
I'll eat one as well.

136
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,360
Chancellor.

137
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,480
Get the kitchen

138
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:36,960
to make another plate.

139
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,520
What else do you want?

140
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,280
I want you

141
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,120
to cook it for me.

142
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,300
Don't ask for more than you should.

143
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,360
Chancellor, you told me

144
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,560
I can ask for anything I want.

145
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,080
Are you going back on your words now?

146
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,400
Enough.

147
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,980
Tell the kitchen to prepare the prawns.

148
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,400
It's just an act.

149
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,040
Are you really going to ask me to cook?

150
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,520
Chancellor,

151
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,800
the last person who cooked prawns for me
was my mother.

152
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:38,960
You are so nice.

153
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,360
Let go.

154
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,600
Someone is watching.

155
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,400
If you don't let go,

156
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,080
how can I cook?

157
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,120
I heard that Beiyuan people
like beef and lamb.

158
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,140
They usually use this
to season their dishes.

159
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,480
In that case,

160
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:45,880
you will

161
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,760
be able to enjoy the dish.

162
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,280
Let go.

163
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,240
I make this personally for you.

164
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,120
Lady Jiang,

165
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,320
you must finish it.

166
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,720
Someone's watching.

167
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,380
You've been drinking water
the whole night.

168
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,040
Are you a water jar
in your previous life?

169
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,890
Why don't you try eating
a whole plate of cumin yourself?

170
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,120
I didn't expect you

171
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,160
to know how to cook, Chancellor.

172
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,840
That's nothing special about it.

173
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,240
I don't come from a noble family.

174
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,560
Little wretch with no parents.

175
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,480
Peel all the prawns.

176
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,760
If you don't peel them all,

177
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,840
I'll kill you.

178
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,680
Peel them quickly!

179
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,320
Today's act

180
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:28,720
wasn't bad.

181
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,960
Can the value I show you

182
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,280
earn me an opportunity from you?

183
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,640
I've never been stingy

184
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,300
when it comes to

185
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,540
treating someone as wise as you,
Lady Jiang.

186
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,420
Thank you, Chancellor.

187
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:47,760
Go to sleep.

188
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,640
Don't let anyone see through our act.

189
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,600
(Jiang Taohua)

190
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,440
(is really good at acting.)

191
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,840
(Her words and actions)

192
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,240
(cannot be trusted easily.)

193
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,880
(If you give me a chance,)

194
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,480
(I will make you believe me.)

195
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,800
No matter how I look,

196
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,640
this is just a normal scroll.

197
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,400
Where is the secret hiding?

198
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,400
Security in the residence is tight.

199
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:47,490
The chancellor
is probably keeping a close eye on me.

200
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,180
I don't feel safe
keeping the scroll for one more day.

201
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,120
Using the opportunity
provided by Lady Jiang's ceremony,

202
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,960
I can use this chance

203
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,150
to hand the painting over
to His Highness

204
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,590
because many people will be visit.

205
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,480
He can study it on his own.

206
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,280
However, the chancellor's kindness
to Lady Jiang seems weird.

207
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,490
What if the chancellor
is waiting for you to make a mistake?

208
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,760
Will the chancellor spare us

209
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,400
if I don't make a mistake?

210
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,280
We avoided it by using Lady Jiang
in the study incident.

211
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,640
Even if the chancellor
purposely gives us an opportunity,

212
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,280
we still have to take it.

213
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,880
This is an obvious scheme.

214
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,120
Don't worry.

215
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,480
I know what I'm doing.

216
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,600
Keep the painting well.

217
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,440
Don't let others find out.

218
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:43,600
Yes.

219
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,740
(Shen Residence)

220
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,720
Deliver this to the Heir's Residence.

221
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,360
The stage is set.

222
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,580
We are just waiting
for His Highness to appear.

223
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,080
Understood.

224
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,480
What about Lady Jiang?

225
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,120
She is cunning
and not to be underestimated.

226
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,550
You must keep an eye on her
during the ceremony.

227
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,360
The Sunlight over a Thousand Peaks
painting must not fall into her hands.

228
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,200
Yes.

229
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,960
I heard Miss Qingying
has entered the city.

230
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,320
Should we inform her about the ceremony?

231
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,560
Qingying is hard to predict.

232
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,880
Send someone to keep an eye on her
during the ceremony.

233
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,320
Don't let her cause any trouble.

234
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,440
Yes.

235
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,060
(Yujing)

236
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Whose son is this?

237
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,480
A wanderer from You and Bing.

238
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,040
It has not been safe recently.

239
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,200
Have you heard?

240
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,920
There's a human trafficker in Nancheng.

241
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,520
I know.

242
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,560
They kidnap young ladies

243
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,560
(Xiang Qingying, Shen Zaiye's Sworn Sister)
and sell them to brothels.

244
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,000
(Xiang Qingying, Shen Zaiye's Sworn Sister)
A few days ago, they made a lady go mad.

245
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,879
(Xiang Qingying, Shen Zaiye's Sworn Sister)
You must keep an eye on your daughter.

246
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,080
Don't go out recently.

247
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,240
It's too dangerous.

248
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,080
This place is a mess.

249
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,440
Darn it.

250
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,120
I'll tell her.

251
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,840
I'll surely deal with this matter.

252
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,800
Stay away!

253
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,440
I beg you!

254
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:16,680
Come here.

255
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,600
What did you say?

256
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,360
Pervert, stop!

257
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,040
Help! It's a kidnapping!

258
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:23,920
Help!

259
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:25,880
You...

260
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,800
Come down.

261
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,200
You...

262
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,880
Everyone, they are human traffickers!

263
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,880
Report him to the officials!

264
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,640
What are you talking about?

265
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,400
Everyone, I'm sorry.

266
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,200
This is my sister.

267
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,520
She has a problem with her brain.

268
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,280
I'm embarrassed.

269
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,240
Who's your sister?

270
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,880
Don't trust him! He is a human trafficker!

271
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,080
Go away! Stop looking.

272
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,190
There's nothing to see here.

273
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,320
Go away! Go!

274
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,080
Quick! What's there to see?

275
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,720
Move!

276
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:49,800
Get down quickly!

277
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,480
Do you hear me?

278
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,040
Quickly!

279
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,990
What are you looking at?

280
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,440
I'll gouge your eyes out.

281
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,280
Young Lady,

282
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,920
I was only walking by

283
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,440
but you hit me with a stone.

284
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,700
Not only did you not apologise to me,
but you also think you're right.

285
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:23,760
Young Master,

286
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,960
let me apologise

287
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,000
on my sister's behalf.

288
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,800
Both of you, let her come down.

289
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,640
I'll talk to her in the house.

290
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,440
Young Master,

291
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,410
my sister is still young and is insensible.

292
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,240
Please forgive her.

293
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,640
She's obviously bullying me.

294
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,840
As her brother, you'll only harm her
if you keep protecting her.

295
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,600
Do you understand?

296
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,560
Help!

297
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,120
Someone is kidnapping a lady!

298
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,000
Help!

299
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,309
Run!

300
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:49,980
- Help!
- Stop!

301
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,980
- Don't run!
- Don't run!

302
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,720
Kid, it was urgent just now.

303
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,120
Sorry.

304
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,160
It's terrible!

305
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,040
Miss Qingying is back!

306
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,160
Miss Qingying is back!

307
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,440
- Heroine, welcome home!
- Heroine, welcome home!

308
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,600
I, the heroine,

309
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,720
have returned!

310
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,120
Are you the Beiyuan Princess
who is running rampant in the residence?

311
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,560
I heard
you've completely charmed my brother.

312
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,080
No one dares to offend you
because of how much he spoils you.

313
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,600
However, you look frail.

314
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,360
How are you so capable?

315
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,920
You must be Qingying
whom the Chancellor mentions often.

316
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,200
I am hurt

317
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,920
and can't stand and greet you.

318
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,920
Please forgive me.

319
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,880
You are indeed my brother's type.

320
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,760
What type?

321
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:17,580
Pretentious.

322
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,720
Her Highness isn't pretentious.

323
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,000
The chancellor, on the other hand,
is very pretentious.

324
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:25,960
Who are you?

325
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,640
Her Highness' maid,

326
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,280
Qingtai.

327
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,840
Are you the maid Zhan Lu mentioned
who's good at martial arts?

328
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,520
I've been trying to spar with Zhan Lu,
but he is always rejecting me

329
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,180
with the excuse
that he's just a servant.

330
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,200
If he praises you,
that means you are capable as well.

331
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,880
Why don't you spar with me?

332
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:02,660
(Zhengchun Boudoir)

333
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,200
Stop.

334
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,840
How dare you offend Miss Qingying.

335
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,120
Zaiye, it's not what it seems.

336
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,880
It hurts.

337
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,920
I think my wound has opened up again.

338
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,990
Take me back inside
and apply medicine for me.

339
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,600
Zaiye,

340
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,760
why is your concubine so pretentious?

341
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:39,920
She's being dramatic.

342
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,320
You're complaining?

343
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:43,520
Look at yourself.

344
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,280
You've caused trouble
as soon as you returned.

345
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:47,980
I'm confining you
in your room for three days.

346
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:49,760
No complaints.

347
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:51,120
Zhan Lu, take her back.

348
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,600
The chancellor's sister
is trouble indeed.

349
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:07,340
She caused trouble
as soon as she returned.

350
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,760
Qingying is reckless

351
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,480
and righteous.

352
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,520
If she causes trouble

353
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,600
and interrupts the chancellor,

354
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,640
it is a good thing

355
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,120
for us.

356
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:29,060
(Zhengchun Boudoir)

357
00:21:31,274 --> 00:21:32,954
First stroke until the end.

358
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:35,980
Looking pretty in the mirror
and the rouge looks like snow.

359
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,120
Second stroke until the end.

360
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,760
Meeting at the magpie bridge
as a pair of mandarin ducks soar.

361
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,520
Third stroke until the end.

362
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,440
Husband and wife
live in harmony forever.

363
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,840
That evil chancellor is so lucky

364
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,200
to see such a pretty lady twice.

365
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:04,880
Where did you learn

366
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,680
all this flattery?

367
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,560
It's still the same face.

368
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,280
This wedding ceremony is much better
compared to the previous one.

369
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,000
This is a ceremony fit for you.

370
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,760
However,

371
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,600
the guests are too few.

372
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,040
It's fine.

373
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,720
That is not the objective
of this ceremony.

374
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,280
The chancellor might have a sharp tongue,

375
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,720
but he is right about one thing.

376
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,960
I'm only useful to him.

377
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,960
So, I must get

378
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,120
the Sunlight over a Thousand Peaks
painting before him this time.

379
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:37,840
That is the only way

380
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,190
he can sit together with me
and speak to me nicely.

381
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
You must be alert

382
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,160
in today's banquet.

383
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,410
Don't worry, Your Highness.

384
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,960
Graceful is the peach tree,

385
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,040
radiant are its blossoms.

386
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,760
You really do live up to your name.

387
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,960
That's too much praise, Chancellor.

388
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,400
However, I've never been needed

389
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,280
in your garden full of blossoms.

390
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,880
It's exactly that I don't need it.

391
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,690
Which is why
I don't care about losing you.

392
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,880
Today, you better be honest

393
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,960
and complete the act.

394
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,040
Don't cause trouble.

395
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,000
I will guarantee you
a peaceful life forever.

396
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,760
However,
you only get one chance, Lady Jiang.

397
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,560
If you fail this time,

398
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,440
don't blame me

399
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,240
for not forgiving you.

400
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,520
Yes.

401
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,160
My life is on the line
with this promise.

402
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,960
I won't treat it lightly.

403
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:21,880
That's good to hear.

404
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,460
(Happiness.)

405
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:48,420
(Shen Residence)

406
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,540
(Shen Residence)

407
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,360
His Highness is here!

408
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,040
Your Highness.

409
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,100
One does look better
during an auspicious occasion.

410
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,640
I've not seen you for days

411
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,300
and you've looked a lot better,

412
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,760
Chancellor Shen.

413
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,040
What happened at Luyeyuan

414
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,080
was caused by my concubine's illness.

415
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,320
I was anxious

416
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,360
and lost my composure.

417
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,560
I can forgive you

418
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,080
for being rude to me once.

419
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,720
After today,

420
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,880
if you dare behave rudely to me

421
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,000
and trample on
the reputation of Qi royalty,

422
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,280
I'll see you

423
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,400
as being disrespectful.

424
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,120
I was wondering
who was acting so high and mighty

425
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,880
without respecting
Chancellor Shen's big day.

426
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,580
(Mu Wuhen, Second Prince of Qi State)

427
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,720
(Mu Wuhen, Second Prince of Qi State)
Turns out it's my brother.

428
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,310
That's right.

429
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,390
I thought about it for a long time,

430
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,300
but it seems like
Chancellor Shen doesn't need anything.

431
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,680
So, I purposely asked someone

432
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,480
to get a Penglaihong.

433
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,760
It is the best treasure
in all of Donghai.

434
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,990
Place it in your residence
to get rid of your bad luck.

435
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,200
Wuhen, you're here?

436
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,200
He's only marrying a concubine.

437
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,960
Why are you being so generous?

438
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,320
It's a wedding ceremony.

439
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,760
I must give a lavish gift.

440
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,960
Otherwise, others might call me stingy.

441
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,260
These two people
have always been against each other.

442
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,100
Keep an eye on them.

443
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,990
Prevent any trouble
from interfering with my plan.

444
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,960
I'm sure Wuhen heard about

445
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,080
my confrontation

446
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,880
with Shen Zaiye at Luyeyuan

447
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,440
and came to pledge his alliance.

448
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:58,880
Act smart later.

449
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,399
Don't worry, Your Highness.

450
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,220
I won't allow Prince Wuhen
to spoil your plan.

451
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:04,720
Chancellor Shen.

452
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:07,960
Prince Wuxia.

453
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,360
Have you seen Wuyin?

454
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,920
Prince Wuyin

455
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,560
hates occasions like these.

456
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,960
He will never attend.

457
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,040
I thought Wugou and Wuhen
wouldn't be here,

458
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,640
so I begged Wuyin

459
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,960
to attend.

460
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,040
Prince Wuxia, you care about

461
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,880
Lady Jiang a lot.

462
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,990
Chancellor Shen,
there's no need to be sarcastic.

463
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,680
The princess is refined

464
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,840
and pure.

465
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,400
Naturally, I can't bear
to see her being bullied.

466
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,080
The auspicious hour is here!

467
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,940
(Virtue alone carries enduring grace)

468
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:53,380
(Happiness)

469
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,760
Congratulations, Chancellor Shen.

470
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,840
Beiyuan's princess is so pretty.

471
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,840
Congratulations, Chancellor Shen.

472
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,120
- Congratulations, Chancellor Shen.
- Congratulations, Chancellor Shen.

473
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:02,760
Congratulations.

474
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,400
Chancellor Shen, you are blessed.

475
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,320
Congratulations, Chancellor Shen.

476
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,200
The ritual is completed!

477
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,120
Wuyin!

478
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,160
Don't cause trouble
on Chancellor Shen's big day.

479
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,240
(Mu Wuyin, Third Prince of Qi State)
I'm giving him this gift

480
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,200
(Mu Wuyin, Third Prince of Qi State)

481
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,540
(Mu Wuyin, Third Prince of Qi State)
exactly because it's his big day.

482
00:29:56,047 --> 00:29:56,607
Wuyin!

483
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,040
As a prince,
you are playing music for dancers.

484
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,440
That's ridiculous.

485
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,400
Wugou.

486
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,240
Wuyin

487
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,600
is someone who dares argue with Father

488
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,600
about learning Taoism in the great hall.

489
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,690
There's no need
to expect him to be proper.

490
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:15,150
Tell me. Which of you is more absurd?

491
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:23,680
Chancellor Shen,

492
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,520
are you satisfied

493
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,240
with my celebratory performance?

494
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,600
I'm a brute
who knows nothing about music.

495
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,280
However, I can hear
that it originates from the North.

496
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,200
Thank you, Prince Wuyin.

497
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,800
The place is full

498
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,640
but no one understands my music.

499
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,360
I got married today

500
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:55,700
and am lucky to have all of you
grace the occasion with your presence.

501
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,240
I'm very grateful.

502
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,440
Cheers.

503
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,040
Wuyin,

504
00:31:02,006 --> 00:31:03,086
where did you learn

505
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,840
how to play the music from the North?

506
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,000
Whether it's Qi or Beiyuan,

507
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,280
music

508
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,880
is always connected.

509
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,160
Madam, Qingying is here.

510
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,320
Qingying, come here.

511
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,240
I've asked someone
to make your favourite food.

512
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,100
I didn't expect you
to release me from my confinement.

513
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,400
Thank you.

514
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:35,840
You are
the chancellor's precious sister.

515
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,440
How can you be absent
on such an auspicious occasion?

516
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,120
It's all because of
that pretentious Jiang Taohua.

517
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,760
I was confined by my brother
as soon as I came back.

518
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,880
Lady Jiang is different from us.

519
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,480
A few days ago,

520
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,600
the chancellor even cooked for her.

521
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,640
I can see how much
the chancellor loves her.

522
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:56,760
What?

523
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,120
My brother cooked for Lady Jiang?

524
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,240
Darn it.

525
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,200
I've never tried Zaiye's cooking.

526
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:04,790
Who does she think she is
to try it before me?

527
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,300
Not only have you not tried his cooking,

528
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,480
but Madam and the other ladies
of the residence

529
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,080
haven't seen the chancellor cook before.

530
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:10,600
Yuetao.

531
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:11,480
Quiet.

532
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,400
Don't overthink, Qingying.

533
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,960
Today is an auspicious day.

534
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,080
If you speak too much,

535
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,560
the chancellor will be unhappy.

536
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,120
I'm unhappy too.

537
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,310
Your Highness, please stay.

538
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:31,520
Prince Wuxia.

539
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,440
Spare the formalities.

540
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,500
I haven't been able to visit
since you got hurt that day.

541
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,880
Have your injuries been healing well?

542
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,080
I'm completely healed now.

543
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:42,880
Thank you for worrying about me.

544
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,760
I'm grateful.

545
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,400
I don't know what's the rule in Beiyuan.

546
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,360
How can Lady Jiang speak to other men

547
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,240
at her wedding?

548
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,480
All right.

549
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,960
Lady Jiang,

550
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,240
I offended you a few days ago.

551
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,200
I won't bully you
because you don't know martial arts.

552
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,240
They say you can become good friends
if you drink together.

553
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,460
Let's have a competition in drinking.

554
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,680
If we drink a lot,

555
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,160
we'll become friends.

556
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,400
The nerd who got beaten up?

557
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,640
It's you?

558
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,200
Did you come to get revenge

559
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,640
because I beat you up last time?

560
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,240
I...

561
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,840
You are really petty for a man.

562
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,600
Young Lady.

563
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,200
You hit me

564
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,720
and you called me petty?

565
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,360
Don't misunderstand, Qingying.

566
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,280
This is the Fourth Prince,

567
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,520
Mu Wuxia.

568
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,600
The Fourth Prince?

569
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,920
Wasn't he the one
you were going to be betrothed to?

570
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,340
Don't simply make assumptions.

571
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,880
We are just friends.

572
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,780
(Distraction)

573
00:34:18,207 --> 00:34:19,647
Distraction?

574
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,000
Chancellor,

575
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,900
they are making their move now.

576
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,440
Mu Wuhen.

577
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,360
How dare you try to sow discord
between me and Chancellor Shen.

578
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,400
What is your intention?

579
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,760
Wugou, what are you talking about?

580
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,200
Do you want me to tell everyone

581
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:01,800
what you said during the toast you made?

582
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,960
What are you doing?

583
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:04,800
Excuse me.

584
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:09,920
Your Highnesses,

585
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,600
today is my big day.

586
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,840
Please try to make up

587
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,120
and stay harmonious.

588
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,600
Sorry for affecting your mood,
Chancellor Shen.

589
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,680
I'm going to get changed.

590
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,560
Bring Prince Wugou to get changed.

591
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,280
Yes.

592
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,000
He's mad.

593
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:32,380
(He will probably
use this opportunity to act.)

594
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,990
(I need to find someone
to keep an eye on him.)

595
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,360
Your Highness, this way.

596
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:52,960
Your Highness.

597
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,560
I've prepared everything.

598
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,790
This time, we will surely
hold the chancellor back

599
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,500
and let Madam Meng deliver the painting.

600
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,360
I can still drink!

601
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,200
Fine. I know.

602
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,160
Let me tell you.

603
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,280
I think you must accompany me.

604
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:09,960
Let me go!

605
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,800
Help!

606
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,920
Which preposterous person is it?

607
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,440
Help!

608
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,400
I'll beat you to death!

609
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,240
Let go! Help!

610
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,240
How dare you!

611
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,960
How dare you do
such perverted things in my residence!

612
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:23,880
Help!

613
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:25,760
Zhan Lu.

614
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,300
Get Eunuch Wen here immediately.

615
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,000
Are you afraid...

616
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,480
Go quickly!

617
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,120
Yes.

618
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:29,760
Stop!

619
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:32,960
Help!

620
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:34,840
Who are you?

621
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,000
Why do you care?

622
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,680
I'm going to beat you up, you pervert!

623
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,560
Insolent!

624
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,280
Stop!

625
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,520
Qingying, don't be rude.

626
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,720
He is the heir.

627
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:43,840
Let go!

628
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:44,760
The heir?

629
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,160
Nonsense!

630
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,320
He's just a pervert!

631
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:47,800
Stop.

632
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,200
Zaiye.

633
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:50,600
Zaiye.

634
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:52,640
Don't speak.

635
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,120
My sister is reckless.

636
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,040
If she offended Your Highness,

637
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,960
I hope you can be the bigger person.

638
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:01,800
Let me

639
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,480
apologise on her behalf.

640
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,160
Is this your sister?

641
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,160
I thought she was an assassin.

642
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,800
Assassinating the heir
is a serious crime.

643
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,980
Technically speaking,
she must be imprisoned.

644
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,480
However,
she is Chancellor Shen's sister.

645
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:20,680
This...

646
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,400
It's troublesome for me.

647
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:41,640
Your Highness.

648
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,160
I see Yuetao going out.

649
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,120
What should we do?

650
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,760
Chancellor Shen
is Qi's Left Chancellor.

651
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,240
I'm sure he will be fair.

652
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,160
He will never be lenient

653
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,800
because the perpetrator is his sister.

654
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,200
