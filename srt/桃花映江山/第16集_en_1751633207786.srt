00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,840
Thank you.

2
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,160
Rap His Majesty's wish,

3
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,840
even if I should face my enemies,

4
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,340
no one will ever marry me.

5
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,680
Another night,

6
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,400
they are her pandemic companion.

7
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,240
Please be expecting.

8
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,880
She even woke me up.

9
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,160
nãooheir

10
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,480
You're looking great

11
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,080
Only couples can be together for a long time.

12
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,480
We...

13
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,360
Then we should be a couple, too.

14
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,320
I don't care.

15
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,640
We should be together.

16
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,560
Miss Qingying.

17
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,480
Love is not a game.

18
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,520
If you only want to have fun,

19
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,800
you should find someone else.

22
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,240
Mu Xia.

23
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,400
What are you writing again?

24
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,360
Nothing.

25
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,960
If Miss Qian Yin is here to tell me about Zuo Yan,

26
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,800
you don't need to...

27
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,480
No.

28
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,560
I'm here to apologize.

29
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,920
You can't be angry after eating this cake.

30
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,800
Eat it.

31
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,800
You can't be angry,

32
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,800
but you have to do me a favor.

33
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,800
What is it?

34
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,280
I heard that there is a secret door in the library.

35
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,800
There are many forbidden books.

36
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,320
But only those who carry jade can enter.

37
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,800
Can you take me in secretly?

38
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Forbidden books?

39
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,520
Since it's forbidden books,

40
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,960
I'd better not read it.

41
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,680
You don't understand.

42
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,920
It's because it's forbidden books

43
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,280
that it looks wonderful.

44
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:58,720
Let's go.

45
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,240
No.

46
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,160
No.

47
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,040
No.

48
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:30,800
Your Highness.

49
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,400
Your Highness.

50
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,280
It's poisonous again.

51
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,000
Yesterday, we should go to Lanying Palace to get the antidote.

52
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,840
Yesterday,

53
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,720
she was always by my side.

54
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,640
Let's go to Lanying Palace.

55
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,240
Slow down.

56
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,360
I'll go with you.

57
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,120
Go.

58
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,760
Go.

59
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,480
Go.

60
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,080
Go.

61
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,760
Go.

62
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,440
Go.

63
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,160
Go.

64
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:50,760
Go.

65
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,560
Go.

66
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,040
Go.

67
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,640
Go.

68
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,280
Go.

69
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:53,800
Go.

70
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,640
Go.

71
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,280
Go.

72
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:55,960
Go.

73
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,640
Go.

74
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,240
Go.

75
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:57,800
Go.

76
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,560
Go.

77
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,240
Go.

78
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,000
Qingtai.

79
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,480
Your Highness, be careful.

80
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,120
You did a good job.

81
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,520
Her Highness has been worried for so long.

82
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,320
She's feeding the silver in the silver mine.

83
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,640
Eunuch Ren's voice.

84
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,440
Why is she here?

85
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,480
The silver is in the treasury of the State of Qi.

86
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,000
It's hard to get it out.

87
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,160
You did such a good job.

88
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,800
How can I explain to Her Highness?

89
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,000
Just tell the truth.

90
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,360
Why is her voice so familiar?

91
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,440
Tell the truth?

92
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,160
You're so straightforward.

93
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,520
Do you know how much effort Her Highness has put into this?

94
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,800
I'm telling you.

95
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,320
It's not good to do things in vain.

96
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,080
You can't run away.

97
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,840
Eunuch, pay attention to your attitude.

98
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,080
I don't care about the rules in daily life.

99
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,280
But it doesn't mean

100
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,480
you servants can do things in vain.

101
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,360
I came here under Her Highness's will.

102
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,480
I'm representing Her Highness.

103
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,880
How can you do that?

104
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,200
Representing Her Highness?

105
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,400
You deserve it.

106
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,000
You...

107
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,640
This is the token of Empress Lv.

108
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,840
Who is this person?

109
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,560
How could it be?

110
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,720
How could Her Highness give this to you?

111
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,720
This...

112
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,760
How could you, a vile servant,

113
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,480
know about me and her?

114
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:44,880
Who is it?

115
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,520
What's this?

116
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,760
She has其實 only been late

117
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,560
at기를

118
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,800
television

119
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,600
to choose pencils.

120
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,260
So she just won't tell anyone?

121
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,600
How come I don't understand?

122
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,360
This...

123
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,440
You...

124
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,080
What are you doing?

125
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,440
No.

126
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:35,640
What are you doing?

127
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,240
What's that sound?

128
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,520
Let's go and have a look.

129
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,400
Hurry up.

130
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,800
There are some people here.

131
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,000
Let's go over there and have a look.

132
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,560
Let's go.

133
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,280
We must catch the people who sneaked into the library.

134
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,760
Otherwise, we will all

135
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,640
be eaten by them.

136
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,240
Did you find them?

137
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:05,840
No.

138
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,560
Where are they?

139
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,080
Let's go and search outside.

140
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,600
Let's go.

141
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,040
The sunset.

142
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:14,960
They are gone.

143
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,560
Let's go.

144
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,720
How is it?

145
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,720
I'm in good health.

146
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,720
I'm in good shape.

147
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,000
Do you have a change of mind now?

148
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,240
Do you want to be my husband?

149
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,160
You are a girl.

150
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,000
Do you know how to embroider...

151
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,080
You'd better change your clothes first.

152
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,200
Wu Xiang, what do you mean?

153
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,560
I'm in good shape.

154
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,200
Am I that scary?

155
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,720
Don't say it out.

156
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,440
Young Master, I'm not good at my job.

157
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,760
Someone ran away.

158
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,280
It's been so long.

159
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,240
How can you run so far?

160
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,280
We must find him.

161
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,320
We were too much on the second floor.

162
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,680
Even the relationship between you and your mother...

163
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:05,680
If he doesn't come out,

164
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,840
he will harm your safety.

165
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,200
There is a piece of blood on the door frame.

166
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,640
If he eavesdrops outside,

167
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,960
he should be covered with blood.

168
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,800
Stop him from coming out

169
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,680
and check the people who have eavesdropped.

170
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,480
Yes.

171
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,760
Your Highness, please change the clothes

172
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,640
with the blood on them.

173
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,520
No need.

174
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,600
I have to go back to Blue Wings Pavilion.

175
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,440
The most important thing now is to get the antidote.

176
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,560
But isn't it dangerous to go back to Blue Wings Pavilion now?

177
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,600
I have an idea.

178
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,400
Good idea.

179
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,320
Fei,

180
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,720
Third Brother...

181
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,800
Why are you here?

182
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,800
I'm out for a walk.

183
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,800
You are...

184
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,800
I'm also out for a walk.

185
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,800
I got my coat dirty when I was in a hurry.

186
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,800
So I bought a new dress.

187
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,800
In a hurry?

188
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,800
You are always so steady.

189
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,800
Why are you so worried today?

190
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,800
I...

191
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,800
I just had an emergency.

192
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,800
I had no choice.

193
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,800
Brother, I have something to do.

194
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,800
I'll leave now.

195
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,800
Come.

196
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,800
Check every single thing about the trip of the 4th Prince.

197
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,800
Yes.

198
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,800
Princess Chengping.

199
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,800
Your Highness.

200
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,800
Your dress...

201
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,800
It's okay.

202
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,800
But my dress is dirty.

203
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,800
I have to buy a new one in Lanyi Pavilion.

204
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,800
I'll leave now.

205
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,800
It's been a long time.

206
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,800
It seems that the person who stole the helmet is among them.

207
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,800
Who told you not to come here?

208
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,800
I'm a drug addict.

209
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,800
I'm a drug addict.

210
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,800
The mission that you gave me, I've already checked it.

211
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,800
The needlework in the painting is a part of the silver frame.

212
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,800
In this letter,

213
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,800
I've already drawn the location of the silver frame.

214
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:00,800
Now, this frame has been taken by the 7th Prince.

215
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,800
I hope that Qingqing will...

216
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,800
有點忘記了

217
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,800
to have this memory.

218
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,800
Your Highness has realized that you're too Eventually,

219
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,800
you'll know if someone do this.

220
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,800
This news of yours is too late.

221
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,800
It's of no use to me,

222
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,800
so you want me to give the antidote to you?

223
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,400
I was trapped in the carriage.

224
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,480
I really can't pass on the news.

225
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,040
Please forgive me.

226
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,840
No matter if you did it on purpose or not,

227
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,800
you must know that your life and your brother's life

228
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,200
are in your hands.

229
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,120
He won't leave anyone who's useless.

230
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,880
I understand.

231
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,200
The task you gave me,

232
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:04,040
I will try my best next time.

233
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,920
Although this half of the antidote can help you relieve your poison,

234
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,760
it will always make you feel the pain of the poison.

235
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,360
Considering that you're new here,

236
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,240
I'll treat you well today.

237
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,000
I hope that you won't delay the time

238
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,680
in the future.

239
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,000
I understand.

240
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,160
When did you come?

241
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,800
The peach blossom poison drug suspect came.

242
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,200
Is there anything else I can do?

243
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,800
Go back.

244
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,000
I'll go.

245
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,400
Your Highness, you wanted to see me?

246
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,800
Sit.

247
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,000
The blood on the peach blossom

248
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,800
must be because of the poison.

249
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,600
Yes.

250
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,800
The poison will make the six clans of the Five Sangs

251
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,600
to be bitten by thousands of bugs.

252
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,200
It's painful.

253
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,400
This can't be done.

254
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,800
This is the soul-saving incense.

255
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,200
If you know it, you can follow the wind.

256
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,400
I'm not afraid of the wind.

257
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,600
I'm not afraid of the wind.

258
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,600
The scent of the soul-saving incense

259
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,800
is followed by the wind.

260
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,400
If you smell it,

261
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,800
you'll be able to break the soul.

262
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,400
Your Highness,

263
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,200
you found the person who stole the pendant?

264
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,600
Today, I came out of the Blue Wings Pavilion

265
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,600
and met my fourth brother.

266
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,800
He was so flustered.

267
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,000
I don't know why he changed into the clothes.

268
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,800
It's him.

269
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,800
Whether it's him or not,

270
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,000
we can't keep him.

271
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,800
My fourth brother will come out of the Blue Wings Pavilion every day.

272
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,800
Give this incense to the peach blossom.

273
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,600
With the peach blossom,

274
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,200
he'll definitely be able to break the spell.

275
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,800
Besides,

276
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,000
you must send someone to keep an eye on the Wood Wings Pavilion.

277
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,400
Nothing can go wrong.

278
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,000
Understood.

279
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,200
I'll take my leave.

280
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,200
Fourth Brother,

281
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,800
we don't want to kill you.

282
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,800
Today,

283
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,000
I'm sorry.

284
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,200
Yang Wanqing deserves to die.

285
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,600
He only gave half of the antidote.

286
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,200
It's fine.

287
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,400
It's good that he won't die.

288
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,000
But Third Highness...

289
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,600
That's not an ordinary token.

290
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,000
When I was young, I saw the Empress and took it out.

291
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,800
The person who saw this token

292
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,200
is like seeing the Empress herself.

293
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,800
It represents a lot of power.

294
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,800
When I was young,

295
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,200
I saw that token in the palace.

296
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,200
I never thought that Third Highness also had one.

297
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,200
So you think that

298
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,200
Third Highness and the Empress are not ordinary allies?

299
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Princess,

300
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,400
the Blue Wings Pavilion sent someone to deliver the fabric for the ten stars.

301
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,200
Tomorrow, the Six Boundaries of the Secret Library will be destroyed.

302
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,200
This is the scent.

303
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,200
Prime Minister, Wang Xi said that

304
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,200
someone suddenly appeared in front of Fourth Highness' residence.

305
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,200
It's suspicious.

306
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,200
I don't know what it is.

307
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,200
I don't know what it is.

308
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,200
I don't know what it is.

309
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,200
I don't know what it is.

310
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,200
The four-star palace is in a state of panic.

311
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,200
Wang Xi specially changed the portrait

312
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,200
to let the Prime Minister decide.

313
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,200
When did it appear?

314
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,200
Less than two hours.

315
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,200
Send more people to watch.

316
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,200
If there is any problem, take it down immediately.

317
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,200
Understood.

318
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,200
Princess,

319
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,200
I've brought the things.

320
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,200
Put it on.

321
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,200
No one saw it, right?

322
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,200
Don't worry, Princess.

323
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,200
I forced people to come all the way.

324
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,200
Now, the Prime Minister doesn't send people to watch the Zhencheng Pavilion.

325
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,200
It's much easier to get out of the palace.

326
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,200
The Northern Courtyard and the Qi State are peaceful on the surface.

327
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,200
The internal force is fierce.

328
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,200
I and he

329
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,200
may not be able to do anything in the future.

330
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,200
Princess,

331
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,200
I have a short-sightedness.

332
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,200
I don't care what will happen to you and the Prime Minister in the future.

333
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,200
I only know

334
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,200
that the antidote is still in the hands of Qing.

335
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,200
It's very important

336
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,200
for you to quickly detoxify the poison.

337
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,200
The relationship between the Third Prince and the Empress

338
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,200
is very strange.

339
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,200
This incense

340
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,200
may have been arranged by the Third Prince.

341
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,200
Then why did the Third Prince

342
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,200
ask you to do such a thing

343
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,200
that makes people unable to touch their heads?

344
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,200
Is it like what I guessed?

345
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,200
We'll see the truth later.

346
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:31,200
dat

347
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,200
Cos nen

348
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:45,200
Wow

349
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,200
Well,

350
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,200
Give her hands four times.

351
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,080
I'm a woman with many children.

352
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,360
Should I change my mind now?

353
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,760
Do you want to be my wife?

354
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:08,800
Your Highness.

355
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,360
You're reading here.

356
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:12,800
Here.

357
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,120
Have some tea.

358
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,200
To calm your heart.

359
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,480
Forget it.

360
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,200
At this hour,

361
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,160
I'll go to the Library.

362
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,480
I can calm my heart there.

363
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:33,440
Let's go.

364
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,680
I just made tea.

365
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,760
Would you like to have a taste?

366
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:39,680
Your Highness.

367
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,400
Who are you looking for?

368
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,560
Why don't you tell me?

369
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,160
You want to live?

370
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:41,840
Yes.

371
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,160
There's so many youkai in the capital.

372
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,200
Go after them!

373
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,880
What a powerful fighter there is!

374
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,600
Oh, let me get off the tail.

375
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,480
Yes sir.

376
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,920
that Bo up items against you.

377
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,200
Mu impenetrable.

378
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,580
This time without knowing,

379
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,920
there are hordes of barons knows the world.

380
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,340
I am wondering who

381
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,840
is even an expert like you.

382
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:18,840
Say.

383
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,140
Who sent you to spy at Prince IV

384
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:21,860
?

385
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:22,840
say?

386
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,560
Such a telegram helps you to find the Chief.

387
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,240
Why it's used to describeули

388
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:38,060
Right Trans moje

389
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:42,840
I think why it's used to describe closely

390
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,560
Ok

391
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:48,500
The poison cell is covered by the oppression of his teeth

392
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,240
Looks like been lying around for a long time

393
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,640
Right Trans moje

394
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,880
Prince IV has always been a prince.

395
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,000
He has no power over any medicine.

396
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,760
Who will harm him?

397
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,080
What's the benefit of harming him?

398
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,440
Prime Minister Rong.

399
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,040
Prince IV never fights in court.

400
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,880
And you're afraid that you're involved with Prince IV.

401
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,720
You can't even recognize your brother.

402
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,400
You even pretend to be a man of no shame.

403
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,480
We've done so much.

404
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,480
But we still have the killer.

405
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,040
Your Highness.

406
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:44,020
I

407
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:47,500
From today on, you can take care of the four princes.

408
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,860
Zhen Lu.

409
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:51,500
Retreat all of us.

410
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:56,420
We'll be in big trouble this time.

411
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,020
Princess.

412
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:18,420
These little bugs just smelled the incense and were still alive.

413
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,820
Why are they all dead now?

414
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,020
This poison is very delicate.

415
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:26,820
When you first smell it, there's a strange scent.

416
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:30,220
It can relax your mind and relax your body.

417
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:33,220
When the poison in the incense reaches a certain concentration,

418
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,220
it will kill you instantly.

419
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,220
I'll go and check.

420
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,820
Yes.

421
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,620
When the poison in the incense reaches a certain concentration,

422
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,620
it will kill you instantly.

423
00:30:45,020 --> 00:31:06,760
The incense is

424
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,920
St Ник,

425
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:19,260
kill all the Markinstall Arrows from the

426
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:25,600
cylinder stem 1500.

427
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,220
Why don't you run after them?

428
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,540
I know you don't like to say okay.

429
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,900
You have to stay.

430
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:36,020
While Indians are dear,

431
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,540
You shouldn't punish me for what I did.

432
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:40,520
Your Lordship, your

433
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,780
body panel

434
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,300
is nothingInaudible,

435
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:53,740
oh,

436
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,420
It's still late at the guest house.

437
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:01,620
administrator

438
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:04,080
Where do you !!

439
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,760
Someone touched the thing that shouldn't be touched

440
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,700
Who dares to dis Disney our lord's olabilir

441
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,260
Such a thing

442
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,260
Are you doing less

443
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,380
Good wine.

444
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:46,860
What are you thinking?

445
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,460
I'm thinking

446
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,260
it's still summer here.

447
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,100
Three more months,

448
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,220
the North Campus will be snowing.

449
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,460
The north campus of 3000 Zodiacades

450
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,020
Lord Xiang is from another country,

451
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,580
we probably

452
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,100
never saw many雪.

453
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,740
The whole land

454
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,820
is all white.

455
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,420
I remembered

456
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,700
in just one year,

457
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,180
the north campus started to snow

458
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,820
but not I can imagine anything.

459
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,220
The peach tree in front of my home

460
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,660
was all proseblack at first.

461
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,940
I argued

462
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,260
I wanted to see the peach blossoms.

463
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,500
So my mother held me

464
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,180
and snowed under the peach blossoms.

465
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,060
The snow was falling year by year.

466
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,740
It's not that I couldn't see it.

467
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,380
Yes.

468
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,820
It was falling year by year.

469
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,220
I was going back to the North Court

470
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,020
to see the peach blossoms

471
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,620
and snow.

472
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:05,020
I only see the peach blossoms

473
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,300
when I just smart- наших me.

474
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,660
How about me going?

475
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,060
You'll have a lot of worries

476
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,140
if you fine yourself.

477
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,460
What's wrong?

478
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,180
It doesn't matter.

479
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:27,740
Are you hurt?

480
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:31,940
Does it hurt?

481
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:05,940
The more I think of you, the more I'm happy.

482
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:09,940
The more I'm afraid of losing you.

483
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:13,940
Your eyes are like stars in the sky.

484
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:16,940
They are clear and transparent.

485
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,940
They reflect the world.

486
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,940
Because of you, I can't explain.

487
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:22,940
Don't block my way.

488
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,940
The Princess hasn't eaten her dinner yet.

489
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:27,940
The warm spring breeze is blowing.

490
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:29,940
Look.

491
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:34,940
Even if we're separated, we'll never stop.

492
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:37,940
We'll live our lives together.

493
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,940
Here you go. It's quite good.

494
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:41,940
You often get hurt.

495
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,940
It can heal faster.

496
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:45,940
Thank you.

497
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,940
We meet each other every day.

498
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,940
No matter what happens.

499
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:55,940
Those memories are in the past.

500
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,460
The years pass by like a

501
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,940
thread.

502
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:00,940
Such a good fish soup.

503
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:01,940
It's a waste.

504
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:02,940
Thank you.

505
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:05,940
No need to be shy.

506
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:11,940
You're not eating?

507
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:14,940
I'm not hungry.

508
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,940
We lost contact with the person who was watching.

509
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,940
I took it out of accident.

510
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:32,940
And took the others back.

511
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,940
Shen Zai Ye?

512
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,940
Our people are always careful.

513
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,940
But this time, we were caught so quickly.

514
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,940
I'm afraid that you'll be in danger.

515
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:55,940
But this time, we were caught so quickly.

516
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,940
That means,

517
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:00,940
he has been sending people to watch the Fourth Prince.

518
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,940
I didn't expect that

519
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:07,940
Shen Zai Ye cares about my Fourth Brother so much.

520
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:11,940
He has already arranged for a few people to be with him.

521
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:15,940
What do you think Shen Zai Ye wants to do?

522
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,940
Shen Zai Ye is now in a deadlock.

523
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,940
Tomorrow's plan...

524
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:28,940
Jiang Taohua is the only person who can be used now.

525
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,940
There must be no mistake.

526
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,940
You order people to come from the side.

527
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:37,940
You must clear all the obstacles.

528
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,940
If you fail again this time,

529
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,940
you will be in a terrible state.

530
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:44,940
Yes.

531
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:58,940
Translation and Timing Glorified by subt거l from let natürlich.com

532
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:25,100
Flowers fall, the north wind blows,

533
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:29,100
the city is in a state of panic.

534
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:32,340
The petals fall, the north rain falls,

535
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:36,020
my heart is broken.

536
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,900
Flowers fall, tears fall,

537
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,700
my heart is torn.

538
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:45,820
There is nowhere to go.

539
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:50,420
The Moon in the Sky

540
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:57,820
My wish is to grow up in the muddy fields.

541
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:05,100
Regret is in the despair.

542
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:12,420
I still hope that it will bear the flowers in its arms.

543
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:16,540
Even if I have to give up my life for the flowers,

544
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:24,020
I will sing it to the forest.

545
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:37,900
Who will lose the heart of a flower?

546
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:41,540
Love and hate can only be eaten.

547
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:45,140
Flowers wither, the heart is broken.

548
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:51,780
There is no need to tell.

549
00:39:55,860 --> 00:40:03,180
Waiting for the wild love.

550
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:10,460
Not afraid to be surprised by the world.

551
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:17,900
Believe me, what she said is related to the flowers.

552
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:28,900
It turns out that she has the answer of love.
