(Adapted from the novel "Peach Blossoms
Reflecting the River and Mountains")

16
00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:40,980
(by Bai Lu Cheng Shuang)

17
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,900
=Episode 8=

18
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,000
Open all those cabinets.

19
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,280
Don't miss out on any corner.

20
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,230
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

21
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,600
I was only here to amuse myself.

22
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,680
I didn't expect you to prepare

23
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,920
such a great show for me.

24
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,280
It was fantastic.

25
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,720
Wasn't it, Wuyin?

26
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,760
Jinyin Gambling House welcomes everyone.

27
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,520
If you can come to have fun,

28
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,200
as your brother,

29
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,120
I can come here, too.

30
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,120
You're right.

31
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,520
It's fifty thousand taels of gold
we're talking about.

32
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,720
Who wouldn't want to join this?

33
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,360
The money in the Jinyin Gambling House

34
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,760
is even more

35
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,880
compared to the treasury.

36
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,200
Shouldn't we invite Father
to enjoy the fun as well?

37
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,280
Wuyin,

38
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,280
shall we leave?

39
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,640
Let's go.

40
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,040
Huaijin,

41
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,080
what do we do?

42
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,440
Wuhen and Wuyin aren't that tight.

43
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,200
But they suddenly showed up here now,

44
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,080
they must be plotting against me.

45
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,040
If they report what happened today

46
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,160
to Father,

47
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,360
what am I to do?

48
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,120
Your Highness,

49
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,640
stay composed.

50
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,280
As for now,

51
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,040
we can only give up on the plan

52
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,080
and destroy this place.

53
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,200
Don't worry, Your Highness.

54
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,440
I'll take care of everything.

55
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,040
They burn the whole place down.

56
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,440
What about those silver?

57
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,680
Fire can't burn real gold and silver.

58
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,920
Only the ledgers and related evidence

59
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,440
will be burned.

60
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,600
That vault contains a shocking amount
of counterfeit money.

61
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,960
If it all gets out,

62
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,280
the consequences could be disastrous.

63
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,120
Thankfully, after tonight,

64
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,640
Prince Wugou will lay low for a while.

65
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,320
Burning it all

66
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,880
might be a good solution.

67
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,720
How will you explain to
His Majesty then?

68
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,680
With all this commotion,

69
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,080
His Majesty will surely make a decision.

70
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,320
Besides,

71
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,880
with two princes as witnesses,

72
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,120
it all depends on him to decide.

73
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,240
This matter has been settled then.

74
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,680
Poor judgment on my part.

75
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,320
It has nothing to do with Huaijin.

76
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,160
Right Chancellor,

77
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,480
please stop punishing him.

78
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,800
(Meng Zhongyan, Right Chancellor of Qi State)

79
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,440
(Meng Zhongyan, Right Chancellor of Qi State)
You're worrying too much, Your Highness.

80
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,200
You are

81
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,720
the royal family.

82
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,600
Everything you say and do

83
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,000
represents the Heaven.

84
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,400
How could you ever be wrong?

85
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,640
Huaijin

86
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,320
was your study companion as a child

87
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,600
and is now your aide.

88
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,640
You and he

89
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,160
share both glory

90
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,160
and disgrace together.

91
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,080
Of course,

92
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,120
you won't abandon him
for a better choice.

93
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,640
Clearly,

94
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,960
all the mistakes

95
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,080
must be his

96
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,480
alone.

97
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,840
He did advise me,
but I refused to listen.

98
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,640
I was reckless

99
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,880
and insisted on doing that.

100
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,080
When you two make a mistake,

101
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,800
His Majesty won't depose you,

102
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,040
but he will take it out
on the Meng family.

103
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,120
He

104
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,600
is the eldest legitimate son
of the Meng family.

105
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,360
He didn't stop you

106
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,480
and has dragged
the entire Meng family down with him.

107
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,560
He's to blame.

108
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,400
Uncle.

109
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:15,800
Uncle,

110
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,680
Huaijin has always been weak
since he was a kid.

111
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,400
It's all my fault.

112
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,840
Please stop punishing him.

113
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,560
If someone must be beaten, let it be me.

114
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,800
Stop it.

115
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,640
Now you care about your cousin,

116
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,280
why didn't you think of him

117
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,320
and the Meng family

118
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,120
while you were at it?

119
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,360
Do you really think your position

120
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,800
is so secure?

121
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,520
The Qin and Duan families are eyeing it.

122
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,840
Consort Lan

123
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,520
is still in favor of His Majesty.

124
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,640
If she were to bear more sons

125
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,560
and after seven or eight years,

126
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,760
everything in Qi would change
in an instant.

127
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,560
Uncle,

128
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,480
Wuhen

129
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,080
saw everything today.

130
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,840
What should we do?

131
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,520
Huaijin.

132
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,280
Yes, Father.

133
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,040
Make a list

134
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,880
of all the nobles and officials

135
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,300
who have left records
at the gambling house over these years.

136
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:43,880
You and I

137
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,880
will have to pay them a call.

138
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,000
Yes, Father.

139
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,240
Wasn't running the gambling house

140
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:52,920
supposed to be

141
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,080
part of our future cause?

142
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,240
Wugou,

143
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,000
the counterfeit money
concerns the livelihood of the people.

144
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,200
If Prince Wuhen exposes this,

145
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,960
even His Majesty can't protect you.

146
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,120
In times like this,

147
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,440
we must pull all those officials
and dignitaries

148
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,320
into this.

149
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,600
We'll sink, they'll sink with us.

150
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,520
Only then

151
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,160
will they defend you wholeheartedly.

152
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,960
I must make those who ruined my plan

153
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,400
pay the price.

154
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,240
They will.

155
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,480
But for now,

156
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,320
we deal with this first.

157
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,420
(Memorandum)

158
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:55,700
(Mu Wuhen's seal)

159
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,040
Your Majesty, I've found

160
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,240
that the Jinyin Gambling House

161
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,280
is a major hub
for circulating counterfeit money.

162
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,400
Following the trail
to track down the source

163
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,440
isn't difficult.

164
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,240
Wuhen submitted this
one step ahead of you.

165
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:14,720
Read this.

166
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,440
Prince Wuhen

167
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,320
is fast.

168
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,520
So many people

169
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,200
and this much money involved.

170
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,080
It can't be done in a day.

171
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,280
He must've been watching
for a long time.

172
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,880
He knew it all along

173
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,760
and simply used this chance

174
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,880
to strike at Wugou's weak spot.

175
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,200
What's your decision, Your Majesty?

176
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,680
There are only over 200 officials

177
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,720
above the third rank in Qi.

178
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:57,720
This list alone

179
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,600
contains nearly a hundred names.

180
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,360
The money involved

181
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,920
is almost equal to
last year's tax revenue.

182
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,960
And even those not on the list,

183
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,960
how many of them

184
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,000
will stand by and watch

185
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
like Wuhen,

186
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,440
waiting for others to fall

187
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,000
so they can swoop in for their benefits?

188
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,880
Even if I punish them now,

189
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,880
there will be a new list

190
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,840
presented to me

191
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,640
like this

192
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,360
a few years later.

193
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,200
So, Chancellor Shen,

194
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,920
let me ask you.

195
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,600
Should I

196
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,840
continue to investigate this?

197
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,920
Your Majesty appointed me to investigate
the counterfeit money case

198
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,200
to stabilize the livelihood
of the people.

199
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,320
If it causes an upheaval
in the imperial court,

200
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,100
that would go against
your original purpose.

201
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,560
As for the heir,

202
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,600
I believe he will restrain himself

203
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:05,720
after this.

204
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,960
If so, let's put an end to it here.

205
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,640
The evidence was conclusive,

206
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,000
yet they just let it go so easily.

207
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,400
Prince Wugou came out unscathed.

208
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,120
Merely a few reprimands

209
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,280
and minor punishments.

210
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,960
Still, this incident

211
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,620
took a toll on the connections
the Meng family has carefully built

212
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,480
for years

213
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,040
and alerted His Majesty.

214
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,760
Besides, the position of the heir

215
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,080
is no longer unshakable.

216
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,840
That, I've achieved my goal.

217
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,360
The Qi has a hundred years of history,

218
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,880
but those noble families
have survived through several reigns.

219
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,800
By now,

220
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:02,120
the entire imperial court
is tied up in a complicated web.

221
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,080
Almost all the officials

222
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,600
are either their descendants
or proteges.

223
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,480
His Majesty has attempted a few times
to raise up men of humble origin

224
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,520
to balance them out,
but it's never truly worked.

225
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,840
This tea is named Sweet Aftertaste.

226
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,360
Bitter at first, the sweetness slowly
grows stronger afterward.

227
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,480
It's grown in the Min Region.

228
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,200
Due to its difficulty in harvesting,

229
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,600
so it's rare.

230
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,720
If you like it,

231
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,560
you can order them to send up
all the stock.

232
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,120
No matter how rare it is,

233
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,480
surely there's enough for you,
Your Majesty.

234
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,120
Each year, local officials

235
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,160
send thirty percent of the harvest
to the palace,

236
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,720
twenty percent

237
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,040
is used for bribes,

238
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,720
and the rest

239
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,680
is all delivered straight
to the Right Chancellor's residence.

240
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,840
When jackals circle,

241
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,120
even the finest tea

242
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,560
loses its fragrance.

243
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:27,840
Father,

244
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,840
we were summoned to the palace today.

245
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,500
But His Majesty didn't punish
Prince Wugou or our family

246
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,960
because of Prince Wuhen's memorandum.

247
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,080
Instead, he ordered you

248
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,920
to gather funds from all noble families.

249
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,000
What is His Majesty's true intention?

250
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,680
This is the price

251
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,920
His Majesty set for the Meng family

252
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,240
to settle the counterfeit money case.

253
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,600
As the head of all noble families,

254
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,480
we need to patch the hole

255
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,640
it left behind.

256
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,160
So,

257
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,080
you must stop your foolish cousin

258
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,240
from acting recklessly again.

259
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,600
Yes, Father.

260
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,560
(The sword is drawn.)

261
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,120
(How can it be sheathed without blood?)

262
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,320
(The Thousand Peaks Map)

263
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,920
(must be hiding an even greater secret.)

264
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,160
(Once the truth comes to light,)

265
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,800
(Meng Zhongyan,)

266
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,560
(how else will you escape?)

267
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,440
You saved Qingtai as you promised.

268
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,240
Certainly, I'll hand the map over
to you.

269
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,080
If you're worried the map
has been tampered with,

270
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,280
you may ask Madam.

271
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,160
In this household,

272
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,400
aside from me,

273
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,760
she's the most familiar with it.

274
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,160
Lady Jiang, you didn't hesitate
this time.

275
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,120
But

276
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,280
how do you expect me to trust

277
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,640
you didn't alter the map again?

278
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,440
It concerns Qingtai's safety,

279
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,990
I would never do anything
that endangers her life.

280
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,120
Please rest assured.

281
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,600
If there's nothing else,

282
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,360
I'll take my leave.

283
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,280
Is this real?

284
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,800
We can't be sure yet.

285
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,080
This woman is cunning.

286
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,840
Who knows what trick she'll pull?

287
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,420
Why did you give the vile chancellor

288
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,160
the complete
Sunlight over a Thousand Peaks

289
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:10,880
but give Miss Yang

290
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,120
only a half map?

291
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,920
I don't know what Empress Lv is after,

292
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,520
I'm just following her orders.

293
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,840
If I uncover the truth before she does,

294
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,440
I'll have the whole picture

295
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,000
to find out what her real intention is,

296
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,880
then I can gain leverage

297
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,560
and save Changjue.

298
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,360
So you're using the vile chancellor
to investigate?

299
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,360
Well done.

300
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,200
Later,

301
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,520
I'll go to Lan Boutique.

302
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,960
Wait for me outside.

303
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,840
If anything happens,

304
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,240
act accordingly.

305
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,800
Don't worry, Your Highness.

306
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,720
Your Highness,

307
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,000
calm down.

308
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,600
Your Highness.

309
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,920
Please spare me, Your Highness!

310
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,280
You servant!

311
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,560
What did you say?

312
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,240
Please spare me, Your Highness!

313
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,120
Everyone keeps telling me to endure.

314
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,200
I've endured until now.

315
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,720
Even a servant

316
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,720
dares to disrespect me!

317
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,560
Huh?

318
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,520
Why are you waiting for?

319
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:28,960
Open the window!

320
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,720
Trying to suffocate me?

321
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,480
Yes, Your Highness.

322
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,840
(Lan Boutique)

323
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,960
Many eyes are on that map right now.

324
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,000
That vile chancellor hides it
in his study

325
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,520
and guards it like it's his own eyeball.

326
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,880
For this half of the map,

327
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,960
I risked house arrest

328
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,440
just to get into his study
with an excuse.

329
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,600
Don't you have a perfect memory,
Your Highness?

330
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,280
Why only half?

331
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,280
That vile chancellor is cautious.

332
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,800
He closed the map
the moment he heard a sound.

333
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,600
This is all I managed to see.

334
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,400
Aside from the seal
of the gambling house,

335
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,560
nothing else is helpful.

336
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,040
After hearing what you said last time,

337
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,680
I've been watching in the residence

338
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,160
for Her Highness's sake.

339
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,880
I found out that...

340
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,400
(What's that?)

341
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,240
(The pattern on her arm.)

342
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,360
(She's the woman who gambled
with me yesterday.)

343
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,000
Prince Wugou is the mastermind
behind the Jinyin Gambling House.

344
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,880
Though it's not publicly known,

345
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,040
it's an open secret
among all dignitaries of Yujing.

346
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,520
What does Her Highness wish to know?

347
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,040
I'll try to find out.

348
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,080
Anyway, there's something
hidden in this map.

349
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,600
Find a way to keep an eye on Shen Zaiye

350
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,280
and see what he's been to lately.

351
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:21,680
Yes.

352
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,640
This is the antidote for this month.

353
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:37,520
Move aside!

354
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,880
- We're arresting a criminal!
- Move.

355
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,040
- Don't block the way.
- Move.

356
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:40,310
Go out.

357
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:40,960
Hurry and leave.

358
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:41,960
Get out.

359
00:20:42,114 --> 00:20:43,520
Is this a mistake, sir?

360
00:20:43,864 --> 00:20:45,160
There's no criminal here.

361
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,440
(Why is Prince Wugou here?)

362
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,240
(Did he see me?)

363
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,520
By all means, sir.

364
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,080
(I must leave quickly.)

365
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,880
Please behave, Your Highness.

366
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,040
Please let her go, Your Highness.

367
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,520
She's Chancellor Shen's woman.

368
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,920
Offending him could be troublesome.

369
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,920
As the heir of the state,

370
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,480
you openly humiliate

371
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,760
a minister's womanfolk.

372
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,760
How could Prince Wugou do that?

373
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,240
Is this the etiquette of Qi?

374
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,920
The heir behaving so disgracefully.

375
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,280
Keep it down.

376
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,680
Though I'm a woman,

377
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,600
I understand dignity and propriety.

378
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,760
If you think I'm guilty,

379
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,240
then arrest me

380
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,880
and accuse me

381
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,160
in front of all officials,

382
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,160
your father,

383
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,440
and all the people.

384
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,360
Qingtai, let's leave.

385
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:22,880
(Wait.)

386
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:25,680
(That voice.)

387
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,440
For the last round,

388
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,000
I bet on myself.

389
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:30,600
It was her.

390
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:31,960
Capture her!

391
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,400
Tell Shen Zaiye to ransom her.

392
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,160
Yes, Your Highness.

393
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,160
Give chase!

394
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,520
Qingtai, let's split up.

395
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:42,960
All right.

396
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,240
Stop right there.

397
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,160
Stop right there.

398
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,200
It's going to rain.

399
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,960
We need to leave the city before dark.

400
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:14,600
Split up.

401
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,240
Yes, sir.

402
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,240
The guard reports

403
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,680
they've searched the entire city
but couldn't find Jiang Taohua.

404
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,620
If she escapes the city,
it'll be hard to catch.

405
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,520
Hard to catch?

406
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,780
Then what do I need
you useless fools for?

407
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,240
Should we inform Mr. Meng?

408
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,760
Huaijin is cautious.

409
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,560
I know what to do. Don't bother him.

410
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,360
Send more men to the mountains.

411
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,360
Tell them

412
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,280
that if they can't find her,

413
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,920
they don't have to come back.

414
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,120
(I've run this far)

415
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,400
(and they're still chasing me.)

416
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,000
(Prince Wugou isn't going to let me go.)

417
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,720
(I must think of a way
to shake them off.)

418
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,440
Chancellor!

419
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,920
Open the door, Chancellor!

420
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,440
What's wrong?

421
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,200
Prince Wugou is hunting down
Her Highness.

422
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,640
Today, she went to a shop
to pick out clothes

423
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:26,720
and ran into Prince Wugou.

424
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,360
Then Prince Wugou
claimed that Her Highness

425
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,920
was the one he gambled with that night.

426
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,960
Please save Her Highness.

427
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,600
Prince Wugou's men have already
chased her outside the city.

428
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,280
Please save her.

429
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,000
Lady Jiang is clever.

430
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,120
I don't think she needs help.

431
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,720
His Highness gave an order.

432
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,960
Bring her back at all costs.

433
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,240
Search carefully.

434
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,280
That's the woman's garment.

435
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,720
She might be tricking us.
We'll split up.

436
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,060
Follow me.

437
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,080
The rest, go that way.

438
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:21,840
His Highness

439
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,760
wants her brought back, dead or alive.

440
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,840
(Ever since I came to Qi
for the marriage alliance,)

441
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,760
(I have to put myself on the line,)

442
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,040
(plotting each step with care.)

443
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,240
(Yet my life's still at the mercy)

444
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,080
(of those in power.)

445
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:43,840
(No.)

446
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,760
(I must stay alive.)

447
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,080
There are footprints.

448
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:45,600
Be careful.

449
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,120
Thank you.

450
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,560
Send more men.

451
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:06,720
Search!

452
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:07,480
Yes, sir.

453
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:08,760
Someone's there.

454
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:14,720
Search inside.

455
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,700
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

456
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,800
There's sound over there.

457
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,480
What's that smell?

458
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,840
Could it be a wild beast's lair?

459
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,440
Should we just leave it?

460
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,320
Nothing here.

461
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,040
Let's check over there.

462
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:23,840
You...

463
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,440
It's not poisonous.

464
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:31,600
I won't die.

465
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,480
Chancellor,

466
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,000
did you especially come here
to save me?

467
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,440
Of course not.

468
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,560
I haven't verified
the authenticity of the map yet.

469
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:51,820
If you die,

470
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,960
I'll have to start
the counterfeit money investigation

471
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,760
all over again.

472
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,000
So,

473
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,040
you can't die.

474
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:03,560
As I thought,

475
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,480
only those who are useful

476
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,720
are worth saving.

477
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,600
Don't overthink it.

478
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,560
If you fall ill,

479
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,840
I'll have to waste even more effort

480
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,920
to get you out of the woods.

481
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,680
Don't catch a cold.

482
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,520
Wolves.

483
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,640
Where are you going?

484
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,920
I'll stand guard outside.

485
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,640
(Stand guard outside?)

486
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,960
(Is a map)

487
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,080
(worth the Left Chancellor)

488
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,080
(risking his life?)

489
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:05,741
♪I'm lost for words when you turn away♪

00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:12,946

501
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,040
Chancellor,

502
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,240
are we going back to the residence?

503
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,200
We can't go back yet.

504
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,760
Prince Wugou couldn't find you
last night,

505
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,960
he'll definitely send more men

506
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,840
to hunt you down.

507
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,200
Right now, we're alone and weak.

508
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,240
We'll die if we show ourselves.

509
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,920
We have to wait
until the reinforcements come.

510
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,520
The forest is vast.

511
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,880
Will Zhan Lu see these marks?

512
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,040
As long as they come,

513
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,040
they'll find them.

514
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,240
So many bamboo shoots!

515
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,040
Let's go.

516
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,240
Who are you?

517
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:53,180
(Lian, Tianshui Village)

518
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,640
Little girl,

519
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,320
don't be afraid.

520
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,800
We're not bad people.

521
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,080
We came into the mountains to have fun
and got lost.

522
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,200
We're sorry

523
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,400
for scaring you just now.

524
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,000
It's been raining every day lately,

525
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,520
high-born like you

526
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,560
wouldn't come here for fun.

527
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,600
Got lost? You think you can fool me?

528
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,400
Little girl,

529
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,680
we did run into trouble.

530
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,200
We didn't tell you earlier

531
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,640
because we didn't want to scare you.

532
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,720
This pair of earrings

533
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,720
could buy a whole lot of bamboo shoots.

534
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,480
Well,

535
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,160
would you take us to your home
for some food?

536
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,240
We'll leave once we freshen up.

537
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,840
We won't cause you any trouble.

538
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,160
You're young,

539
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,120
but you're cunning.

540
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,560
Little girl,

541
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,480
we really don't want to cause trouble.

542
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,960
Please help us.

543
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,560
Besides, the earrings

544
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,960
could feed your family for years.

545
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,840
The likes of you are always pretentious.

546
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,920
Who knows what you'll do

547
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,640
once you come to my home?

548
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,240
Do we have to pretend

549
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,400
if we really want to hurt you?

550
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,960
My house is right ahead.

551
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,040
Keep your word.

552
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,480
You'll only stay one day.

553
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,280
Lian, you're back.

554
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,600
Hello, Mr. Li.

555
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,080
Hello.

556
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,440
Hello, Madam Wang.

557
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,800
You're back, Lian.

558
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,440
Who are they?

559
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,640
They're my guests.

560
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,520
Granny, I'm home.

561
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,600
Good.

562
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,560
You must be hungry.

563
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:10,800
(Lian's Grandmother, Tianshui Village)
Come on and eat.

564
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,830
(Lian's Grandmother, Tianshui Village)

565
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,760
What's going on here?

566
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,440
This lady and her husband
got lost in the mountains,

567
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,920
so I brought them back.

568
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,960
We've had a hard journey.

569
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,120
Would you let us stay
to clean ourselves?

570
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,080
My husband was bitten by a snake.

571
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,640
Could you give us some hot water

572
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,080
to clean his wound?

573
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,240
You didn't ask for hot water earlier.

574
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,920
So pretentious.

575
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,520
Do you know how much firewood it takes
to heat the water?

576
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:34,920
Lian,

577
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,680
don't be rude.

578
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,520
Everyone runs into trouble
when they travel.

579
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,520
Mister, madam, you're too polite.

580
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,320
You can have it if you need it.

581
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:55,840
Mister,

582
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,480
you look just like Lian's brother.

583
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,880
I'm happy looking at you.

584
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,440
How about this?

585
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:04,920
You take a rest.

586
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,000
Lian,

587
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,640
take them to change clothes.

588
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,880
I'll prepare some dishes.

589
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,080
Let's eat later.

590
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:11,480
Fine.

591
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,200
Go ahead.

592
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,600
Follow me.

593
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,000
My brother is way more good-looking
than you.

594
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,120
Come on and have a seat.

595
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:12,600
Farmhouse dishes are nothing like
what you have in the city.

596
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,720
Please try some.

597
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,480
Where did you get the chicken from?

598
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,560
Granny, did you slaughter the hen?

599
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,320
Didn't you always want to eat it?

600
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,080
Come, have some.

601
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,960
But we're relying on the hen
to lay eggs to help us pay our debts.

602
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,360
Well,

603
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,720
they were hurt in the mountains.

604
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,040
They can't just eat greens.

605
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:34,640
Right?

606
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:37,480
Here.

607
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:40,680
Here.

608
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,720
Have more.

609
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,600
Thank you.

610
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,000
You must be starving.

611
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:47,600
Here you go.

612
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:48,680
Thank you.

613
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,000
Eat some.

614
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:57,880
Come on and eat.

615
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,360
No need.

616
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,280
Lian, eat this.

617
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:05,840
But...

618
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:09,720
Delicious.

619
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,640
Madam, your cooking is amazing.

620
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,560
Really?

621
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:14,960
Good to know.

622
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:17,880
Please have more.

623
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:18,760
Here, Lian.

624
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,400
Lian.

625
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:20,880
I'll do it.

626
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,680
You can have it.

627
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,560
Let me.

628
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:26,920
Have more.

629
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,720
Eat more if you like it.

630
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,760
It smells great.

631
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,640
Really?

632
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,040
Don't worry, Granny.
I'll dig a lot of bamboo shoots

633
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,000
and buy another chicken soon.

634
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,320
All right.

635
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,160
Good girl.

636
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:49,680
Bowl, plate, rattle drum.
All kinds of things are for sale.

637
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,160
Folded fan, bottle gourd,
vinegar, and rice liquor.

638
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,200
Do you sell honey sweets?

639
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:53,520
Yes.

640
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:54,480
Five wen.

641
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,400
Wasn't it two wen last time?

642
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,360
It's five now.

643
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,200
Bowl, plate, rattle drum,
folded fan, and bottle guard.

644
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,640
We sell all kinds of things.

645
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,960
Rice liquor.

646
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,440
Excuse me.

647
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,520
We sell everything.

648
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,320
You don't seem local.

649
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,440
What would you like?

650
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,120
I'll pay for her.

651
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,440
Sure.

652
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,600
You think you can bribe me
with one candy?

653
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,640
How about two?

654
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,640
Still no.

655
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,400
Give me a few more malt sugar.

656
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:26,640
Sure.

657
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,920
You're so kind-hearted.

658
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,880
Here's an extra piece for you.

659
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,160
Wait a moment. Let me get your change.

660
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:36,680
Give it to me.

661
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,080
We're together.

662
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,040
I see.

663
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:39,840
All right.

664
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:40,880
I'm leaving now.

665
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,280
You really won't take it?

666
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,240
You ate and stayed for free at my house.

667
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,720
It's no big deal, even if I take two.

668
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:01,440
Let's go.

669
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,080
Look at this.

670
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,200
Something's wrong with this silver?

671
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,880
Dear, we just ate.

672
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:09,960
Shall we walk around

673
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:10,720
in the village

674
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,520
to help digestion?

675
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,280
Come and have a look.

676
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,600
We have fresh stock.

677
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,320
Fresh stock?

678
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,040
Yes.

679
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,000
Let me see.

680
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,600
Give me this one.

681
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,480
All right, here's your change.

682
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,240
Keep it safe.

683
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,080
All right. What would you like?

684
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,760
Mother, I want malt sugar.

685
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Me too.

686
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,240
To think

687
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:51,960
that counterfeit money

688
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,560
appears in a remote village like this.

689
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,880
Have you noticed anything strange

690
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,120
about this village?

691
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,320
It seems like

692
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,600
there are no young men

693
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,560
in this village.

694
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,000
Right.

695
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:14,320
There are only elderly people,
women, and children.

696
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,680
No large fields either.

697
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,960
Just a few women tending small gardens.

698
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:23,280
The counterfeit money
is now circulating through this village,

699
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:24,880
so I plan

700
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,440
to stay a few days

701
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,360
to find out what's going on.

702
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,520
There are only women and children here.

703
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,200
If you chat with them,

704
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,760
they'll probably let their guard down.

705
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:39,320
What about you?

706
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:41,600
Me?

707
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I have something more important

708
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:46,720
to do.

709
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,680
(This is my chance.)

710
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:57,080
(This time,)

711
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:58,880
(I must use his power)

712
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,220
(to uncover the secret
behind the Thousand Peaks Map.)

713
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:03,280

to crush me again.)
