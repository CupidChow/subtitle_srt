18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,440
After them!

19
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,320
Kill her!

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,600
(Jiang Taohua.)

21
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,560
(Oh, no.)

22
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,880
(I'm tangled by the weeds.)

23
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,760
(What do I do?)

24
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,600
(I can't get free.)

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,680
(Help.)

26
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,640
(Help me.)

27
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,040
(Help.)

28
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:39,920
(Mother...)

29
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,400
Let my mother go!

30
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,920
Let her go!

31
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,040
Hold her!

32
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,200
Force it in!

33
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,120
Lady Lv, I'm begging you!

34
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,320
Please help my mother.

35
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,680
You brought this on yourself
for sitting where you never should've.

36
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,200
If I don't get rid of you,

37
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,760
(Young Empress Lv)
how can I rule this harem?

38
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,800
This world belongs

39
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,600
to the strong.

40
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,440
The weak will get wiped out.

41
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,680
Mother.

42
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,520
Taohua.

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,760
Mother.

44
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,080
Mother.

45
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,120
Listen to me.

46
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,200
Changjue,

47
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,400
Taohua.

48
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,520
After I'm gone,

49
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,840
life will be hard

50
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,080
for you

51
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,880
and Changjue.

52
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,600
Trust no one.

53
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,000
Remember that.

54
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,080
When danger comes,

55
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,080
save yourself first.

56
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,960
Protect yourself.

57
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,080
(Mother...)

58
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,920
(I'm too weak.)

59
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,440
(This time,)

60
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,160
(I am unable to save myself.)

61
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:58,920
Come, child.

62
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,160
Have a bite.

63
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,560
You're finally awake.

64
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,480
Where am I?

65
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,680
That treacherous Chancellor

66
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,390
must've known the villagers were going
to report it to the authority.

67
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,960
So he made arrangements in advance.

68
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,800
The sword-wielding man
who accompanied him discovered

69
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,120
this old house

70
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,440
and hid everyone inside.

71
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,040
I still can't figure out

72
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,760
if he is a good guy or a bad guy.

73
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,040
But he really cares about you.

74
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,720
He carried you here himself

75
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,080
and never left your side.

76
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,840
You claimed you wanted
to join forces with me.

77
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,880
Yet I had to drag you out

78
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,520
when you fell into the water.

79
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,440
When I think of it,

80
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,440
you owe me two lives now.

81
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,400
How should I repay you?

82
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:45,960
Get better soon.

83
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,360
Then

84
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,000
work twice as hard to repay the debt.

85
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,040
Someone! Help!
Granny was hit by an arrow.

86
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,320
Granny!

87
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,720
Granny.

88
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,720
Granny, wake up.

89
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,280
Granny.

90
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,440
Granny, open your eyes.

91
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,120
Granny,

92
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,080
wake up.

93
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,800
You said you'd bring her back.

94
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,360
Why is she hurt!

95
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,840
It's not their fault.

96
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,040
I insisted

97
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,040
on returning.

98
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,880
I didn't expect

99
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,120
to run into those bad guys.

100
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,400
Granny!

101
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,160
They risked everything to get me out.

102
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:07,120
So I could see you

103
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,120
one last time.

104
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,720
Lian,

105
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,920
from now on,

106
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,120
it's just you and your brother.

107
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,120
You must wait for him.

108
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,440
There, there.

109
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,480
Good girl,

110
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,600
don't cry.

111
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,880
Granny!

112
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,800
Granny!

113
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,040
Granny, wake up!

114
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,800
- Granny.
- Granny!

115
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,080
Granny!

116
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,560
I want Granny!

117
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,040
Let me go.

118
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,800
I want Granny!

119
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,040
Let me go!

120
00:09:29,394 --> 00:09:30,440
Granny!

121
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,480
It's all your fault.

122
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,520
None of this would've happened
if not for you!

123
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,720
Granny wouldn't be dead!

124
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,840
Don't bite him, Lian!

125
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,000
You can't!

126
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,120
Granny!

127
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,480
Lian.

128
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,640
Lian.

129
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,680
Granny!

130
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,400
Don't burn my granny!

131
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,720
(Lian is right.)

132
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,240
(It's my fault.)

133
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,880
(I thought
I had everything under control.)

134
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,400
(But just like twenty years ago,)

135
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,000
(I could do nothing)

136
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,680
(as Granny died before me.)

137
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,880
The criminals, Xie Guanyu

138
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,440
and his sister, Consort Shu,
used witchcraft to harm the nation.

139
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,940
We are hereby commanded to search
and seize the Xie residence.

140
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,160
This petition...

141
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,240
My sister and I were innocent!

142
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,720
I want to submit this petition

143
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,360
to His Majesty.

144
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,320
Official Xie,

145
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,400
don't worry.

146
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,440
I will submit it
to His Majesty in person

147
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,720
to clear your innocence.

148
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:02,920
My dear!

149
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,080
Father!

150
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:05,920
My dear!

151
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,200
My dear...

152
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,400
From this moment on,

153
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,800
you're Shen Zaiye,

154
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,840
and I am Xie Jing'an.

155
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,720
Young Master,
you're the last of the Xie line now.

156
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,480
Only you can clear our names

157
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,080
and live on for all of us.

158
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,600
Granny...

159
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,720
(Lian, don't worry.)

160
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,000
(I will make the Heir,)

161
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,160
(the Meng family,)

162
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,080
(and those who brought ruin
to our family)

163
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,400
(pay the price.)

164
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,320
Granny...

165
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,640
Mu Wuxia, are you okay?

166
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,560
You never used to drink.

167
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,800
This is all my fault.

168
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,600
If I hadn't acted on my own

169
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,480
and gone to the authorities,

170
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,640
those men would never have found

171
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,760
where they were hiding.

172
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,080
Chancellor Shen was right.

173
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,080
So many villagers died.

174
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,320
Granny died in pain.

175
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,080
It's all because of me.

176
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,880
I have failed them.

177
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,200
I've failed the villagers

178
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,520
and Granny.

179
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,280
I failed Lian most of all.

180
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,960
How is this your fault?

181
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,160
If those thugs intended to act,

182
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,280
they would have done so anyway

183
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,360
even without us reporting to Censor Zhou.

184
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,600
I've learned my lesson.

185
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,360
But at the cost of innocent people.

186
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,840
Mu Wuxia,

187
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,960
bad people are to blame, not us.

188
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,280
We must remain strong

189
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,040
and fight back.

190
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,720
If they saw you

191
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,120
in this state, they would be thrilled.

192
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,320
Has everything been taken care of?

193
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,600
The grieving have cried.

194
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,120
The rest have scattered. It's over.

195
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,760
It's all right.

196
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,120
The child bit hard.

197
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,800
The wound is deep.

198
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,080
So it may leave a scar.

199
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,560
All

200
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:26,720
the better.

201
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,360
Stop blaming yourself.

202
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,660
You've already done everything
you could.

203
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,520
If Granny's watching from above,

204
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,960
she would understand.

205
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,280
She wouldn't blame you.

206
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,800
As for Lian,

207
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,680
she'll come around eventually.

208
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,120
You asked me

209
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,800
why I came back to save you even

210
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,960
after escaping the assassins.

211
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,720
It's because there was someone

212
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,000
I wanted to save

213
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,080
but failed to save.

214
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,320
Let's settle this with a game of cuju.

215
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:33,720
If you win,

216
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,120
I'll help you

217
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,600
get revenge.

218
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,720
But if you lose,

219
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,840
then forget the past, move forward,

220
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,320
and live well with your brother
when he returns.

221
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:44,480
Deal?

222
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,160
You're a treacherous Chancellor.

223
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,240
Why should I believe you?

224
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,680
I'll swear it if you want.

225
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,080
Fine. Deal!

226
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,120
(You had someone you couldn't save.)

227
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,760
(So did I.)

228
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,640
- Lian.
- Lian.

229
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,680
Let me help you!

230
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,720
Me too!

231
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,600
Count me in!

232
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,120
We'll do this with him!

233
00:17:48,482 --> 00:17:50,168
Lian, kick! Hurry!

234
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,160
Stop him!

235
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,580
- I got it!
- Everyone! Block him!

236
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,480
Lian, kick it now!

237
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,800
Lian, you won!

238
00:18:13,074 --> 00:18:15,280
- Lian has won!
- I won!

239
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,960
That's awesome! Lian has won!

240
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,840
- Lian won!
- Lian won!

241
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,360
Will you join me

242
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,840
and avenge Granny?

243
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,240
Lian won!

244
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,360
That foreman pointed us this way.

245
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,280
If the Heir's men hadn't ambushed us,

246
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,440
we might have traced

247
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,160
the counterfeit money

248
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,480
to its source.

249
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,040
But with all these mountains around,

250
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,960
there's no sign of the villagers

251
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,560
who were taken.

252
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,320
Where there's a camp,

253
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,080
there must be traces of life.

254
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,320
Zhan Lu, go down

255
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,600
and scout the area.

256
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,320
Be careful.

257
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,000
Yes, Chancellor.

258
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,800
It's remote out here.

259
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,720
If counterfeit coins
were transported regularly,

260
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,880
it'd be hard to hide the cart tracks.

261
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,360
We'll know more

262
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,440
once Zhan Lu reports back.

263
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,400
Could this place be linked

264
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,960
to "Sunlight Over a Thousand Peaks"?

265
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,840
I think I've figured it out.

266
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,600
Come with me.

267
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:51,800
Here.

268
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,320
It's okay.

269
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,400
I can manage.

270
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,120
Don't you find this view familiar?

271
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:07,800
Familiar?

272
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,840
Lend me your sword.

273
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,880
"Sunlight over a Thousand Peaks"?

274
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,400
That's right.

275
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,920
Xue Ran must've painted it

276
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,280
from this very spot.

277
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,320
Though it's a thousand peaks bathed
in sunlight,

278
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,880
from here, you can see

279
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,200
it's actually seven mountain peaks
in a chain.

280
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,700
(Yaoguang, Kaiyang, Yuheng,
Lingque, Tianji, Lingfu, Tianxuan)

281
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,800
The Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper.

282
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,600
And among those seven stars,

283
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,400
Yuheng shines the brightest.

284
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,520
So

285
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,680
this must be the one.

286
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,600
(Yuheng. Lianzhen Star)

287
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,920
But

288
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,320
it has a sharp peak

289
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,080
and steep slopes.

290
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,400
It's not ideal for minting coins.

291
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,080
Xue Ran completed this painting

292
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,560
as a safeguard

293
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,440
before he met me.

294
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,880
He must've hidden clues within it.

295
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,240
The sun

296
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,640
and stars shift.

297
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,800
If we look at the painting
upside down...

298
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,640
The peaks become valleys,

299
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,560
and the valleys become peaks.

300
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,880
If we overlay that
with the Dipper's stars,

301
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,600
the position completely changes.

302
00:22:59,080 --> 00:22:59,960
Among the seven,

303
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,160
Yuheng is the brightest.

304
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,400
Just like how all the ministers revolve
around His Majesty.

305
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:05,840
The Dipper revolves

306
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,800
around the Polaris.

307
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,320
Over here

308
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,360
is a blank space.

309
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,520
But

310
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,520
why did he leave it blank?

311
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:20,800
I got it.

312
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,640
Let's go and meet Zhan Lu.

313
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,200
Chancellor.

314
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,200
You hurt yourself.

315
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,120
It's nothing.

316
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,280
I discovered
a royal hunting ground nearby.

317
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,840
Just as I thought.

318
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,160
Also,

319
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,360
while scouting,

320
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,540
I noticed a convoy departing
from the hunting grounds.

321
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,320
Stop the carts.

322
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:47,600
Stop.

323
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,640
So that's how they've been smuggling
the counterfeit coins.

324
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,920
What's the story
behind this hunting ground?

325
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,000
Five years ago, the Heir claimed

326
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,600
to have acquired several Ferghana horses
from the Western Regions.

327
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,160
He said they were wild and hard to tame.

328
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,640
So he specially requested His Majesty

329
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,080
to build a royal hunting ground here.

330
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:05,920
No wonder.

331
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,920
The money transport carts

332
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,480
were disguised as feed carts.

333
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,760
Who would dare to inspect them?

334
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,760
Let alone suspect

335
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,280
the royal family.

336
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,880
No wonder this hunting ground

337
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,760
is so heavily guarded.

338
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,640
We must return to the capital

339
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,520
and prepare at once.

340
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,180
His Majesty has strictly forbidden me
from investigating further.

341
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,480
If we act rashly,

342
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,240
we'll only give them more leverage.

343
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,640
The more nervous they are,

344
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:29,920
the closer

345
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,600
we must be to the truth.

346
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,280
Exactly.

347
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,200
So, do you believe

348
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,320
I gave you the real painting now?

349
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,540
(Shen Residence)

350
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,640
Your Highness, you're finally back!

351
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,960
You were chased and fell into the river.

352
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,600
That's terrifying just to hear!

353
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:29,720
Wait a minute.

354
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,200
About you falling into the river,

355
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,120
did Shen Zaiye plan it?

356
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,680
Did he take you out

357
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,960
just to put you in danger?

358
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,680
Stop it, Qingtai.

359
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,920
Ever since I was young,

360
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,960
no one ever risked their life
to save me.

361
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,440
But that day,

362
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,680
he came back for me

363
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,760
even after he got them off his trail.

364
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,920
He saved me

365
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,080
without a second thought.

366
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,880
If you put it that way,

367
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,000
is he a good person or not?

368
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,840
The world

369
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,520
isn't simply black and white.

370
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,160
Maybe I only knew one side of him.

371
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,600
He only has his own agenda

372
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,720
and doesn't bother explaining it
to others.

373
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,320
It sounds like

374
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,800
this treacherous Chancellor

375
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,660
and Your Highness
might have a bit in common.

376
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,120
We're nothing alike.

377
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,240
I only want
to live out my days peacefully

378
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,280
with Changjue.

379
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,240
I agree, Your Highness.

380
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,360
What a journey this turned out to be.

381
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,560
Who would have thought

382
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,160
that the counterfeit money was connected

383
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,320
to the painting that Empress Lv
has been searching for.

384
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,360
And it implicates both Qi State
and Beiyuan.

385
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,840
This is serious.

386
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,680
We'll have to tread carefully.

387
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,160
Find a chance in the next day or two

388
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,640
to send word to Qing.

389
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,080
Tell her

390
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,760
I found the painting.

391
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,640
Yes, Your Highness.

392
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,700
(Lan Boutique)

393
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,400
Qing, this is the painting
Her Highness requested.

394
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,680
It doesn't look fake.

395
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,640
But do you know

396
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,040
the underlying meaning of it?

397
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,120
I wouldn't dare to speculate.

398
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,560
Your next task is
to uncover the secret within it.

399
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,080
This painting is key
to Her Highness's grand plan.

400
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,960
You must figure out where it leads.

401
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,320
May I know the place

402
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,360
Her Highness is referring to?

403
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,680
That's not your concern.

404
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,600
All you need to know is

405
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,400
the answer lies

406
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,600
inside this painting.

407
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,040
Understood.

408
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,880
I only fear I may not be clever enough

409
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,560
and delay Her Highness's grand plan.

410
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,840
Your Highness,
don't underestimate yourself.

411
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,120
Her Highness did mention

412
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,880
you somehow had no time

413
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,400
to search for the painting.

414
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,480
But you had plenty of time
to travel with Chancellor Shen.

415
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,080
Quite the scenic tour.

416
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,000
I know

417
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,360
I've delayed the mission.

418
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,040
But I have no say

419
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,080
at Chancellor Residence.

420
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,720
It won't happen again.

421
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:18,040
Whether it was unintentional or not,

422
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,240
you know the truth in your heart.

423
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,960
Don't think being in Qi State

424
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,080
means you're beyond reach.

425
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,440
Her Highness knows

426
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,640
everything you do.

427
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,160
I understand.

428
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,160
I won't do it.

429
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,280
If you do this again.

430
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,800
I won't do it again.

431
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,000
You won't be let off so easily.

432
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,440
These are new patterns from Beiyuan.

433
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,800
Your Highness, you'll like it.

434
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,520
Her Highness said,

435
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,080
as long as you behave,

436
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,480
there'll be plenty more
where that came from.

437
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,120
(Taohua.)

438
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,840
(It's been so long since we last met.)

439
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,960
(Every time I think of you,)

440
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,280
(I wish I could go to you.)

441
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,880
(I'm writing this letter)

442
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,480
(to let you know I'm well.)

443
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,600
(Life at the military camp is well.)

444
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,920
(There are people assigned to care
for my daily needs.)

445
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,320
(Please don't worry.)

446
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,320
(But I can't help thinking)

447
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,640
(about you,)

448
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,640
(alone in Qi State.)

449
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,240
(Are you safe and well?)

450
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,360
(Does Chancellor Shen treat you
with sincerity?)

451
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,240
(I only hope
you take good care of yourself.)

452
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,240
(Don't worry about me.)

453
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,560
(Even though the world is vast,)

454
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,920
(we will reunite one day.)

455
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,720
(I long for that day)

456
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,200
(when we can talk about everything.)

457
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,120
(Forgive me for this hasty letter.)

458
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,920
(There's much I still want to say.)

459
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,200
(Take care, always.)

460
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:14,960
(With deepest respect,)

461
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,320
(Changjue.)

462
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,160
Your Highness,

463
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,480
are you all right?

464
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,000
Please, get up.

465
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,000
Get up.

466
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,120
Was that a letter from Prince Changjue?

467
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,360
Did he say

468
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,440
life is hard in the army?

469
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,080
Then why are you still upset?

470
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,240
He said he's doing fine.

471
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,880
He's training under a border general.

472
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,520
He trains every day

473
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,080
and is stronger than before.

474
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,480
Then why do you still look so sad?

475
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:07,960
Look at this.

476
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,120
The lines on this seal

477
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,680
are crooked and unsteady.

478
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,680
That means a weak hand

479
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,360
and an unsettled heart.

480
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,880
Changjue is not doing well.

481
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,920
It sure looks that way, Your Highness.

482
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,080
Who knows what hardships

483
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,240
His Highness is going through
in that camp.

484
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,920
Empress Lv had
Yang Wanqing delivered this letter

485
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,360
only to use his safety to pressure me.

486
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,680
So I'd hurry and complete my mission.

487
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,200
The more desperate they are,

488
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,440
the more important

489
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,800
this is to them.

490
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,080
I fear that the day I complete the task

491
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,990
will be the day
both Changjue and I are silenced.

492
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,600
Then what should we do?

493
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,520
They still have your antidote.

494
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,520
What matters now

495
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,680
is finding out exactly what they want.

496
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,080
Go and wash the Chancellor's robe.

497
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,960
I'm returning it to him myself.

498
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:18,920
Yes, Your Highness.

499
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:26,740
(Shen Residence)

500
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,040
Chancellor.

501
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,600
A scout just returned.

502
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,280
No wonder His Majesty forbade us

503
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,880
from digging into the counterfeit money.

504
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,680
It turns out he struck a deal
with the Meng family

505
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,680
to trade the flood relief funds
in exchange.

506
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,560
Quite a profitable arrangement.

507
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,480
Pity all the effort

508
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,080
we spent investigating.

509
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,960
No secret stays buried forever.

510
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,200
The Meng family thinks

511
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,600
they can stop me from exposing this.

512
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,400
How naive.

513
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,080
Zaiye!

514
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:19,920
Zaiye!

515
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,000
Just take me to the Spring Hunt!

516
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,320
You take me every year!

517
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,000
Why are you suddenly restricting
my freedom

518
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,360
and keeping me locked in at home?

519
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,440
If you don't take me,

520
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,590
I'll turn your whole courtyard
into a target practice!

521
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:31,920
Zaiye!

522
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,160
Chancellor, your sister...

523
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,160
Let her be.

524
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,280
She'll stop once she's had enough.

525
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:37,600
Zaiye!

526
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,040
- Miss Qingying!
- Miss Qingying!

527
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:47,920
Be careful with that!

528
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,920
Miss Qingying, stop this!

529
00:34:49,138 --> 00:34:49,480
Stop it.

530
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,349
Put your bow down!

531
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,000
- Watch where you're pointing.
- Watch it.

532
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,525
Be careful.

533
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,640
Please stop, Miss Qingying.

534
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,480
Put it down.

535
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,560
Put it down, Miss Qingying.

536
00:34:56,776 --> 00:34:58,560
If you don't agree to take me,

537
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,600
I'll turn them into porcupines!

538
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,360
Miss Qingying, stop it already!

539
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,440
Watch where you're aiming!

540
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,480
- Put it down, please.
- I'm going to shoot for real!

541
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,200
Jiang Taohua,

542
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,520
are you hurt?

543
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:21,960
I'm fine.

544
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,080
I was too careless.

545
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,200
Let me help you pick it up.

546
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:25,920
Here you go.

547
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,400
What Spring Hunt are you talking about?

548
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,800
It's a grand hunt hosted

549
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,520
by Qi's royal family.

550
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:32,880
Every year,

551
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,520
many sons of noble families will attend.

552
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,680
Those who perform well

553
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,240
might even get rewarded by His Majesty.

554
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,480
It's a major event.

555
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,880
I'm going to speak to Zaiye again.

556
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,560
You! Jiang Taohua!

557
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,080
Why are you always getting in my way?

558
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,680
The Chancellor must have his reasons
for keeping you from the hunt.

559
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,080
You should listen

560
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:55,920
and go back for now.

561
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:56,560
No!

562
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,520
Give them back!

563
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,760
Give them back to me!

564
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,440
Return my arrows.

565
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,560
Give them back!

566
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,440
Give them back, Jiang Taohua!

567
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,400
Zhan Lu, escort Miss Qingying back
to her chamber.

568
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:04,920
Jiang Taohua!

569
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,560
Give them back!

570
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,080
The Chancellor asked you
to return to your chamber.

571
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,480
No!

572
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,400
Jiang Taohua, we're enemies from now on!

573
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,520
Qingying.

574
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,120
Don't worry.

575
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,680
I'll find a way

576
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,560
to convince your brother
to take you to the hunt.

577
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,160
If I ever believe you again, I'm a fool.

578
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,640
I have the servant

579
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,520
to wash your clothes.

580
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,080
Are you having a headache?

581
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,560
How did you know?

582
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,920
This calming incense has yindan grass.

583
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,880
If you don't mind,

584
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,280
I know some techniques to ease the pain.

585
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,920
Qingying said

586
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,360
the Spring Hunt is coming up.

587
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,440
Are you here to speak on her behalf?

588
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,320
Work has been busy this year.

589
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,400
I was thinking of requesting leave
from His Majesty.

590
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,280
Qingying is lively and energetic.

591
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,200
If we all leave

592
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,960
and she's left alone at home,

593
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,400
we might as well bring her along

594
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,320
where we would worry less.

595
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,160
Let me think it over.

596
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,400
I'm curious about one thing.

597
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,880
Where exactly is the Spring Hunt held?

598
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,920
It's usually held
at the hunting ground in Xishan.

599
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,680
Are you saying...

600
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,720
If that's the case,

601
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,760
we must plan this carefully.

602
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,800
Once the bait is drawn in,

603
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,400
we must strike with absolute precision.

604
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,680
A trap with no escape. A perfect setup.

605
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,040
Chancellor, as you instructed,

606
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,800
I've informed Prince Wuhen of the plan.

607
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,800
He has agreed
to submit a memorial to His Majesty.

608
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,000
But

609
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,840
this is a crucial operation.

610
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,440
Can Lady Jiang really be trusted?

611
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,640
I know what I'm doing.

612
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,720
After the Tianshui Village incident,

613
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,360
you and Lady Jiang have changed.

614
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,080
Before, we'd never tell her
about anything this crucial.

615
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:19,840
But now, you two...

616
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,360
There is nothing between us even now.

617
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,600
Send someone to Beiyuan
to look into Jiang Taohua's background.

618
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,120
I want every detail,

619
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,680
no matter how small.

620
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,080
Yes, Chancellor.

621
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,920
Your Highness,
what's bothering you again?

622
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,160
The Spring Hunt takes place
every year at Xishan.

623
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,320
But this year, Father suddenly chose

624
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,400
my hunting grounds instead.

625
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,240
Do you think

626
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,840
it's Shen Zaiye's doing?

627
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:18,960
I doubt it.

628
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,240
Shen Zaiye may be the Left Chancellor.

629
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,640
But he's not powerful enough
to sway His Majesty's decision.

630
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,960
He may not have the power.

631
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:28,760
But Wuhen does.

632
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,000
Today, he told Father

633
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,920
that I possess a rare Ferghana horse,

634
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,880
unlike any other,

635
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,520
which brings good fortune.

636
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,400
Then Third Brother added
to the excitement.

637
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,000
Even Consort Lan took an interest.

638
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,640
Father, of course, was delighted.

639
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,880
The venue was changed
to my hunting grounds just like that.

640
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,320
But why would
Third Prince involve himself?

641
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,400
Wuhen told him

642
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,320
my hunting ground

643
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,160
is some holy sanctuary
for sages and spiritual cultivation.

644
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,200
Prince Wuhen alone

645
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,200
wouldn't be able to pull that off.

646
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,720
He must have had Shen Zaiye working
behind the scenes.

647
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,240
Usually,

648
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,880
Wuhen and Shen Zaiye

649
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,440
have always been close.

650
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,000
Do you think

651
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,560
they're trying
to win over Third Brother too?

652
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,320
Before Father left,
he said he sensed something strange.

653
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,120
He suspects
that all these incidents lately

654
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,520
are part
of a plot deliberately targeting you.

655
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,280
He told us to stay alert.

656
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:33,640
Huaijin,

657
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,040
there are too many traces

658
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,680
at the hunting ground.

659
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,680
If the counterfeit money operation
gets exposed,

660
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,080
I'm finished.

661
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,640
Huaijin,

662
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,240
I need your help.

663
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,200
Don't panic.

664
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,880
I'll write to Father at once.

665
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,080
Xiaodongzi,

666
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,480
bring me the hunting grounds map.

667
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,240
Yes, sir.

668
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,640
From this moment forward,

669
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:05,800
shut down the mine.

670
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,640
Seal off all entrances.

671
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,240
Evacuate everyone inside
and relocate them

672
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,360
under tight control.

673
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,120
We cannot afford
even the slightest mistake.

674
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,040
Madam,

675
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,000
the Chancellor says
the Spring Hunt is near.

676
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,840
He knows you've been unwell and says

677
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,080
once you're better,

678
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,800
a bit of fresh air might do you good.

679
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:38,880
All right.

680
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,440
I understand.

681
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,360
Madam, a letter
from Young Master Huaijin.

682
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,400
(I've made arrangements
to dissolve the marriage.)

683
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,956
(But for now, we must act with caution.)

684
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:02,790
(The priority is to keep a close eye
on Chancellor Shen during the hunt.)

685
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:03,190
(Huaijin.)

686
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,080
Madam, what did he say?

687
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,120
He... He said

688
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,720
there's something important.

689
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,320
At the hunt tomorrow,

690
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,120
I must keep a close watch
on the Chancellor.

691
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:20,420
(Royal Hunting Ground)

692
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,680
How are preparations going?

693
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,200
Everything is in place.

694
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,120
You can rest easy, Your Highness.

695
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,240
Good.

696
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,800
This time, Shen Zaiye

697
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:33,920
and his little concubine

698
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,120
