=The Princess's Gambit=

15
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,510
(Adapted from the novel "Peach Blossoms
Reflecting the River and Mountains")

16
00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:40,980
(by Bai Lu Cheng Shuang)

17
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,860
=Episode 1=

18
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,590
(Due to its border with the Qi state,)

19
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,590
(the State of Beiyuan)

20
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,550
(has been ravaged by war,)

21
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,190
(leaving our people high and dry.)

22
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,750
(Now the Emperor
is in a frail condition)

23
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,110
(and the heir is still young,)

24
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,270
(so I shall govern in regency.)

25
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,710
(To show benevolence and restore peace,)

26
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:05,430
(Princess Taohua,)

27
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,150
(titled Chengping,)

28
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,430
(is to be sent to Qi
in a marriage alliance.)

29
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,910
(Chengping's mission)

30
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,910
(is to unite the two nations)

31
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,630
(and end the war.)

32
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,790
(Should anyone defy this decree)

33
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,470
(or slight the alliance,)

34
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,470
(they shall be accused of treason.)

35
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:23,350
(That is all.)

36
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,780
(Jiang Taohua, Princess of Beiyuan)

37
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,150
(Confined for 18 years,)

38
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:36,230
(I never imagined
I could leave the palace alive.)

39
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,030
(I, Taohua,)

40
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:43,350
(will have my revenge.)

41
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,510
This is bad! The Cold Palace caught fire!

42
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,750
The Princess and the Heir are gone!

43
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,950
If we can't find them, we'll lose our heads!

44
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,110
Leave no stone unturned.

45
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:56,910
Search!

46
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,350
Nothing here.

47
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,150
Nothing here.

48
00:03:06,268 --> 00:03:06,948
Over here.

49
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,110
Nothing.

50
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:11,910
Anything here?

51
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:12,950
No.

52
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,270
Search carefully!

53
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,270
And that side?

54
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,550
Nothing.

55
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:52,670
Fools!

56
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,290
Her Highness wants them alive.

57
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:55,950
Go over there and search.

58
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:57,670
Move.

59
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,890
Thankfully,
you prepared these ashes sacks.

60
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,270
Otherwise, we'd be dead.

61
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:03,750
Hush.

62
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:04,870
Let's go.

63
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:12,990
Hurry.

64
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:14,470
Taohua,

65
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:15,900
I still don't understand

66
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,350
why Father agreed to send you
for marriage alliance.

67
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,910
Starting the day he let Lv seize power,

68
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,990
the reason no longer mattered.

69
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,110
Come on.

70
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,230
Quick.

71
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:29,790
Quick.

72
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,220
(Jiang Changjue, Heir of Beiyuan)

73
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,070
(Jiang Changjue, Heir of Beiyuan)
Taohua, it's dawn.

74
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,470
How beautiful.

75
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,110
Changjue,

76
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:45,790
once we go through this,

77
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,190
we'll be free.

78
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,310
Let's go.

79
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,150
Changjue!

80
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,870
Are you all right, Taohua?

81
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:23,270
Changjue,

82
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,470
don't worry about me.

83
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:25,910
You go first.

84
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,280
There's noise over there.

85
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:27,910
Quick!

86
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:33,310
Hurry.

87
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:34,390
Oh no.

88
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,270
They found us.

89
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,190
Quick.

90
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,610
- Hurry.
- Changjue,

91
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,030
run now.

92
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:41,500
Over there.

93
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:42,470
Don't worry about me.

94
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,390
Just go.

95
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,230
Mother,

96
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:06,190
it's all my fault.

97
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,150
It has nothing to do with anyone else.

98
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:09,950
Please punish me.

99
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:11,790
Please free Changjue.

100
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,980
(Lv Yuanhua, Empress of Beiyuan)

101
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,490
Let's talk about the matter at hand.

102
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,950
The State Preceptor says
Changjue is of age to begin his studies.

103
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,710
It's time he trains with the army
to improve himself.

104
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,390
I agree.

105
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,150
Since the peace negotiation is stalled,

106
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,910
and in case another war breaks out,

107
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:42,670
as the heir, Changjue must be the first
to step forward.

108
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:44,510
Pass my decree.

109
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:45,790
The generals

110
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,430
are to train the Heir.

111
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:50,910
Yes, Your Highness.

112
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:56,470
Mother,

113
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,410
Changjue has lived in the palace
since infancy

114
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,990
and never received a proper education.

115
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,870
He has no knowledge
of military or warfare strategy.

116
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:07,710
I fear he might make mistakes
and hinder the state's endeavor.

117
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,830
I made a foolish mistake
for what happened before.

118
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,710
I volunteer for the marriage alliance

119
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,030
to offer myself in exchange for peace

120
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,870
and to ease the burden
on you and Father.

121
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,590
To do so, you're required
to leave the palace

122
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,910
and deal with noblewomen
of the officials

123
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:42,230
and gather intelligence

124
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,150
for Beiyuan.

125
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:47,510
If your identity is exposed,

126
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,230
no one will come to your aid.

127
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,210
Do think twice before you answer.

128
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,150
For the sake of the people of Beiyuan,

129
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,070
I'm willing to risk my life without regret.

130
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,670
But regarding Changjue,

131
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:06,710
I beg you to reconsider.

132
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:08,310
No worries.

133
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,350
As long as you obey,

134
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,870
I'll guarantee Changjue's safety
in the army.

135
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:16,870
Let go of me!

136
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:17,590
Changjue!

137
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:18,550
Let go!

138
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,190
Pull him.

139
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:20,270
Changjue!

140
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:20,710
Move.

141
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:22,470
Changjue!

142
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,230
Taohua!

143
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:23,830
Taohua!

144
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,390
Changjue!

145
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:25,670
Let go!

146
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,710
Changjue!

147
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:27,670
Let go of me!

148
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:28,390
Changjue!

149
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,030
Move.

150
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,790
Taohua!

151
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:42,550
Changjue!

152
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,270
Taohua!

153
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,070
Changjue!

154
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:45,950
Let go of me.

155
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:46,710
Changjue!

156
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,350
Move.

157
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,270
Taohua!

158
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:50,790
Taohua!

159
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,750
Changjue!

160
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,270
Taohua!

161
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,670
You must stay alive!

162
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,510
(Changjue,)

163
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:09,110
(even though we're forced to part,)

164
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:12,430
(as long as you remember our promise.)

165
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,630
(Stay alive.)

166
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:18,110
(And we'll reunite one day.)

167
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,140
(Qi)

168
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,500
(Qi)

169
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:23,110
Your Highness,
we've reached the border of Qi.

170
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:24,670
(Mu Wugou, the first trueborn,)
Who knows what the royal family of Qi

171
00:10:24,671 --> 00:10:25,830
(was made heir early on.)
is really like?

172
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,330
(The Qin family is the second)
Let's hope they're all naive.

173
00:10:27,331 --> 00:10:28,350
(most prominent clan in Qi.)
Let's hope they're all naive.

174
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,700
(Mu Wuhen, the second prince,
is arrogant)

175
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,900
(and he doesn't get along
with the Heir.)

176
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:36,350
It's unlikely for the royal family to be naive.

177
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,350
(The Emperor Qi has four sons.)

178
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,350
(Wu Mugou, the first trueborn,
was made heir early on.)

179
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,790
The Emperor Qi has four sons.

180
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:48,190
The one I'm marrying
is the Fourth Prince.

181
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,490
His mother died when he was young,

182
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,470
and Emperor Qi never favored him.

183
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,890
He was sent away to a temporary
imperial abode at the age of three,

184
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:56,990
(Mu Wuxia, Fourth Prince of Qi State)

185
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,090
(Mu Wuxia, Fourth Prince of Qi State)

186
00:10:58,104 --> 00:10:58,621
What?

187
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,910
(Qingtai, Jiang Taohua's Personal Maid)

188
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,110
I'm afraid so.

189
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,390
The Qi State was only founded
less than a hundred years ago,

190
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,910
but the noble clans within
have flourished for generations,

191
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,470
with influence
deeply rooted and widespread.

192
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:16,630
(Mu Wugou, Heir of Qi State)

193
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,110
comes from the most powerful clan,
the Meng family,

194
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,430
while the second largest clan,
the Qin family,

195
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:24,230
fully supports the Second Prince,
born of Consort Qin.

196
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:27,130
Both of them fight fiercely
inside and outside the imperial court,

197
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,990
(Mu Wuhen, Second Prince of Qi State)

198
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,110
If he makes a single mistake,

199
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,430
I will be doomed as well as his wife.

200
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:35,350
Behind this strife for succession,

201
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,550
there's one key figure,

202
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,190
the Left Chancellor, Shen Zaiye.

203
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,070
This man was of base birth.

204
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:43,490
Ten years ago, when Emperor Qi was
assassinated during his visit to the south,

205
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,870
he saved his life.

206
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:46,390
From then on,

207
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,830
he gained favor from Emperor Qi

208
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,150
and quickly rose through the ranks.

209
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:52,710
He's only thirty now.

210
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,550
He became the Left Chancellor at thirty?

211
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,910
Word has it that he's ruthless,

212
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,990
and nothing can stop him
from achieving his aim.

213
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,340
(Yujing)

214
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,860
The Left Chancellor is
on an official investigation.

215
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,230
No unrelated persons are allowed!

216
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:10,020
(Peng Residence)

217
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:10,950
Chancellor,

218
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,830
the entire Peng family is here.

219
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,190
Among the confiscated assets,

220
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,110
aside from gold and jewelry,

221
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:19,300
a large amount of counterfeit money
is found.

222
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,150
How shameless!

223
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,430
(Peng Si, Gentleman Attendant)

224
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,830
(Peng Si, Gentleman Attendant)
was planted here

225
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,630
(Peng Si, Gentleman Attendant)
when you raided my residence.

226
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,510
Mr. Peng,

227
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,350
I don't quite understand
what you're saying.

228
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:40,110
I came here as I followed the trail
of the counterfeit money case.

229
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,830
The evidence is conclusive.

230
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,910
Looks like I need to use some torture

231
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:48,990
to show you I'm made of.

232
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,070
No.

233
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,110
Father.

234
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,190
Master.

235
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,710
Shen Zaiye.

236
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,270
Master.

237
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,430
Shen Zaiye,

238
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:09,030
how dare you openly
poison a court official?

239
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,830
Those glutinous rice balls are clean.

240
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,950
They're just hot.

241
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,870
Mr. Peng is too eager to eat them.

242
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,230
How can you blame me?

243
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,670
You slandered me

244
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,150
and had me tortured.

245
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:29,270
You vile chancellor!

246
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:33,430
Since you already know I'm vile,

247
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,910
how could you expect me

248
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:37,910
to judge the case

249
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,030
fairly?

250
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:47,790
Mr. Peng,

251
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,470
confess now,

252
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:51,430
and I'll charge you alone.

253
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,590
If you don't,

254
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,680
(Shen Zaiye, Left Chancellor of Qi State)
your whole family will eat

255
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,511
(Shen Zaiye, Left Chancellor of Qi State)

256
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:03,590
and have their stomach scorched through

257
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,110
and vomit blood.

258
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,430
That must be

259
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:11,950
a gruesome sight.

260
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,670
Chancellor, there are
many corrupt officials out there,

261
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,190
(Zhan Lu, Shen Zaiye's Commander of the Imperial Guards)
why make Peng Si take the fall?

262
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,230
Even though he doesn't commit bribery,

263
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,630
he abducts young women.

264
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,070
We've never had a good chance
to punish him.

265
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,590
Using him as bait
to lure the real culprit

266
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:44,870
couldn't be more fitting.

267
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,990
Let's go. Wait for the fish to take the bait.

268
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,830
If what you said yesterday was true,

269
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,550
is the Emperor Qi senile?

270
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,690
How could he make a man like that
the Left Chancellor?

271
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:02,910
On the contrary,

272
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,710
it's precisely what makes him wise.

273
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,230
All four princes are grown,

274
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,030
and all the clans
have taken their sides.

275
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:12,150
There have been several powers
lurking in the state.

276
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,750
If not for the independent force,

277
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,390
the ruthless Shen Zaiye,
who suddenly rose to prominence

278
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:18,790
and challenged them

279
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,550
single-handedly,

280
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,270
the Qi state

281
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:23,790
(Yujing)
would've fallen into chaos.

282
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,410
(Yujing)

283
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,620
(Yujing, Capital of Qi State)

284
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:42,000
(Eunuch Ren, Empress Lv’s Personal Eunuch)

285
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:42,990
As per the Heir's order,

286
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:46,110
a Taoist priest of Mount Taichang
has picked an auspicious hour.

287
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,870
Beiyuan's bride's procession
shall enter the city at Xu hour.

288
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,030
There's no such nonsense for a princess

289
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,550
to wait until dark
to enter the city.

290
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:53,590
This is Qi,

291
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:54,630
not Beiyuan.

292
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,750
When we say Xu hour, then it's Xu hour.

293
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:58,990
You!

294
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:01,630
Eunuch Ren.

295
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:04,990
Let's not stir up trouble.

296
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,230
Qi has its own ways of receiving guests.

297
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,830
Let's follow what they say

298
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,270
and wait until the Xu hour.

299
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,910
If so, I'll do as you say,
Your Highness.

300
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,190
They're warning us at the start.

301
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:22,270
Our life in Qi won't be easy
from here on out.

302
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,590
Your Highness, there you are.

303
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,110
The Princess has reached the city gate.

304
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,190
Why are you still playing with a bird?

305
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,590
What if something goes wrong

306
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,030
with this marriage?

307
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,790
You don't have to be so anxious.

308
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,410
It's just the marriage

309
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:54,590
of a prince who grew up
in a temporary imperial abode,

310
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,390
it's not a big deal.

311
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,550
Even if something does go wrong,

312
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,270
no one will complain.

313
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:01,790
There, there.

314
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:03,910
You've recovered.

315
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:05,070
From now on,

316
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,630
you can fly freely.

317
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:15,230
A bird returning home flies freely,

318
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,190
unfettered in the sky.

319
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,110
It may carry no grand ambition,

320
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,230
yet still longs for the woods.

321
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:23,570
(Zuimeng Pavilion)
(Its flight turns rough)

322
00:17:23,571 --> 00:17:24,470
(Zuimeng Pavilion)
(as encountered clouds,)

323
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,690
(it cries out for a companion.)

324
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,430
(Fame and power may be tempting,)

325
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,510
(still by nature,
it's hard to leave the nest.)

326
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:32,790
Chancellor,

327
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:33,870
this way, please.

328
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,570
(Our informant
on the counterfeit money case reported)

329
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,430
(the liaison he met left)

330
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,990
(after saying this.)

331
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:51,070
(This poem is quite popular
in Zuimeng Pavilion.)

332
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,910
(I suppose he meant to lure me here
for a meeting.)

333
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:56,870
(What is his purpose)

334
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,670
(in luring you here?)

335
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,550
(Whatever his intent may be,)

336
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,190
(be it danger or not,)

337
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:06,670
(I will come.)

338
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:48,630
Qingtai,

339
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:50,990
did you

340
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,190
hear something?

341
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,990
Please don't worry, Your Highness.

342
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,330
It should be the sound of cicadas.

343
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,470
Maybe I'm too tired and heard wrong.

344
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:44,430
Wolves!

345
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,510
Wolves!

346
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,470
There are wolves!

347
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:49,310
Wolves are coming!

348
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:54,670
Hold your position.

349
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:55,750
Grab your weapon.

350
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,430
Don't panic.

351
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:59,510
Don't panic.

352
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:01,910
Stay composed.

353
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,230
Wolves!

354
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:08,550
Don't panic.

355
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,130
Use fire to drive them away.

356
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,070
They're afraid of fire.

357
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,070
Hurry up. Light the torch!

358
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:47,990
Light the torch. Quick.

359
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,630
Quick! Light the torch.

360
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:50,390
Go over there.

361
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,270
Use fire to drive them away.

362
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,150
Don't panic.

363
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:57,590
Go.

364
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,030
Open the city gate.

365
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:08,890
But the Heir said
you could only enter at Xu hour.

366
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:09,910
It's not time yet.

367
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,230
If we all die and the peace negotiation fails,

368
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,750
who among you will take responsibility?

369
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:15,710
Open the gate.

370
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:16,670
Qingtai!

371
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:17,550
Coming.

372
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:18,350
Let's go inside.

373
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:18,990
They're here.

374
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:45,630
Your Highness, run!

375
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:08,150
Block the door.

376
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:21,590
Watch out, Your Highness.

377
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:23,350
Run, Your Highness.

378
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:25,190
You must be careful.

379
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:25,830
I will.

380
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:34,470
Your Highness.

381
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:48,150
Run, Your Highness.

382
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:48,990
I'll hold them off.

383
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:51,830
Be careful.

384
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,390
Are you pleased

385
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,230
with today's gift, Princess?

386
00:23:16,727 --> 00:23:17,990
You invited me here,

387
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,390
(Xue Ran, Martial Artist)
why ambush me?

388
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:26,910
I, Xue Ran, would like to offer you a gift,
Chancellor Shen.

389
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:28,550
But I'm curious

390
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,230
if you're capable enough

391
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,190
of receiving this gift.

392
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:34,950
Let me guess.

393
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:37,310
A few days ago,

394
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:38,950
my men were exposed

395
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,830
when tracking the counterfeit money.

396
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:47,950
The smuggler fled.

397
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:50,910
They wanted to bring back
the carriage drivers for interrogation,

398
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,310
but they all took poison and died.

399
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:54,670
So the trail has gone cold.

400
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,590
That one who fled
likely didn't want to die.

401
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:01,550
But he wouldn't live either

402
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:02,910
if he returned,

403
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:06,030
so he thought of using it as leverage

404
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:07,310
to fight his own way

405
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,430
to survive.

406
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,150
You see through it all.

407
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,990
In that case,
I'll cut right to the chase.

408
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,870
I want to trade something you want

409
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:26,270
for the lives of my whole family.

410
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:30,830
Tell me,

411
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:32,110
what's the offer?

412
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,390
I've traveled across the land
over the past years

413
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:38,670
and recorded every mountain and river
I saw into a scroll,

414
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:40,830
namely "Sunlight over a Thousand Peaks".

415
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,910
If you could find the mystery lies in it,

416
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:45,990
what you're after can be resolved.

417
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:50,030
Stalling with a drawing, huh?

418
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:53,150
Are you afraid I might betray you

419
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:54,510
once I get the clue?

420
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:58,350
My family's lives are tied to this.

421
00:24:58,750 --> 00:24:59,830
I dare not take any chances.

422
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:02,870
Since you've come to me,

423
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,910
you should know how I handle things.

424
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,870
Hand over the map.

425
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:09,310
Tomorrow,

426
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:12,110
someone will escort your family
out of the city.

427
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,890
Thank you for your kindness,
Chancellor Shen.

428
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:21,790
Who's there?

429
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,070
Let's split.

430
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:26,470
Yes, sir.

431
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:28,670
What?

432
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,270
Wolf attack?

433
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:31,110
Yes.

434
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:34,700
The gate guard reported that after the Princess
and her maidservant entered the city,

435
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:35,750
they disappeared.

436
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,350
Even if it was an attack,

437
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,970
there should've been
some traces left behind.

438
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,030
I'm afraid this isn't an accident.

439
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:45,310
Wang Xi,

440
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:48,230
arrange a group of men to search
for the Princess with me.

441
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:48,710
Yes.

442
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:49,110
Quick.

443
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:52,990
If you hadn't insisted Her Highness
wait until the Xu hour to enter,

444
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:54,750
she wouldn't have been in danger.

445
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,190
Slap her.

446
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:58,710
Hyah!

447
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,270
Hyah!

448
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,070
Stop.

449
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:05,310
Speak up.

450
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,350
Where's the Princess?

451
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,470
If the Princess can't be found,

452
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,230
all of you die.

453
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:22,950
Wugou, why are you punishing
her maidservant here

454
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:24,790
instead of searching for the Princess?

455
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,830
The Princess went missing

456
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:32,160
even before she was brought
to your mansion.

457
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,490
She failed her duty
to protect her master.

458
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:36,950
She deserves this.

459
00:26:45,401 --> 00:26:45,950
Wugou,

460
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,590
since they're the Princess's servants,

461
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:49,670
they'll soon

462
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,190
be mine as well.

463
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:53,870
Please do me a favor

464
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,470
and spare them.

465
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,950
A prince who grew up
in a temporary imperial abode,

466
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:02,130
who you think you are
to ask for a favor from me?

467
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:05,270
But...

468
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:16,310
Since it's your wedding day,

469
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:17,830
as your brother,

470
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,110
I'll give you this favor.

471
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,870
Consider it my wedding gift for you.

472
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,750
Thank you for your consideration, Wugou.

473
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,110
However,

474
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:37,430
this marriage alliance is important.

475
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:39,230
Please join me

476
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,590
in searching for the Princess.

477
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,110
Pass my order.

478
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,270
Split into squads

479
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:48,150
and search the entire city.

480
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,110
Yes, Your Highness.

481
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:53,830
Sir, where are you going?

482
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,430
(That shadow was clearly
coming this way.)

483
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,110
Sir,

484
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,150
where are you doing?

485
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:59,510
Sir, don't leave.

486
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:00,550
Sir.

487
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:02,390
Sir.

488
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:04,710
(It's here.)

489
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:06,510
Let's leave.

490
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,070
(This is)

491
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,470
(the aphrodisiac powder.)

492
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:03,910
Who are you?

493
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:07,750
Aren't all who come here

494
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:09,990
patrons?

495
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:15,430
Let go of me.

496
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:19,470
I was drugged with the strongest
aphrodisiac powder.

497
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,910
Hurting me

498
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,750
won't help.

499
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:27,910
From the look of you,

500
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:30,230
you didn't come here of your own will.

501
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,670
Tell me everything you know,

502
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,670
and I won't touch you.

503
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:36,670
If not,

504
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:40,070
I'm not a gentleman,

505
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,190
I'll let the drug take over

506
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,310
and play along,

507
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,630
and no one can blame me afterward.

508
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,510
How dare you!

509
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:48,790
I'm

510
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:50,270
Beiyuan's

511
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:51,430
Princess...

512
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:52,390
Don't speak.

513
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,300
Your Majesty, please look.

514
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:01,760
This is Beiyuan's princess
who came for the marriage alliance,

515
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:02,750
Princess Chengping.

516
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:06,300
(Emperor Qi)

517
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,950
She has a decent look.

518
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:09,190
Pretty good.

519
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,950
(Who drugged the Beiyuan princess)

520
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:15,590
(and lured me here?)

521
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,630
What a brilliant move indeed.

522
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,470
It's a shame that such a beauty

523
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:26,910
will have to bear

524
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,430
the name of an assassin.

525
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:57,750
Your Highness!

526
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:01,690
Your Highness.

527
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:02,390
Your Highness.

528
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:03,730
Your Highness.

529
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,290
Your Highness.

530
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:20,910
Chancellor Shen.

531
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,230
Why is the Princess of Beiyuan

532
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,070
with you?

533
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:56,097
(Yujing Inn)

534
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:01,510
Your Highness,

535
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:03,910
last night at Zuimeng Pavilion...

536
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:05,190
Nothing happened.

537
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,070
But

538
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:09,230
why was the vile chancellor with you?

539
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:10,910
Vile chancellor?

540
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:15,430
No wonder he tried to kill me.

541
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:20,990
Has Emperor Qi summoned me

542
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:22,550
or Eunuch Ren over this matter?

543
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:31,390
What's wrong, Your Highness?

544
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:34,470
There was a big mistake made
while receiving the bride's procession,

545
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:35,910
I'm sure Qi

546
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:37,950
has called an emergency
court meeting to discuss.

547
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,380
However, if without the victim,

548
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:43,110
the truth will be whatever they say it is.

549
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:46,150
Left Chancellor Shen Zaiye

550
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:47,990
has done such an outrageous act

551
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,430
with the Princess of Beiyuan

552
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,710
during the peace negotiation,

553
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:54,270
we urge Your Majesty to dismiss him

554
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,830
to preserve the reputation of Qi.

555
00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:01,590
- Please consider the nation
- Please consider the nation

556
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,190
- and the people, Your Majesty!
- and the people, Your Majesty!

557
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:07,710
Hear that?

558
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:10,110
If I don't remove you today,

559
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:12,310
I'll become a foolish emperor

560
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:14,370
who doesn't care about
the nation and my people.

561
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:18,510
Those clueless

562
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:21,390
might've thought they were with me
in the Zuimeng Pavilion.

563
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:22,750
You still have the mood to joke?

564
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,270
Tell me, then.

565
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,710
The officials are using this opportunity
to strike at you,

566
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:30,910
how do you defend yourself?

567
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:32,990
Your Majesty,

568
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,260
there's no way to prove myself
when it comes to private matters as such.

569
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:36,790
They don't care about the truth at all.

570
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,130
The more I try to explain,

571
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,350
the more excuses I give them.

572
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,750
If they want to fan the flames,

573
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:42,870
I'll give them

574
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:44,750
more fuel

575
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:46,670
and let the fire grow stronger.

576
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:49,590
That way, those who harbor bad intentions
will reveal their true color.

577
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:51,830
What do you mean?

578
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:55,610
Your Majesty.

579
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:04,710
Are you suggesting

580
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,150
that the ones making the most noise

581
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:09,780
might be involved
in the counterfeit money case?

582
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:10,270
Maybe.

583
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:11,670
After all,

584
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:13,470
I have too many enemies.

585
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:14,910
That being said,

586
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:17,670
they've helped me
narrow down the suspects.

587
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,590
The counterfeit money case

588
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,430
concerns national safety.

589
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,270
Whoever is found involved

590
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:27,070
must be punished.

591
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:29,310
Yes, Your Majesty.

592
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,190
(Post Station)

593
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,670
Don't worry, Your Highness.

594
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:36,330
The Emperor Qi has sent
so many soldiers to protect you.

595
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:37,870
It's not as serious as you think.

596
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:40,590
Look.

597
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:43,830
Those soldiers

598
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:45,590
are mostly facing inward.

599
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:48,700
That means they're not protecting me

600
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:50,230
but watching me.

601
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:54,350
But you're innocent.

602
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:56,710
The truth doesn't matter.

603
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:58,030
What matters is

604
00:35:58,350 --> 00:35:59,950
they need me to appear guilty.

605
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:05,230
I'm afraid the marriage alliance
may fail.

606
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,430
We need to prepare in advance.

607
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:14,630
It's pitiful that the Princess
got dragged into this mess.

608
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:16,990
How will you do

609
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:17,710
with this?

610
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,950
In everyone's eyes,
she's already deflowered,

611
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:24,790
and her marriage to the Fourth Prince
is impossible.

612
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:27,250
Fortunately, it's Beiyuan
who requests this marriage.

613
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,350
Just ask them to pick another lady.

614
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:33,550
That's the only option left.

615
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:36,670
You'll deliver the decree
to the Princess.

616
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:40,790
Your Highness,

617
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:42,390
what's your plan?

618
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:46,950
I must find a way to meet Emperor Qi

619
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:48,550
and secure this marriage.

620
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:49,990
Otherwise,

621
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:51,950
if I were to be sent back to Beiyuan,

622
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:53,990
both Changjue's life and mine

623
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:55,470
would be at stake.

624
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:59,350
(Since I've reached a dead end,)

625
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,230
(all I can do is make a last stand)

626
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:02,900
(for one last chance at survival.)

627
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:06,590
(From now on,)

628
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,550
(I will protect)

629
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:12,190
