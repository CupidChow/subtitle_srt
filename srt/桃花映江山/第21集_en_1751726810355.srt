1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,440
The wind and rain scatter and the clouds are still.

2
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,720
How can I stay alive and live in this life?

3
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,680
If I could stay with you in my life,

4
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,280
if you could understand my sincerity,

5
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:55,280
I would be happy to be with you in this life.

6
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,440
Even if I have to spend my life with you,

7
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,440
I would spend my life with you.

8
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,760
The unwavering struggle for destiny

9
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,440
has broken the balance.

10
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,640
Fate is a combination of right and wrong, love and hate.

11
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,640
If I could stay with you in my life,

12
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,040
I would be happy to be with you in this life.

13
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:27,440
I would not wait for you to come back.

14
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:39,440
The Long Ballad

15
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,440
Episode 16

16
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,440
You're all useless!

17
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,440
You're all useless!

18
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,440
All of you, get lost!

19
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,440
Why is the world so chaotic?

20
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,440
Did something big happen?

21
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,440
What are you doing?

22
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,440
You're making a noise. Don't you know His Highness is inside?

23
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,440
Brother Qing Feng, the manor below sent a cart of fruit and vegetables.

24
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,440
We wanted to give His Highness a taste.

25
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,440
The Northern Courtyard's envoy just entered the city, but the Prime Minister stopped him.

26
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,440
His Highness is in a big storm.

27
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,440
Why did Shen Zai Yi stop the Northern Courtyard's envoy?

28
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,440
Is he still going to entangle with me?

29
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,440
His Highness is not satisfied with this matter.

30
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,440
If he sends me back to the Northern Courtyard, what should I do?

31
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,440
You can't get any advantage if you go now.

32
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,440
Let's go.

33
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,440
Yes.

34
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,440
The Northern Courtyard

35
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,440
You are the Prime Minister of Qi, Shen Zai Yi?

36
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,440
You've come from afar. Thank you for your hard work.

37
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,440
Shen Zai Yi, why did you detain us?

38
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,440
If you can't give us an explanation, I will never give up.

39
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:46,440
The Minister of Rites, Wang Yuan Qi, the future empress, is very capable and kind.

40
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,440
Take him away.

41
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,440
Shen Zai Yi, I am the Northern Courtyard's envoy, Wen Zong Ling.

42
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,440
How dare you arrest me?

43
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,440
What are you going to do?

44
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,440
Are you going to kill us?

45
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:04,440
I invited you all here today to talk about Princess Chengping's past.

46
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,440
You are all the old friends of Princess Chengping in the Northern Courtyard.

47
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,440
The princess once said that

48
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,440
the princess was killed by a spy in Qi.

49
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,440
Killed?

50
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,440
I'm afraid you're not going to investigate her accomplice.

51
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,440
I've never treated her well.

52
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,440
Yes, she has a sharp tongue.

53
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,440
I cut her three days' food to make her more aggressive.

54
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,440
I left a bowl of chili water in her room.

55
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,440
You have a plan to use chili water?

56
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,440
And me.

57
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,440
This bitch can't control her legs and runs out.

58
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,440
I used a rope to pull her feet.

59
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,440
She was locked in the room and was always shouting.

60
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,440
There was a snake in her mouth.

61
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,440
I was tired of hearing it several times.

62
00:04:49,440 --> 00:05:16,680
I threw some martial arts

63
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,440
Everyone was watching.

64
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:24,440
So I have to be more vigilant about everything.

65
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,440
Good.

66
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,440
Good.

67
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,440
Zhan Lu.

68
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,440
Take her away.

69
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,440
Take her away.

70
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,440
Young Master.

71
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,440
Young Master.

72
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,440
Let me go.

73
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,440
Please spare my life.

74
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,440
Please spare my life.

75
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,440
Young Master.

76
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,440
Did you hear that?

77
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,440
Prime Minister Shen is interrogating the people in the North Court.

78
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,440
I heard that these people have offended Princess Chengping.

79
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,440
I heard that this action seems to have been used to torture her.

80
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,440
Come in.

81
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,440
Hurry up.

82
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,440
Hurry up.

83
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,440
Don't move.

84
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,440
Or I'll beat you up.

85
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,440
Chief.

86
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,440
The news has been released.

87
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,440
Everyone is busy.

88
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,440
They are blocking the way.

89
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,440
Who are we going to show this?

90
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,440
Why do you care so much?

91
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,440
Don't talk too much.

92
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,440
Do more work.

93
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,440
Yes.

94
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,440
The princess is here.

95
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,440
She is at the door.

96
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,440
There was a scream just now.

97
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,440
The North Court people are not watching.

98
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,440
They are watching.

99
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,440
They are watching.

100
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,440
They are watching.

101
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,440
The North Court people are not watching.

102
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,440
They dare to offend the Prime Minister.

103
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,440
Go open the side door.

104
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,440
Yes.

105
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,440
I heard that they caught her as soon as she entered the city.

106
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,440
The princess is really a little bit painful.

107
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,440
Prime Minister.

108
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,440
Please let me remember this person first.

109
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,440
Go.

110
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,440
You two talk.

111
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,440
What do I want to hear?

112
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,440
The more detailed, the better.

113
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,440
The princess has been good and kind since childhood.

114
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,440
She has been favored.

115
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,440
Good and kind.

116
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,440
She is being punished.

117
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,440
Take her away.

118
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,440
Prime Minister, please forgive me.

119
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,440
This is really a big trouble.

120
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,440
Prime Minister, please forgive me.

121
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,440
Prime Minister, please forgive me.

122
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,440
Prince Li.

123
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,440
Lan Jing.

124
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,440
Little Xizi.

125
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,440
What is Shen Zaiye going to do?

126
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,440
What about you three?

127
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,440
It is said that since the previous queen left first,

128
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,440
Princess Chengping's position has been taken.

129
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,440
She and her younger brother are in the palace.

130
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,440
It is even more difficult to do.

131
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,440
I remember that

132
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,440
when the previous queen left first,

133
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,440
the princess was only seven years old.

134
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,440
She held the four-year-old Changjue.

135
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,440
Two little people were crying there.

136
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,440
I was heartbroken.

137
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,440
Continue.

138
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,440
Your Highness.

139
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,440
As you know,

140
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,440
the previous queen was in the palace.

141
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,440
His Majesty did favor the princess.

142
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,440
But later,

143
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,440
the little princess and Changjue

144
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,440
were driven to the Cold Palace.

145
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,440
I can testify that

146
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,440
the people in the palace are all despicable.

147
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,440
In order to flatter the Empress Lv,

148
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,440
they are very good at using the princess.

149
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,440
Especially the few people who were taken away just now.

150
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,440
They are even more despicable.

151
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,440
I once remembered that

152
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,440
the cold winter was so cold

153
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,440
that Changjue fell ill.

154
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,440
Her body was cold and she was very old.

155
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,440
In order to get the medicine,

156
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,440
the princess was forced to kneel down by the Empress Lv.

157
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,440
But in the end,

158
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,440
the princess still could not get the medicine.

159
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,440
She cried all the way back to the Cold Palace.

160
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,440
I really could not bear to see her

161
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,440
secretly send the firewood and medicine to the princess.

162
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,440
The princess wanted to thank me,

163
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,440
but she was too shy.

164
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,440
The whole Cold Palace

165
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:34,440
could not even get a good nurse.

166
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,440
The princess and the crown prince

167
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,440
were all treated with mercy.

168
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,440
But

169
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,440
they were all treated with mercy.

170
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,440
They were often forced to do so.

171
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,440
Give me some tea.

172
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,440
Give it to me.

173
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,440
Give it back to me.

174
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,440
Father.

175
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,440
Here, here, here.

176
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,440
Qiu Yanzhi,

177
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,440
beg me.

178
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,440
I will give you a cake if you beg me.

179
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,440
Please beg me.

180
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,440
I did not expect that the princess

181
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,440
would give you a cake

182
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,440
for such a low price.

183
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,440
Then, give it to me.

184
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,440
Go and pick it up, little beggar.

185
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,440
Little beggar, little beggar.

186
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,440
Princess.

187
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,440
Princess, do not eat it.

188
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,440
This is clean.

189
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,440
Princess, eat this.

190
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,440
Since then,

191
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,440
I have never had a fight with the princess.

192
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,440
What did the princess do?

193
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,440
I...

194
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,440
I really do not know.

195
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,440
Prime Minister.

196
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,440
Prime Minister, please spare my life.

197
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,440
Prime Minister, please spare my life.

198
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,440
Prime Minister, please spare my life.

199
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,440
I did not know that the princess was guilty.

200
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,440
But I only felt that the little boy was innocent.

201
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,440
Please forgive me.

202
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,440
You did not do anything wrong.

203
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,440
If I did not do anything wrong,

204
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,440
what crime did I commit?

205
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,440
You did not do anything wrong.

206
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,440
If it were not for you,

207
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,440
how could the princess still live

208
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,440
in the harem of the devils?

209
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,440
The reason why the Prime Minister

210
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,440
called you here to the chess game

211
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,440
is because he wanted to thank you in person.

212
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,440
The reward from the Prime Minister

213
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,440
is all yours.

214
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,440
Why are you crying?

215
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,440
I am thinking

216
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,440
that the princess is happy.

217
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,440
The princess has finally found

218
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,440
the person who cares about her.

219
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,440
The person who cares about me

220
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,440
is Shen Zai Yi.

221
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,440
Come.

222
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,440
Send everyone out.

223
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,440
Prime Minister,

224
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,440
the princess has just arrived.

225
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,440
I am sorry.

226
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,440
I did not know that

227
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,440
the princess was innocent.

228
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,440
I am sorry.

229
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,440
I did not know that

230
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,440
the princess was innocent.

231
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,440
I am sorry.

232
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,440
I did not know that

233
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,440
the princess was innocent.

234
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,440
I am sorry.

235
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,440
I did not know that

236
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,440
the princess was innocent.

237
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,440
I am sorry.

238
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,440
I did not know that

239
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,440
the princess was innocent.

240
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,440
I am sorry.

241
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,440
I did not know that

242
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,440
the princess was innocent.

243
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,440
Those simple and ordinary moments

244
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,440
remind me of my dream.

245
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,440
You still

246
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,440
do not want to see me.

247
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,440
I do not care about the common things.

248
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,440
Those memories

249
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,440
are still in my heart.

250
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,440
They last forever.

251
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,440
My heart is filled with feelings.

252
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,440
It is so heartless.

253
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,440
I am sorry.

254
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,440
Miss Meng Er.

255
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,440
Why are you here?

256
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,440
I wanted to find the princess.

257
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,440
But I was lost

258
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,440
and lost my way in the mansion.

259
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,440
If so,

260
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,440
I will take you to her.

261
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,440
Thank you.

262
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,440
Miss Meng Er.

263
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,440
Her Highness will be here soon.

264
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,440
What is going on?

265
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,440
So clumsy.

266
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,440
Tang Qian.

267
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,440
What do you want?

268
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,440
Your Highness.

269
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,440
I have been feeling

270
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,440
hungry since I woke up.

271
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,440
I just remembered

272
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,440
that I should come to

273
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,440
greet you every day

274
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,440
according to the etiquette.

275
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,440
So I came here in a hurry.

276
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,440
Please do not blame me.

277
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,440
I am not good at

278
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,440
these meaningless formalities.

279
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,440
You do not have to come.

280
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,440
Yes.

281
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,440
I will go back first.

282
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,440
Hua.

283
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,440
Jiang Taohua

284
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,440
really does not remember anything?

285
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,440
He is confused.

286
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,440
Now he listens

287
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,440
to me.

288
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,440
He is very thoughtful.

289
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,440
You should not be careless.

290
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,440
I will listen to you.

291
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,440
I will be very careful.

292
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,440
The oil is ready.

293
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,440
The five books are ready.

294
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,440
Recently,

295
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,440
the weather has been

296
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,440
very gloomy.

297
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,440
It is just like

298
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,440
our master's face.

299
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,440
Lord Liu.

300
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,440
You are very careful.

301
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,440
I am not.

302
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,440
I am just a little bit

303
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,440
confused.

304
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,440
I am not.

305
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,440
I am just a little bit

306
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,440
confused.

307
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,440
I am just a little bit

308
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,440
confused.

309
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,440
Lord.

310
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,440
You are very careful.

311
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,440
Minister Qin.

312
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,440
Please help me to see.

313
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,440
Minister Wang.

314
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,440
This is a strategy.

315
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,440
I still have important things to do.

316
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,440
You two.

317
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,440
I have a strategy here.

318
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,440
Can you help me?

319
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,440
I am sorry, Fourth Prince.

320
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,440
We still have other things to do.

321
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,440
What is the matter that you are worried about?

322
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,440
I am worried about you.

323
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,440
Prime Minister Li is very righteous.

324
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,440
I don't want to bother you

325
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,440
with my business.

326
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,440
Let me see.

327
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,440
This is a top-level strategy.

328
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,440
I am afraid it will not

329
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,440
suit your taste.

330
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,440
What is the quality of Li Jauhan?

331
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,440
What is the general standard?

332
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,440
No quality, no quality.

333
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,440
It is more expensive.

334
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,440
It is just a pity.

335
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,440
There is no one who knows the truth.

336
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,440
I let you do nothing.

337
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,440
There is no one who knows the truth.

338
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:49,960
State

339
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,440
Nice gift, nice dream, nice prophecy.

340
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,440
Questioning,anosy.

341
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,440
If았 Photoshop,

342
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,640
Sprats

343
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,800
Old people

344
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,680
I think more salt

345
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:16,700
Huairui

346
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,600
Bring us tea

347
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,320
Officer Gao

348
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,320
He can't be antitild

349
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:30,760
Maybe he could be our

350
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:31,840
Problem, Your Highness

351
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:32,800
Your Highness

352
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,800
About Li Zhuohan

353
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,760
how is he?

354
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,040
So, you haven't got the final product.

355
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,360
The final product is the land of the royal family.

356
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,920
It's of no quality.

357
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:46,920
How about

358
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,120
I give it to my father directly?

359
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:49,720
Let him...

360
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,440
No.

361
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,040
Now the court is heavily occupied.

362
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,320
In order to balance the parties,

363
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,400
His Majesty has forced the left to be promoted.

364
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,720
Even so,

365
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,280
it's a lot of work.

366
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,480
It's complicated.

367
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,720
If you make the proposal,

368
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,680
I'm afraid it will cause a dispute.

369
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,480
In the end,

370
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,640
it's hard to protect the talent.

371
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,680
But the talent is rare.

372
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,520
Don't worry, Your Highness.

373
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,720
Such talent,

374
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,200
I'll try my best to recommend him.

375
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,120
I'll start with the selection process.

376
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,240
Then I'll make the proposal step by step.

377
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,240
Is that okay?

378
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,040
It's more appropriate.

379
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,000
Don't worry, Your Highness.

380
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,040
I'll do my best

381
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,680
to recommend Li Jiahai to be the official.

382
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,520
But there are some minor things

383
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,960
that we need to do with all our might.

384
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,480
Where is Qingtai?

385
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,760
Your Highness,

386
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,560
she has been locked in the room

387
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,520
except for sending the peach blossoms for the meal.

388
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,360
Send her out of the mansion.

389
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,240
Your Highness,

390
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,640
what did she do wrong?

391
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,880
Your Highness, Hua is here.

392
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,320
You should be more careful.

393
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,480
First, separate the peach blossoms

394
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,360
from Qingtai.

395
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,960
Or Qingtai...

396
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,000
No need for now.

397
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,240
The peach blossoms are important to this maid.

398
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,840
Keep them.

399
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,640
Maybe we can use them in the future.

400
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,320
Yes.

401
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,240
Miss Mo'er,

402
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,200
it's time for dinner.

403
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,280
Where is Qingtai?

404
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,360
Your Highness has another arrangement for Qingtai.

405
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,920
I'll bring her food in the future.

406
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,320
If it's inconvenient,

407
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,680
I'll bring her some food.

408
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,160
I'll bring her some food.

409
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,600
If it's inconvenient,

410
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,240
please take more responsibility.

411
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,760
Qingfeng,

412
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,400
I'm now in the care of the Third Prince.

413
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,320
There's no position

414
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,240
in this mansion.

415
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,040
Now even a maid

416
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,680
can't stay with me.

417
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,720
Miss, you're joking.

418
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,920
His Highness values you very much.

419
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,440
In this mansion,

420
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,760
you're the only maid

421
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,000
who has never been here.

422
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,000
If that's the case,

423
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,000
you should consider

424
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,560
the consequences of offending me.

425
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,960
Although I have no power or power,

426
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,800
His Highness made sure I stayed.

427
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,200
It means I'm useful to him.

428
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,000
If I can help His Highness,

429
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,560
I can help you wear a shoe.

430
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,040
It's convenient.

431
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,120
Miss Mo'er,

432
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,720
what did I do wrong?

433
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,760
Let me ask you.

434
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,640
Where is Qingtai?

435
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:10,960
Miss,

436
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,600
I can only tell you

437
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,840
that Qingtai is alive.

438
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,520
As for the rest,

439
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,960
even if you kill me,

440
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,000
I can't tell you.

441
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:20,960
Leave.

442
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,280
He's so cold-hearted.

443
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,800
When Qingtai comes to us,

444
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,960
I must find him.

445
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,560
Brother Jiao Han,

446
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,280
I'm Mo Huai Rui,

447
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,800
the son of Grand Secretary Gao.

448
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,360
Greetings, Mr. Mo.

449
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,360
What's the matter?

450
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,440
Come on, sit down.

451
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,680
Brother Jiao Han,

452
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,360
I wish you

453
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,320
to grow up from now on.

454
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,160
What are you talking about?

455
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,960
I'm just a nobody.

456
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,560
Brother Jiao Han,

457
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,400
I just said

458
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,960
I'm the son of Grand Secretary Gao.

459
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,720
Don't you understand

460
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,440
that Grand Secretary Gao

461
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,240
is a righteous official and a humble man.

462
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,720
He's a good man

463
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,440
and a great man.

464
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,440
And you're talented and righteous.

465
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,360
He has read your article

466
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,400
and praised you.

467
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,960
That's why he sent me to meet you.

468
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,440
Mr. Mo,

469
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,720
you're really a good man.

470
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,680
I need your help.

471
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,840
But...

472
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,960
But what?

473
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,560
You wrote too much

474
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,240
and caused a lot of trouble.

475
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,320
His Majesty can't implement it in a short time.

476
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,000
Why don't you start from the beginning?

477
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,640
A small mistake?

478
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,720
For example, write a short and humble

479
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,680
official article.

480
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,680
This way, Grand Secretary Gao will be a good man

481
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,440
and you'll be a good official.

482
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,080
And don't involve too many families

483
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,920
or they'll be against it.

484
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,440
It's not difficult.

485
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,760
I can write and write.

486
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,520
But there's no ink here.

487
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,520
Otherwise...

488
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,880
Brother Jiao Han, look.

489
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,600
I've already prepared it for you.

490
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,320
Please.

491
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,080
Go.

492
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,400
Thank you, Brother Jiao Han.

493
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,720
Wait for my good news.

494
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,640
Thank you, Brother Huai Rui.

495
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,840
I'lling Jinzheng

496
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,720
Be wrapped up with it.

497
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,040
That's too much.

498
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,800
I'm tired of it.

499
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,960
And I need to copy it before I can use it.

500
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,040
But with this,

501
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,960
I...

502
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,960
I don't know if he heard me interrogating the North Garden Envoy.

503
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,960
If he heard it,

504
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,360
what would he think?

505
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,960
I don't know.

506
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,960
I don't know.

507
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,960
I don't know.

508
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,960
I don't know.

509
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,960
My Lord, our men from Ding Shao reported that

510
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,960
the Third Prince left the mansion in a carriage.

511
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,960
The Princess didn't come with him.

512
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,960
I'm sorry.

513
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,960
It seems that you are not in this mansion

514
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,960
like the peace collection I played in the last visit.

515
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,960
Why are you dressed like this?

516
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,960
What are you doing here?

517
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,960
I have something to ask you.

518
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,960
You are so late. Why don't you go to bed early?

519
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,960
Is something wrong?

520
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,960
No.

521
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,960
I was in the room just now.

522
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,960
I'm going to rest now.

523
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,960
You can leave.

524
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,960
Shen Xiang,

525
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,960
how much trouble do you want to make?

526
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,960
I will solve the trouble for you in the future.

527
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,960
Do you really think that

528
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,960
the people of the North Garden Envoy's group are ungrateful?

529
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,960
Jiang Taohua,

530
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,960
this is just the beginning.

531
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,960
All the grievances and evil things you have suffered in the past,

532
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,960
I will get them back for you one by one.

533
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,960
Until you solve the poison of Jiang Taodan,

534
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,960
until Changjue is safe and sound.

535
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,960
How do you know?

536
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,960
I only hate that I know too late

537
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,960
and let you suffer too much.

538
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,960
What is the relationship between us?

539
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,960
When you left Lu Yu Jing,

540
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,960
did you really have a grudge against me?

541
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,960
Do you really forget everything?

542
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,960
This matter is shocking.

543
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,960
She and my nephew are like cattle and cats.

544
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,960
You didn't get married to the Fourth Prince,

545
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,960
so you entered my house.

546
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,960
Impossible.

547
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,960
Even if I came for the marriage,

548
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,960
I am also the Princess Chengping of the North Garden.

549
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,960
When I first entered the Yu Jing,

550
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,960
I entered the Third Prince's house.

551
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,960
I was married to the Third Prince.

552
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,960
You were married to the Third Prince?

553
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,960
Did he tell you that?

554
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,960
I remember.

555
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,960
It's just that after coming to the Great Qi,

556
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,960
I have some trouble.

557
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,960
What else do you remember?

558
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,960
Tell me.

559
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:52,960
I remember

560
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,960
the Third Prince was on the high platform to help me.

561
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,960
I remember the face of the Third Prince, Xiao Ying Ying.

562
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,960
I remember.

563
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:02,960
Then in your memory,

564
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,960
is there me?

565
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,960
Since you came to the Yu Jing,

566
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,960
you have been with a man.

567
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,960
Don't believe anyone.

568
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,960
Go.

569
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,960
You go.

570
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,960
Where is Qingtai now?

571
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,960
I was just going to find Qingtai.

572
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,960
Is she still in the house?

573
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,960
I don't know.

574
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,960
She told me

575
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,960
she was in the house asking for help in private.

576
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,960
I don't know.

577
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,960
She told me

578
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,960
she was in the house asking for help in private.

579
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,960
Wait for me here.

580
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,960
I'll go find her.

581
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,960
I'll go with you.

582
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,960
Fine.

583
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,960
As long as you find Qingtai,

584
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,960
everything will be clear.

585
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,960
Jiang Daohua,

586
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,960
I know you are worried.

587
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,960
I just want you to remember,

588
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,960
no matter when,

589
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,960
you can always believe me.

590
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,960
I'll go now.

591
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,960
There is no incense room.

592
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,960
Even the south and stove room are empty.

593
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,960
There is no track of Qingtai.

594
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,960
Could she be not in the house?

595
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,960
I'll go find elsewhere.

596
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,960
Who is it?

597
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,980
He is segueing to Mount Jun.

598
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,380
How did we get here?

599
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,400
But supposedly,

600
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,360
mountain mutualism and mutual understanding

601
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,080
is a foreign jump can be maintained.

602
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,800
Why didn't he come back here by then?

603
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:37,700
있기.

604
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:51,740
the

605
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:53,580
You are

606
00:31:54,260 --> 00:32:21,380
the daughter of Apothecary House

607
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,420
Your Highness.

608
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,980
This is the Third Prince's bedroom.

609
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,740
Where can I hide my identity here?

610
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,220
I've been here before.

611
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,220
I didn't find anything strange.

612
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,340
Many nobles

613
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,300
have their own secret room in the bedroom.

614
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,460
When you came here,

615
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,420
I informed you.

616
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,500
The coins.

617
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,460
The Third Prince is a prince.

618
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,140
He shouldn't need the coins.

619
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,420
But he put a lot of coins in the bedroom.

620
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,860
He kept them carefully.

621
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:09,900
Where?

622
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:10,740
Come.

623
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,340
Who is it?

624
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:17,780
Who is here?

625
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,660
I'll go and hide them.

626
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,060
Before you find Qingtan,

627
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,540
you should protect yourself.

628
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,340
Stop.

629
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,340
Don't run.

630
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,860
I'm so anxious again.

631
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,420
Why am I so anxious

632
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,820
every time I see him?

633
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,020
Why am I so sad

634
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,100
every time I see his back?

635
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,140
Be quiet.

636
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:54,820
Don't talk to me.

637
00:33:59,060 --> 00:33:59,900
He ran that way.

638
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:00,540
Stop.

639
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,300
Stop.

640
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:07,820
This place

641
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,580
must be the secret entrance.

642
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,780
Is this the Baguazhen

643
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,620
that we're looking for?

644
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,220
Baguazhen Fn

645
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,500

646
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,780

648

! kab

649
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:43,940
I can't find a sound here.

650
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,940
If it's the other way around,

651
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,940
who will come out of the dead gate?

652
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,940
The dead gate is the palace of Kun.

653
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:54,940
It symbolizes the female genitals.

654
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:56,940
I heard that the Third Prince

655
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:57,940
has been living with Sister Bao since childhood.

656
00:34:58,940 --> 00:34:59,940
The key to the secret

657
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:01,940
is Kun, right?

658
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:08,940
It's done.

659
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,940
Kun.

660
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,940
It's strange.

661
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:38,940
It's a secret room.

662
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:40,940
Why is it so dark?

663
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:42,940
It's like a wedding room.

664
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:45,940
Wait.

665
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:47,940
This is...

666
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:55,940
This bracelet...

667
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:58,940
I think I've seen it somewhere.

668
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:10,940
It's Lü Ao's.

669
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:14,940
It's Lü Ao's.

670
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:34,940
Hua.

671
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,940
All the places you've known

672
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,940
will be your World in the future.

673
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:50,940
I have nowhere to tell you my feelings.

674
00:37:55,940 --> 00:38:02,940
I wish to grow up in the mud.

675
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:09,940
I regret to die in despair.

676
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:16,940
I still hope that the flowers in my arms will bloom.

677
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:28,940
Even if I have to give up my life for the flowers, I will still sing them.

678
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:45,940
Who will lose the heart of a flower? Love and hate can only be eaten.

679
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:56,940
The flower withers, the heart is broken, there is no need to tell.

680
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:06,940
How can I still be crazy?

681
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:14,940
I'm not afraid of being misunderstood.

682
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:22,940
I'm not afraid of being misunderstood.
