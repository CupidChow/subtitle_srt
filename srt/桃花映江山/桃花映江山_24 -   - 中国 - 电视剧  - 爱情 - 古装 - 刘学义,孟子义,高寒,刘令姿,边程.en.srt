15
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,510
(Adapted from the novel "Peach Blossoms
Reflecting the River and Mountains")

16
00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:40,980
(by Bai Lu Cheng Shuang)

17
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,900
=Episode 24=

18
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,520
Mu Wuxia, what happened?

19
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,080
Li Jiaohan,
why would you take your own life?

20
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,400
Li Jiaohan!

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,320
Li Jiaohan...

22
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,680
(My name is Li Jiaohan.)

23
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,760
(How should I address you?)

24
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,040
(My surname is Mu.)

25
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,720
(Mr. Nobody
is lighting a spark of hope for us.)

26
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,080
(If the political direction is sound,)

27
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,190
(then the Peach Blossom Spring
Jiang Kun dreamed of,)

28
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,320
(where people live in peace)

29
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,520
(with no class divide,
may yet come to pass.)

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,790
(Even if his vision is difficult
to achieve,)

31
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,920
(if we shy away)

32
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,800
(from writing the truth out of fear,)

33
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,960
(how is that)

34
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:47,960
(any different)

35
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,640
(from the present?)

36
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,000
I should be like Jiang Kun,

37
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,080
giving everything I have

38
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,240
to secure a way forward for students
from humble backgrounds

39
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,040
through the imperial exams.

40
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,960
The foundation of a nation
lies in its talent.

41
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,920
Gifted youths from poor families
are barred by their lineage

42
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,080
from serving their country.

43
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,080
This is our state's greatest regret.

44
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,320
Only by expanding
the imperial exam system

45
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,520
can the court strengthen
its ability to govern.

46
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,160
(With the Rising Sun
and the Evening Glow)

47
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,160
A love for learning will flourish
among the people.

48
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,560
Poor scholars across the land
will devote themselves

49
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,240
to serving Qi.

50
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,960
This is a matter of great importance.

51
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,200
We'll discuss it another day.

52
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,360
Court is adjourned.

53
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,200
(I beg to risk death to speak again.)

54
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,960
(The abolition of the exams)

55
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,480
(not only blocks the path for talent,)

56
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,380
(but also wounds
the lifeblood of the nation.)

57
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,680
(If noble clans grow unchecked,)

58
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,600
(the imperial power will be eroded.)

59
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,200
(If commoners grow discontented,
rebellion brews.)

60
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,680
(If we don't break
the aristocratic stranglehold)

61
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,320
(through the imperial exam system,)

62
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,960
(the court will lose its wings,)

63
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,680
(and the state will falter.)

64
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,920
(Father, I beg you)

65
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,040
(to permit
the reinstatement of the exams,)

66
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,840
(to recruit the worthy)

67
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,920
(and strengthen the state.)

68
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,760
The cold is biting.

69
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,720
Prince Wuxia, you should return.

70
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,320
Prince Wuxia has been kneeling for long.

71
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,880
Will His Majesty be moved

72
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,920
and agree to the exams?

73
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,000
He talks a good game,

74
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,120
but I bet he is just a power-hungry wolf

75
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,640
trying to seize influence.

76
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,800
Father would never agree to it.

77
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,080
Your Highness is wise.

78
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,680
He is still kneeling outside?

79
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,120
Yes.

80
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,440
Your Majesty.

81
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,400
It is freezing out there.

82
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,640
You should have him
return to his residence,

83
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,000
lest he fall ill.

84
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,880
I didn't make him kneel.

85
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,440
If he wants to kneel, let him.

86
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,080
If he freezes to death, then bury him.

87
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,960
Left Chancellor.

88
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,440
Your Highness is kindhearted

89
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,600
for taking pity on Prince Wuxia.

90
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,360
But I actually think

91
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,840
His Majesty has a point.

92
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,200
If he wants to kneel, let him.

93
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,480
We need not pay him any mind.

94
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:07,880
Why not?

95
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,360
Your Highness.

96
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,190
His Highness is doing this for
the reinstatement of the imperial exams.

97
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,080
If he stands,

98
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,920
it implies His Majesty has agreed.

99
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,840
With Li Jiaohan's death,

100
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,760
public anger is boiling over.

101
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,780
Countless humble scholars
are praying and pleading

102
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,720
for the reinstatement
of the imperial exams.

103
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,800
If His Highness is allowed to rise,

104
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,800
it will be seen as approval.

105
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,600
But reinstating the exams

106
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,920
is a grave matter.

107
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,660
The noble families
will surely oppose it.

108
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,400
Why not silence

109
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,600
those protesting scholars

110
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,240
to calm the nobles?

111
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,600
Your Majesty,

112
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,160
shall we proceed with discretion?

113
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,080
After all, the Beiyuan delegation
is still in the capital.

114
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,640
We mustn't let Qi become
a laughingstock to other states.

115
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,760
Someone is stirring unrest.

116
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,200
The protests are embarrassing, yes.

117
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,200
But if the exams are restored...

118
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,200
If they are restored,

119
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,720
the noble clans
will unite in opposition.

120
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,720
If they petition as one,

121
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,400
it will be difficult for Your Majesty

122
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,880
to manage.

123
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,120
Do I fear a few noble clans

124
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,200
in my own empire?

125
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,120
What can their petitions really do?

126
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,760
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

127
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,480
You have conquered far and wide,

128
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,240
never losing a single campaign.

129
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,720
It was I who misspoke.

130
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,240
Of course.

131
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,120
Even if I choose to reinstate the exams,

132
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,680
who are they to oppose?

133
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,120
A few pampered aristocrats.

134
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,600
What do they count for?

135
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,320
Indeed.

136
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,880
Still, the noble clans have deep roots.

137
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,200
What, then,

138
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,840
would you suggest?

139
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,280
Perhaps

140
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,560
appoint both a prominent noble
and Prince Wuxia

141
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,640
as chief examiners?

142
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,160
Then, strictly limit
the number of passes.

143
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,760
This preserves the dignity of the nobles

144
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,120
avoiding disappointment
among the masses.

145
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,040
What does Your Majesty think?

146
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,200
Excellent.

147
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,200
You are thoughtful.

148
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,400
Issue my decree.

149
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,600
The imperial exam will be held
after the Chinese New Year.

150
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,040
Prince Mu Wuxia

151
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,690
and Minister-in-Chief Qin Mian
shall serve as the chief examiners.

152
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:23,960
And you

153
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,200
shall be the invigilator.

154
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,360
As Your Majesty commands.

155
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,920
The show is over.

156
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,640
Let's go get a drink.

157
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,960
Your Highness, someone's coming out.

158
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,280
By the mandate of Heaven,
the Emperor decrees.

159
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,800
The prosperity of the state
depends on its talent.

160
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,480
The imperial exams shall be held
following the Chinese New Year.

161
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,920
(Imperial Decree)
Prince Mu Wuxia and Minister-in-Chief Qin Mian

162
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,080
are hereby appointed as chief examiners.

163
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,120
Left Chancellor Shen Zaiye is to supervise
all matters of the exam hall.

164
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,440
Thus decreed.

165
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,160
Your Highness!

166
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,600
(Jiaohan,)

167
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,560
(did you hear that?)

168
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,920
(Did your spirit see it)

169
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,040
(from beyond?)

170
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,200
(Shen Residence)

171
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:38,760
Chancellor.

172
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,640
Everything is unfolding as we planned.

173
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,840
Not a single step out of place.

174
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,960
His Majesty has reinstated
the imperial examination.

175
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,860
Prince Wuxia will serve
as the chief examiner.

176
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,840
You are to spread the decree throughout
the east, west, south, and north.

177
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,640
Make sure it reaches
even the most remote villages.

178
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,040
Is that clear?

179
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,290
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

180
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:09,760
Onward!

181
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,480
(Now that the exams
are being reinstated,)

182
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,800
(the people must know)

183
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,990
(that it was Prince Wuxia
who knelt before the court.)

184
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,560
(That he, in plain clothes,
braved wind and snow to win this.)

185
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,920
(I will turn the hearts of the people)

186
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,040
(into his armor.)

187
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,560
(Let the noble families and ministers
see what it means)

188
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,320
(when the will of the people
surges like a tide.)

189
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,280
Jiaohan,

190
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,320
(Li Jiaohan)
the imperial exams will return next year.

191
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,680
If you were still here,

192
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,200
you would surely be the top scorer.

193
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,240
It was Mu Wuxia's determination

194
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:42,920
and your death

195
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,040
that brought about this day.

196
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,600
If only you were still alive...

197
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,440
I should have knelt long ago.

198
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,960
I should have done so much sooner...

199
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,460
(Li Jiaohan)

200
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,760
(Wuxia.)

201
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,840
(Be it my father,)

202
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,040
(your mother,)

203
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,800
(or Li Jiaohan.)

204
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,360
(Their sacrifices will not be in vain.)

205
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,800
(This time,)

206
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,480
(we must root out the rot)

207
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,240
(and usher in a new era.)

208
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,240
Mu Wuyin.

209
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,040
If I had not come to push you myself,

210
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,400
you'd never have laid a ruthless hand
on your own brother.

211
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,160
Mu Wuxia's reputation is on the rise.

212
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,040
He might become
a major obstacle in our path.

213
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,920
Hua, I can explain.

214
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,080
Wuxia, he almost...

215
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,400
I don't care for explanations.

216
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,240
Besides,
Mu Wuxia is not your only brother.

217
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,560
I'm sorry.

218
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,440
I've been indecisive.

219
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,120
I only want you to promise

220
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,840
this "three birds with one stone" plan

221
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,200
I arranged must not fail.

222
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,200
All right. I promise you.

223
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,120
I promise.

224
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,000
Hua!

225
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,600
Hua.

226
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,320
I'll be waiting
for your good news in Beiyuan.

227
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,040
Wuyin,

228
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,840
don't disappoint me again.

229
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,560
(Meng Residence)

230
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,960
So they really made

231
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,280
the imperial examination happen.

232
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,440
Father, please calm your anger.

233
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,960
The moment Li Jiaohan

234
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,800
was strung up
on the archway of the exam hall,

235
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,000
this outcome was sealed.

236
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,560
Who was it that hung him there?

237
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,320
Was it Prince Wuxia?

238
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,520
No.

239
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,480
He is too softhearted.

240
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,840
He could never be that ruthless.

241
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,960
Then who?

242
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,040
Shen Zaiye.

243
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,880
This kind of thing is in line
with his usual methods.

244
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,720
What I don't understand

245
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:32,880
is why...

246
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,640
Whether it was him or not
matters little.

247
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,480
Now that the exam door
has been pried open,

248
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,520
it will be like a flood
from a broken levee.

249
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,840
Impossible to stop.

250
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,880
The decree has been issued.

251
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,480
The imperial examination will happen.

252
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:50,920
Then...

253
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,080
Master.

254
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,320
Prince Wuyin has invited Ms. Zhenzhen
to his residence.

255
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,980
(Shunjing Residence)

256
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,600
Please.

257
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,560
This game is deadlocked.

258
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,080
It appears even Your Highness
is troubled by the imperial exam matter.

259
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,040
Why don't we join forces?

260
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,280
The imperial exams are now inevitable.

261
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,160
If we want to turn the tide,

262
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,080
we must eliminate all obstacles.

263
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,720
Your Highness and the Meng family
share a common goal.

264
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,160
Shen Zaiye.

265
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,640
Mu Wuxia.

266
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,920
With you by my side,

267
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,440
we are sure to win this round.

268
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:13,840
Your Highness.

269
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,280
Letting useful pieces
sit idle is not wise.

270
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,280
I will make sure

271
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,360
every piece is used to its full value.

272
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,740
(Meng Residence)

273
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,760
Ms. Zhenzhen.

274
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,320
Why are you here?

275
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,680
The imperial exam is approaching.

276
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,760
I came to visit my uncle

277
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,080
and seek his academic guidance.

278
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,280
Academic guidance?

279
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:53,880
Meng Huairui.

280
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,120
You and I both know

281
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,320
how you got those "discourses."

282
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,440
Last time, you had that poor scholar.

283
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,540
Who will you beg for help
with the exams this time?

284
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,000
I advise you give to up now.

285
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,040
Better than embarrassing yourself
at the exams.

286
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,320
Shaming the Meng family
is a small matter,

287
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,660
but deceit and implicating the clan
will turn it into a grave one.

288
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,960
You don't need to worry about me.

289
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,600
If I pass the exam one day,

290
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,940
the Meng family
will welcome me in soon enough.

291
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,240
I must be on my way.

292
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,200
Foolish troublemaker.

293
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,840
Have someone keep an eye on him.

294
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:33,840
Understood.

295
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,620
(Shen Residence)

296
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,080
Miss.

297
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,920
Why are you at the Zhengchun Boudoir?

298
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,120
Something seems to be going on there.

299
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,480
Is someone hiding in there?

300
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,360
There's no one.

301
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,600
I can find out easily enough.

302
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,480
The Chancellor said

303
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,540
you're not allowed
to enter the Zhengchun Boudoir.

304
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,400
Why not?

305
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,440
In any case, if you want to enter,

306
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,000
you need the Chancellor's permission.

307
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,560
My brother?

308
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,080
Are you trying to get me in trouble?

309
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,640
My brother seems fine on the surface,

310
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,360
but the moment I mention Jiang Taohua,

311
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,520
he blows up on me.

312
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,520
He has been exhausted

313
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,840
from dealing with the matters

314
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,960
of the imperial examination.

315
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,660
Understandably,
his temper has been short.

316
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:22,800
True.

317
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,320
Mu Wuxia did mention it to me.

318
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:28,880
Fine.

319
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,280
I'll try not to add to his troubles.

320
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,440
Don't follow me.

321
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,840
(Glad she's easy to dismiss.)

322
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,720
(He thought he could fool me.)

323
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,400
(I'll see what you guys are up to.)

324
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,120
(Qingtai?)

325
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,680
(Wasn't she missing with Jiang Taohua?)

326
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,520
(What's she doing here?)

327
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,440
(Where's she off to?)

328
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,800
(This won't do.)

329
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,480
(I should tail her.)

330
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,000
(This path leads)

331
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,680
(toward Prince Wuyin's residence.)

332
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:49,700
(Shunjing Residence)

333
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,120
Who's there?

334
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,560
Miss Qingying?

335
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,320
Qingtai?

336
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,480
What are you doing here?

337
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,200
I followed you.

338
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,440
If you're alive,

339
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,960
does that mean Jiang Taohua is too?

340
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,360
This way.

341
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,800
Your Highness.

342
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,440
Jiang Taohua! You're alive.

343
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,440
Why are you two here?

344
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,080
Why are you in Prince Wuyin's residence?

345
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,800
Why didn't you tell us you were alive?

346
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,760
My brother forbade me
from mentioning you.

347
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,320
Zhan Lu even said he was irritable

348
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,080
from overwork.

349
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,720
But I know it's because of you.

350
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,360
He knows I'm here.

351
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,960
What?

352
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,920
I was disoriented

353
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,040
after my injury.

354
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,240
I can't recall much of what happened

355
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,400
after arriving in Qi.

356
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,480
Your Highness.

357
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,200
You still can't remember?

358
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,160
Your Highness, please come with us.

359
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,280
It's not safe here.

360
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,280
Qingtai, listen to me.

361
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,000
This place is dangerous.

362
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,200
Prince Wuyin won't spare you

363
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,680
if he finds out you're alive.

364
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,760
You barely escaped with your life.

365
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,320
Just go.

366
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,800
Qingtai's life?

367
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,080
Qingtai, are you hurt?

368
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,120
My injury has more or less healed.

369
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,880
That treacherous chancellor had
a moment of conscience and took me in.

370
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,380
I only came because I was worried
about Her Highness's safety.

371
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,400
That's good.

372
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,520
But let's not talk about all that now.

373
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,120
Can you do something about my brother?

374
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,040
My brother has been

375
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,760
losing his mind thinking about you!

376
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,920
(Zhengchun Boudoir)

377
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,800
Ever since you fell off that cliff
and went missing,

378
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,800
he has not been the same.

379
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,040
At first,

380
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,240
he would just sit alone

381
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,560
in the Zhengchun Boudoir
drinking all night.

382
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,120
Or stare off into space in his room,
staring up at the ceiling.

383
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,080
Sometimes, he would go an entire day
without speaking to anyone.

384
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,000
And now it's even worse.

385
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,960
He buries himself in work
without food or rest.

386
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,360
He won't eat.

387
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,680
He won't sleep.

388
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,440
Chancellor, you have not eaten all day.

389
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,840
Please, have a little something.

390
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,080
Everyone says

391
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,760
he is overworking himself
because of the imperial exams,

392
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,640
but I know

393
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,240
it's just to keep himself
from thinking about you.

394
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,320
(Shen Zaiye,)

395
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,320
(why do you do this to yourself?)

396
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,080
Miss Meng.

397
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,400
These dried fruits
were sent by Prince Wuyin.

398
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,480
Convey my thanks to His Highness.

399
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,240
Yes. I will leave them here.

400
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:20,680
Zaiye,

401
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,800
Zhan Lu said

402
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,800
you haven't eaten properly in ages.

403
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,720
You shouldn't be here.

404
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,680
Go back.

405
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,400
You've grown thin from hunger.

406
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,400
I don't care.

407
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,080
I prepared all this food.

408
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,400
You have to finish everything.

409
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,280
Do it for me.

410
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,240

Miss Meng.

433
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,240
His Highness is here.

434
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,040
Greetings, Your Highness.

435
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,320
Qingfeng said
the weather's been cold lately,

436
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,040
and you hardly leave your room.

437
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,560
With your body so delicate,

438
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,840
I wonder

439
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,640
if you'll be able
to serve me much longer?

440
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,320
Of course, I can.

441
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,040
Please give your orders.

442
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,360
I want you to visit Chancellor Shen.

443
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,960
Visit Chancellor Shen?

444
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,440
He's been busy with work lately.

445
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,000
It seems he's not quite
as infatuated with you anymore.

446
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:15,640
Your Highness.

447
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,360
To tell the truth,

448
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,760
ever since you told me the truth,

449
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,440
I swore

450
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,400
I would never give him another chance.

451
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,760
If that is how he feels now,

452
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,200
isn't that for the better?

453
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,080
I know you hold resentment

454
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,880
and want to cut all ties.

455
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,600
But times have changed.

456
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:40,240
Chancellor Shen is working himself
to the bone over the examination.

457
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,400
As a prince,

458
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,560
I must care for my ministers.

459
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,880
After much thought,

460
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,200
I ask you to visit him often,

461
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:52,920
so that he may find
some balance and rest.

462
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,520
You understand, don't you?

463
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,000
The Jinxiu Pavilion's winter special,
Jade Dew Soup,

464
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
is always a delicacy.

465
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,040
Treat Chancellor Shen to a meal
on my behalf.

466
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,320
Your Highness,

467
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,640
is there something
you want me to find out?

468
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,200
Just make sure
Chancellor Shen sees more of you.

469
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,440
I understand.

470
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,880
(Though a minor piece,)

471
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,080
(it now sits directly
on Shen Zaiye's critical weak point.)

472
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,360
(He wants me)

473
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,080
(to restrain Shen Zaiye.)

474
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:29,800
(I can't let him reap the benefits
without lifting a finger.)

475
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,560
(I need to think of a plan.)

476
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:38,840
This way, Miss.

477
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:44,840
Miss Meng.

478
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,440
His Highness specifically asked

479
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,940
that you be gentle and considerate
with Chancellor Shen.

480
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,760
After all,

481
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,200
you'll need to be by his side often.

482
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:53,920
Understood.

483
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,640
To avoid suspicion,

484
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,700
I will wait in the carriage
at the alley entrance.

485
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,080
If you need anything,

486
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,440
just have the attendant call me.

487
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,360
(He even assigned Qingfeng to watch me.)

488
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,920
(This matter means
a great deal to Prince Wuyin.)

489
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,120
(Which means)

490
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,600
(I must not let it go unchecked.)

491
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,560
(Who knows what he and Empress Lv
are really after?)

492
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,280
(If they want me)

493
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,040
(to restrain Shen Zaiye,)

494
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,680
(then I must do the opposite.)

495
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,520
What's on your mind?

496
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:48,720
Chancellor Shen.

497
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,040
Qingtai has been staying

498
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,240
at your residence.

499
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,840
We've troubled you.

500
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,000
That's no trouble for me.

501
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,200
She's recovering well.

502
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,680
With Zhan Lu watching
over her day and night,

503
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,240
you can rest easy.

504
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,240
Qingtai has been by my side for years.

505
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,080
She's always been the one
worrying about me.

506
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,720
Now, I finally understand how she felt.

507
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,520
I worry for her.

508
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,000
If you care so much,

509
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,320
why not return with me to my residence?

510
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,120
Chancellor Shen.

511
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,520
Please keep

512
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,120
Qingtai's identity secret.

513
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,480
In others' eyes,

514
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,480
she is already dead.

515
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,800
Is Qingtai all

516
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,160
we can talk about now?

517
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,320
Changjue matters.

518
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,280
Qingtai matters.

519
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,600
Is the person you forgot the only one

520
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:04,960
that doesn't?

521
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,760
Have you ever considered

522
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,320
that even if Qingtai wakes up

523
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,080
and confirms everything you said,

524
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,120
to me,

525
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,040
it may still be someone else's story.

526
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,920
I may not be able
to relate to any of it.

527
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,800
There is only one thing in this world
that cannot be forced,

528
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,200
and that is love.

529
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,720
It is getting late.

530
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,000
I should return.

531
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,360
Prince Wuyin will be worried.

532
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,160
Miss Meng!

533
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,240
Miss Meng!

534
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,400
Please wait.

535
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,720
When will we meet again?

536
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,600
I worked so hard
to gain Prince Wuyin's trust.

537
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,040
Unless it is something important...

538
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,240
And what counts as important?

539
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,320
Qingtai.

540
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,480
Anything else?

541
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:29,960
No.

542
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:38,800
Chancellor Shen,

543
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,720
this is where we part.

(We were doomed from the start.)

547
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,240
(Better to take this chance)

548
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,680
(to set things right)

549
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,520

00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,760
(why must you be so resolute?)

553
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,600
(Am I to spend the rest of my life)

554
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,640
(watching you drift further away)

555
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,520
(and never looking back?)

556
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,360
♪The flower weeps, burdened by thoughts♪

557
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,400
(In the end,)

558
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,560
(we still strayed far from each other.)

559
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,800
(Drink this farewell wine.)

560
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,080
(After tonight,)

561
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,240
(we will never meet again.)

562
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,560
(There are countless women
in the world.)

563
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,510
(Why do you insist
on making my life miserable?)

564
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,400
(We are nothing more than strangers.)

565
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,840
(Why would I hate you?)

566
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,520
(Jiang Taohua.)

567
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,760
(If I said I regret it all,)

568
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,040
(that I regret not trusting you,)

569
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,200
(protecting you,)

570
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,760
(loving you,)

571
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,600
(would you turn back,)

572
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,640
(and spare me another glance?)

573
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:26,760
Chancellor.

574
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:27,840
It's getting late.

575
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,480
You should rest.

576
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,000
You have been overworked lately

577
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,560
because of the imperial examination.

578
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,680
If you keep this up,
your health will suffer.

579
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,360
Why must you do this to yourself?

580
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,200
There are many good women in the world.
You...

581
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,440
(There is only one thing in this world)

582
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,040
(that cannot be forced,)

583
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,240
(and that is love.)

584
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:15,880
♪Save for the slow crown

585
00:33:16,402 --> 00:33:21,120

(Jiang Taohua,)

599
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,880
(since you've chosen to walk alone,)

600
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,200
(I will no longer try to stop you.)

601
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,200
(But the path you've chosen
is laden with peril.)

602
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,560
(Even so,)

603
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,320
(I will stand behind you, always.)

00:34:24,728 --> 00:34:28,570
♪Among a noisy crowd of strangers♪

605
00:34:40,472 --> 00:34:43,020
(Serene and Graceful)

606
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,760
Your Highness is wise and far-sighted.

607
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,520
His Majesty has appointed
Minister Qin as an examiner.

608
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,760
Prince Wuhen and the Qin family
have been seen together

609
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,520
far more frequently.

610
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,360
They no longer even bother to hide it.

611
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,680
My second brother

612
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,800
is greedy and ambitious,

613
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,900
with little talent
and even less integrity.

614
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,640
With such a juicy opportunity
presented to him,

615
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,760
he simply can't resist taking a bite.

616
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,480
Your Highness.

617
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,440
What should our next move be?

618
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,820
You shouldn't be asking me
what to do next,

619
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,880
but rather

620
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,720
what my second brother will do next.

621
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,240
He will look for a way
to sell the exam questions.

622
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:25,800
I understand.

623
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,480
I will have someone
keep an eye on his buyers.

624
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,880
Once the time comes,

625
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,480
the buyer will step forward
as a witness.

626
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:36,760
That gives us

627
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,680
a witness,

628
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,320
but physical evidence
will be hard to retain.

629
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,240
My father will not convict Wuhen easily.

630
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,840
I heard the Meng family

631
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,840
once commissioned an artisan

632
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,520
to carve an entire map
of Yujing's streets

633
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,040
onto the shell of a single fruit seed.

634
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,640
Perhaps you could recommend

635
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,400
that craftsman

636
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,720
to my second brother?

637
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,880
Your Highness is most intelligent.

638
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,990
I will send someone
to find the artisan right away.

639
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,840
Prince Wuhen will not be disappointed.

640
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,400
The birds' chirping annoys me.

641
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,360
A perfect
"kill two birds with one stone."

642
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,520
Qingfeng.

643
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,600
As I recall,

644
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,280
there were two birds in the exam hall.

645
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,520
I have another task for you.
