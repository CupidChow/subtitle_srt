(Adapted from the novel "Peach Blossoms
Reflecting the River and Mountains")

16
00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:40,980
(by Bai Lu Cheng Shuang)

17
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,900
=Episode 30=

18
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,720
It's falling.

19
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,640
This is not good.

20
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,120
Empress Lv planned
everything far too well.

21
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,120
There's more than one signal lantern.

22
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,360
They're too far

23
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,320
to shoot down.

24
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,480
We need to warn the people quickly.

25
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,360
I'll meet up with Zhan Lu
and try to reduce casualties.

26
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,480
Shen Zaiye.

27
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,640
If we make it through this alive,

28
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:23,720
I...

29
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,800
Be careful.

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,680
You too.

31
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,920
Someone, store all the saltpeter.

32
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,040
There's danger!

33
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,200
Everyone, get out of the city!

34
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,280
There's going to be a fire!

35
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,840
Danger!

36
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,960
A fire's about to break out!

37
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:12,960
Get out of the city!

38
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,400
Danger! Run!

39
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,240
A fire's about to break out!

40
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,400
Get out of the city!

41
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,680
There's going to be a fire!

42
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,440
Leave the city now!

43
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,960
When I was little,
I loved hearing you talk

44
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,600
about Beiyuan's Sky Lantern Festival.

45
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,920
Then you came to Beiyuan,

46
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,920
and I started dreaming

47
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,080
of lighting lanterns with you.

48
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,880
If only you spent that much effort
on state affairs,

49
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,240
Qi would've been yours by now.

50
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,600
But I only want to belong to you.

51
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,560
Then you'd better behave.

52
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,240
Everything's in motion.

53
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,120
I've stationed shadow guards

54
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,640
throughout the city with gunpowder.

55
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,720
Once the lanterns fall,

56
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,680
they'll light the fires.

57
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,240
Tonight, I'm going to wipe them all out.

58
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,600
After that,

59
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,320
no one

60
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,840
can keep us apart.

61
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,160
The signals are sent.

62
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,280
Come.

63
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,200
We need to leave the city.

64
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:09,020
(Luocheng)

65
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,680
Fire!

66
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,640
Fire!

67
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,040
Hurry! Save the people.

68
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,000
Save my child!

69
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,608
Save my child!

70
00:05:29,757 --> 00:05:31,362
Help me save them!

71
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,800
Here. He's safe now.

72
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,000
Thank you, sir!

73
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,040
Thank you so much, sir.

74
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,080
Thank you, sir.

75
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,760
Move! Get everyone out!

76
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,720
Fire!

77
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,480
Sir!

78
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,080
Save them!

79
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:42,960
Help!

80
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,880
Fire!

81
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,680
Help!

82
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,880
Put out the fire!

83
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,440
Don't panic.
Leave from the back entrance.

84
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,400
Go! Hurry!

85
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,440
Your Highness.

86
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,780
- Your Highness.
- Hurry.

87
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,120
Be careful.

88
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,680
- Make haste.
- Hurry!

89
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,680
Move out of the way.

90
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,280
(Commandant's Residence)

91
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,120
There are so many explosions already.

92
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,320
Commandant Deng,
don't tell me you're still unsure?

93
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,320
Sir, fires are breaking out
all over the city.

94
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,920
Someone just came with Empress Lv's seal
and took control of the gate!

95
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,200
What?

96
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,600
Impossible.

97
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,640
Once Empress Lv locks down the city,

98
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,600
not just the citizens,

99
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,920
even you and I

100
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,920
won't make it out of the city alive.

101
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:35,920
Commandant Deng,

102
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,600
attempting to please both sides
will earn you nothing,

103
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,040
or satisfy Empress Lv.

104
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,760
It won't save the people you care about.

105
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,680
All troops, listen up!

106
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,630
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

107
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,200
One unit, put out the fires.

108
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,960
The rest, come with me
and Prince Changjue

109
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,560
to evacuate the citizens!

110
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,640
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

111
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,800
Run for your lives!

112
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,541
Run!

113
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,160
Run!

114
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,600
Come on, run!

115
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,960
Head for the gates!

116
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,704
Run for your lives!

117
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,200
(The smoke is thick now.)

118
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,440
(I hope the drum draws them
to the gate.)

119
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:13,592
Hurry!

120
00:07:13,773 --> 00:07:14,333
Quickly!

121
00:07:15,042 --> 00:07:15,938
Move it!

122
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,160
Water!

123
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,200
Water.

124
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,520
Water is here.

125
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,720
Lend a hand quickly.

126
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,080
- Put it out together!
- Coming!

127
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,440
Bring the water here quickly!

128
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,440
Help me clear this path!

129
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,000
Coming!

130
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,960
Hurry! More water!

131
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,120
Follow the drumbeats!

132
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,320
Head for the gates!

133
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,600
Head for the outer city! Hurry!

134
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:39,960
Watch your steps!

135
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,960
Don't lose your footing!

136
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,600
Help the weak!

137
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:13,840
Who's there?

138
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,720
Chancellor, are you all right?

139
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,640
Secure the saltpeter.

140
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:35,640
Hurry.

141
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:51,960
Your Highness,

142
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,080
most people have moved
to the outer city.

143
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,120
Let's go.

144
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,800
It's Empress Lv.

145
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,560
Let's go.

146
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:26,920
Hua,

147
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,960
Jiang Taohua saw us.

148
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,560
You should leave the city first.

149
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,200
Let me handle the rest.

150
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,720
Let my mother go!

151
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,320
Let her go!

152
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,480
Force it down her throat!

153
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,800
I've been nothing but kind to you.

154
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,560
Why are you doing this...

155
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,720
But you're sitting on the throne
that you shouldn't have.

156
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,240
If I don't get rid of you,

157
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,520
how can I rule this harem?

158
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,120
Hua,

159
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,120
go first.

160
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,440
I'll cover you.

161
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,320
I'll wait outside the city.

162
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,440
Stop her.

163
00:10:59,200 --> 00:10:59,960
Leave no one alive.

164
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,040
Kill her.

165
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,680
Your Highness!

166
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,480
Jiang Taohua.

167
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,680
The one commanding at the gates

168
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,320
is Cui Wei.

169
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,180
He's one of Empress Lv's
most loyal servants.

170
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,640
Chancellor Shen was right again.

171
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,940
(Outside Luocheng City)
Empress Lv's shadow guards

172
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,040
(Outside Luocheng City)
must be waiting for her.

173
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:50,920
Yes.

174
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,080
Your Highness.

175
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,320
Attack!

176
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,000
Protect Her Highness!

177
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,080
Your Highness, this way.

178
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,400
Stop them!

179
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,520
Chancellor, the water's here!

180
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:39,960
Chancellor!

181
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,360
Chancellor!

182
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,920
- Where's Taohua?
- We ran into Empress Lv.

183
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,440
Mu Wuyin captured Her Highness.

184
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,520
Chancellor, save Her Highness.

185
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,280
Leave this to us!

186
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,720
Take me to her!

187
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,240
All right.

188
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,640
Your Highness,
that must have startled you.

189
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,080
Please forgive us.

190
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,840
It's fine.

191
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,680
I knew Shen Zaiye's shadow guards
wouldn't go down easily.

192
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,600
That's why I doubled the security
just in case.

193
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,280
Your Highness.

194
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,400
Now that you're safely out of the city,

195
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,440
shall we lock down the city?

196
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,560
Give him some time.

197
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,600
You're about to die.

198
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,840
You might as well reflect on your life

199
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,240
before it's too late.

200
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,040
You should take your advice,

201
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,360
or death might come so fast

202
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,680
that you won't even have time
to regret it.

203
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,680
With you in my hands,

204
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,600
what can Shen Zaiye possibly do?

205
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,120
You really are pitiful.

206
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,320
Even now, you still don't see it.

207
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,920
The one who came
to kill you was someone else.

208
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,520
That person

209
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,880
just left you here.

210
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:16,920
They say

211
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,520
a man's final words
are always honest and kind.

212
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,480
It sounds like

213
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,280
your condition's flaring up again.

214
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,280
That's why you're talking nonsense.

215
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,200
People do not always appear
as they truly are.

216
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,680
Do you really know

217
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,880
what kind of person Hua is?

218
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,360
You were the one
who told Shen Zaiye about her.

219
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,000
Tell me.

220
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,560
What else do you know?

221
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,560
I not only know her name,

222
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,600
but I also know her past.

223
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,720
I spent years living in Beiyuan.

224
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,720
What I saw and felt was far more real

225
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,160
than your nostalgic imagination.

226
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,760
If anyone truly understands Hua,

227
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,400
it's me.

228
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,840
If there's no sincerity,

229
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,200
even living side by side

230
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,560
means nothing.

231
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,200
It's all just pretense.

232
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,920
Jiang Taohua,

233
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,240
you have no right

234
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,280
to judge my history with Hua.

235
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,880
She took advantage and stepped in

236
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,480
after your sister passed away.

237
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,520
You truly believed it was real?

238
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,240
Jiang Taohua, I'm warning you.

239
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,520
Don't you dare slander her.

240
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,480
She's the kindest person in this world.

241
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,720
She deserves the best
this world can offer.

242
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,400
You carry yourself like a sage

243
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,360
who has no interest in worldly matters.

244
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,960
I assume it was Empress Lv

245
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,310
who told you to get involved
in this power struggle, right?

246
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,840
Even if Hua once had true feelings
for you back then,

247
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,360
she's not the same anymore.

248
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,520
She has turned cold, ruthless,

249
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,200
and consumed by her obsession
with power.

250
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:05,800
And anyone

251
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,080
can be a stepping stone for her to rise.

252
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,960
That includes you.

253
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,400
Power struggles are always

254
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,560
a matter of life and death.

255
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,560
We've schemed for years.

256
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,600
Wasn't it all for the moment
we'd finally be free

257
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,200
to chase what you really wanted?

258
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,480
Enough!

259
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,640
She is still the same person.

260
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,000
She has never changed.

261
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,280
Can't you hear the screams

262
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,000
of the people?

263
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,160
What did they ever do

264
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,160
to deserve being dragged

265
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,040
into this hell because of her?

266
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,600
Son, where are you?

267
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,480
Everything is gone!

268
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,480
They're insignificant.

269
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,720
You call the people insignificant.

270
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,760
But aren't you just

271
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,280
another pawn in Empress Lv's plan?

272
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,680
Or is it that
you simply don't want to face it

273
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,280
or admit it?

274
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,400
You've already been delayed for a while.

275
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,080
Do you really think she will wait
for you outside the city?

276
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,600
She will.

277
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,320
She will wait for me.

278
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,880
She will wait for me.

279
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:36,840
She will.

280
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,120
Your Highness,

281
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,920
everything is in place.

282
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,640
Only Prince Wuyin hasn't arrived.

283
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,840
We must prioritize the bigger picture.

284
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,360
Seal the city gates.

285
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,640
Yes, Your Highness.

286
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:07,600
Move out!

287
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,200
(Mu Wuyin,)

288
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,120
(I gave you a chance.)

289
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,280
(It's you who wasted it.)

290
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,160
Have we found Empress Lv?

291
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,440
We lost her.

292
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,696
- Why are you closing the gate?
- Don't close the gate!

293
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:24,960
Let us in!

294
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,237
My family is still inside!

295
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,800
Open the city gates!

296
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,440
Open the gates!

297
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,280
Darn it.
Empress Lv is locking down the city.

298
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,360
The Chancellor and the rest are still
inside the city.

299
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,480
Let's breach the city gate.

300
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:44,800
Lock down the city!

301
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,360
Hurry!

302
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:52,400
Go back!

303
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,440
- Let us out!
- Let us out!

304
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,960
Why are you nailing the city gate shut?

305
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,480
Let us out now!

306
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,360
Step back!

307
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,128
Let us out!

308
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,920
Inform Her Highness

309
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,600
that I'm here.

310
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,920
Open the city gates now.

311
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,280
Yes, Your Highness.

312
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,040
Prince Wuyin is here!

313
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,640
Open the city gates!

314
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,880
Come to your senses, Mu Wuyin.

315
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,240
This is who Empress Lv really is.

316
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,720
(Do you really know
what kind of person Hua is?)

317
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,120
(She has become)

318
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,240
(cold and ruthless.)

319
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,760
Anyone

320
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,040
can be a stepping stone for her to rise.

321
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,880
That includes you.

322
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,360
I won't let my plans fall apart.

323
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,800
We must put the bigger picture first.

324
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,560
(Will she really wait
for you outside the city?)

325
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,440
Hua,

326
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,240
I'm still here.

327
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,760
Are you leaving me behind?

328
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:51,960
Let's go!

329
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,480
Your Highness.

330
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,200
Are you hurt?

331
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,440
No.

332
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,560
Empress Lv has locked down the city.

333
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,840
What should we do now?

334
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,000
It's all right now.

335
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,400
You shouldn't have been so stubborn.

336
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,560
Is dying here really worth it?

337
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,240
It is.

338
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,120
Your Highness.

339
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:50,840
Come.

340
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,120
Are you hurt?

341
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:54,880
I'm fine.

342
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:55,600
Come.

343
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,360
Help him.

344
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,280
Prince Wuxia?

345
00:22:59,480 --> 00:22:59,960
Qingying?

346
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,440
Zaiye.

347
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,880
So Empress Lv lured you here too.

348
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,160
Changjue,

349
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,280
this is Prince Wuxia of Qi,

350
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,760
my benefactor.

351
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,400
Thank you for looking out
for my sister.

352
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,360
You have

353
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,600
my deepest gratitude.

354
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:28,760
Prince Changjue,

355
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,800
Her Highness was fated to survive.

356
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,600
I only did what anyone should.

357
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,280
Fated to survive.

358
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,120
Yet, we're now

359
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,400
all trapped in Luocheng.

360
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,080
Fusheng.

361
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:52,840
Fusheng.

362
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,320
The city has been locked down.

363
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,080
We will all die here.

364
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:56,800
I am here.

365
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,280
Thank you, sir.

366
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,080
Thank you so much.

367
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,320
Has any of you

368
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,960
seen Commandant Deng at the city gates?

369
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:03,840
No.

370
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,680
He's just another
of Empress Lv's lackeys.

371
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,560
Why would he care about us?

372
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,101
- That's right! Nobody cares about us!
- No one cares.

373
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,040
No one cares about us at all!

374
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,480
We can't sit here and wait to die.

375
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:20,480
Changjue,

376
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,080
where's the city armory?

377
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,280
We need weapons

378
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,440
to break through the gates.

379
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,120
It's behind the Commandant's office.

380
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,000
But the key

381
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,400
is with Commandant Deng.

382
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,600
Your Highness,

383
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,440
those blasts we heard just now came

384
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,560
from that direction.

385
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,760
I'm afraid the armory
has already been destroyed.

386
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,080
Comrades! Fight your way out!

387
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,720
Breaking open the city gate

388
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,160
is our only way

389
00:24:59,000 --> 00:24:59,880
to survive.

390
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,720
Charge!

391
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,120
Let's unite and break out together

392
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,560
and fight to the end!

393
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,608
- Fight to the end!
- To the end!

394
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,280
Head for the gates!

395
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,640
Heaven helps those

396
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,600
who help themselves!

397
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,040
If we give up,

398
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,480
we're as good as dead!

399
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,520
Comrades!

400
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,240
Let's take down
that wicked empress together!

401
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,800
Kill!

402
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:40,760
Commandant Deng,

403
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,280
I'm here to help you!

404
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:45,720
Let's go.

405
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:00,360
- Kill!
- Kill!

406
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,680
There are too many archers!

407
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,640
Find cover! Block the arrows!

408
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:20,880
Qingying. Changjue.

409
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:21,880
Help me cover them!

410
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,640
Raise the shields!

411
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,920
Don't let them take the tower!

412
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:50,800
Qingtai,

413
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,840
save the civilians!

414
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,720
Yes, Your Highness.

415
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,800
Come now.

416
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,240
Taohua, watch out!

417
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,520
Taohua, come with me!

418
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,520
Take care of him.

419
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,400
Yes, Your Highness.

420
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:28,760
This is...

421
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,240
Their shield formation is impenetrable,

422
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,080
and the archers have them covered.

423
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,520
As long as the archers are in place,

424
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,640
we can't push forward.

425
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,120
Then we'll use
their own methods against them.

426
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,880
We'll blast a way out

427
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,840
using sulfur and saltpeter

428
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,520
in case we're attacked
from both front and rear.

429
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,900
I've already sent
Zhan Lu, Qingtai, and Qingying

430
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,480
to take out the archers on the flanks.

431
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,400
Move out.

432
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:18,640
Qingying,

433
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,280
get the fire arrows ready.

434
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:25,640
Three.

435
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,120
Two.

436
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:28,320
One.

437
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,600
Hold formation!

438
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,480
It's not working, Zaiye.

439
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,920
It's too far to blast them!

440
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:51,800
I'll do it!

441
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,240
We're still not close enough. What now?

442
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,520
Qingying, cover me!

443
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,280
Be careful!

444
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,680
Zaiye, it's dangerous!

445
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,720
Don't let him get close! Kill him!

446
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:33,960
(This distance)

447
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,480
(should be enough.)

448
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,200
Qingying, the fire arrows!

449
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,920
The tower is breached!
Get ready to break down the gates!

450
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,400
Cover me!

451
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,920
- Charge!
- Charge!

452
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:46,760
Let's go.

453
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,440
Come on!

454
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,120
(So)

455
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,960
(this is what true love)

456
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,080
(really looks like.)

457
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:26,920
Chancellor Shen.

458
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,560
Chancellor Shen,
the main gates are nailed shut.

459
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,560
There's no way out.

460
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:32,510
Empress Lv's death warriors
are waiting outside.

461
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,960
Zaiye, what now?

462
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,120
Blow up the city gates.

463
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,120
All right.

464
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,040
Fall back!

465
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,920
I'll cover the civilians
and help them out of the city!

466
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,680
I'll go and help Changjue.

467
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,920
Taohua! Taohua!

468
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,720
Qingtai, keep the Princess safe.

469
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,120
Yes, sir.

470
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:25,720
Be careful.

471
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,400
Qingying,

472
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,680
help evacuate the people!

473
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,040
Got it.

474
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,520
The rest of you, follow me!

475
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,320
Kill every last one of Empress Lv's men!

476
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,920
Your Highness, you're...

477
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,440
Don't stop.

478
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,560
I don't want anyone to worry about me.

479
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:48,760
Let's move it.

480
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,280
No, the antidote is in the city.

481
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,040
I'll go and get it.

482
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:51,440
No.

483
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,760
The fire's too fierce.

484
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,080
The place could collapse at any moment.

485
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,080
Why are you still here, Taohua?

486
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,200
Her Highness is...

487
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,120
I'm fine.

488
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,160
Changjue, let's go.

489
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:01,920
How about this?

490
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,440
Wait for me at the quarry.

491
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,840
After I help evacuate the people,

492
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,720
I'll meet you there.

493
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,280
Don't worry about me.

494
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,600
All right. Be careful.

495
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,520
You too.

496
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,120
Move it!

497
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:13,640
Let's go.

498
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,400
Are you all right, madam?

499
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,320
- Madam.
- Are you hurt?

500
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,200
Everyone, make a run for it!
The gates are open!

501
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,040
Run outside! Quickly!

502
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,320
Run!

503
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,800
Get them out! Hurry!

504
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,120
Everyone! Run!

505
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,800
Run for your lives now!

506
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,800
Everyone, leave the city!

507
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,680
The city gates are opened!
Get out of the city!

508
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,240
Hurry!

509
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,040
Keep moving!

510
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,240
Stay close!

511
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,560
Keep up!

512
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,400
Hold it!

513
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,120
Hang in there.

514
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,040
Just a little longer.

515
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:02,640
You'll be fine.

516
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,200
It doesn't hurt.

517
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,320
Your hand is surprisingly soft
for someone who uses it to write.

518
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,720
It's not rough like most men.

519
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,000
Have you held

520
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,520
other men's hands?

521
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,680
My brother's.

522
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,200
Father raised him to wield a sword
from a young age.

523
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,240
If he didn't train hard,
how would he protect us?

524
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:49,920
So,

525
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,120
what was Chancellor Shen like
as a child?

526
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,000
My father said

527
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,360
my brother was just like his name,

528
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,280
wild from the start.

529
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,360
You, a filthy orphan.

530
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,560
Hurry up and peel the shrimp!

531
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,120
If you don't finish peeling them today,

532
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,040
I'll beat you to death!

533
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:05,840
Be quick about it!

534
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:17,920
- Amazing!
- Awesome!

535
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,760
- Marvelous!
- Nice!

536
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,680
Thank you, everyone.

537
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,040
Hey, brat. You've got guts.

538
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,280
How dare you steal my money?

539
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,400
Where are your parents?

540
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,040
Look! A snake!

541
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,360
You little...

542
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,760
Hand over the money!

543
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,600
Be quick about it.

544
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,160
Stop it!

545
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,960
- Let's get out of here.
- Run for it!

546
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,720
Stop right there.

547
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,480
Do you want to learn some martial arts?

548
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,680
(Xiang Zhen'ao, Shen Zaiye's godfather)
Then call me Master.

549
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,920
My name is Xiang Zhen'ao.

550
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,720
I've spent my life wandering
the martial world,

551
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,120
living by a code of justice.

552
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,400
Master, please accept respect
from your disciple, Shen Zaiye.

553
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,000
Get up.

554
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,200
Good lad.

555
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,360
This is my only daughter.

556
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,560
Her name is Qingying.

557
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,120
Then she's my junior sister.

558
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:07,800
Good.

559
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,280
After that,

560
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,840
Father took us traveling
around the martial world.

561
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,480
My brother is incredible.

562
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,760
He quickly absorbed everything

563
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,560
Father taught him

564
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,480
and mastered it
as if it were second nature.

565
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:18,300
Not only that,

566
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,100
he loved lecturing me
about big ideas like

567
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:23,260
governing with virtue.

568
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,220
In any case, it was all gibberish to me.

569
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,540
"Govern with integrity,

570
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:28,780
win wars with strategy,

571
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,640
and win the world through peace."

572
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,580
Cousin, what does that mean?

573
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,860
It means a country stays stable

574
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,780
through justice and order.

575
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,460
If you want to win,

576
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,300
you need to fight with a strategy.

577
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,100
Mu Wuxia,

578
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,820
I'm talking to you.

579
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,740
Why are you in a daze?

580
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,780
I was just thinking

581
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,580
Chancellor Shen really had it rough
growing up.

582
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,940
That's why he's so protective of me.

583
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,440
He once said

584
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,660
he would do everything he could

585
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,180
to make me safe and happy

586
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,860
because he knows how hard life can be.

587
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,660
What's wrong with Taohua?

588
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,420
She fainted from exhaustion

589
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,860
while helping evacuate the people.

590
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,380
After such a battle,
a plague may soon follow.

591
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,380
She's weak.

592
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,940
Make sure you clean
and change her clothes regularly.

593
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,580
Yes, Chancellor.

594
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:35,140
Chancellor, Her Highness hasn't told
Prince Changjue about the poison.

595
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,680
She doesn't want him to blame himself.

596
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,240
All right.

597
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,280
I won't tell him.

598
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,400
Now, hurry up and tell me
where the antidote is.

599
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,460
Her Highness didn't want you
to take the risk.

600
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,220
Qingtai. If you keep stalling,

601
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,040
it'll be too late

602
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,240
if the antidote gets destroyed.

603
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,420
Stop hesitating. Just tell me.

604
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:56,060
We dropped it
while fighting Empress Lv's men.

605
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,860
It probably fell near Qiao Tavern.

606
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:03,840
Qiao Tavern?

607
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,980
Take good care of Taohua.

608
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,020
Take it.

609
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:16,660
Zhan Lu,

610
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,180
the Chancellor is heading
into the city to find the antidote.

611
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:29,500
Chancellor,

612
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:31,700
I'll come with you.

613
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,440
(Qiao Tavern)

614
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,580
