(Adapted from the novel "Peach Blossoms
Reflecting the River and Mountains")

16
00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:40,980
(by Bai Lu Cheng Shuang)

17
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,900
=Episode 33=

18
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,200
That's not the daughter
of the Meng family.

19
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,800
Who is she, then?

20
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,440
Please explain yourself, Prince Wuyin.

21
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,960
She is Empress Lv of Beiyuan.

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,514
Empress Lv?

23
00:01:58,562 --> 00:01:59,640
- Empress Lv?
- Empress Lv?

24
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,760
Absurd.

25
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,680
Utterly absurd!

26
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,200
Since Your Highness
has accepted the throne,

27
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,520
how could Empress Lv

28
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,440
become our Empress of Qi?

29
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,800
Your Highness,

30
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,160
you owe us an explanation.

31
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,400
- Yes!
- That's right!

32
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,680
Give us an explanation!

33
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,760
We demand answers!

34
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,840
Tell us what's going on!

35
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,560
Yeah, give us an explanation!

36
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,600
That's right!
Give us an explanation!

37
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,520
We want answers!

38
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,520
- You owe us a proper explanation!
- You owe us a proper explanation!

39
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,040
So what if she isn't?

40
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,960
And what if she is?

41
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,360
No matter who Hua was in the past,

42
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,240
from this day forward,

43
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,480
she is my one and only wife.

44
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,640
She is the Empress of Qi.

45
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,760
Empress Lv poisoned her rivals,

46
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,880
framed the innocent,

47
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,360
and even bathed

48
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,640
the borderlands in blood.

49
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,840
She brought misery to all.

50
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,080
She is a vile and monstrous person.

51
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,960
Yet, you say her past

52
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,320
doesn't matter?

53
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,680
How dare you slander Hua?

54
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,120
Guards!

55
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,080
Kill her.

56
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,040
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

57
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:18,560
Wait!

58
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,880
Allow me to interject.

59
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,800
Your Highness once
proclaimed to the world

60
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,240
that you'd marry the legitimate
daughter of the Meng family.

61
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,880
And now you're marrying
Empress Lv of Beiyuan?

62
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,400
On behalf of all my colleagues,

63
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,120
I ask Your Highness
to explain this to us.

64
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,000
- Yes, explain it to us!
- We want an explanation!

65
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,320
Explanation?

66
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,080
Today is the day I ascend
the throne and get married.

67
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,720
And on the very first day,
you demand answers?

68
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,320
What about the days that follow?

69
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,920
Do you plan to take this throne

70
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,960
and sit on it yourselves?

71
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,600
Your Highness,
don't twist our intentions.

72
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,080
Regardless of her identity,

73
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,560
just judging by her age,

74
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,120
she's not a proper match.

75
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,160
Both sentimentally and logically,

76
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,600
Your Highness owes us some explanation.

77
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,880
- That's right.
- Yeah!

78
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,800
- He's right!
- Exactly.

79
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,520
Everyone, stop pressuring His Highness.

80
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,800
His relationship with Empress Lv

81
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,280
didn't start overnight.

82
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,880
Empress Lv was once
a palace maid in Qi,

83
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,320
and she looked after His Highness.

84
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,960
It's only natural
that he grew attached to her.

85
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,080
That makes sense.

86
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,320
Moreover,

87
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,720
His Highness has risen
from a carefree noble

88
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,240
to where he is today.

89
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,520
It only happened with her help.

90
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,520
She used poison to control His Majesty,

91
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,120
killed Prince Wuhen,

92
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,320
framed Prince Wuxia,

93
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,880
and even caused
Prince Wugou's downfall.

94
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,520
His Highness couldn't have

95
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,560
done all of that

96
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,760
by himself.

97
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,280
This is...

98
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,760
Utterly shameless!

99
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,680
Such heinous and immoral acts

100
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,520
happened in Qi!

101
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,120
I object to this marriage!

102
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,200
- We object!
- That's right!

103
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,200
- Exactly!
- Absolutely!

104
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,120
- Yes!
- We won't agree!

105
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:12,520
- Absolutely not!
- Absolutely not!

106
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,000
- I object too!
- I object as well!

107
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,520
- We all object!
- We won't accept this!

108
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:15,920
We object!

109
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,240
- We won't agree!
- We all object!

110
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,280
- Absolutely not!
- No way!

111
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:20,920
You object.

112
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,240
Fine.

113
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,880
Well said.

114
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,000
In that case,

115
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,160
I'd like to see

116
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,000
how long a bunch of stubborn old fools

117
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,520
can hold out.

118
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:43,760
You...

119
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,040
Object?

120
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,720
Still want an explanation?

121
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,600
How about now?

122
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,280
Zhi!

123
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,280
Ms. Zhenzhen.

124
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,520
Zhi, open the palace gate now!

125
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,120
Ms. Zhenzhen, you mustn't go.

126
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,200
(Meng Zhi of the Meng Family)
Shen Zaiye has led General Zhou Chonghu

127
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,280
through the west city gate.

128
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,320
They'll be here any moment!

129
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,560
If you open the gate now,
everything will be for nothing!

130
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,120
Meng Zhi. The family leader's seal.
It carries the authority.

131
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,320
Prince Wuyin ordered me

132
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,560
to go to Qingxiu Hall
and guard His Majesty tomorrow.

133
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,120
Father, you seem concerned.

134
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,400
Tomorrow

135
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,400
is the abdication ceremony,

136
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,040
and your wedding day.

137
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,120
If I'm not in the palace,

138
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,800
I'll surely feel uneasy.

139
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,880
So I give this seal to you.

140
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,880
Once you're in the palace,

141
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,240
you can use it to contact Meng Zhi

142
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
as needed.

143
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,120
Open the palace gate!

144
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:13,640
Yes.

145
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,280
Open the gate!

146
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,320
How dare you!

147
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,880
Who gave you permission?

148
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,200
Greetings, Commander.

149
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,840
Vice Commander Meng.

150
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,520
Who told you to open the gate?

151
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,520
General Qi just issued the order.

152
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,120
We are to strengthen the defense

153
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,760
until Prince Wuyin takes the throne.

154
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,520
Guards.

155
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,120
Seize Meng Zhi!

156
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,120
Yes, sir!

157
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,720
Kill him.

158
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,880
Anyone else object?

159
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,800
(It's gone on for too long.)

160
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,960
(I don't know the situation outside.)

161
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,280
(If I wait for him to take the throne,)

162
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,280
(it'll be too late.)

163
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,120
(Shen Zaiye...)

164
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,880
(You'd better hurry.)

165
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,880
Present the seal!

166
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,520
Who said I was abdicating?

167
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,920
Seize Jiang Taohua!

168
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,960
Princess Chengping is in my hands.

169
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,760
Shen Zaiye, back off!

170
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,160
How dare you, traitor Mu Wuyin!

171
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,480
You imprisoned the ruler,

172
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,080
and plotted to usurp the throne!

173
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,520
Your treachery deserves death!

174
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,080
- Yes!
- Yes!

175
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,280
Stop them!

176
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,840
Those who conspired
with the traitor Mu Wuyin

177
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,200
shall have their
whole families executed.

178
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,080
But if you surrender now,

179
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,680
you may be spared.

180
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,320
All soldiers, listen up!

181
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,560
Capture the traitors!

182
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,080
If you surrender now,

183
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,920
His Majesty will show mercy!

184
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:47,600
Stand down!

185
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,480
- Stand down!
- Stand down!

186
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,800
I admit my crimes.

187
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,080
Are you alright?

188
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,600
They fled.

189
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,080
Follow me.

190
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:35,500
(Chongde Palace)

191
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,120
Hua.

192
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,560
Go now!

193
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:55,920
Your Highness.

194
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,520
Now that all's lost,

195
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,520
how will you escape?

196
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,080
If you can't leave,

197
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,960
I still have hidden spies
left in Yujing.

198
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,280
Maybe

199
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,280
we could start over.

200
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,400
I've already wiped out all your people.

201
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,720
There are no spies

202
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,720
to help us start over.

203
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,720
A sly rabbit makes three burrows.

204
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,960
Why would I place

205
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,800
all my agents in Lan Boutique?

206
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,160
If that's true,

207
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,320
how could you

208
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,080
have stayed by my side for so long?

209
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,720
The situation is dire.

210
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,600
Even if you don't trust me,
we can't just sit here and wait it out.

211
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,120
Hua.

212
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,720
We won't make it out.

213
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,280
Father will never forgive me.

214
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,760
Shen Zaiye and the others
will be here soon.

215
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,720
I can't accept this.

216
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,280
Why should I die here with you?

217
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,480
Hua.

218
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,240
Do you recognize this place?

219
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:19,760
This is

220
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,080
the grave

221
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,320
I chose for us.

222
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,960
See that bed?

223
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,920
When I was little,

224
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,160
you used to lull me to sleep there.

225
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,520
And over there.

226
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,240
Back then,

227
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,880
we used to sing nursery rhymes together.

228
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,720
All these years,

229
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,360
I've maintained everything

230
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,720
with great care.

231
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,360
Hua.

232
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,000
You know,

233
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,120
this place

234
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,640
was once where I felt happiest.

235
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,560
But...

236
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,280
It's the place I hate the most.

237
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,440
Every single day I spent here

238
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,480
was worse than death.

239
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,320
And you...

240
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,800
You are the person I hate most.

241
00:13:53,055 --> 00:13:54,495
All I ever wanted was to live

242
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,600
quietly as a lowly maid.

243
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,080
But you made me everyone's target,

244
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,800
forcing me to endure
humiliation day after day.

245
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,200
I finally escaped.

246
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,080
I could've achieved great things.

247
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,960
But because of the fool you were,

248
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,000
I failed again and again.

249
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,400
You even dragged me
back to Qi on your own whim,

250
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,960
dreaming of offering
the world as a betrothal gift.

251
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,920
What a joke.

252
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,080
All of this was thanks to you.

253
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,120
Now, I have nothing left.

254
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,800
I'll never stay by your side.

255
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,520
Hua.

256
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,440
I'm sorry.

257
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,200
Please don't leave me.

258
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,360
You're all I have left.

259
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:04,920
Stay!

260
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,680
You want to kill me?

261
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:42,960
Go ahead!

262
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,640
Kill me!

263
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,160
Just like when you were a kid.

264
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,200
You've always been this pathetic.

265
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:46,920
Hua...

266
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,760
Hua...

267
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,720
Hua...

268
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,040
Hua...

269
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,000
Hua...

270
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,000
Hua...

271
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,520
(You wanted the empire.)

272
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,080
(I did everything I could
to make it happen.)

273
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,440
(You feared my brother's power.)

274
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,960
(I even turned against him to help you.)

275
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,200
(You used me like a pawn.)

276
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,520
(I willingly did your bidding.)

277
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,520
(Hua...)

278
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,640
(I gave you the glory you wanted.)

279
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,560
(And today, it all goes up in flames.)

280
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,720
(In this life or the next,)

281
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,720
(you'll always owe me
for breaking my heart.)

282
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:37,920
Empress Lv

283
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,720
is actually dead.

284
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,520
She met Mu Wuyin here,

285
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,400
and died with him in the fire.

286
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,400
I guess they met the same end.

287
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,760
She killed my mother.

288
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,280
She got Changjue trapped in the army.

289
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,280
She drove me from my home.

290
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,200
All these years,

291
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,760
I've hated her every single day.

292
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,760
And yet now,

293
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,920
seeing her die in this inferno

294
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,600
doesn't give me closure.

295
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,240
Now that she's dead,

296
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,520
everything is over.

297
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,080
Someone I've hated for over a decade

298
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,680
suddenly dies at someone else's hands.

299
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,000
The hatred lingers on,

300
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,200
yet there's no one left to hate.

301
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,680
Do you know

302
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,880
how that feels?

303
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,600
Soon,

304
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,080
I will.

305
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,480
Zaiye!

306
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,920
Are you hurt?

307
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,080
We're alright.

308
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,320
Is Wuyin...

309
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,120
He and Empress Lv died in the flame.

310
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,480
I wonder if Wuyin ever regretted

311
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,320
what he had done in his final moments.

312
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,120
He's done great evils.

313
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,920
He brought ruin to all.

314
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,680
All of this became his undoing.

315
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,280
Bad news! Bad news!

316
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,280
Fire in the palace!

317
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,280
Go put it out!

318
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,360
Empress Lv and Prince Wuyin
died in the fire!

319
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,240
You two stay here.
The rest, come with me!

320
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:00,920
- Yes, sir!
- Yes!

321
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,240
Who did you just say died in the fire?

322
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,400
Answer me! Who was it?

323
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,800
We didn't go in ourselves.

324
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,000
Let me go in!

325
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:14,680
You mustn't.

326
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,520
At least tell me who it was!

327
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:18,720
Qingying!

328
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,520
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

329
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,520
What happened to your hand?

330
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,320
It's nothing. Just a scratch.

331
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,360
You're bleeding so badly.

332
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,840
How is this nothing?

333
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,760
Really, it's nothing.

334
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,040
Qingying...

335
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,000
Please don't cry.

336
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,680
Look at you.

337
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,160
You got this hurt
because I wasn't there.

338
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,480
You know...

339
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,920
When I woke up at the residence,

340
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,120
there wasn't a single person around.

341
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,560
No one told me anything.

342
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,960
I felt like a complete outsider.

343
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,440
I felt so helpless.

344
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,560
Qingying...

345
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,680
Qingying, you...

346
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,960
Please stop crying, will you?

347
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,520
Qingying...

348
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,600
Aren't you always pushing me away?

349
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,200
Why are you holding my hand now?

350
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,880
Did I hurt you?

351
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,520
Let me see.

352
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:48,880
I promise you

353
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,320
I'll never push you away again.

354
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,240
Qingying...

355
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,120
I want to keep you by my side forever.

356
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,520
What did you say?

357
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,120
I said

358
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,840
I'd never push you away again.

359
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,200
I want you to stay with me, always.

360
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,760
When I tried to save Father
at Qingxiu Temple,

361
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,960
I was relieved you didn't come.

362
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,400
The place was full of perils.

363
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,480
But once I was in real danger,

364
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,360
I kept thinking...

365
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,920
If I really died...

366
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,480
Without even seeing you one last time,

367
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,720
I would regret it so much.

368
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,400
So this time...

369
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,560
I won't push you away again.

370
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,440
I'll hold on to you.

371
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,520
I've fallen for you.

372
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:13,760
Well then,

373
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,320
since you're being so sincere about it,

374
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,120
I don't mind forgiving you.

375
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,360
But if you ever betray me,

376
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:21,800
I'll make you pay.

377
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:32,220
(Zhilan Palace)

378
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,080
Prince Wuxia, this way.

379
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,160
Consort Lan.

380
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,120
Wuxia, you're here.

381
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,160
Come, sit down.

382
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,000
Father summoned me.

383
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,080
I won't keep Your Highness any longer.

384
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,640
Where is Father?

385
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,960
His Majesty is resting.

386
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,360
He asked me to welcome you.

387
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:56,680
Have a seat.

388
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,480
Here, try these snacks.

389
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,720
How is Father doing lately?

390
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,240
After taking the imperial
physician's medicine,

391
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,960
his addiction to the pills
has eased quite a bit.

392
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,440
But his body isn't what it used to be.

393
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,120
Still, it's kind of you to care.

394
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,640
No wonder he always
speaks so highly of you.

395
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,440
Easing Father's burden

396
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,000
is my duty as a son.

397
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,880
Here, try this.

398
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,320
It's a special recipe from my family.

399
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,240
How is it?

400
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:52,920
It's wonderful.

401
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:53,520
Look at you.

402
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,080
You're eating like a kid.

403
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,080
Don't take it the wrong way.

404
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,520
I just feel pity for you.

405
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,600
You grew up without a mother's care.

406
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,320
And your mother's family...

407
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,680
Though mine isn't as powerful
as the three great families,

408
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,120
we're still a noble house
of good standing.

409
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,160
If I were to have a son,

410
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,440
his birth would not be beneath him.

411
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,480
Consort Lan, are you...

412
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:31,520
Just some idle chatter.

413
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,320
It's about time.

414
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,400
I should go prepare
His Majesty's medicine.

415
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,600
From now on,

416
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,960
do come visit me more often.

417
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,920
I'll take my leave.

418
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:03,460
(Shen Residence)

419
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,120
Father.

420
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,520
Mother.

421
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,000
Meng Zhongyan committed
countless crimes.

422
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,040
He is now imprisoned.

423
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,120
I should have

424
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,120
pushed for a retrial
of the witchcraft case.

425
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,440
But Taohua...

426
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,480
If she doesn't return to Beiyuan
to find a cure,

427
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,960
she might not have much time left.

428
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,560
Please don't worry.

429
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,080
Once I return,

430
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,920
I will reopen the case

431
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,400
and clear the Xie family's name.

432
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,240
Chancellor.

433
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,480
Prince Wuxia is here.

434
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,600
Give me a moment.

435
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:19,760
Wuxia.

436
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,400
I've decided to go with Taohua tomorrow

437
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,520
and head to Beiyuan.

438
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,360
Once I return,

439
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,480
I'll bring justice

440
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:27,560
for Aunt

441
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:28,920
and the Xie family.

442
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,000
Did something happen?

443
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,920
Father summoned me to the palace.

444
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,200
It was Consort Lan who received me.

445
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,760
In her words, she hinted
that her family holds great influence.

446
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,960
And if she were to have a son,

447
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,000
he'd be worthy of noble standing.

448
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,160
His Majesty plans to have you adopted
under Consort Lan's name.

449
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,080
If that happens,

450
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,680
my mother, Consort Shu,

451
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,680
will be erased from the records.

452
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,080
She'll cease to exist

453
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,240
in any records.

454
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,520
If His Majesty wants you as heir,

455
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,600
he must first craft you
a respectable lineage.

456
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,800
We can't delay reopening
the witchcraft case.

457
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:21,800
Zaiye.

458
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,240
You should go with her to Beiyuan.

459
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,640
I can manage things here.

460
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,120
The die has been cast.

461
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,360
There's no turning back.

462
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,400
As for the Princess...

463
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,400
Don't worry.

464
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:33,920
Taohua will be

465
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,120
well taken care of.

466
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:37,520
Alright.

467
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:39,800
Zaiye.

468
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,680
We are brothers in arms.

469
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,040
We fight side by side.

470
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,640
The truth will be brought to light.

471
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,960
(Meng Residence)

472
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,520
Move!

473
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:57,600
Hurry!

474
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,400
Out of the way!

475
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:00,920
Move aside!

476
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,160
Go!

477
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:05,240
Keep up!

478
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:06,440
Go!

479
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,040
Move!

480
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,360
Step aside!

481
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,080
By order of His Majesty,

482
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,920
search and seize the Xie Residence!

483
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,440
Xie Guanyu and Consort Shu
plotted the witchcraft case.

484
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,880
That is treason!

485
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,840
They have been convicted.

486
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,560
The entire Xie family shall be executed.

487
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,920
Don't let a single one of them escape!

488
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,840
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

489
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,500
Chancellor, we searched everywhere.

490
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,760
No confession letter.

491
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:57,600
Search again.

492
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,240
Yes.

493
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:08,880
Ms. Meng.

494
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,520
Are you packed?

495
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,290
The Meng family's assets
have been seized.

496
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,600
There's really not much left to pack.

497
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,120
Besides, the exile route
is long and rough.

498
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,760
Traveling light

499
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,520
might be better.

500
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,520
What if I could spare
the women and children

501
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,520
from exile?

502
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:49,300
(Imperial Prison)

503
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,240
Master Meng.

504
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,840
Alive and well, I see.

505
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,680
Now that you see me

506
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,720
brought down to this disgraceful state,

507
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,640
you must be pleased, Chancellor Shen.

508
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,320
Pleased? Not quite.

509
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,600
Just a little relieved.

510
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,000
Master Meng.

511
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,040
Do you still remember Xie Guanyu
of the Xie family?

512
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,240
Why bring that up now?

513
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,720
Thanks to you, Master Meng,

514
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,640
the Xie family

515
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,680
was wiped out.

516
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,280
Now,

517
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,400
justice has come full circle.

518
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,680
What's your connection

519
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,080
to the Xie family?

520
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,240
Before I became Shen Zaiye,

521
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,640
I had another name.

522
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,160
I was Xie Jing'an.

523
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,960
You orchestrated the witchcraft case.

524
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,960
You confiscated
my father's confession letter.

525
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,320
You framed the Xie family

526
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,880
and Consort Shu.

527
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,520
You slaughtered my entire family.

528
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,880
Meng Zhongyan, do you admit it now?

529
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:22,920
Correct.

530
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,520
It was me.

531
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,200
So what if it was?

532
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,680
The case was ordered

533
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,440
by His Majesty himself.

534
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,720
There was evidence.

535
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,560
It's been eighteen years.

536
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,520
That case is set in stone.

537
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,400
Not quite.

538
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,760
With your confession in writing,

539
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,520
the case can be reopened.

540
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:56,040
I'm afraid I'll have to
disappoint you, Chancellor Shen.

541
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,920
I've already committed treason.

542
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,120
My entire family is guilty.

543
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,240
We can't escape punishment.

544
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,200
Why should I help you?

545
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,640
Your entire family is guilty?

546
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,600
Do you feel even a shred of regret

547
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,320
for joining forces with Mu Wuyin

548
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,520
and dragging your family down with you?

549
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,320
Of course I regret it.

550
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:29,400
Not just for trusting Mu Wuyin,

551
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,000
but even more so

552
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:34,120
for not wiping you out
when I had the chance.

553
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,520
Still so delusional.

554
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,000
Fortunately,

555
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,760
not everyone in your family is as blind.

556
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,280
Aren't you the least bit curious

557
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,480
how the gates opened

558
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,440
when we stormed the palace that day?

559
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,240
It was Ms. Meng's doing.

560
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,320
Because of that,

561
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,920
her merits outweigh her crimes.

562
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,400
By law,

563
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:12,120
the women and children of the Meng family
can be spared execution.

564
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:13,920
But your punishment

565
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,280
shall be mine to decide.

566
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:18,880
You mean

567
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,080
Mu Wuyin failed to usurp
the throne in time

568
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,760
because Meng Zhenzhen
let you into the palace?

569
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,360
Impossible!

570
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,400
That's impossible!

571
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:33,920
Zhenzhen...

572
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,400
Zhenzhen would never betray me!

573
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,400
I want to see her!

574
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,520
Now!

575
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:40,880
Perfect.

576
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,880
She wants to see you too.

577
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,120
You tell him

578
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,520
the rest.

579
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,240
Was it you

580
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,160
who gave the order to open the gates?

581
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,120
Yes.

582
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,320
We lost everything!

583
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,880
It's all your fault!

584
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,080
All my efforts went down the drain!

585
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,840
You were captured early on.

586
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:46,680
You had no idea

587
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,320
Mu Wuyin was marrying
Empress Lv of Beiyuan

588
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,320
instead of me.

589
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,240
I almost died at the hands
of the maid he sent!

590
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,960
Father, did you ever wonder why

591
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,880
Mu Wuyin didn't let you
command the Palace Guards

592
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,300
but instead sent you to watch
the Emperor at Qingxiu Temple?

593
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,640
After the ceremony,

594
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,560
what kind of fate did you think
awaited our family?

595
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,680
And now...

596
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,440
Look where the Meng family

597
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,440
has ended up.

598
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,800
Centuries ago,

599
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,080
our ancestors

600
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,520
started from nothing.

601
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,120
And I'm still alive.

602
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,520
The women and children
of our family will live on.

603
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,760
The Meng family still has a future.

604
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,560
Father, I beg you,

605
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,720
for the future of our family,

606
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,280
write the confession.

607
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,720
To protect the Meng family,

608
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,880
I'll pay whatever price it takes.

609
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:25,980
