1
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,840
We're screwed.

2
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,470
No more free Wi-Fi.

3
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,120
Hey, Ki-jung!

4
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,250
Yeah?

5
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,420
The lady upstairs put a password on "iptime".

6
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,230
A password?

7
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,930
Did you try 123456789?

8
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:25,090
No luck.

9
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,650
Do it the other way.

10
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,310
I tried that too!

11
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:32,500
Fuck, then we can't get WhatsApp?

12
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,420
Nothing.

13
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,660
Hey, Jim Ki-taek.

14
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,940
Don't fucking pretend to sleep. What do you think?

15
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:45,900
Our phones are shut off. Now our Wi-Fi is shut off.

16
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,020
What's your plan?

17
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,190
-Ki-woo.    -Yes, Dad?

18
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,410
For Wi-Fi, held it high.

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,700
Stick it in every corner and so on.

20
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:10,420
Damn stink bugs.

21
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,770
Over here! I got it!

22
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,200
Really? You got a signal?

23
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,400
Yeah, see?

24
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,750
This one, "coffeeland 2G".

25
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,940
Did a new cafe open?

26
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,640
Why can't I get it?

27
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,310
Climb up here.

28
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,650
Hey kids.

29
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,100
Does it work?

30
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,140
Yeah.

31
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:31,960
Then check WhatsApp.

32
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,930
Pizza Generation said they'd contact me.

33
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,810
Hold on.

34
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,250
Here it is. Pizza Generation.

35
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,450
Wow! Check this out, guys.

36
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,210
If we go as fast as her,

37
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,520
we can finish today.

38
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,850
Then we can get paid.

39
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,470
-Should we stand up too?    -She's a pro.

40
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,990
-What?    -Fumigation?

41
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,680
They still do that kind of thing?

42
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,690
Guess so.

43
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:02,550
Shut the window.

44
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,310
Leave it open. We'll get free extermination.

45
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,020
Kill the stink bugs.

46
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,180
Right, too many stink bugs these days...

47
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,480
God, that smells!

48
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,650
I told you to shut it!

49
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:20,650
Should I shut it, Dad?

50
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,380
What exactly is the problem?

51
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,310
Take this one as an example.

52
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,860
You call this a straight line?

53
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,130
And why's it folded here?

54
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,850
Why is this sticking up?

55
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,130
You didn't even fold it.

56
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,430
A quarter of them look like this.

57
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,770
So 1 out of 4 are rejects.

58
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,760
So you're really docking 10% off our pay?

59
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:04,510
Considering the rejects that's a low penalty, isn't it?

60
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,910
Our pay is so low already! How can you do this?

61
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:11,970
Look here.

62
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,100
This is not some minor issue.

63
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,920
You know what one shitty boss

64
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,460
can do to our brand image?

65
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,850
Brand? You can't even afford a box folder!

66
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,040
What did you say?

67
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,110
Boss.

68
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,710
This is all because of that guy, right?

69
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:30,740
What guy?

70
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:34,640
Your part-time worker. He's gone AWOL, right?

71
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,770
Just when the Love of God Church made a huge group order?

72
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:41,150
How do you know all that?

73
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,230
Who told you?

74
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:44,970
My sister knows the guy.

75
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:49,410
He's always been a bit strange. Got a bad reputation.

76
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,240
Speaking of which, Boss.

77
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,220
We'll accept a 10% penalty.

78
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,380
In return.

79
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,820
In return?

80
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,430
Any thought of hiring a new part-time worker?

81
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:03,300
Sis, we need someone!

82
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,300
Ditch the guy you've got now. Just fire him.

83
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,270
Tomorrow I'll come for a formal interview. What time?

84
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:11,970
Wait, hold on a sec.

85
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,440
Let me think about it.

86
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,140
Then for now, just pay for the boxes.

87
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,790
So we're all gathered here today.

88
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,430
To celebrate the reconnection of our phones,

89
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:36,140
and this bounteous Wi-Fi!

90
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,760
Look at that bastard. It's not even dark yet.

91
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,830
Why didn't you put up a 'No Urinating' sign?

92
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,490
I told you!

93
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,530
No, signs like that just make them piss even more.

94
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,380
At least shout at him!

95
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,090
Don't shout.

96
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,750
"Please don't piss!"

97
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,370
Hey, is that Min?

98
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:04,420
Hey mister, that's not a toilet.

99
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,890
Way to go, Min.

100
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:07,910
Hey, punk!

101
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,100
Who are you staring at, asshole?

102
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,480
Come here! You little shit.

103
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,820
Get a fucking grip!

104
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,360
That's an impressive friend.

105
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,430
College students have a real vigor to them.

106
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,530
Not like my brother.

107
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,940
But is he coming here?

108
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,980
Did you invite him?

109
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,040
No.

110
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,380
Hello!

111
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,240
Oh hi, Min!

112
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,250
Min!

113
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,070
Are you well, sir?

114
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:35,980
-Sure.    -What are you doing here?

115
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:39,420
I texted you. Didn't you see it?

116
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,150
Sorry, were you eating?

117
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,560
No, we weren't eating.

118
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,850
-How are you, Ki-jung?    -Fine, you too?

119
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,770
We could've met outside, why come here?

120
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:48,660
Because of this.

121
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,530
It's for you, but it's so heavy.

122
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,930
Really? Put it down here.

123
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,500
Wow, what is that?

124
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,270
When I said I was meeting Ki-woo,

125
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:02,470
my grandfather insisted I bring this to you.

126
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,930
Is this a landscape type?

127
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,730
Or you can see it as an abstract type.

128
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,070
Wow, you know these!

129
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:18,180
My grandpa has collected scholar's rocks since his cadet days.

130
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,790
Now the annex, the study, every room in the house

131
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:24,010
is filled with these things.

132
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,940
But this stone here is said to bring material wealth to families...

133
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,990
Min!

134
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,910
This is so metaphorical.

135
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:35,910
For sure. It's a very opportune gift.

136
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:36,720
Of course.

137
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,270
Please relay our deepest thanks to your grandpa.

138
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,580
Food would be better.

139
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:56,140
What was that called? A landscape stone?

140
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,590
You collect those rocks too?

141
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:00,720
Hey, thanks to that rock I saw your parents,

142
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,980
they look healthy.

143
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,070
They're plenty healthy, just out of work.

144
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,110
Is Ki-jung taking lessons these days?

145
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,960
She can't afford lessons.

146
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,890
Cute, huh?

147
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:30,010
She's the one you're tutoring?

148
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,520
Park Da-hye. High school sophomore.

149
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,400
You take over as her English tutor.

150
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,320
What do you mean?

151
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,170
Tutor a rich kid. It pays well.

152
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,110
She's a nice girl.

153
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:45,160
Look after her while I'm studying abroad.

154
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,410
What about your university friends?

155
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:52,470
Why ask a loser like me?

156
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,470
Why do you think?

157
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,680
Just the thought makes me sick.

158
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,920
Those disgusting frat boys slavering over Da-hye?

159
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,540
It's revolting.

160
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:10,710
You like her?

161
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,860
Hey, I'm serious.

162
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,060
When she enters university, I'll officially ask her out.

163
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:26,080
So you take care of her until then.

164
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,220
If it's you, I can leave in peace.

165
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,950
Thanks for your trust,

166
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,810
but do I have to pretend to be a college student?

167
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,350
Ki-woo, think about it.

168
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:47,120
For years including your military service,

169
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,780
you took the university entrance exam 4 times.

170
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,260
Grammar, vocabulary, composition, conversation...

171
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,770
When it comes to English,

172
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:58,770
you can teach 10 times better than those drunken college pricks.

173
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,880
-I guess so.    -Sure!

174
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:07,170
But will they hire me? I'm not a college student.

175
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,850
Just fake it.

176
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:12,110
Don't worry, you'll have my recommendation, plus...

177
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,810
How should I describe the mother...?

178
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,130
She's a bit simple.

179
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,490
Young and simple.

180
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,240
Simple?

181
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,040
What do you mean?

182
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,290
Anyway, it's all good. I had fun there.

183
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,500
So you agree?

184
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,900
I guess so.

185
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:37,120
Hey, you said your sister is artistic?

186
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,230
Good at Photoshop?

187
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,790
God, with skills like this, why can't you get into art school?

188
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,150
Shut up.

189
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,920
Hey, no smoking in here.

190
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,360
Yeah, yeah. Gimme that.

191
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:53,950
Yeah.

192
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,560
Now the cherry on top...

193
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:07,250
Wow, does Oxford have a major in document forgery?

194
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,460
Ki-jung would be top of her class.

195
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,530
She's amazing, huh?

196
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:18,890
Our boy's going for a job interview. Wish him luck.

197
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:20,890
Son.

198
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,730
I'm proud of you.

199
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,150
Dad.

200
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:29,890
I don't think of this as forgery or crime.

201
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,810
I'll go this university next year.

202
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,360
So you've got a plan!

203
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,520
I just printed out the document a bit early.

204
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,580
Who is it?

205
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,480
Madame? Good afternoon.

206
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,330
I'm here on Min's recommendation...

207
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,810
Oh right, come in.

208
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,030
Thank you.

209
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,470
Hello!

210
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,070
Hello, Madame.

211
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:04,340
I just work here. Come this way.

212
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,640
The yard is so nice.

213
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,980
The insider's nice too.

214
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,880
You know the architect Namgoong?

215
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,190
He's famous.

216
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:14,430
He used to live in this house.

217
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:19,040
He designed it himself.

218
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:26,890
As you can see, now it's a playpen.

219
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:28,600
This way.

220
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:33,600
Sit yourself down here. I'll bring the madame.

221
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,370
Yes.

222
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:47,590
Madame.

223
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,030
Madame?

224
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:53,970
Madame?

225
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,200
Madame?

226
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,860
He's here. The tutoring candidate.

227
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,070
I don't care about documents.

228
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:12,000
Min recommended you, after all.

229
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:18,710
As you know, Min is such a brilliant human being.

230
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:22,120
Da-hye and I were quite happy with him.

231
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,050
Regardless of her grades.

232
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,440
Know what I mean?

233
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,200
Yes.

234
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,870
He was marvelous.

235
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:31,830
So to be honest, we wanted to stick

236
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:35,650
with him through high school.

237
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:39,260
But all of a sudden he's going abroad.

238
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:47,130
Anyway, excuse me, but if I can speak directly,

239
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:52,620
if you're not up to Min's level, then,

240
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,790
I'm not sure what the point is.

241
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:00,910
So anyway, what I want to say is,

242
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:05,760
for your first lesson today, do you mind if I sit in.

243
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:10,050
I want to see it full time, how you run your lesson.

244
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:13,970
Is it okay with you?

245
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,550
You sure about #24?

246
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,670
Da-hye, you solved those later problems

247
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,560
then went back to #24.

248
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,330
Right?

249
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:01,180
Yes.

250
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,240
If that were the first question on a real exam,

251
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,110
you'd be screwed.

252
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:18,380
Look at this. Your pulse is racing.

253
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:24,410
The heart doesn't lie.

254
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:29,520
An exam is like slashing through a jungle.

255
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,730
Lose that momentum and you're finished.

256
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:37,500
The answer to #24? I don't care.

257
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,850
Slashing through the exam, dominating it!

258
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,190
That's all I care about.

259
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,670
What you need is vigor.

260
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,380
Vigor.

261
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:51,870
Understand?

262
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,370
So I'll pay you this time each month.

263
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:09,360
3 classes a week, 2 hours each, okay?

264
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,570
As for the fee,

265
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:13,340
I was going to pay Min's rate,

266
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,590
then I added a bit for inflation.

267
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:16,720
Thank you.

268
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:20,600
How about a proper introduction?

269
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,200
Da-hye' tutor, we'll call him Kevin.

270
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,170
Mr. Kevin!

271
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,760
If you feel like snacking during your lesson, just call me.

272
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,990
If you need anything, ask her.

273
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,680
She knows this house better than I...

274
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,100
Da-song, stop it!

275
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm sorry, did he startle you?

276
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,760
How cute. His name's Da-song?

277
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,520
Yes, our youngest.

278
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,230
Da-song, come say hi!

279
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,600
This is Mr. Kevin!

280
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,620
This is an Indian arrow.

281
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,790
I ordered it from the U.S.

282
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:57,100
From last year he's been an Indian fanatic.

283
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:00,850
Indians?

284
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:04,450
He's got a fanboy personality?

285
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:08,320
Well, he's eccentric and easily distracted.

286
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,480
he can barely sit still!

287
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,370
So last year I enrolled him in Cub Scouts.

288
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:16,420
hoping he'd learn moderation and focus.

289
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,930
But look.

290
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,930
He's even worse.

291
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,970
His scout leader is an Indian fanatic,

292
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,970
maybe that's why.

293
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:32,590
The American Indian is the very spirit of the Cub Scouts.

294
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,740
It's a good thing.

295
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,890
Were you a Cub Scout, Kevin?

296
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:40,020
Sure. I'm a Scout by nature.

297
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:43,890
Da-song is an artist by nature. Look at this painting.

298
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:48,450
It's so metaphorical. It's really strong.

299
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:50,210
Strong, right?

300
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:52,320
You've got an eye for this.

301
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,300
It's a chimpanzee, right?

302
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,580
A self-portrait.

303
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,160
Sure enough!

304
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:06,150
The perspective of a young artist eludes understanding.

305
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,150
Or perhaps it's Da-song's expressive genius...

306
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,790
Anyway,

307
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:14,210
we've been through so many art teachers.

308
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:16,210
None of them lasts even a month.

309
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:20,680
And Da-song is just so hard to control.

310
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,680
-Just a moment. Madame.    -Yes?

311
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:29,380
Someone just came to mind.

312
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,420
What was her name?

313
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,680
Jessica! Right, Jessica...

314
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,160
She was in the same art school as my cousin.

315
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,700
What was her Korean name?

316
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,720
Anyway, after studying

317
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,550
applied arts at Illinois State University,

318
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,550
she returned to Korea

319
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,950
Illinois... tell me more.

320
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,740
Her teaching is unusual,

321
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:58,730
but she knows how to handle kids.

322
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,360
She's got a special reputation in her field.

323
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:04,640
But even though her methods are unique,

324
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,070
she can help kids get into good art schools.

325
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:09,660
Now I'm really curious.

326
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,350
What is she like?

327
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,350
Would you like to meet her?

328
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:16,220
Though I heard she's in high demand...

329
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,400
Hold on.

330
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:29,040
Jessica, only child, Illinois Chicago,

331
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,400
classmate Kim Jin-mo, he's your cousin.

332
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:43,220
Look at how he painted the side dishes on the tablecloth

333
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,820
in this mosaic arrangement.

334
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,300
But within that too, there are repeating patterns.

335
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,700
Gochujang is red, the rice... well, anyway,

336
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,350
he has a Basquiat-esque sense,

337
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,830
even at age 9!

338
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,540
How exciting.

339
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:03,890
I'm sure Miss Jessica must have already sensed this,

340
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:08,370
so I'll leave you two, and go up for Da-hye's lesson.

341
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,560
Have a nice lesson, Jessica.

342
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,480
Yes, thank you for the introduction.

343
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:22,000
So as you can see, Da-song's eccentric genius...

344
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,590
Da-hye.

345
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:29,220
So we'll start with #38?

346
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,870
Kevin.

347
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,180
Yeah?

348
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,260
Did you know that Da-song is faking it all?

349
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:44,130
Huh? What do you mean?

350
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,540
It's all a show.

351
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:50,400
Acting like a genius, that 4th dimension stuff is all fake.

352
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,630
An artist cosplay.

353
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,230
Da-song?

354
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,760
You know that thing,

355
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,210
when he freezes and

356
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:00,560
stares at the sky, as if struck by inspiration.

357
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:06,880
So he's walking along, then he stares at the clouds for 10 minutes.

358
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,130
So you know what I mean?

359
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,340
He gives me the creeps.

360
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,980
He pretends that he can't live a normal life.

361
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,000
Makes me want to puke.

362
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:20,510
So Da-song is pretending...

363
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:24,780
But what's that got to do with your studies?

364
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:33,060
Well, I'm just saying.

365
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,650
Sure, so in that sense,

366
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,690
what you told me about Da-song was very interesting,

367
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:44,600
so let's write about it in English.

368
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:51,370
And be sure to use the word 'pretend' at least twice.

369
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:55,460
Then, can I ask you a question?

370
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,610
Sure.

371
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:58,730
That teacher Jessica.

372
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:05,520
Is she really your cousin's classmate?

373
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,880
What do you mean?

374
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,300
She's your girlfriend, right?

375
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,880
No way... I just met her today.

376
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,910
Jessica's really pretty. isn't she?

377
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,300
Aren't you interested?

378
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,570
You saw her?

379
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,450
Sure, she's pretty. She's a beautiful woman.

380
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,430
Yeah.

381
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,340
I knew it.

382
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:45,040
So you are interested.

383
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:49,050
Da-hye...

384
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:58,930
So, if we can compare Jessica to a rose,

385
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,320
then you are...

386
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,080
-Let's study.    -Yes.

387
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:53,440
Please understand that my boy has trouble keeping still.

388
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,430
I understand.

389
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,080
Da-song!

390
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:58,590
Da-song, get up!

391
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,800
Come on, Da-song!

392
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:02,190
In your butt...

393
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:04,460
-Madame, please leave us.    -What?

394
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:07,470
I never teach with a parent in the room.

395
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:10,500
But today is our first day, and as you can see, he's...

396
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,560
Wait downstairs.

397
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,050
Park Da-song?

398
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:15,750
Da-song!

399
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,230
Madame?

400
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,190
Want some plum extract?

401
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:24,980
What?

402
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:28,230
It's mixed with honey. To ease your tension.

403
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,600
Yeah, that would be great.

404
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,050
-Hey.    -Yes?

405
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,270
I've got an idea.

406
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:52,670
Take two glasses of plum extract to Da-song's room.

407
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:55,770
You're not a parent, so you can go in!

408
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:57,390
Oh, that's right!

409
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:00,350
Then I'll report back on what's going on in there...

410
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,930
Why didn't I think of it earlier?

411
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,170
What?

412
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,520
They came out?

413
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,300
Yeah.

414
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,650
So you're done already?

415
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:19,760
Madame. Come sit next to me.

416
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,860
Da-song, go upstairs.

417
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,870
Hurry up!

418
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,760
Da-son just painted this.

419
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,920
I see...

420
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:41,370
I'd rather speak with Madame alone.

421
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:42,530
Oh, but she is...

422
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:45,040
No, leave us.

423
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:52,600
Madame, I told you

424
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,940
I study art psychology and art therapy?

425
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,080
Yes.

426
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,140
Did anything happen to Da-song in first grade?

427
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:05,890
To be frank,

428
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:09,240
before I decide whether to take on Da-song,

429
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,330
I need to hear about this.

430
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:16,310
But this is hard for me to talk about right now.

431
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,200
What to do?

432
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,670
Never mind, then.

433
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:24,420
The lower-right region of
a painting is called the "schizophrenia zone".

434
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:27,540
Psychotic symptoms often reveal themselves here.

435
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,120
Oh, phrenia...

436
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,190
Look here.

437
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:31,790
Da-song painted this unusual shape, right?

438
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:32,650
I see.

439
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:38,060
Over there, it's the same! It's the same, right?

440
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,500
Yes, that's correct.

441
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:42,310
A similar shape in the same zone.

442
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,530
You see it now?

443
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:44,950
Yes.

444
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:49,510
I've stared at that painting at every meal!

445
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,540
But I had no idea.

446
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:55,150
Calm down. Let's compose ourselves.

447
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:58,490
This is all a black box into Da-song's mind.

448
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,840
Would you like to open that box with me, Madame?

449
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,810
I want to open it.

450
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:10,440
Then we'll need 4 two-hour sessions per week,

451
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,730
and this is not simple tutoring, it's art therapy, right?

452
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:15,780
Of course.

453
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:18,950
Because of that my rate is set at a very high level.

454
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,300
Are you okay with that?

455
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,850
It's my pleasure.

456
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,010
Da-songs dad is home.

457
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:37,230
Honey, Da-song's new art teacher is here.

458
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:41,120
Her name's Jessica, from Illinois.

459
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,500
Jessica! This is Dong-ik.

460
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,420
-Hello.    -Hi.

461
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,700
Thanks for your help.

462
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,450
Class is over?

463
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:50,290
Yes, just finished.

464
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,410
-Driver Yoon.    -Yes?

465
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:54,100
-Are you free?    -Yes, I am.

466
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,810
Then give her a lift, okay?

467
00:28:56,810 --> 00:29:01,360
Sure, we don't want her going down alone at night, right?

468
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,150
Of course.

469
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:03,920
Miss Jessica?

470
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:09,770
Shall I drive you all the way home, then?

471
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,060
-Which neighborhood?    -No. that's fine.

472
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,060
You can just drop me off at Hyehwa station.

473
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,680
Thank you.

474
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,160
I don't mind if it's far away.

475
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,650
-My shift is finished, anyway.    -I'll get off at Hyehwa.

476
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:27,460
Looks like it's going to rain.

477
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,500
Ride the Benz, not the subway!

478
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,700
I'm meeting my boyfriend at exit 3 of Hyehwa Station!

479
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:37,380
Yes.

480
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:15,830
Dad, when you worked as a driver, did you drive a lot of Benzes?

481
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:22,750
Benzes? Not then, but I did when I worked as a valet.

482
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,590
You worked as a valet?

483
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,970
Sure, after the chicken place went bust,

484
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:30,410
before the Taiwan cake shop,

485
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:32,210
in that 6-month window?

486
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:35,060
No, it was after the cake shop went bust.

487
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:40,470
We're moving to the next stage already?

488
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:45,150
I set a trap in the Benz.

489
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:47,150
Then we're diving right in.

490
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,720
Wow this is so metaphorical.

491
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:52,920
Look Dad, we're eating in a driver's cafeteria right now!

492
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,160
Right, a driver's cafeteria!

493
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,390
Eat as much as you want, kids.

494
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:01,170
You didn't even pay for it. they did!

495
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:04,300
Son, have some more. Eat up!

496
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,260
Yes, Dad.

497
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,470
Eat your fill!

498
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:08,780
What did you do to that woman yesterday?

499
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,500
What?

500
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,340
She was freaking out.

501
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,790
Saying she was so moved, you put her in shock.

502
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,190
Fuck. I don't know!

503
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:18,870
I googled "art therapy". and ad-libbed the rest.

504
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,370
Then suddenly she's weeping.

505
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,880
Crazy bitch, I couldn't believe it.

506
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,110
Oh, you're home?

507
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:02,110
Did you eat yet?

508
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:05,120
Is something wrong?

509
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,570
Is the housekeeper out?

510
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:07,610
She's walking the dogs.

511
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:09,790
Honey.

512
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,070
This was under my car seat.

513
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,370
Driver Yoon is such a scumbag.

514
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,760
What is this?

515
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,460
I'm sorry, honey.

516
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,610
I didn't know he was this kind of guy.

517
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,460
Don't you pay him well?

518
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:30,550
Is he saving up by not paying for a motel?

519
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,210
He must be a pervert.

520
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:34,340
He likes it in the car.

521
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:38,320
Oh, that's gross. In his boss' car!

522
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,730
A young guy's sex life is his own business, that's all fine.

523
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,970
But why in my car?

524
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,110
And if so, why not in his seat?

525
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:54,090
Why cross the line like that?

526
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:55,070
You're right.

527
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:59,170
Does dripping his sperm on my seat turn him on?

528
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:00,800
I can't believe this.

529
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,170
But you know what's strangest of all?

530
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,400
What?

531
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,480
Usually if you have car sex,

532
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:20,070
you might leave behind a strand of hair, or an earring.

533
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,070
Right.

534
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:25,100
But how can you forget your own panties?

535
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:29,520
That's right. It's hard to overlook.

536
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:34,260
So it makes me quite suspicious of this woman's condition.

537
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,340
You get me?

538
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:49,780
Oh my... meth or cocaine?

539
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,920
Shh! The kids...

540
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:52,160
What do we do?

541
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:55,420
What if anyone finds white powder in your car?

542
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,420
Calm down, relax.

543
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,420
Relax.

544
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:02,980
For now it's just supposition. A rational guess.

545
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:06,250
But no need to call the police.

546
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,290
Not that!

547
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:11,750
Still, for a busy man like me to ask,

548
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:14,530
"Why are you fucking in my car?"

549
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:15,750
Exactly.

550
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:16,770
So instead...

551
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:22,070
Can you just invent some bland excuse to let him go?

552
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,200
Okay sure.

553
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,110
No need to mention panties or car sex.

554
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,850
We don't need to stoop to that level, do we?

555
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,070
Surely not!

556
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,290
But what if he goes online and accuses us...

557
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:37,000
Just give him a good severance.

558
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:40,520
How was Da-song today?

559
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,520
He was fine.

560
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:45,280
-So class is finished?    -Yes.

561
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:48,760
Jessica, the last time you came,

562
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,230
our driver gave you a ride, right?

563
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,240
That's right.

564
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,040
This may be an odd question,

565
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,640
but nothing happened then?

566
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,090
No, he was very nice.

567
00:34:58,090 --> 00:34:59,960
I told him to go to Hyehwa Station,

568
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,470
but he insisted on driving me home.

569
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:06,610
That jerk! He took you home late at night?

570
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:07,960
Revealing where you live?

571
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:10,960
No, I got off at Hyehwa.

572
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,720
Oh, good girl. Very good.

573
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,250
Jessica nice...

574
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:17,730
Did something happen with him?

575
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:23,210
He won't be working for us any more. A slightly shameful incident.

576
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,700
What incident?

577
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:28,270
Oh, you don't need to know.

578
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:33,940
But I'm surprised. He was so gentlemanly and cool.

579
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:37,380
Jessica, you're too young and innocent!

580
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,880
You have a lot to learn about people.

581
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:45,050
But we were excited to have such a young, hip driver, too.

582
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:48,420
But isn't an older driver better?

583
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,750
That's true. They drive better, have better manners.

584
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:55,320
My father's brother had a driver just like that.

585
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:59,900
Mr. Kim. He was so congenial and nice,

586
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:03,060
I used to call him Uncle when I was young.

587
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,510
You know a man like that?

588
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:07,030
Yes, he was so mild-mannered.

589
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,490
Oh, but my relatives relocated to Chicago.

590
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,740
I wonder if Mr. Kim's free now?

591
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:19,590
I'm really interested! Could I meet him?

592
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,900
Really?

593
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,680
I don't trust anyone now.

594
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,860
I only trust someone recommended by a person I know well.

595
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:30,370
But if you've known him so long,

596
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:32,050
I'd feel much more at ease.

597
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,200
Do you really want to meet him?

598
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:38,390
I'm deadly serious.

599
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:42,380
This chain of recommendations is best.

600
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,150
How should I describe it?

601
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:45,990
A belt of trust?

602
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,830
-This one's different.    -Here.

603
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:48,490
Oh, right.

604
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:49,550
And this one.

605
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:51,850
Looks like a touch screen now.

606
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:54,890
It's not touch, it says you have to turn it.

607
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:56,470
Wow, this thing?

608
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,160
Sir?

609
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,160
Taking our time, are we?

610
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,780
This is a nice car.

611
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:09,260
This is en it! Come over here.

612
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:14,200
He's in a meeting now.

613
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,520
Have a seat and wait here.

614
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,420
Hello, nice to meet...

615
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,490
But is it compatible with a phone?

616
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:44,590
Oh, not with a phone. You need more computing power.

617
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:50,050
This isn't any sort of test, so don't be nervous.

618
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,470
I was worn out at the office, so I came out for a bit.

619
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:55,990
I understand.

620
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:59,440
Constant chatter, all that bother.

621
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,950
At least the car is peaceful.

622
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,320
Thank you.

623
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,150
You seem to know the road well?

624
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:09,880
Anything below the 38th parallel.

625
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:13,800
After 30 years behind the wheel, the car almost drives itself.

626
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,250
I respect those who work in one field for a long time.

627
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:20,070
Well, to be honest this is a simple vocation.

628
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:22,860
But... the head of a household,

629
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,870
the leader of a company?

630
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:28,340
Or else just a lonely man

631
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,140
setting off on the road each morning...

632
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,870
It's companionship of a sort,

633
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:36,380
so that's how I've approached each day.

634
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,140
The years sure pass quickly.

635
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,890
Sure enough, your cornering is excellent.

636
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:51,020
Well, it may look simple, but it's one of the fundamentals.

637
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:56,050
She may look like a sheep, but inside, she's a fox.

638
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:59,440
Sometimes she acts like she owns the house.

639
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,440
Right.

640
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,360
Of all the people in that house, she's lived there the longest.

641
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:09,720
She was housekeeper to the architect Namgoong,

642
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:13,580
but then she went on to work for this family.

643
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:16,380
When the architect moved out,

644
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,840
he introduced this woman to Park's family,

645
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,640
telling them, "This is a great housekeeper, you should hire her."

646
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,170
So she survived a change of ownership.

647
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:28,730
She won't give up good job easily.

648
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:32,600
To extract a woman like that, we need to prepare well.

649
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:36,350
Right, we need a plan.

650
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:41,030
I want to eat peaches. I like peaches best.

651
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:43,460
Why not ask for some?

652
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:46,720
No peaches at our house. It's a forbidden fruit.

653
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:57,850
So according to what Da-hye told me,

654
00:39:57,850 --> 00:40:00,490
she's got a massively serious allergy to peaches.

655
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:01,930
You know that fuzz on a peach's skin?

656
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:05,470
If she's anywhere near it, she gets a full body rash,

657
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:12,920
has trouble breathing, asthma, a total meltdown!

658
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,940
No no, there weren't any peaches anywhere.

659
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,830
That's what I'm saying!

660
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:29,260
Usually when I get symptoms like this,

661
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,100
I run to my room and take my medicine,

662
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,750
but it was so sudden,

663
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,950
I wasn't sure where I left it.

664
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:42,680
Madame, this woman behind me, is that?

665
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,240
Oh, it's our housekeeper!

666
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,240
So it's true. Oh, how sad.

667
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:50,270
I wasn't sure if that was really her.

668
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:54,350
I've only seen her a couple times in the living room.

669
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:57,420
This was in the hospital?

670
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:01,200
A few days ago I went for my annual medical exam.

671
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,120
I took a selfie for my wife,

672
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,670
and there she was behind me.

673
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,660
Is she talking on the phone there?

674
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:11,880
Anyway. I wasn't trying to eavesdrop...

675
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,880
I wasn't trying to eavesdrop...

676
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,800
but her words came through clearly!

677
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,630
-So I couldn't help but..    -Cut, cut!

678
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:20,640
Dad, your emotions are up to here.

679
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,640
Bring them down to about there.

680
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,000
...so I couldn't help but overhear.

681
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,560
Keep it focused!

682
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:33,450
What I'm trying to say is, it's just that,

683
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,350
your housekeeper's voice is quite loud, you know?

684
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:40,060
I understand, it's all right. Just tell me, okay?

685
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:43,630
She said she got diagnosed with active TB,

686
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:46,220
and she was shouting on the phone,

687
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:48,870
so upset she could barely control herself!

688
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:51,340
Tuberculosis? Come on...

689
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:56,340
It's true, she phoned someone saying she had active TB.

690
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:01,690
Do people still get TB?

691
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:02,740
Dad...

692
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:07,490
Back in the day, people used to buy Christmas Seals, right?

693
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:09,900
Feels like a bygone era.

694
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,560
But I saw it on the internet.

695
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:15,520
Korea has the #1 rate of TB of all the OECD countries.

696
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:19,140
But she's still working, as if nothing's wrong.

697
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:21,190
With a kid like Da-song in the house.

698
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:23,980
So you've got a young kid like Da-song in the house,

699
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:26,560
and a TB patient is doing dishes,

700
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,860
cooking, spraying spittle...

701
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,040
Stop it, please!

702
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,280
Dad: arriving in 3 mins.

703
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:25,730
If you get the chance, this'll be icing on the cake.

704
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,260
Madame

705
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,200
2nd floor sauna room.

706
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,200
Don't let anyone know

707
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:12,980
-Have a seat.    -Yes.

708
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,230
Mr. Kim.

709
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:20,080
Please don't tell any of this to my husband, okay?

710
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:21,930
Understood.

711
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:25,880
If he hears I brought a TB patient to our home,

712
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:29,580
I'll be hanged and quartered!

713
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:31,110
Don't worry, Madame.

714
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:34,640
And if I may presume to say one thing.

715
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:38,120
I have no feelings against that woman.

716
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:44,370
I felt I had to speak up for the sake of

717
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:46,080
public health and hygiene.

718
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:50,240
But this could be seen as snitching or...

719
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,720
Don't you worry.

720
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,430
I won't mention the TB.

721
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:56,110
I'll just make up some excuse to dismiss her.

722
00:44:56,950 --> 00:44:57,890
Simply and quietly.

723
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:02,100
It's a proven method. That's the best.

724
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:04,230
Okay, then.

725
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:18,230
Have you... washed your hands?

726
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:05,240
Mr. Kim,

727
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:08,660
do you know a good braised ribs place?

728
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:10,430
Somewhere close by.

729
00:46:10,430 --> 00:46:11,330
Sure.

730
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:15,190
-Then you'll be eating out?    -That's right.

731
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:19,480
Why such a craving for braised ribs today?

732
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:22,400
Our old housekeeper made delicious ribs.

733
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,190
The one who quit this week?

734
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:30,610
My wife wouldn't even tell me why she quit.

735
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:38,160
Sure, it's easy enough to hire a new one.

736
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:44,540
Still, it's a shame. She was a great housekeeper

737
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:45,510
I see.

738
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:48,110
She kept the house in great shape,

739
00:46:48,110 --> 00:46:50,370
and she knew never to cross the line.

740
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:53,610
I can't stand people who cross the line.

741
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,990
Perhaps just one weak point?

742
00:46:58,170 --> 00:46:59,800
Eating too much.

743
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,920
She always ate enough for two.

744
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:07,020
But considering all the work she did...

745
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:11,980
Then you better find someone new. A new housekeeper.

746
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:14,360
We're in trouble now.

747
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:18,830
In a week, our house will be a trash can.

748
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:22,370
My clothes will start to smell.

749
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,940
My wife has no talent for housework.

750
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:30,010
She's bad at cleaning, and her cooking's awful.

751
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:33,070
Still, you love her, right?

752
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:44,300
Of course. I love her.

753
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:46,910
We'll call it love.

754
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,710
Then would this help?

755
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:57,680
The Care? What is this?

756
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,040
I just recently found out about them.

757
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:04,550
How to describe it? It's like a membership service.

758
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:07,880
The company provides veteran-grade

759
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:12,080
help to VIP customers such as you.

760
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:18,090
For example maids, caregivers. or drivers like myself.

761
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,080
You can tell from the card they're high-class.

762
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,020
Cool design.

763
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:26,810
Then how do you know about this company?

764
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:30,750
They contacted me as a veteran-grade driver.

765
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,170
You might say they scouted me?

766
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:40,990
But when their call came I had already arranged to meet with you.

767
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,000
I see...

768
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:47,940
You turned down this famous company to work for me.

769
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:50,220
I won't forget that.

770
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,260
Son of a bitch!

771
00:48:55,980 --> 00:49:00,250
Anyway, I can give this card to my wife, right?

772
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:02,090
Yes, that's why I brought it up.

773
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:03,990
No need to mention me.

774
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:08,690
You can tell her you found the company yourself.

775
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:10,510
Sure.

776
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:13,410
Thanks to you I can play the good husband.

777
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:17,490
On the back, there's a number for consultations.

778
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:19,470
Tell her to call there...

779
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:20,660
Eyes on the road!

780
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:28,840
Hello, this is Senior Advisor Yeo of The Care.

781
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:32,720
Yes, this is The Care's main office?

782
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:33,730
Yes.

783
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:37,270
If she wanted, she'd be a fucking great con artist.

784
00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:39,220
Isn't her voice tone great? Takes after me.

785
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:44,030
From what I've heard, it's a full membership service?

786
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:48,010
So you're not currently a member, I assume?

787
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:50,590
That's right, What steps do I need to take?

788
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:54,820
We'll just need to receive a few documents from you.

789
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:57,430
Are you ready to write this down?

790
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:02,310
Your family register, citizenship ID cards...

791
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:06,040
documents to prove your income level,

792
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:09,010
i.e the title to your property, etc.

793
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:10,980
-Our property title?    -Yes.

794
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:21,480
Wow, peaches!

795
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:22,960
You have some too, Mr. Kevin.

796
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:24,790
Thank you.

797
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,510
Leave it outside the door next time.

798
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:38,320
-And knock!    -Yes.

799
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:43,090
No entering during my lesson!

800
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:44,030
Yes, miss!

801
00:50:46,570 --> 00:50:48,140
Park Da-song!

802
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:49,400
Daddy!

803
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,610
Where are you?

804
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,600
Daddy!

805
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:57,690
Son!

806
00:50:57,690 --> 00:50:58,810
Walkie talkies!

807
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:01,460
Walkie talkies!

808
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:03,680
Who do you like better, your dad or the walkie talkie?

809
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:07,850
Da-song, how could you run out from your lesson?

810
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:11,830
When did you buy all this?

811
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:13,170
It's no big deal.

812
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:13,910
Huh?

813
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:17,840
Huh?

814
00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:20,000
What is it?

815
00:51:23,110 --> 00:51:24,340
What's he doing now?

816
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:26,830
Da-song, don't do that!

817
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:30,110
It's the same! They smell the same!

818
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:33,620
What are you talking about? Go up to Jessica.

819
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,840
Jessica smells like that, too.

820
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:42,930
So do we all need to use different soap, now?

821
00:51:42,930 --> 00:51:46,870
Dad, we'll need to use different laundry soap, too.

822
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:47,730
And fabric softener.

823
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:51,140
You mean doing four separate loads of laundry each time?

824
00:51:52,490 --> 00:51:53,970
That's not it.

825
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,970
It's the semi-basement smell.

826
00:51:58,230 --> 00:52:00,220
We need to leave this home to lose the smell.

827
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:08,830
Anyway, aren't we fortunate to be worrying about things like this?

828
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:09,940
Sure.

829
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:12,440
In an age like ours,

830
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:17,410
when an opening for a security
guard attracts 500 university graduates.

831
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:21,010
Our entire family got hired!

832
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:22,940
That's right, Dad!

833
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:26,540
If we put our 4 salaries together?

834
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:30,380
The amount of cash coming from that house into ours is immense!

835
00:52:31,570 --> 00:52:34,900
Let's offer a prayer of gratitude to the great Mr. Park.

836
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,800
And to Min!

837
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:39,430
Ki-woo, that friend of yours turned into such a fine guy,

838
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:41,640
and thanks to him we're all...

839
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:42,870
Fuck, not again!

840
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:44,280
That asshole's dead.

841
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,700
Ki-woo's on the rampage!

842
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:53,990
Don't overdo it!

843
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:58,910
Use this instead.

844
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:00,930
Damn you!

845
00:53:06,570 --> 00:53:07,880
Get a fucking grip!

846
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,080
Get a grip!

847
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:12,980
Wow!

848
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:19,360
It's a deluge!

849
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:40,540
Current weather is clear, over. The clouds are moving.

850
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:42,980
But they're not rain clouds, over.

851
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:44,490
I hear you, over.

852
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:48,370
Currently your sister's lip is pouting

853
00:53:48,370 --> 00:53:50,300
like a duck's bill.

854
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:53,250
She's super annoyed, over.

855
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:56,690
Can't I stay home and study English?

856
00:53:57,250 --> 00:53:58,430
And call Kevin?

857
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:02,260
Hey! Don't make a scene just as we're leaving.

858
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:04,710
If we have to go, let's have fun.

859
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:07,560
Da-hye, this is no ordinary camping trip.

860
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:08,280
That's right!

861
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,480
How could you miss your brother's birthday?

862
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,220
No way!

863
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:13,070
Even your busy father is taking time off to go.

864
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:16,120
Right! If you don't go, you'll regret it!

865
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:21,040
Oh, right. You know the beam projector?

866
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,350
The outdoor theater?

867
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:24,060
Right, bring the outdoor beam projector.

868
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:24,850
Yes.

869
00:54:24,850 --> 00:54:28,590
And look for Da-song's camping raincoat.

870
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:30,910
He loves it when it rains.

871
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:35,500
You remember now? Zoonie, Berry, and Fofoo.

872
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:36,800
Zoome and Berry get this.

873
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,740
Yes, Natural Balance Original Ultra.

874
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:41,760
Right, and for Foofoo...

875
00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:44,510
Kam-kamaboko. Japanese crab sticks.

876
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:45,160
Yes.

877
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:48,060
When you walk Zoonie, give him a long leash.

878
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:51,180
He needs to run around to feel happy.

879
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:53,740
He's like the canine version of Da-song!

880
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:21,010
Son!

881
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:24,160
Why are you lying down outside?

882
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,930
Isn't he hot out there?

883
00:55:29,990 --> 00:55:32,220
I'm gazing at the sky from home.

884
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:35,380
It's so great.

885
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:41,630
Mom, want some water?

886
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:42,950
There's sparkling, right?

887
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:45,610
Ki-jung, some water?

888
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:47,220
Telepathy... thank you.

889
00:56:09,790 --> 00:56:11,380
Whoa.

890
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:16,300
Wow, all these varieties or alcohol.

891
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:21,120
Dad! Let me add another to the mix!

892
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:25,250
This is pretty classy.

893
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:29,700
Rain falling on the lawn, as we sip our whiskey...

894
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:35,860
Ki-woo, what's that yellow notebook you've been carrying?

895
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:40,120
This? It's Da-hye's diary.

896
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,120
Her diary?

897
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:46,090
What a scumbag. How could you read her diary?

898
00:56:48,270 --> 00:56:52,300
Just so we can understand each other deeper.

899
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:54,580
Fuck, are you two dating?

900
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:59,190
I'm serious. She really likes me too.

901
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:02,210
Awhile back...

902
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:04,800
Never mind.

903
00:57:06,050 --> 00:57:08,540
When she enters university. I'll officially ask her out.

904
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:10,210
Seriously.

905
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:16,720
My son!

906
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:21,480
Then this house will be your in-laws' house?

907
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:25,490
That's right.

908
00:57:26,790 --> 00:57:29,490
Fuck, then I'm washing dishes at my daughter-in-law's?

909
00:57:29,490 --> 00:57:32,570
Sure, washing your daughter-in-law's socks!

910
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:49,440
I like her. She's a good kid.

911
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:54,160
She's pretty, but she's not wild.

912
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:59,180
Well, now that we're daydreaming...

913
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:02,730
If Da-hye and I marry,

914
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:07,000
we can bring in actors to be my mom and dad.

915
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,000
Look at her.

916
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:12,710
She got so many jobs acting in weddings last year.

917
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:17,250
even caught the bouquet from a bitch I've never met.

918
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,960
If you get the bouquet, they pay an extra $10.

919
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:23,120
That's how your acting got so good!

920
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:26,310
Acting is one thing,

921
00:58:26,310 --> 00:58:28,770
but this family is so gullible, right?

922
00:58:28,770 --> 00:58:31,000
The madame especially.

923
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,370
You said it.

924
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:37,220
She's so naive, and nice.

925
00:58:38,170 --> 00:58:40,240
She's rich, but still nice.

926
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,640
Not "rich, but still nice."

927
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:45,970
"Nice because she's rich." You know?

928
00:58:49,790 --> 00:58:53,150
Hell, if I had all this money.

929
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:58,130
I'd be nice too!

930
00:58:58,130 --> 00:58:59,380
Even nicer!

931
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,400
That's true. Your mom's right.

932
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:05,240
Rich people are naive. No resentments.

933
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:07,700
No creases on them.

934
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:10,460
It all gets ironed out. Money is an iron.

935
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:13,690
Those creases all get smoothed out.

936
00:59:13,690 --> 00:59:14,740
Hey, Ki-woo.

937
00:59:15,850 --> 00:59:20,250
You know that driver, Yoon? Was it Yoon?

938
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:23,790
The driver before me.

939
00:59:23,790 --> 00:59:25,050
Yeah, Yoon.

940
00:59:25,050 --> 00:59:29,690
He must be working somewhere else now, right?

941
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:32,160
Sure, he must be.

942
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:35,080
He's young, got a nice physique.

943
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:38,930
He must've found a better job.

944
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:40,930
Fucking hell!

945
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:44,040
What's with her now?

946
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:50,500
We're the ones who need help. Worry about us, okay?

947
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:54,310
Dad! Come on, Dad!

948
00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:59,210
Just focus on us, okay? On us!

949
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:03,640
Not Driver Yoon, but me, please.

950
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,650
Awesome timing, huh?

951
01:00:06,730 --> 01:00:09,670
She speaks, and the lightning crashes!

952
01:00:12,490 --> 01:00:14,030
Hey, Jessica. Cheers.

953
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:21,300
Hey, when I went up before, and you were in the bath...

954
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:22,690
What about it?

955
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:26,710
How to put it? You fit in here.

956
01:00:27,330 --> 01:00:30,280
This rich house suits you. Not like us.

957
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:31,180
Fuck off.

958
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:32,160
I'm serious!

959
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:33,990
Dad, before...

960
01:00:33,990 --> 01:00:36,230
She was lying back in the tub, watching TV.

961
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:39,200
Like she's lived here for years.

962
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:42,940
Speaking of which,

963
01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:47,470
if this became our house,

964
01:00:47,470 --> 01:00:51,370
if we lived here, which room would you want?

965
01:00:51,830 --> 01:00:56,630
What room in this masterwork by the great Namgoong?

966
01:00:57,110 --> 01:00:59,090
Fuck, I don't know.

967
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:02,120
Get me the house first. Then I'll think about it.

968
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:05,030
We live here now, don't we?

969
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:09,300
Getting drunk in the living room.

970
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:12,890
Right, we live here. Why not?

971
01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:17,390
This is our home right now. It's cosy.

972
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:20,160
Cosy? Are you feeling cosy?

973
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:25,690
Sure, but suppose Park walked through that door now.

974
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:27,690
What about your dad?

975
01:01:27,690 --> 01:01:30,720
He'd run and hide like a cockroach.

976
01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:34,780
Kids, you know at our house,

977
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:39,440
when you turn on the light, and the cockroaches scatter?

978
01:01:39,890 --> 01:01:41,900
You know what I mean?

979
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:45,130
I'm getting fucking tired of this.

980
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:47,750
-A cockroach?    -Yeah.

981
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:51,760
Huh? What's wrong?

982
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,420
What's the matter?

983
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:58,260
Dad, don't do that. You only live once.

984
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:07,470
What the hell?

985
01:02:07,470 --> 01:02:09,510
I fooled you! Didn't I?

986
01:02:09,510 --> 01:02:10,890
Jesus, Dad.

987
01:02:10,890 --> 01:02:12,880
I fooled you too, Ki-woo?

988
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:15,130
Did it look for real?

989
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:17,890
If it was for real, I'd fucking kill you.

990
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:20,070
What is this? Fucking puppy.

991
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:22,540
Who is it at this hour'?

992
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,510
What is it?

993
01:02:38,890 --> 01:02:40,430
What's she doing here?

994
01:02:41,060 --> 01:02:42,690
The old housekeeper?

995
01:02:43,410 --> 01:02:44,640
What's she here for?

996
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:49,980
She won't stop ringing it.

997
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:53,030
Raising a racket.

998
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:55,930
Who is it?

999
01:02:57,390 --> 01:03:00,250
Oh, hello! I'm...

1000
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:02,480
The madame's not in, right?

1001
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:03,590
What?

1002
01:03:03,590 --> 01:03:07,630
I worked here for a very long time.

1003
01:03:08,580 --> 01:03:13,870
Above the monitor there, you see a photo of 3 dogs, right?

1004
01:03:14,350 --> 01:03:15,830
Zoome, Berry, Foofoo.

1005
01:03:15,830 --> 01:03:20,160
I get it, but why are you here?

1006
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:24,650
You're my successor as housekeeper, right?

1007
01:03:30,050 --> 01:03:31,300
Anyway...

1008
01:03:32,530 --> 01:03:35,250
I'm very sorry to call on you so late.

1009
01:03:35,910 --> 01:03:37,250
It's just that...

1010
01:03:37,970 --> 01:03:44,700
I forgot something in the basement under the kitchen.

1011
01:03:45,490 --> 01:03:51,250
When I left, they pushed me out so quickly...

1012
01:03:55,110 --> 01:03:56,690
Would you let me in?

1013
01:03:59,190 --> 01:04:00,560
What do we do?

1014
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:03,650
This isn't in the plan.

1015
01:04:11,590 --> 01:04:13,030
Sorry for the trouble.

1016
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:15,100
This way.

1017
01:04:15,100 --> 01:04:16,700
Yes, thank you.

1018
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:20,750
You can put your raincoat...

1019
01:04:20,750 --> 01:04:22,990
It'll just be a second.

1020
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:27,630
Quite a meal there. That'll be a job to clean up.

1021
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:30,640
But what did you leave below?

1022
01:04:35,510 --> 01:04:37,160
Want to come down with me?

1023
01:04:39,030 --> 01:04:41,830
Well, just go ahead.

1024
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:39,200
Help me push this!

1025
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:42,180
Pull it! From over there.

1026
01:05:42,210 --> 01:05:43,230
What?

1027
01:05:43,310 --> 01:05:44,480
Pull!

1028
01:05:46,790 --> 01:05:48,440
Pull it hard!

1029
01:05:52,230 --> 01:05:53,520
Are you okay?

1030
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:56,870
Did I scare you?

1031
01:05:58,910 --> 01:06:00,640
Thank you!

1032
01:06:01,550 --> 01:06:02,790
Thank you.

1033
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:12,180
Honey!

1034
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:13,410
What the hell?

1035
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:16,220
Hey!

1036
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:17,510
Honey!

1037
01:06:18,580 --> 01:06:19,990
Honey!

1038
01:06:22,590 --> 01:06:23,830
Wait!

1039
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:25,960
Honey, I'm here!

1040
01:06:26,030 --> 01:06:27,330
What is all this?

1041
01:06:29,870 --> 01:06:30,970
Honey!

1042
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:32,890
Honey, I'm fine.

1043
01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:34,750
No you're not!

1044
01:06:34,850 --> 01:06:35,850
I'm fine, really.

1045
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:37,190
How can you say that?

1046
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:39,300
But I'm really hungry.

1047
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:40,320
Suck it!

1048
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:41,840
How many days has it been?

1049
01:06:42,430 --> 01:06:44,940
You must've been so hungry!

1050
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:48,790
It's okay.

1051
01:06:48,790 --> 01:06:51,630
She's a nice woman. She let me in.

1052
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:53,020
There was an iron plate, for grilling meat.

1053
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:55,390
It was wedged under the shelf.

1054
01:06:55,390 --> 01:06:56,500
So that's why.

1055
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:59,470
I couldn't open it from the inside.

1056
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:01,510
What's going on here?

1057
01:07:01,510 --> 01:07:02,960
I know you must be startled.

1058
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:06,110
I would be too in this situation.

1059
01:07:06,110 --> 01:07:11,030
But as two fellow workers... Right, Chung-sook?

1060
01:07:12,350 --> 01:07:14,320
How do you know my name?

1061
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:18,480
To be honest I'm still texting with the boy Da-song.

1062
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:21,030
I knew they were going camping,

1063
01:07:21,530 --> 01:07:23,850
so I came today.

1064
01:07:23,850 --> 01:07:26,140
I wanted to speak to you alone.

1065
01:07:26,770 --> 01:07:28,140
Talking about.

1066
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:32,450
Don't worry, Chung-sook.

1067
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:36,020
I cut the wire on the CCTV by the gate.

1068
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:40,460
Nobody knows I came. Isn't that good, sis?

1069
01:07:41,170 --> 01:07:42,580
Don't call me sis!

1070
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:45,180
Sis, my name is Moon-gwang.

1071
01:07:45,790 --> 01:07:50,230
This is my hubbie Oh Geun-sae. Say hello, honey.

1072
01:07:50,230 --> 01:07:53,900
This tastes great. What happened to your face?

1073
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:56,380
I'll tell you later.

1074
01:07:57,020 --> 01:08:01,090
So you'd steal food every day while working in the kitchen.

1075
01:08:01,090 --> 01:08:02,230
Feeding your husband.

1076
01:08:02,230 --> 01:08:07,190
Not at all! I bought all his food with my salary.

1077
01:08:07,190 --> 01:08:10,140
That's so unfair!

1078
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:12,850
But how long has your husband been down here?

1079
01:08:12,850 --> 01:08:14,850
Hold on a sec. 4 years?

1080
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:19,070
4 years, 3 months and 17 days.

1081
01:08:19,070 --> 01:08:20,360
Right, it's June now.

1082
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:26,880
Four years ago when Mr. Namgoong moved to Paris,

1083
01:08:27,510 --> 01:08:30,160
in the time before Mr. Park's family moved in,

1084
01:08:30,710 --> 01:08:34,150
I brought my husband down here.

1085
01:08:34,150 --> 01:08:38,770
Many rich houses have secret bunkers, where you can hide

1086
01:08:39,330 --> 01:08:42,240
in case North Korea attacks,

1087
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:44,070
or if creditors break in.

1088
01:08:44,070 --> 01:08:48,820
But it seems Mr. Namgoong was a bit embarrassed about this,

1089
01:08:48,820 --> 01:08:53,250
because he never mentioned it to Mr. Park's family.

1090
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:55,910
So only I know about it.

1091
01:08:55,910 --> 01:08:57,690
So that's how it happened.

1092
01:08:58,310 --> 01:09:00,710
But now that I know,

1093
01:09:00,710 --> 01:09:02,900
I've no choice but to call the police!

1094
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:04,350
No please, sis!

1095
01:09:05,590 --> 01:09:07,870
As fellow members of the needy, please don't.

1096
01:09:07,870 --> 01:09:09,870
I'm not needy!

1097
01:09:09,870 --> 01:09:13,330
But we're needy!

1098
01:09:13,330 --> 01:09:17,240
We've no house, no money, only debts!

1099
01:09:17,970 --> 01:09:19,150
Sis, please!

1100
01:09:19,150 --> 01:09:23,650
Even after 4 years of hiding, those debt collectors won't give up.

1101
01:09:23,650 --> 01:09:28,020
They're still searching for him, threatening to stab him.

1102
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:29,340
You used loan sharks?

1103
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:32,130
It's all my fault.

1104
01:09:32,890 --> 01:09:36,630
The Taiwan cake shop.

1105
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:38,990
My Taiwanese Wangshui castella shop went bust.

1106
01:09:38,990 --> 01:09:40,760
I was overwhelmed by debt.

1107
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:42,470
Please take this.

1108
01:09:43,180 --> 01:09:44,170
What's that?

1109
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:48,990
It's not much, just a modest sum.

1110
01:09:48,990 --> 01:09:51,310
But we'll send it to you every month.

1111
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:54,090
In return, just once every 2 days.

1112
01:09:54,090 --> 01:09:56,840
please leave him some food.

1113
01:09:57,830 --> 01:10:01,340
No no, just once a week.

1114
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:03,660
There's a refrigerator here. Just once a week.

1115
01:10:03,660 --> 01:10:06,820
You've got some nerve! I'm calling the police.

1116
01:10:06,820 --> 01:10:08,210
Sis!

1117
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:11,210
Who is that?

1118
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:16,060
Wait... Jessica?

1119
01:10:17,190 --> 01:10:18,390
Mr. Kim?

1120
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:19,470
What the hell?

1121
01:10:20,620 --> 01:10:22,710
Dad, my ankle!

1122
01:10:22,710 --> 01:10:23,820
You okay? Sorry.

1123
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:25,750
Dad, my foot.

1124
01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:27,750
Don't call me Dad!

1125
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:37,990
I thought it was weird when the driver was fired.

1126
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:39,910
Hey.

1127
01:10:39,910 --> 01:10:42,380
-Let's talk things over.    -What the hell?

1128
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:43,760
Are you some family of charlatans?

1129
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:44,710
So, sis...

1130
01:10:44,710 --> 01:10:46,740
Don't fucking call me sis, you filthy bitch!

1131
01:10:47,470 --> 01:10:52,720
I'm gonna send this video to the madame, how about that?

1132
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:54,720
Dad, my foot.

1133
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:56,780
No reception in the basement, right?

1134
01:10:57,630 --> 01:10:59,630
-The phone works fine.    -Fuck.

1135
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:04,390
Ma'am, to be honest, the jobs we have here...

1136
01:11:04,390 --> 01:11:07,510
Shut up! It's too late now!

1137
01:11:07,510 --> 01:11:09,510
Let's all go to jail!

1138
01:11:09,510 --> 01:11:10,870
We're fucking going down!

1139
01:11:10,870 --> 01:11:13,660
Lady, are you crazy?

1140
01:11:14,630 --> 01:11:19,360
If they see that video, Mr. Park and his wife will be so shocked!

1141
01:11:19,950 --> 01:11:22,560
What did those nice people ever do wrong?

1142
01:11:23,910 --> 01:11:24,940
Why do this to them?

1143
01:11:24,940 --> 01:11:25,960
Stop right there!

1144
01:11:26,590 --> 01:11:28,440
Or I'll push the 'send' button.

1145
01:11:29,030 --> 01:11:30,020
Follow me.

1146
01:11:31,230 --> 01:11:33,590
Calm down, ma'am.

1147
01:11:34,670 --> 01:11:36,310
Don't push!

1148
01:11:40,430 --> 01:11:41,930
Let's go up, honey.

1149
01:11:42,470 --> 01:11:45,350
Time for you to get some fresh air!

1150
01:12:02,510 --> 01:12:08,120
Honey, this 'send' button is like a missile launcher.

1151
01:12:09,070 --> 01:12:11,230
What do you mean, honey?

1152
01:12:11,230 --> 01:12:16,760
If we threaten to push it. those people can't do anything.

1153
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:21,040
It's like a North Korean rocket. A North Korean missile button!

1154
01:12:22,550 --> 01:12:26,500
Today our beloved Great Leader Kim Jong-un,

1155
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:29,550
after witnessing the charlatan family video,

1156
01:12:29,550 --> 01:12:32,350
was unable to contain his shock and fury

1157
01:12:32,350 --> 01:12:35,620
at their wicked, despicable provocation!

1158
01:12:35,620 --> 01:12:37,560
I've missed your jokes, honey!

1159
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:39,400
Therefore our Great Leader,

1160
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:42,220
in this age of denuclearization,

1161
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:48,160
has commanded that the nation's last remaining nuclear warhead

1162
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:50,710
be driven down the throats of this wicked family!

1163
01:12:50,710 --> 01:12:55,440
No one can imitate North Korean news anchors like you!

1164
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:58,940
With their stinking guts serving as the last nuclear graveyard,

1165
01:12:58,940 --> 01:13:05,620
our Dear Leaders wish to denuclearize and bring world peace can...

1166
01:13:05,620 --> 01:13:06,920
Hands in the air, fuckers!

1167
01:13:07,790 --> 01:13:08,920
Higher!

1168
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:13,270
You scumbag family.

1169
01:13:13,270 --> 01:13:14,680
Husband?

1170
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:15,420
Husband.

1171
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:16,380
Wife?

1172
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:17,260
Yes.

1173
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:18,430
Son?

1174
01:13:18,430 --> 01:13:18,980
Yes.

1175
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:19,700
Daughter?

1176
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:20,360
Yes.

1177
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:22,460
You neanderthals.

1178
01:13:22,460 --> 01:13:26,020
Is that all you can think to do, drink yourselves stupid?

1179
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:31,460
In this home suffused with Mr. Namgoong's creative spirit?

1180
01:13:32,150 --> 01:13:33,350
You cretins!

1181
01:13:33,350 --> 01:13:34,840
What do you know about art?

1182
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:36,840
What would they know?

1183
01:13:37,750 --> 01:13:40,360
When the sun was nice,

1184
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:44,750
we'd bask in those sunbeam, right?

1185
01:13:46,420 --> 01:13:50,390
At such moments we could feel his artistic touch.

1186
01:15:00,950 --> 01:15:02,080
Give it to me!

1187
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:05,430
Good job! Delete it!

1188
01:15:05,430 --> 01:15:09,040
Careful, don't send it by accident.

1189
01:15:23,070 --> 01:15:24,020
Hello?

1190
01:15:24,950 --> 01:15:27,940
Listen, do you know how to make ram-don?

1191
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:30,260
Ram-don?

1192
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:33,320
Da-song likes ram-don more than anything.

1193
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:37,880
If you boil the water now, the timing will be perfect.

1194
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:40,720
There's sirloin in the fridge, add that too.

1195
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:43,000
Then, the camping...?

1196
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,280
My god, what a disaster.

1197
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:51,960
The river overflowed and everyone was packing their tents,

1198
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:55,140
but Da-song was crying and refusing to go home.

1199
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:58,670
Anyway, ram-don as soon as we walk in, okay?

1200
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:01,960
Then you're almost here?

1201
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:04,880
8 minutes, according to the GPS.

1202
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:06,000
You arrive in 8 minutes...

1203
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,280
Start boiling the water right away!

1204
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:14,950
What the hell is ram-don?

1205
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:25,870
Move, quickly!

1206
01:16:27,230 --> 01:16:29,390
Hurry!

1207
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:37,220
Ramen/Udon.

1208
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:42,160
Dad, I can't drag her any further!

1209
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:55,110
What are you doing?

1210
01:16:56,550 --> 01:16:58,190
Dad!

1211
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:04,230
Go up quickly! Help upstairs.

1212
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:13,540
Take this!

1213
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:34,030
Welcome home!

1214
01:17:34,030 --> 01:17:37,120
Da-song, look! Let's eat ram-don!

1215
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:40,760
Da-song!

1216
01:17:44,390 --> 01:17:45,960
Da-song!

1217
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:48,320
Madame!

1218
01:18:11,790 --> 01:18:14,150
Why don't you just eat the ram-don?

1219
01:18:14,150 --> 01:18:15,020
Shall I?

1220
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:18,230
No, wait. I can give it to my husband.

1221
01:18:18,230 --> 01:18:19,830
There's sirloin in here.

1222
01:18:22,780 --> 01:18:25,830
It's cooked through? Medium well done.

1223
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:55,950
Returning after a day's work... I love you so much, Mr. Park!

1224
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:03,460
Home from the office, Mr. Park is off duty now.

1225
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:10,150
Returning after a day's work... I love you so much, Mr. Park!

1226
01:19:10,150 --> 01:19:11,980
-What are you doing?    -Shut up!

1227
01:19:23,710 --> 01:19:26,360
Honey, do you want some ram-don?

1228
01:19:26,360 --> 01:19:27,460
Da-song doesn't want it?

1229
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:28,180
No.

1230
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:30,480
No, I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

1231
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:33,160
Why are you staring?

1232
01:19:34,460 --> 01:19:38,080
Mr. Park, you feed me and house me.

1233
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:39,920
Respect!

1234
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:43,080
You do this every day?

1235
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:48,760
Sure, I even send whole sentences to thank him.

1236
01:19:50,070 --> 01:19:52,040
Someone of your age should know it.

1237
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:53,070
Know what?

1238
01:19:53,070 --> 01:19:54,310
Morse Code.

1239
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:58,820
That sensor's going batty.

1240
01:20:07,550 --> 01:20:11,120
Da-song will know it, since he's a Scout.

1241
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:12,980
It's ridiculous, right?

1242
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:15,950
Running around. trying to please a kid.

1243
01:20:16,550 --> 01:20:18,150
He's not some kind of prince.

1244
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:21,070
He's the youngest. It's common.

1245
01:20:22,430 --> 01:20:23,710
Please understand.

1246
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:27,540
Da-song's a bit... unwell.

1247
01:20:28,540 --> 01:20:31,150
He's receiving trauma therapy and art therapy.

1248
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:34,550
There was an incident.

1249
01:20:34,550 --> 01:20:35,760
What incident?

1250
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:39,100
Sis, you believe in ghosts, too?

1251
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:44,560
Da-song saw a ghost in the house when he was in 1st grade.

1252
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:54,320
He had a birthday party at home that day.

1253
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:56,900
Late that night, when everyone was sleeping,

1254
01:20:56,900 --> 01:21:01,560
Da-song crept down to the kitchen and took the cake out.

1255
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:04,430
The whipped cream on that cake was amazing.

1256
01:21:04,430 --> 01:21:06,840
Even in bed, he couldn't stop thinking about it.

1257
01:21:07,870 --> 01:21:12,960
So Da-song was sitting, eating his cake...

1258
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:25,760
He screamed, and I ran downstairs,

1259
01:21:26,540 --> 01:21:28,070
and he was all...

1260
01:21:29,060 --> 01:21:33,960
his eyes rolled back in his head, convulsions, foam in his mouth.

1261
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:38,740
Have you ever seen a child have a seizure?

1262
01:21:38,740 --> 01:21:39,640
No.

1263
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:44,270
They need 15-minute treatment, or they're done for.

1264
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:48,560
That's the time you have to reach an emergency room, 15 minutes.

1265
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:55,960
How can you live in a place like this?

1266
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:59,340
Well, lots of people live underground.

1267
01:21:59,340 --> 01:22:01,270
Especially if you count semi-basements.

1268
01:22:01,270 --> 01:22:05,350
What'll you do? You don't have a plan?

1269
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:09,180
I just feel comfortable here.

1270
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:13,630
It feels like I was born here.

1271
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:17,300
Maybe I had my wedding here, too.

1272
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:20,910
As for the National Pension, I don't qualify.

1273
01:22:22,550 --> 01:22:25,550
In my old age, love will comfort me.

1274
01:22:27,620 --> 01:22:32,390
So please. Let me live down here.

1275
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:35,660
Anyway...

1276
01:22:36,910 --> 01:22:41,860
My husband was away on business, so I had to deal with it all.

1277
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:47,030
Since then we've always gone out for his birthday.

1278
01:22:47,060 --> 01:22:50,190
Last year my mother's house, this year, camping.

1279
01:22:50,190 --> 01:22:55,160
Da-song's dad says it's just a part of growing up.

1280
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:59,020
They say a ghost in the house brings wealth.

1281
01:23:01,150 --> 01:23:05,340
Actually, the money's been good recently.

1282
01:23:32,700 --> 01:23:34,600
Thank god.

1283
01:24:01,100 --> 01:24:03,480
Just stay here for now.

1284
01:24:14,750 --> 01:24:16,660
Zoonie, what's wrong?

1285
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:20,520
Something under there?

1286
01:24:21,950 --> 01:24:23,630
What is it?

1287
01:24:24,340 --> 01:24:25,630
Damn it!

1288
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:28,720
-Mom!    -Yeah?

1289
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:31,190
-How could you?    -What?

1290
01:24:31,190 --> 01:24:32,800
I like ram-don too!

1291
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:34,940
How could you not even ask me?

1292
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:35,640
Well...

1293
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:38,760
Da-song didn't want it, so you asked Dad,

1294
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:40,360
then ate it yourself.

1295
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:42,340
Want her to make one?

1296
01:24:42,340 --> 01:24:44,160
That's not the point!

1297
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:47,140
-Stop fighting over ramen!    -Why didn't you ask me?

1298
01:24:47,140 --> 01:24:48,830
Oh, stop it! Just go to bed Go get changed.

1299
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:50,830
This way!

1300
01:24:57,580 --> 01:24:58,340
Ki-jung?

1301
01:24:58,340 --> 01:24:59,680
Under there! Hurry!

1302
01:25:02,780 --> 01:25:07,140
One, two, three! One two three!

1303
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:09,350
Da-song?

1304
01:25:09,350 --> 01:25:11,020
Da-song, cut it out!

1305
01:25:11,020 --> 01:25:14,560
He's gone crazy! Get an umbrella.

1306
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:16,160
Hey Park Da-song!

1307
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:21,350
What a monster. What the hell is he doing?

1308
01:25:22,470 --> 01:25:27,040
Da-song, it's time for bed! You know how late it is?

1309
01:25:27,050 --> 01:25:28,240
Here.

1310
01:25:28,340 --> 01:25:29,710
Honey, here.

1311
01:25:33,260 --> 01:25:38,640
Who do you take after to be so stubborn! Look at this rain!

1312
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:47,820
OMG Kevin. Da-song camping in the yard.

1313
01:25:51,900 --> 01:25:54,790
Hey, channel 3 for emergencies!

1314
01:25:54,790 --> 01:25:56,840
Keep it turned on.

1315
01:25:56,840 --> 01:26:00,120
Let me have it. I can't believe him.

1316
01:26:00,120 --> 01:26:02,940
Just leave him. He'll come in if he's tired.

1317
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:06,210
-I want you here, honey.    -I'm with you.

1318
01:26:06,220 --> 01:26:07,180
Hey, Da-hye!

1319
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:09,880
Stop using your phone. Go to bed.

1320
01:26:10,060 --> 01:26:12,760
Go sleep in your room. We'll take care of things.

1321
01:26:14,030 --> 01:26:16,080
This is the living room, do you copy?

1322
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:17,380
Copy, over.

1323
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:21,420
Daddy is standing by for emergencies, over.

1324
01:26:21,420 --> 01:26:23,740
Got it, over.

1325
01:26:25,310 --> 01:26:27,480
Is that tent going to leak?

1326
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:30,750
We ordered from the U.S., it'll be fine.

1327
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:33,960
-Should we sleep here?    -What?

1328
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:36,200
We've got a full view of the tent.

1329
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:38,190
Good idea. I'll feel much better.

1330
01:26:38,190 --> 01:26:38,950
Right?

1331
01:26:38,950 --> 01:26:40,600
Let's watch over him as we sleep.

1332
01:26:43,070 --> 01:26:44,640
What a kid...

1333
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:55,630
Wait a minute.

1334
01:26:57,630 --> 01:27:00,150
Where's that smell coming from?

1335
01:27:00,150 --> 01:27:01,510
What smell?

1336
01:27:01,510 --> 01:27:03,400
Mr. Kim's smell.

1337
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:05,230
-Mr. Kim?    -Yeah.

1338
01:27:05,790 --> 01:27:07,230
Not sure what you mean.

1339
01:27:07,230 --> 01:27:09,960
Really? You must have smelled it.

1340
01:27:10,620 --> 01:27:14,590
That smell that wafts through the car, how to describe it?

1341
01:27:14,620 --> 01:27:17,460
-An old man's smell?    -No no, it's not that.

1342
01:27:17,460 --> 01:27:19,100
What is it?

1343
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:21,430
Like an old radish?

1344
01:27:22,350 --> 01:27:23,110
No.

1345
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:25,360
You know when you boil a rag?

1346
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:26,740
It smells like that.

1347
01:27:29,980 --> 01:27:35,670
Anyway, even though he always seems about to cross the line,

1348
01:27:35,670 --> 01:27:39,760
he never does cross it. That's good.

1349
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:41,280
-I'll give him credit.    -Yeah.

1350
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:44,680
But that smell crosses the line.

1351
01:27:45,430 --> 01:27:47,620
It powers through right into the back seat.

1352
01:27:48,220 --> 01:27:49,980
How bad can it be?

1353
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:50,980
I don't know.

1354
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:54,540
It's hard to describe.

1355
01:27:55,470 --> 01:27:59,180
But you sometimes smell it on the subway.

1356
01:27:59,180 --> 01:28:02,320
It's been ages since I rode a subway.

1357
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:06,190
People who ride the subway have a special smell.

1358
01:28:06,190 --> 01:28:06,940
Yeah.

1359
01:28:23,830 --> 01:28:25,990
Isn't this like the cars back seat?

1360
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:30,700
What if Da-song comes back in?

1361
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:32,870
Don't worry!

1362
01:28:33,540 --> 01:28:35,940
I can just pull my hand back.

1363
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:43,240
We shouldn't...

1364
01:28:49,380 --> 01:28:50,940
Do it clockwise.

1365
01:28:51,870 --> 01:28:52,910
Right.

1366
01:28:56,310 --> 01:29:00,150
You know where.

1367
01:29:16,030 --> 01:29:19,900
You still have those cheap panties?

1368
01:29:19,900 --> 01:29:21,310
Huh?

1369
01:29:21,310 --> 01:29:24,110
The ones Yoon's girlfriend left behind.

1370
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:27,840
If you wear those, I'll get really fucking hard.

1371
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:30,720
Really?

1372
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:32,200
Then buy me drugs.

1373
01:29:35,470 --> 01:29:36,980
Buy me drugs!

1374
01:29:38,980 --> 01:29:40,840
Eat this instead.

1375
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:53,440
You like it?

1376
01:30:14,900 --> 01:30:16,900
They're passed out cold. Sneak out now.

1377
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:53,020
Emergency! Emergency, over!

1378
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:57,030
-Emergency!    -What?

1379
01:30:58,340 --> 01:30:59,430
What is it, over!

1380
01:30:59,430 --> 01:31:01,180
Da-song, what's wrong?

1381
01:31:01,180 --> 01:31:03,360
I can't sleep, over.

1382
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:07,380
So stop it and come in, okay?

1383
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,740
Go sleep in your soft bed. over.

1384
01:31:10,740 --> 01:31:12,160
Right!

1385
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:14,220
I don't want to. over.

1386
01:31:14,780 --> 01:31:16,470
Hey, Park Da-song.

1387
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:23,780
Let's just sleep...

1388
01:32:58,620 --> 01:33:02,430
How did it turn out back there?

1389
01:33:03,060 --> 01:33:04,430
What?

1390
01:33:06,640 --> 01:33:08,340
The people in the basement.

1391
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:16,000
Well, I tied them up.

1392
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
What will we do now?

1393
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:20,420
Huh?

1394
01:33:22,980 --> 01:33:25,960
What do we do now, what's our plan?

1395
01:33:27,020 --> 01:33:29,710
I've been wondering...

1396
01:33:30,780 --> 01:33:34,100
What would Min do in this situation?

1397
01:33:35,660 --> 01:33:38,510
Min wouldn't be in this situation!

1398
01:33:38,510 --> 01:33:45,580
Look kids, we made it out of there safely, right?

1399
01:33:46,940 --> 01:33:51,750
And besides us, nobody knows what happened there. Right?

1400
01:33:52,520 --> 01:33:54,800
So nothing happened. You understand?

1401
01:33:56,400 --> 01:33:58,040
I've got my own plan.

1402
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:03,620
So you two just forget about it, okay?

1403
01:34:05,540 --> 01:34:07,550
Let's go home.

1404
01:34:08,110 --> 01:34:10,070
Let's go take a bath.

1405
01:34:29,070 --> 01:34:31,520
What are you doing there? Hurry up!

1406
01:34:45,020 --> 01:34:47,590
What's going on?

1407
01:34:49,340 --> 01:34:52,440
You stay there. This is all sewage water.

1408
01:34:52,440 --> 01:34:56,180
Was our window open?

1409
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:02,550
Help me out, Ki-taek!

1410
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:12,030
Ki-woo!

1411
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:16,390
Hey Ki-woo, close the window!

1412
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:21,200
You got shocked?

1413
01:35:26,950 --> 01:35:28,880
I'm dizzy.

1414
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:36,310
Hold on a sec. Wait.

1415
01:35:42,140 --> 01:35:44,230
Shit, I'm dizzy.

1416
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:50,190
Ki-jung, be careful.

1417
01:35:51,940 --> 01:35:53,510
Don't touch anything.

1418
01:36:05,990 --> 01:36:11,960
Honey, I've got a concussion.

1419
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:14,190
I can't see you.

1420
01:36:35,860 --> 01:36:40,160
Honey, that woman Chung-sook...

1421
01:36:41,180 --> 01:36:43,280
Oh, god.

1422
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:45,300
What a nice person.

1423
01:36:47,100 --> 01:36:50,000
She kicked me down the stairs.

1424
01:36:52,660 --> 01:36:54,430
Repeat after me.

1425
01:36:55,550 --> 01:36:57,870
Chung-sook...

1426
01:36:59,750 --> 01:37:01,590
Chung-sook...

1427
01:37:12,910 --> 01:37:14,120
Hey, Ki-woo!

1428
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:16,950
What at are you doing there?

1429
01:37:16,950 --> 01:37:17,990
Huh?

1430
01:37:32,950 --> 01:37:35,900
H O L P... M...

1431
01:38:42,630 --> 01:38:43,580
Dad.

1432
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:45,240
Yeah?

1433
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:50,120
What was your plan?

1434
01:38:52,120 --> 01:38:53,660
What are you talking about?

1435
01:38:55,190 --> 01:38:57,180
Before, you said you had a plan.

1436
01:38:58,110 --> 01:38:59,640
What will you do? About...

1437
01:39:00,940 --> 01:39:01,950
the basement.

1438
01:39:02,980 --> 01:39:08,140
Ki-woo, you know what kind of plan never fails?

1439
01:39:10,670 --> 01:39:12,560
No plan at all.

1440
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:14,470
No plan.

1441
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:16,520
You know why?

1442
01:39:18,710 --> 01:39:24,460
If you make a plan, life never works out that way.

1443
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:27,320
Look around us.

1444
01:39:28,060 --> 01:39:31,550
Did these people think,

1445
01:39:31,550 --> 01:39:33,230
"Let's all spend the night in a gym?"

1446
01:39:34,470 --> 01:39:35,550
But look now.

1447
01:39:36,540 --> 01:39:39,700
Everyone's sleeping on the floor, us included.

1448
01:39:42,070 --> 01:39:44,590
That's why people shouldn't make plans.

1449
01:39:47,350 --> 01:39:50,720
With no plan, nothing can go wrong.

1450
01:39:51,470 --> 01:39:57,480
And if something spins out of control, it doesn't matter.

1451
01:39:59,190 --> 01:40:01,740
Whether you kill someone or betray your country.

1452
01:40:03,620 --> 01:40:06,840
None of it fucking matters. Got it?

1453
01:40:09,240 --> 01:40:10,100
Dad.

1454
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:13,620
I'm sorry.

1455
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:16,070
For what?

1456
01:40:19,620 --> 01:40:20,580
Everything.

1457
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:23,040
All of it.

1458
01:40:25,860 --> 01:40:27,100
I'll take care of everything.

1459
01:40:28,760 --> 01:40:30,320
What are you talking about?

1460
01:40:32,870 --> 01:40:34,880
Why are you hugging that stone?

1461
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:37,380
This?

1462
01:40:43,380 --> 01:40:45,910
It keeps clinging to me.

1463
01:40:48,550 --> 01:40:52,150
I think you need some sleep.

1464
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:57,320
I'm serious.

1465
01:40:59,230 --> 01:41:00,910
It keeps following me.

1466
01:41:13,950 --> 01:41:16,880
Miss Jessica! Sorry to call on Sunday morning.

1467
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:19,260
Are you free for lunch today?

1468
01:41:19,260 --> 01:41:22,760
We're having a birthday impromptu for Da-song.

1469
01:41:24,620 --> 01:41:26,420
A birthday party?

1470
01:41:26,420 --> 01:41:29,990
If you come too, Da-song will be so happy.

1471
01:41:29,990 --> 01:41:34,230
And have as much pasta, gratin, and salmon steak as you want.

1472
01:41:34,230 --> 01:41:36,480
Please come by 1PM,

1473
01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:39,510
and I'll count today as one of your lessons.

1474
01:41:39,510 --> 01:41:41,750
You know what I mean? See you soon!

1475
01:41:43,550 --> 01:41:45,040
-Mom.    -Yeah?

1476
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:48,790
For the impromptu, should we invite Kevin too?

1477
01:41:48,790 --> 01:41:51,710
Great idea! Why not? Will you call him?

1478
01:41:51,710 --> 01:41:57,070
Get some more sleep, honey! You must be tired after yesterday.

1479
01:41:57,070 --> 01:41:59,910
If we have a party, won't you need to do the rounds?

1480
01:41:59,910 --> 01:42:01,880
Right, the wine shop,

1481
01:42:01,880 --> 01:42:04,240
supermarket, bakery, florist...

1482
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:07,960
But I already told Mr. Kim to hurry over.

1483
01:42:07,960 --> 01:42:09,440
I'll pay him overtime.

1484
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:10,260
Perfect.

1485
01:42:20,830 --> 01:42:25,150
Everyone it down, I'll explain!

1486
01:42:25,770 --> 01:42:30,560
Da-hye: We're having a party, and mom said to invite you!

1487
01:42:32,870 --> 01:42:36,300
Sis, in the basement...

1488
01:42:36,300 --> 01:42:38,680
we have 10 outdoor tables.

1489
01:42:38,680 --> 01:42:42,440
First take them all out, then arrange them...

1490
01:42:43,230 --> 01:42:46,100
No, come to the window. I need to show you.

1491
01:42:48,150 --> 01:42:50,030
With Da-song's tent in the middle,

1492
01:42:50,030 --> 01:42:53,920
curve the tables outward...

1493
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:56,000
A crane's wing formation!

1494
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,040
Like Admiral Yi used, you know?

1495
01:42:58,040 --> 01:42:59,550
The Battle of Hansan Island!

1496
01:42:59,550 --> 01:43:01,990
Think of the tent as the Japanese warship.

1497
01:43:01,990 --> 01:43:07,390
And our tables will make a semicircular crane's wing formation.

1498
01:43:07,400 --> 01:43:11,640
Then near the tent will be the barbeque grill, firewood and such.

1499
01:43:11,640 --> 01:43:14,110
Arrange them all there!

1500
01:43:14,110 --> 01:43:17,640
Oh sure, bring your husband too!

1501
01:43:17,640 --> 01:43:18,740
Yeah!

1502
01:43:18,740 --> 01:43:22,470
And definitely no presents, just come!

1503
01:43:22,470 --> 01:43:23,260
Yeah!

1504
01:43:23,260 --> 01:43:25,390
What dress code?

1505
01:43:25,390 --> 01:43:28,310
It's an impromptu. You can wear sweat pants!

1506
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:32,590
And definitely no presents!

1507
01:43:32,590 --> 01:43:35,760
Just come and eat hors d'oeuvres!

1508
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:38,960
You know my culinary skills!

1509
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:43,500
Right! We'll get drunk in the daytime.

1510
01:43:44,300 --> 01:43:45,380
Yeah!

1511
01:43:45,380 --> 01:43:47,720
If you'd sing, that'd be grand!

1512
01:43:47,720 --> 01:43:53,350
You know the one...

1513
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:07,910
Quiet, he's sleeping!

1514
01:44:07,910 --> 01:44:11,860
Today the sky's so blue, and no pollution!

1515
01:44:11,860 --> 01:44:13,780
Thanks to all the rain yesterday.

1516
01:44:14,640 --> 01:44:15,950
Right.

1517
01:44:16,420 --> 01:44:20,110
So we traded camping for a garden party.

1518
01:44:21,390 --> 01:44:23,120
Lemons into lemonade.

1519
01:44:26,310 --> 01:44:30,800
Right, that rain was such a blessing!

1520
01:44:32,670 --> 01:44:36,990
And definitely no presents, I mean it!

1521
01:44:37,860 --> 01:44:41,470
Right, just squeeze your Mini Cooper into the garage.

1522
01:44:41,470 --> 01:44:43,320
Go on up!

1523
01:44:43,320 --> 01:44:45,340
Right, back it in.

1524
01:44:45,340 --> 01:44:48,940
Just don't block the Benz!

1525
01:44:48,940 --> 01:44:52,440
You're here! It's been so long!

1526
01:44:52,440 --> 01:44:55,940
I told you no presents!

1527
01:45:14,870 --> 01:45:16,120
You were thinking of something else.

1528
01:45:17,140 --> 01:45:17,990
What?

1529
01:45:19,390 --> 01:45:22,240
While kissing me, you thought of something else.

1530
01:45:24,840 --> 01:45:25,710
No.

1531
01:45:26,870 --> 01:45:29,750
What do you mean? You're doing it now, too.

1532
01:45:33,100 --> 01:45:34,260
Wow.

1533
01:45:36,260 --> 01:45:37,910
Everyone looks gorgeous, right?

1534
01:45:40,160 --> 01:45:43,550
Even for a sudden gathering, they're so cool.

1535
01:45:45,070 --> 01:45:46,480
And look so natural.

1536
01:45:49,110 --> 01:45:49,900
Da-hye.

1537
01:45:53,200 --> 01:45:54,350
Do I fit in here?

1538
01:45:56,350 --> 01:45:57,300
What?

1539
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:00,880
In this setting, do I fit in?

1540
01:46:11,750 --> 01:46:13,480
Hey, where are you going?

1541
01:46:14,320 --> 01:46:15,270
I need to go down.

1542
01:46:16,020 --> 01:46:18,140
Just stay with me.

1543
01:46:19,220 --> 01:46:20,230
I need to go down there.

1544
01:46:21,720 --> 01:46:25,860
Why go to those boring people? Can't you stay here?

1545
01:46:27,120 --> 01:46:31,110
Not to those people, down lover.

1546
01:46:33,440 --> 01:46:34,780
Wow, what is that?

1547
01:46:37,870 --> 01:46:41,070
God, I can't believe I'm doing this at my age.

1548
01:46:42,180 --> 01:46:43,740
It's so embarrassing.

1549
01:46:45,150 --> 01:46:47,030
I'm really sorry, Mr. Kim.

1550
01:46:47,030 --> 01:46:49,510
Da-song's mom insisted, it can't be helped.

1551
01:46:50,310 --> 01:46:53,110
But the concept is simple.

1552
01:46:53,110 --> 01:46:57,380
There'll be a parade with Jessica carrying a birthday cake.

1553
01:46:57,380 --> 01:47:01,480
Then we jump out and attack Jessica.

1554
01:47:01,480 --> 01:47:03,820
Swinging our tomahawks!

1555
01:47:03,820 --> 01:47:04,660
Right.

1556
01:47:04,660 --> 01:47:07,700
Just then, Da-song the good Indian will jump out

1557
01:47:07,700 --> 01:47:09,520
and we'll do battle.

1558
01:47:10,360 --> 01:47:12,820
Finally, he'll save Jessica, the cake princess,

1559
01:47:12,820 --> 01:47:14,420
and they'll all cheer.

1560
01:47:14,900 --> 01:47:16,220
Something like that.

1561
01:47:17,750 --> 01:47:18,800
Silly, isn't it?

1562
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:23,750
I guess your wife likes events and surprises.

1563
01:47:23,750 --> 01:47:25,790
Yeah, she does.

1564
01:47:25,790 --> 01:47:28,230
But she's particularly into this party.

1565
01:47:30,230 --> 01:47:32,630
You're trying your best, too.

1566
01:47:34,340 --> 01:47:36,830
Well, you love her, after all.

1567
01:47:42,590 --> 01:47:43,740
Mr. Kim.

1568
01:47:45,640 --> 01:47:47,980
You're getting paid extra.

1569
01:47:53,460 --> 01:47:56,470
Think of this as part of your work, okay?

1570
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:10,700
Did you go down below?

1571
01:48:10,700 --> 01:48:12,440
Not yet.

1572
01:48:12,440 --> 01:48:14,660
Shouldn't we talk to them?

1573
01:48:14,660 --> 01:48:16,580
Reach an understanding?

1574
01:48:16,580 --> 01:48:17,660
Exactly!

1575
01:48:17,660 --> 01:48:20,470
We all got too fucking worked up last night.

1576
01:48:20,470 --> 01:48:23,880
Dad was going on about some plan...

1577
01:48:24,870 --> 01:48:27,360
-I'm just going down there.    -Hold on.

1578
01:48:27,360 --> 01:48:29,750
Take this down to them.

1579
01:48:29,750 --> 01:48:31,360
-They must be hungry.    -Right.

1580
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:33,300
Let them eat first.

1581
01:48:34,180 --> 01:48:36,710
Coffee next time for Sure!

1582
01:48:37,630 --> 01:48:39,720
Here you are, Jessica.

1583
01:48:39,720 --> 01:48:42,020
-This is so amazing.    -Isn't it great?

1584
01:48:42,020 --> 01:48:44,740
I've got a special favor to ask.

1585
01:48:44,740 --> 01:48:45,980
What is it?

1586
01:48:45,980 --> 01:48:48,300
This is... how to describe it?

1587
01:48:48,300 --> 01:48:50,470
Da-song's trauma recovery cake?

1588
01:48:50,470 --> 01:48:52,270
So it needs to be you who does it.

1589
01:48:52,270 --> 01:48:53,540
Today's highlight!

1590
01:50:16,510 --> 01:50:19,600
Hey, are you okay?

1591
01:50:24,980 --> 01:50:26,590
Are you...?

1592
01:50:36,500 --> 01:50:38,940
Wait, mister!

1593
01:52:25,300 --> 01:52:27,630
Kevin? Kevin!

1594
01:52:34,630 --> 01:52:37,600
Da-song, happy birthday!

1595
01:52:37,600 --> 01:52:39,320
Congratulations!

1596
01:52:46,180 --> 01:52:47,830
Shit...

1597
01:52:53,190 --> 01:52:54,640
Stop!

1598
01:52:57,870 --> 01:53:01,660
Chung-sook!

1599
01:53:01,660 --> 01:53:03,040
Ki-jung!

1600
01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:04,820
Come out here, Chung-sook!

1601
01:53:04,820 --> 01:53:07,820
Stop the blood! Push down on the wound!

1602
01:53:12,240 --> 01:53:13,920
Da-song!

1603
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:15,390
Honey!

1604
01:53:16,780 --> 01:53:18,990
Let go, don't!

1605
01:53:25,430 --> 01:53:31,460
It hurts.

1606
01:53:36,180 --> 01:53:37,390
The emergency room!

1607
01:53:37,390 --> 01:53:38,670
Get the car!

1608
01:53:38,670 --> 01:53:40,790
Mr. Kim! What are you doing?

1609
01:53:40,790 --> 01:53:42,870
We can't wait for an ambulance!

1610
01:53:42,870 --> 01:53:45,280
Stop pushing, Dad!

1611
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:48,180
Makes it hurt more.

1612
01:53:48,180 --> 01:53:50,110
Car keys! The car keys!

1613
01:53:50,110 --> 01:53:52,920
Throw them! Throw me the key!

1614
01:54:09,600 --> 01:54:11,340
Are you okay?

1615
01:54:12,540 --> 01:54:14,080
Don't touch it!

1616
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:18,880
Hello, Mr. Park.

1617
01:54:18,880 --> 01:54:20,140
You know me?

1618
01:54:20,140 --> 01:54:21,590
Respect!

1619
01:55:48,660 --> 01:55:53,020
Opening my eyes for the first time in a month, I saw a detective.

1620
01:55:54,030 --> 01:55:58,630
You have the right to an attorney...

1621
01:55:58,630 --> 01:56:02,550
Who looked nothing like a detective.

1622
01:56:05,400 --> 01:56:06,790
Is he laughing?

1623
01:56:07,580 --> 01:56:08,620
Just a sec.

1624
01:56:09,630 --> 01:56:13,660
Then the doctor who looked nothing like a doctor spoke.

1625
01:56:15,520 --> 01:56:19,440
That happens sometimes after brain surgery.

1626
01:56:19,440 --> 01:56:21,440
They keep laughing. For no reason.

1627
01:56:22,220 --> 01:56:24,120
Do you hear me?

1628
01:56:24,660 --> 01:56:26,120
Can you hear me?

1629
01:56:26,720 --> 01:56:28,620
Then do I have to do it again?

1630
01:56:28,620 --> 01:56:29,500
Do what?

1631
01:56:29,500 --> 01:56:30,790
The Miranda thing.

1632
01:56:33,310 --> 01:56:36,310
You have the right to remain silent.

1633
01:56:36,310 --> 01:56:40,380
Anything you say can and will be used against you...

1634
01:56:40,380 --> 01:56:42,380
He keeps laughing, look!

1635
01:56:45,670 --> 01:56:50,940
Even when I heard how much Ki-jung bled that day...

1636
01:56:51,660 --> 01:56:54,100
Even when I heard the words forgery,

1637
01:56:54,100 --> 01:56:58,830
trespassing, foul play, self-defense

1638
01:56:59,710 --> 01:57:05,220
and we were lucky to get away with a probation...

1639
01:57:08,870 --> 01:57:12,180
Even when I finally got to see Ki-jung's face...

1640
01:57:12,200 --> 01:57:14,700
Kim Ki-jung. RIP.

1641
01:57:16,480 --> 01:57:18,460
I kept laughing.

1642
01:57:28,590 --> 01:57:33,560
Still, when I went back and watched the news reports,

1643
01:57:34,180 --> 01:57:35,870
I didn't laugh.

1644
01:57:36,280 --> 01:57:38,750
This sudden rampage in the back yard of an upper-class home

1645
01:57:38,750 --> 01:57:40,700
is a highly unusual case.

1646
01:57:40,700 --> 01:57:46,020
Since the homeless man who sparked the rampage died at the scene,

1647
01:57:46,020 --> 01:57:51,310
police are struggling to even establish a clear motive.

1648
01:57:51,310 --> 01:57:55,880
The driver Kim and the slain
Mr. Park are said to have been on good terms.

1649
01:57:55,880 --> 01:58:00,860
For now the police investigation
is focused on locating the driver Kim.

1650
01:58:01,950 --> 01:58:06,070
Kim, after exiting this door and descending the stairs,

1651
01:58:06,070 --> 01:58:08,710
disappeared into the neighboring alleys.

1652
01:58:09,800 --> 01:58:14,420
Police searched the CCTVs of nearby homes to no avail,

1653
01:58:15,380 --> 01:58:17,990
and they have yet to find any witnesses.

1654
01:58:19,040 --> 01:58:21,270
Given the situation,

1655
01:58:21,270 --> 01:58:25,600
it's not an exaggeration to say that Kim vanished into thin air.

1656
01:58:27,600 --> 01:58:34,590
Actually Mom and I had no idea where Dad was.

1657
01:58:36,910 --> 01:58:42,040
But those detectives still wore themselves out tailing us.

1658
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:51,990
Eventually the news went quiet, and after the tails stopped,

1659
01:58:53,030 --> 01:58:56,430
I started going up that mountain.

1660
01:58:58,430 --> 01:59:02,880
From up there, you get a great view of the house.

1661
01:59:06,140 --> 01:59:09,500
That day, despite the cold.

1662
01:59:10,660 --> 01:59:12,710
I felt like staying longer.

1663
01:59:26,280 --> 01:59:29,390
Dash-dash-dot-dot.

1664
01:59:34,100 --> 01:59:52,200
Dash-dash-dot-dot.

1665
01:59:55,190 --> 01:59:56,100
Son!

1666
01:59:58,560 --> 01:59:59,760
Son!

1667
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:05,270
Perhaps you, if no one else. will be able to read this letter.

1668
02:00:09,180 --> 02:00:14,640
You were a Boy Scout, so I'm writing this just in case.

1669
02:00:18,750 --> 02:00:20,980
Have your injuries healed?

1670
02:00:22,640 --> 02:00:26,120
I'm sure your mom is plenty healthy.

1671
02:00:30,870 --> 02:00:33,340
I'm doing fine in here.

1672
02:00:34,710 --> 02:00:37,120
Though thinking of Ki-jung makes me cry.

1673
02:00:40,670 --> 02:00:44,780
Even now, what happened that day doesn't seem real.

1674
02:00:46,680 --> 02:00:48,510
It feels like a dream,

1675
02:00:49,990 --> 02:00:51,670
and yet it doesn't.

1676
02:00:53,320 --> 02:00:57,550
That day as I went out the gate, I suddenly knew.

1677
02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:00,480
Where I needed to go...

1678
02:01:40,260 --> 02:01:43,460
A house where such grisly crime took place

1679
02:01:43,460 --> 02:01:46,220
would surely not be easy to sell.

1680
02:01:49,790 --> 02:01:51,740
I'm sorry, Mr. Park.

1681
02:01:52,390 --> 02:01:57,840
I struggled to hold out like that in an empty house.

1682
02:02:01,380 --> 02:02:04,430
Still, thanks to the house being empty.

1683
02:02:04,430 --> 02:02:09,390
what was her name? Moon-gwang?

1684
02:02:09,390 --> 02:02:12,880
I was able to give her a proper send off.

1685
02:02:14,830 --> 02:02:20,450
I hear tree-side burials are trendy. so hell, I did my best.

1686
02:02:24,820 --> 02:02:28,120
But those real estate sharks sure are clever.

1687
02:02:33,040 --> 02:02:37,540
They hoodwinked some people who had just arrived in Korea

1688
02:02:37,540 --> 02:02:39,240
and managed to sell the house.

1689
02:02:40,960 --> 02:02:44,270
With the parents working, and the kids attending school,

1690
02:02:44,270 --> 02:02:47,100
the family is usually out.

1691
02:02:47,100 --> 02:02:51,800
But the goddamned housekeeper stays there 24 hours a day.

1692
02:02:52,640 --> 02:02:56,870
Each time I go upstairs, I take my life in my hands.

1693
02:03:00,040 --> 02:03:03,710
It turns out Germans eat more than just sausage and beer.

1694
02:03:04,820 --> 02:03:06,430
What a relief.

1695
02:03:09,630 --> 02:03:13,200
Passing the time down here, everything starts to go hazy.

1696
02:03:18,160 --> 02:03:21,830
Today at least I was able to write you a letter.

1697
02:03:24,240 --> 02:03:28,110
If I send out the letter this way every night,

1698
02:03:28,110 --> 02:03:32,320
maybe someday you'll see it.

1699
02:03:38,520 --> 02:03:40,040
So long.

1700
02:03:54,200 --> 02:03:55,560
You're home, Ki-woo?

1701
02:03:55,560 --> 02:03:56,540
Yeah.

1702
02:04:10,900 --> 02:04:15,180
Dad, today I made a plan.

1703
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:19,110
A fundamental plan.

1704
02:04:22,270 --> 02:04:23,640
I'm going to earn money.

1705
02:04:24,820 --> 02:04:25,910
A lot of it.

1706
02:04:29,870 --> 02:04:33,910
University, a career, marriage. those are all fine,

1707
02:04:34,860 --> 02:04:36,880
but first I'll earn money.

1708
02:04:36,880 --> 02:04:41,820
You'll see once you go in, but it's very spacious.

1709
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:47,710
Actually, we don't show this house to just anyone.

1710
02:04:47,710 --> 02:04:51,540
When I have money, I'll buy that house.

1711
02:04:53,060 --> 02:04:57,020
On the day we move in, Mom and I will be in the yard.

1712
02:04:57,980 --> 02:04:59,820
Because the sunshine is so nice there.

1713
02:05:01,580 --> 02:05:02,830
All you'll need to do

1714
02:05:03,790 --> 02:05:05,620
is walk up the stairs.

1715
02:06:29,480 --> 02:06:33,540
Take care until then.

1716
02:06:38,160 --> 02:06:40,750
So long.
