1
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,840
We're screwed.

2
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,470
No more free Wi-Fi.

3
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,120
Hey, Ki-jung!

4
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,250
Yeah?

5
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:40,420
The lady upstairs put a password on "iptime".

6
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,230
A password?

7
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,930
Did you try 123456789?

8
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:45,090
No luck.

9
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,650
Do it the other way.

10
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,310
I tried that too!

11
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:52,500
Fuck, then we can't get WhatsApp?

12
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,420
Nothing.

13
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,660
Hey, Jim Ki-taek.

14
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:59,940
Don't fucking pretend to sleep. What do you think?

15
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:05,900
Our phones are shut off. Now our Wi-Fi is shut off.

16
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,020
What's your plan?

17
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,190
-Ki-woo.    -Yes, Dad?

18
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,410
For Wi-Fi, held it high.

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,700
Stick it in every corner and so on.

20
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:30,420
Damn stink bugs.

21
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,770
Over here! I got it!

22
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,200
Really? You got a signal?

23
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,400
Yeah, see?

24
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,750
This one, "coffeeland 2G".

25
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,940
Did a new cafe open?

26
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,640
Why can't I get it?

27
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,310
Climb up here.

28
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,650
Hey kids.

29
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,100
Does it work?

30
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,140
Yeah.

31
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,960
Then check WhatsApp.

32
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,930
Pizza Generation said they'd contact me.

33
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,810
Hold on.

34
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,250
Here it is. Pizza Generation.

35
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,450
Wow! Check this out, guys.

36
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,210
If we go as fast as her,

37
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,520
we can finish today.

38
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,850
Then we can get paid.

39
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:12,470
-Should we stand up too?    -She's a pro.

40
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,990
-What?    -Fumigation?

41
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,680
They still do that kind of thing?

42
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,690
Guess so.

43
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:22,550
Shut the window.

44
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:25,310
Leave it open. We'll get free extermination.

45
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,020
Kill the stink bugs.

46
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,180
Right, too many stink bugs these days...

47
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,480
God, that smells!

48
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,650
I told you to shut it!

49
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,650
Should I shut it, Dad?

50
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,380
What exactly is the problem?

51
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,310
Take this one as an example.

52
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,860
You call this a straight line?

53
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,130
And why's it folded here?

54
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,850
Why is this sticking up?

55
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,130
You didn't even fold it.

56
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:11,430
A quarter of them look like this.

57
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,770
So 1 out of 4 are rejects.

58
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,760
So you're really docking 10% off our pay?

59
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,510
Considering the rejects that's a low penalty, isn't it?

60
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,910
Our pay is so low already! How can you do this?

61
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:31,970
Look here.

62
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,100
This is not some minor issue.

63
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,920
You know what one shitty boss

64
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:40,460
can do to our brand image?

65
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,850
Brand? You can't even afford a box folder!

66
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,040
What did you say?

67
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,110
Boss.

68
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,710
This is all because of that guy, right?

69
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:50,740
What guy?

70
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,640
Your part-time worker. He's gone AWOL, right?

71
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,770
Just when the Love of God Church made a huge group order?

72
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:01,150
How do you know all that?

73
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,230
Who told you?

74
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,970
My sister knows the guy.

75
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:09,410
He's always been a bit strange. Got a bad reputation.

76
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,240
Speaking of which, Boss.

77
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,220
We'll accept a 10% penalty.

78
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,380
In return.

79
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,820
In return?

80
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,430
Any thought of hiring a new part-time worker?

81
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:23,300
Sis, we need someone!

82
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,300
Ditch the guy you've got now. Just fire him.

83
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:30,270
Tomorrow I'll come for a formal interview. What time?

84
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,970
Wait, hold on a sec.

85
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,440
Let me think about it.

86
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,140
Then for now, just pay for the boxes.

87
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,790
So we're all gathered here today.

88
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,430
To celebrate the reconnection of our phones,

89
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:56,140
and this bounteous Wi-Fi!

90
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,760
Look at that bastard. It's not even dark yet.

91
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,830
Why didn't you put up a 'No Urinating' sign?

92
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,490
I told you!

93
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,530
No, signs like that just make them piss even more.

94
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,380
At least shout at him!

95
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,090
Don't shout.

96
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:15,750
"Please don't piss!"

97
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,370
Hey, is that Min?

98
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,420
Hey mister, that's not a toilet.

99
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,890
Way to go, Min.

100
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:27,910
Hey, punk!

101
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:30,100
Who are you staring at, asshole?

102
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,480
Come here! You little shit.

103
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,820
Get a fucking grip!

104
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:41,360
That's an impressive friend.

105
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,430
College students have a real vigor to them.

106
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,530
Not like my brother.

107
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,940
But is he coming here?

108
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,980
Did you invite him?

109
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,040
No.

110
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,380
Hello!

111
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,240
Oh hi, Min!

112
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,250
Min!

113
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,070
Are you well, sir?

114
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:55,980
-Sure.    -What are you doing here?

115
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,420
I texted you. Didn't you see it?

116
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,150
Sorry, were you eating?

117
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,560
No, we weren't eating.

118
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,850
-How are you, Ki-jung?    -Fine, you too?

119
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:07,770
We could've met outside, why come here?

120
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:08,660
Because of this.

121
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,530
It's for you, but it's so heavy.

122
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:13,930
Really? Put it down here.

123
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,500
Wow, what is that?

124
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,270
When I said I was meeting Ki-woo,

125
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:22,470
my grandfather insisted I bring this to you.

126
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,930
Is this a landscape type?

127
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,730
Or you can see it as an abstract type.

128
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,070
Wow, you know these!

129
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:38,180
My grandpa has collected scholar's rocks since his cadet days.

130
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,790
Now the annex, the study, every room in the house

131
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,010
is filled with these things.

132
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:47,940
But this stone here is said to bring material wealth to families...

133
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,990
Min!

134
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,910
This is so metaphorical.

135
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:55,910
For sure. It's a very opportune gift.

136
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:56,720
Of course.

137
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,270
Please relay our deepest thanks to your grandpa.

138
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,580
Food would be better.

139
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:16,140
What was that called? A landscape stone?

140
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,590
You collect those rocks too?

141
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:20,720
Hey, thanks to that rock I saw your parents,

142
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,980
they look healthy.

143
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,070
They're plenty healthy, just out of work.

144
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,110
Is Ki-jung taking lessons these days?

145
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,960
She can't afford lessons.

146
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,890
Cute, huh?

147
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:50,010
She's the one you're tutoring?

148
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,520
Park Da-hye. High school sophomore.

149
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,400
You take over as her English tutor.

150
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,320
What do you mean?

151
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,170
Tutor a rich kid. It pays well.

152
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,110
She's a nice girl.

153
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:05,160
Look after her while I'm studying abroad.

154
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,410
What about your university friends?

155
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:12,470
Why ask a loser like me?

156
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:14,470
Why do you think?

157
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,680
Just the thought makes me sick.

158
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,920
Those disgusting frat boys slavering over Da-hye?

159
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,540
It's revolting.

160
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:30,710
You like her?

161
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,860
Hey, I'm serious.

162
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,060
When she enters university, I'll officially ask her out.

163
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,080
So you take care of her until then.

164
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,220
If it's you, I can leave in peace.

165
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,950
Thanks for your trust,

166
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:57,810
but do I have to pretend to be a college student?

167
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,350
Ki-woo, think about it.

168
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:07,120
For years including your military service,

169
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,780
you took the university entrance exam 4 times.

170
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,260
Grammar, vocabulary, composition, conversation...

171
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,770
When it comes to English,

172
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:18,770
you can teach 10 times better than those drunken college pricks.

173
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,880
-I guess so.    -Sure!

174
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:27,170
But will they hire me? I'm not a college student.

175
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:28,850
Just fake it.

176
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:32,110
Don't worry, you'll have my recommendation, plus...

177
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,810
How should I describe the mother...?

178
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,130
She's a bit simple.

179
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:41,490
Young and simple.

180
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:42,240
Simple?

181
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,040
What do you mean?

182
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:48,290
Anyway, it's all good. I had fun there.

183
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,500
So you agree?

184
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,900
I guess so.

185
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:57,120
Hey, you said your sister is artistic?

186
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,230
Good at Photoshop?

187
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,790
God, with skills like this, why can't you get into art school?

188
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,150
Shut up.

189
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,920
Hey, no smoking in here.

190
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,360
Yeah, yeah. Gimme that.

191
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:13,950
Yeah.

192
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:21,560
Now the cherry on top...

193
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:27,250
Wow, does Oxford have a major in document forgery?

194
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:30,460
Ki-jung would be top of her class.

195
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,530
She's amazing, huh?

196
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:38,890
Our boy's going for a job interview. Wish him luck.

197
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:40,890
Son.

198
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,730
I'm proud of you.

199
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,150
Dad.

200
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,890
I don't think of this as forgery or crime.

201
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,810
I'll go this university next year.

202
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,360
So you've got a plan!

203
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,520
I just printed out the document a bit early.

204
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,580
Who is it?

205
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,480
Madame? Good afternoon.

206
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,330
I'm here on Min's recommendation...

207
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,810
Oh right, come in.

208
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,030
Thank you.

209
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,470
Hello!

210
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,070
Hello, Madame.

211
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:24,340
I just work here. Come this way.

212
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,640
The yard is so nice.

213
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,980
The insider's nice too.

214
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,880
You know the architect Namgoong?

215
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,190
He's famous.

216
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,430
He used to live in this house.

217
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,040
He designed it himself.

218
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:46,890
As you can see, now it's a playpen.

219
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,600
This way.

220
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:53,600
Sit yourself down here. I'll bring the madame.

221
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,370
Yes.

222
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:07,590
Madame.

223
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,030
Madame?

224
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:13,970
Madame?

225
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,200
Madame?

226
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:22,860
He's here. The tutoring candidate.

227
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:29,070
I don't care about documents.

228
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:32,000
Min recommended you, after all.

229
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:38,710
As you know, Min is such a brilliant human being.

230
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:42,120
Da-hye and I were quite happy with him.

231
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,050
Regardless of her grades.

232
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,440
Know what I mean?

233
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,200
Yes.

234
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,870
He was marvelous.

235
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:51,830
So to be honest, we wanted to stick

236
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:55,650
with him through high school.

237
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:59,260
But all of a sudden he's going abroad.

238
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:07,130
Anyway, excuse me, but if I can speak directly,

239
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:12,620
if you're not up to Min's level, then,

240
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,790
I'm not sure what the point is.

241
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:20,910
So anyway, what I want to say is,

242
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:25,760
for your first lesson today, do you mind if I sit in.

243
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:30,050
I want to see it full time, how you run your lesson.

244
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:33,970
Is it okay with you?

245
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,550
You sure about #24?

246
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,670
Da-hye, you solved those later problems

247
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:16,560
then went back to #24.

248
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,330
Right?

249
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:21,180
Yes.

250
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,240
If that were the first question on a real exam,

251
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,110
you'd be screwed.

252
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,380
Look at this. Your pulse is racing.

253
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:44,410
The heart doesn't lie.

254
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:49,520
An exam is like slashing through a jungle.

255
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,730
Lose that momentum and you're finished.

256
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:57,500
The answer to #24? I don't care.

257
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,850
Slashing through the exam, dominating it!

258
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,190
That's all I care about.

259
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,670
What you need is vigor.

260
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,380
Vigor.

261
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:11,870
Understand?

262
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:26,370
So I'll pay you this time each month.

263
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:29,360
3 classes a week, 2 hours each, okay?

264
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,570
As for the fee,

265
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,340
I was going to pay Min's rate,

266
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,590
then I added a bit for inflation.

267
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,720
Thank you.

268
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:40,600
How about a proper introduction?

269
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,200
Da-hye' tutor, we'll call him Kevin.

270
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,170
Mr. Kevin!

271
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:49,760
If you feel like snacking during your lesson, just call me.

272
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,990
If you need anything, ask her.

273
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,680
She knows this house better than I...

274
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,100
Da-song, stop it!

275
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,000
I'm sorry, did he startle you?

276
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:02,760
How cute. His name's Da-song?

277
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,520
Yes, our youngest.

278
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,230
Da-song, come say hi!

279
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,600
This is Mr. Kevin!

280
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,620
This is an Indian arrow.

281
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,790
I ordered it from the U.S.

282
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:17,100
From last year he's been an Indian fanatic.

283
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:20,850
Indians?

284
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:24,450
He's got a fanboy personality?

285
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:28,320
Well, he's eccentric and easily distracted.

286
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,480
he can barely sit still!

287
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,370
So last year I enrolled him in Cub Scouts.

288
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:36,420
hoping he'd learn moderation and focus.

289
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,930
But look.

290
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,930
He's even worse.

291
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,970
His scout leader is an Indian fanatic,

292
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,970
maybe that's why.

293
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:52,590
The American Indian is the very spirit of the Cub Scouts.

294
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,740
It's a good thing.

295
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,890
Were you a Cub Scout, Kevin?

296
00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:00,020
Sure. I'm a Scout by nature.

297
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:03,890
Da-song is an artist by nature. Look at this painting.

298
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:08,450
It's so metaphorical. It's really strong.

299
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,210
Strong, right?

300
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,320
You've got an eye for this.

301
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,300
It's a chimpanzee, right?

302
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,580
A self-portrait.

303
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,160
Sure enough!

304
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:26,150
The perspective of a young artist eludes understanding.

305
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,150
Or perhaps it's Da-song's expressive genius...

306
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,790
Anyway,

307
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:34,210
we've been through so many art teachers.

308
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:36,210
None of them lasts even a month.

309
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:40,680
And Da-song is just so hard to control.

310
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,680
-Just a moment. Madame.    -Yes?

311
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:49,380
Someone just came to mind.

312
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,420
What was her name?

313
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,680
Jessica! Right, Jessica...

314
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,160
She was in the same art school as my cousin.

315
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,700
What was her Korean name?

316
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,720
Anyway, after studying

317
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,550
applied arts at Illinois State University,

318
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,550
she returned to Korea

319
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,950
Illinois... tell me more.

320
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:14,740
Her teaching is unusual,

321
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:18,730
but she knows how to handle kids.

322
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:21,360
She's got a special reputation in her field.

323
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:24,640
But even though her methods are unique,

324
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,070
she can help kids get into good art schools.

325
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:29,660
Now I'm really curious.

326
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,350
What is she like?

327
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,350
Would you like to meet her?

328
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:36,220
Though I heard she's in high demand...

329
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:43,400
Hold on.

330
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,040
Jessica, only child, Illinois Chicago,

331
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,400
classmate Kim Jin-mo, he's your cousin.

332
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:03,220
Look at how he painted the side dishes on the tablecloth

333
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:05,820
in this mosaic arrangement.

334
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,300
But within that too, there are repeating patterns.

335
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,700
Gochujang is red, the rice... well, anyway,

336
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,350
he has a Basquiat-esque sense,

337
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,830
even at age 9!

338
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:18,540
How exciting.

339
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:23,890
I'm sure Miss Jessica must have already sensed this,

340
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:28,370
so I'll leave you two, and go up for Da-hye's lesson.

341
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,560
Have a nice lesson, Jessica.

342
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,480
Yes, thank you for the introduction.

343
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:42,000
So as you can see, Da-song's eccentric genius...

344
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,590
Da-hye.

345
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:49,220
So we'll start with #38?

346
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,870
Kevin.

347
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,180
Yeah?

348
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,260
Did you know that Da-song is faking it all?

349
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:04,130
Huh? What do you mean?

350
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,540
It's all a show.

351
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:10,400
Acting like a genius, that 4th dimension stuff is all fake.

352
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,630
An artist cosplay.

353
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,230
Da-song?

354
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:16,760
You know that thing,

355
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,210
when he freezes and

356
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:20,560
stares at the sky, as if struck by inspiration.

357
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:26,880
So he's walking along, then he stares at the clouds for 10 minutes.

358
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,130
So you know what I mean?

359
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:32,340
He gives me the creeps.

360
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,980
He pretends that he can't live a normal life.

361
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,000
Makes me want to puke.

362
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:40,510
So Da-song is pretending...

363
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:44,780
But what's that got to do with your studies?

364
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:53,060
Well, I'm just saying.

365
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,650
Sure, so in that sense,

366
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,690
what you told me about Da-song was very interesting,

367
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:04,600
so let's write about it in English.

368
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:11,370
And be sure to use the word 'pretend' at least twice.

369
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:15,460
Then, can I ask you a question?

370
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,610
Sure.

371
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:18,730
That teacher Jessica.

372
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:25,520
Is she really your cousin's classmate?

373
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,880
What do you mean?

374
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,300
She's your girlfriend, right?

375
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,880
No way... I just met her today.

376
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:45,910
Jessica's really pretty. isn't she?

377
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,300
Aren't you interested?

378
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,570
You saw her?

379
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,450
Sure, she's pretty. She's a beautiful woman.

380
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:57,430
Yeah.

381
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,340
I knew it.

382
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:05,040
So you are interested.

383
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,050
Da-hye...

384
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:18,930
So, if we can compare Jessica to a rose,

385
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,320
then you are...

386
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,080
-Let's study.    -Yes.

387
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:13,440
Please understand that my boy has trouble keeping still.

388
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,430
I understand.

389
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,080
Da-song!

390
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:18,590
Da-song, get up!

391
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,800
Come on, Da-song!

392
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,190
In your butt...

393
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:24,460
-Madame, please leave us.    -What?

394
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,470
I never teach with a parent in the room.

395
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:30,500
But today is our first day, and as you can see, he's...

396
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,560
Wait downstairs.

397
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,050
Park Da-song?

398
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:35,750
Da-song!

399
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,230
Madame?

400
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,190
Want some plum extract?

401
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:44,980
What?

402
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:48,230
It's mixed with honey. To ease your tension.

403
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,600
Yeah, that would be great.

404
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:07,050
-Hey.    -Yes?

405
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,270
I've got an idea.

406
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:12,670
Take two glasses of plum extract to Da-song's room.

407
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:15,770
You're not a parent, so you can go in!

408
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:17,390
Oh, that's right!

409
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:20,350
Then I'll report back on what's going on in there...

410
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,930
Why didn't I think of it earlier?

411
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,170
What?

412
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:27,520
They came out?

413
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,300
Yeah.

414
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,650
So you're done already?

415
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:39,760
Madame. Come sit next to me.

416
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,860
Da-song, go upstairs.

417
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,870
Hurry up!

418
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,760
Da-son just painted this.

419
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,920
I see...

420
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:01,370
I'd rather speak with Madame alone.

421
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,530
Oh, but she is...

422
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:05,040
No, leave us.

423
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:12,600
Madame, I told you

424
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,940
I study art psychology and art therapy?

425
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,080
Yes.

426
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:20,140
Did anything happen to Da-song in first grade?

427
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,890
To be frank,

428
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:29,240
before I decide whether to take on Da-song,

429
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,330
I need to hear about this.

430
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:36,310
But this is hard for me to talk about right now.

431
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,200
What to do?

432
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,670
Never mind, then.

433
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,420
The lower-right region of
a painting is called the "schizophrenia zone".

434
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:47,540
Psychotic symptoms often reveal themselves here.

435
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,120
Oh, phrenia...

436
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,190
Look here.

437
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:51,790
Da-song painted this unusual shape, right?

438
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:52,650
I see.

439
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:58,060
Over there, it's the same! It's the same, right?

440
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,500
Yes, that's correct.

441
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:02,310
A similar shape in the same zone.

442
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,530
You see it now?

443
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:04,950
Yes.

444
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:09,510
I've stared at that painting at every meal!

445
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,540
But I had no idea.

446
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:15,150
Calm down. Let's compose ourselves.

447
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:18,490
This is all a black box into Da-song's mind.

448
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,840
Would you like to open that box with me, Madame?

449
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,810
I want to open it.

450
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:30,440
Then we'll need 4 two-hour sessions per week,

451
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:34,730
and this is not simple tutoring, it's art therapy, right?

452
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:35,780
Of course.

453
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,950
Because of that my rate is set at a very high level.

454
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,300
Are you okay with that?

455
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,850
It's my pleasure.

456
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,010
Da-songs dad is home.

457
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:57,230
Honey, Da-song's new art teacher is here.

458
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:01,120
Her name's Jessica, from Illinois.

459
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,500
Jessica! This is Dong-ik.

460
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,420
-Hello.    -Hi.

461
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,700
Thanks for your help.

462
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,450
Class is over?

463
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,290
Yes, just finished.

464
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,410
-Driver Yoon.    -Yes?

465
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:14,100
-Are you free?    -Yes, I am.

466
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,810
Then give her a lift, okay?

467
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:21,360
Sure, we don't want her going down alone at night, right?

468
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,150
Of course.

469
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:23,920
Miss Jessica?

470
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:29,770
Shall I drive you all the way home, then?

471
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:35,060
-Which neighborhood?    -No. that's fine.

472
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:37,060
You can just drop me off at Hyehwa station.

473
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,680
Thank you.

474
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,160
I don't mind if it's far away.

475
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:43,650
-My shift is finished, anyway.    -I'll get off at Hyehwa.

476
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,460
Looks like it's going to rain.

477
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,500
Ride the Benz, not the subway!

478
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,700
I'm meeting my boyfriend at exit 3 of Hyehwa Station!

479
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,380
Yes.

480
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:35,830
Dad, when you worked as a driver, did you drive a lot of Benzes?

481
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:42,750
Benzes? Not then, but I did when I worked as a valet.

482
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,590
You worked as a valet?

483
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:48,970
Sure, after the chicken place went bust,

484
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:50,410
before the Taiwan cake shop,

485
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:52,210
in that 6-month window?

486
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:55,060
No, it was after the cake shop went bust.

487
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:00,470
We're moving to the next stage already?

488
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:05,150
I set a trap in the Benz.

489
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:07,150
Then we're diving right in.

490
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:08,720
Wow this is so metaphorical.

491
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:12,920
Look Dad, we're eating in a driver's cafeteria right now!

492
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:15,160
Right, a driver's cafeteria!

493
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,390
Eat as much as you want, kids.

494
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:21,170
You didn't even pay for it. they did!

495
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:24,300
Son, have some more. Eat up!

496
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,260
Yes, Dad.

497
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,470
Eat your fill!

498
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,780
What did you do to that woman yesterday?

499
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:29,500
What?

500
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,340
She was freaking out.

501
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,790
Saying she was so moved, you put her in shock.

502
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,190
Fuck. I don't know!

503
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:38,870
I googled "art therapy". and ad-libbed the rest.

504
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,370
Then suddenly she's weeping.

505
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,880
Crazy bitch, I couldn't believe it.

506
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:20,110
Oh, you're home?

507
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:22,110
Did you eat yet?

508
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:25,120
Is something wrong?

509
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,570
Is the housekeeper out?

510
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:27,610
She's walking the dogs.

511
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:29,790
Honey.

512
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,070
This was under my car seat.

513
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,370
Driver Yoon is such a scumbag.

514
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:39,760
What is this?

515
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,460
I'm sorry, honey.

516
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,610
I didn't know he was this kind of guy.

517
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:46,460
Don't you pay him well?

518
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:50,550
Is he saving up by not paying for a motel?

519
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,210
He must be a pervert.

520
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,340
He likes it in the car.

521
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:58,320
Oh, that's gross. In his boss' car!

522
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,730
A young guy's sex life is his own business, that's all fine.

523
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,970
But why in my car?

524
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,110
And if so, why not in his seat?

525
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:14,090
Why cross the line like that?

526
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:15,070
You're right.

527
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:19,170
Does dripping his sperm on my seat turn him on?

528
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,800
I can't believe this.

529
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,170
But you know what's strangest of all?

530
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,400
What?

531
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,480
Usually if you have car sex,

532
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:40,070
you might leave behind a strand of hair, or an earring.

533
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,070
Right.

534
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:45,100
But how can you forget your own panties?

535
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:49,520
That's right. It's hard to overlook.

536
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:54,260
So it makes me quite suspicious of this woman's condition.

537
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,340
You get me?

538
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:09,780
Oh my... meth or cocaine?

539
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,920
Shh! The kids...

540
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:12,160
What do we do?

541
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:15,420
What if anyone finds white powder in your car?

542
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,420
Calm down, relax.

543
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,420
Relax.

544
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,980
For now it's just supposition. A rational guess.

545
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:26,250
But no need to call the police.

546
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:27,290
Not that!

547
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:31,750
Still, for a busy man like me to ask,

548
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:34,530
"Why are you fucking in my car?"

549
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:35,750
Exactly.

550
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:36,770
So instead...

551
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:42,070
Can you just invent some bland excuse to let him go?

552
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,200
Okay sure.

553
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:47,110
No need to mention panties or car sex.

554
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,850
We don't need to stoop to that level, do we?

555
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:51,070
Surely not!

556
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,290
But what if he goes online and accuses us...

557
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:57,000
Just give him a good severance.

558
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:00,520
How was Da-song today?

559
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:02,520
He was fine.

560
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:05,280
-So class is finished?    -Yes.

561
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:08,760
Jessica, the last time you came,

562
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,230
our driver gave you a ride, right?

563
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,240
That's right.

564
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,040
This may be an odd question,

565
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:16,640
but nothing happened then?

566
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,090
No, he was very nice.

567
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:19,960
I told him to go to Hyehwa Station,

568
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,470
but he insisted on driving me home.

569
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:26,610
That jerk! He took you home late at night?

570
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:27,960
Revealing where you live?

571
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:30,960
No, I got off at Hyehwa.

572
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,720
Oh, good girl. Very good.

573
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,250
Jessica nice...

574
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:37,730
Did something happen with him?

575
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:43,210
He won't be working for us any more. A slightly shameful incident.

576
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:45,700
What incident?

577
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,270
Oh, you don't need to know.

578
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:53,940
But I'm surprised. He was so gentlemanly and cool.

579
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:57,380
Jessica, you're too young and innocent!

580
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,880
You have a lot to learn about people.

581
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:05,050
But we were excited to have such a young, hip driver, too.

582
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:08,420
But isn't an older driver better?

583
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:11,750
That's true. They drive better, have better manners.

584
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:15,320
My father's brother had a driver just like that.

585
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:19,900
Mr. Kim. He was so congenial and nice,

586
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:23,060
I used to call him Uncle when I was young.

587
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,510
You know a man like that?

588
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:27,030
Yes, he was so mild-mannered.

589
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,490
Oh, but my relatives relocated to Chicago.

590
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,740
I wonder if Mr. Kim's free now?

591
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:39,590
I'm really interested! Could I meet him?

592
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,900
Really?

593
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,680
I don't trust anyone now.

594
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,860
I only trust someone recommended by a person I know well.

595
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:50,370
But if you've known him so long,

596
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:52,050
I'd feel much more at ease.

597
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,200
Do you really want to meet him?

598
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:58,390
I'm deadly serious.

599
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:02,380
This chain of recommendations is best.

600
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,150
How should I describe it?

601
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:05,990
A belt of trust?

602
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,830
-This one's different.    -Here.

603
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:08,490
Oh, right.

604
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:09,550
And this one.

605
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,850
Looks like a touch screen now.

606
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:14,890
It's not touch, it says you have to turn it.

607
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:16,470
Wow, this thing?

608
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,160
Sir?

609
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,160
Taking our time, are we?

610
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,780
This is a nice car.

611
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:29,260
This is en it! Come over here.

612
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,200
He's in a meeting now.

613
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:41,520
Have a seat and wait here.

614
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,420
Hello, nice to meet...

615
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,490
But is it compatible with a phone?

616
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:04,590
Oh, not with a phone. You need more computing power.

617
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:10,050
This isn't any sort of test, so don't be nervous.

618
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,470
I was worn out at the office, so I came out for a bit.

619
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:15,990
I understand.

620
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:19,440
Constant chatter, all that bother.

621
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,950
At least the car is peaceful.

622
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,320
Thank you.

623
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:27,150
You seem to know the road well?

624
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:29,880
Anything below the 38th parallel.

625
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:33,800
After 30 years behind the wheel, the car almost drives itself.

626
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,250
I respect those who work in one field for a long time.

627
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:40,070
Well, to be honest this is a simple vocation.

628
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:42,860
But... the head of a household,

629
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,870
the leader of a company?

630
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:48,340
Or else just a lonely man

631
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,140
setting off on the road each morning...

632
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,870
It's companionship of a sort,

633
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:56,380
so that's how I've approached each day.

634
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,140
The years sure pass quickly.

635
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,890
Sure enough, your cornering is excellent.

636
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:11,020
Well, it may look simple, but it's one of the fundamentals.

637
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:16,050
She may look like a sheep, but inside, she's a fox.

638
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:19,440
Sometimes she acts like she owns the house.

639
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,440
Right.

640
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,360
Of all the people in that house, she's lived there the longest.

641
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:29,720
She was housekeeper to the architect Namgoong,

642
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:33,580
but then she went on to work for this family.

643
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,380
When the architect moved out,

644
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,840
he introduced this woman to Park's family,

645
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,640
telling them, "This is a great housekeeper, you should hire her."

646
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,170
So she survived a change of ownership.

647
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:48,730
She won't give up good job easily.

648
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,600
To extract a woman like that, we need to prepare well.

649
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:56,350
Right, we need a plan.

650
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:01,030
I want to eat peaches. I like peaches best.

651
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:03,460
Why not ask for some?

652
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:06,720
No peaches at our house. It's a forbidden fruit.

653
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:17,850
So according to what Da-hye told me,

654
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:20,490
she's got a massively serious allergy to peaches.

655
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:21,930
You know that fuzz on a peach's skin?

656
00:40:22,490 --> 00:40:25,470
If she's anywhere near it, she gets a full body rash,

657
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:32,920
has trouble breathing, asthma, a total meltdown!

658
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,940
No no, there weren't any peaches anywhere.

659
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,830
That's what I'm saying!

660
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:49,260
Usually when I get symptoms like this,

661
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:52,100
I run to my room and take my medicine,

662
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,750
but it was so sudden,

663
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:57,950
I wasn't sure where I left it.

664
00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:02,680
Madame, this woman behind me, is that?

665
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,240
Oh, it's our housekeeper!

666
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,240
So it's true. Oh, how sad.

667
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:10,270
I wasn't sure if that was really her.

668
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,350
I've only seen her a couple times in the living room.

669
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:17,420
This was in the hospital?

670
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:21,200
A few days ago I went for my annual medical exam.

671
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,120
I took a selfie for my wife,

672
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,670
and there she was behind me.

673
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,660
Is she talking on the phone there?

674
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:31,880
Anyway. I wasn't trying to eavesdrop...

675
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,880
I wasn't trying to eavesdrop...

676
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,800
but her words came through clearly!

677
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,630
-So I couldn't help but..    -Cut, cut!

678
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:40,640
Dad, your emotions are up to here.

679
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,640
Bring them down to about there.

680
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,000
...so I couldn't help but overhear.

681
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,560
Keep it focused!

682
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:53,450
What I'm trying to say is, it's just that,

683
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,350
your housekeeper's voice is quite loud, you know?

684
00:41:57,150 --> 00:42:00,060
I understand, it's all right. Just tell me, okay?

685
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:03,630
She said she got diagnosed with active TB,

686
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:06,220
and she was shouting on the phone,

687
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:08,870
so upset she could barely control herself!

688
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:11,340
Tuberculosis? Come on...

689
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:16,340
It's true, she phoned someone saying she had active TB.

690
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:19,220
Do people still get TB?

691
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:21,690
Do people still get TB?

692
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:22,740
Dad...

693
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:27,490
Back in the day, people used to buy Christmas Seals, right?

694
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:29,900
Feels like a bygone era.

695
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,560
But I saw it on the internet.

696
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:35,520
Korea has the #1 rate of TB of all the OECD countries.

697
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:39,140
But she's still working, as if nothing's wrong.

698
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,190
With a kid like Da-song in the house.

699
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:43,980
So you've got a young kid like Da-song in the house,

700
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:46,560
and a TB patient is doing dishes,

701
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,860
cooking, spraying spittle...

702
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,040
Stop it, please!

703
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,280
Dad: arriving in 3 mins.

704
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,730
If you get the chance, this'll be icing on the cake.

705
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:18,260
Madame

706
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:20,200
2nd floor sauna room.

707
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,200
Don't let anyone know

708
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:32,980
-Have a seat.    -Yes.

709
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:36,230
Mr. Kim.

710
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:40,080
Please don't tell any of this to my husband, okay?

711
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:41,930
Understood.

712
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:45,880
If he hears I brought a TB patient to our home,

713
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:49,580
I'll be hanged and quartered!

714
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:51,110
Don't worry, Madame.

715
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:54,640
And if I may presume to say one thing.

716
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:58,120
I have no feelings against that woman.

717
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:04,370
I felt I had to speak up for the sake of

718
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:06,080
public health and hygiene.

719
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:10,240
But this could be seen as snitching or...

720
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,720
Don't you worry.

721
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,430
I won't mention the TB.

722
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:16,110
I'll just make up some excuse to dismiss her.

723
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:17,890
Simply and quietly.

724
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:22,100
It's a proven method. That's the best.

725
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:24,230
Okay, then.

726
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:38,230
Have you... washed your hands?

727
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:25,240
Mr. Kim,

728
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:28,660
do you know a good braised ribs place?

729
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,430
Somewhere close by.

730
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:31,330
Sure.

731
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:35,190
-Then you'll be eating out?    -That's right.

732
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:39,480
Why such a craving for braised ribs today?

733
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:42,400
Our old housekeeper made delicious ribs.

734
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,190
The one who quit this week?

735
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:50,610
My wife wouldn't even tell me why she quit.

736
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:58,160
Sure, it's easy enough to hire a new one.

737
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:04,540
Still, it's a shame. She was a great housekeeper

738
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:05,510
I see.

739
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:08,110
She kept the house in great shape,

740
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:10,370
and she knew never to cross the line.

741
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:13,610
I can't stand people who cross the line.

742
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,990
Perhaps just one weak point?

743
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:19,800
Eating too much.

744
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,920
She always ate enough for two.

745
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:27,020
But considering all the work she did...

746
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:31,980
Then you better find someone new. A new housekeeper.

747
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:34,360
We're in trouble now.

748
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:38,830
In a week, our house will be a trash can.

749
00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:42,370
My clothes will start to smell.

750
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:46,940
My wife has no talent for housework.

751
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,010
She's bad at cleaning, and her cooking's awful.

752
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:53,070
Still, you love her, right?

753
00:48:01,350 --> 00:48:04,300
Of course. I love her.

754
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:06,910
We'll call it love.

755
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,710
Then would this help?

756
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:17,680
The Care? What is this?

757
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,040
I just recently found out about them.

758
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:24,550
How to describe it? It's like a membership service.

759
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:27,880
The company provides veteran-grade

760
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:32,080
help to VIP customers such as you.

761
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:38,090
For example maids, caregivers. or drivers like myself.

762
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,080
You can tell from the card they're high-class.

763
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:43,020
Cool design.

764
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,810
Then how do you know about this company?

765
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:50,750
They contacted me as a veteran-grade driver.

766
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,170
You might say they scouted me?

767
00:48:54,970 --> 00:49:00,990
But when their call came I had already arranged to meet with you.

768
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,000
I see...

769
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:07,940
You turned down this famous company to work for me.

770
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:10,220
I won't forget that.

771
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:13,260
Son of a bitch!

772
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:20,250
Anyway, I can give this card to my wife, right?

773
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:22,090
Yes, that's why I brought it up.

774
00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:23,990
No need to mention me.

775
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:28,690
You can tell her you found the company yourself.

776
00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:30,510
Sure.

777
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:33,410
Thanks to you I can play the good husband.

778
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:37,490
On the back, there's a number for consultations.

779
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:39,470
Tell her to call there...

780
00:49:39,470 --> 00:49:40,660
Eyes on the road!

781
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:48,840
Hello, this is Senior Advisor Yeo of The Care.

782
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:52,720
Yes, this is The Care's main office?

783
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:53,730
Yes.

784
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:57,270
If she wanted, she'd be a fucking great con artist.

785
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:59,220
Isn't her voice tone great? Takes after me.

786
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:04,030
From what I've heard, it's a full membership service?

787
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:08,010
So you're not currently a member, I assume?

788
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:10,590
That's right, What steps do I need to take?

789
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:14,820
We'll just need to receive a few documents from you.

790
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:17,430
Are you ready to write this down?

791
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:22,310
Your family register, citizenship ID cards...

792
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:26,040
documents to prove your income level,

793
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:29,010
i.e the title to your property, etc.

794
00:50:29,010 --> 00:50:30,980
-Our property title?    -Yes.

795
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:41,480
Wow, peaches!

796
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:42,960
You have some too, Mr. Kevin.

797
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:44,790
Thank you.

798
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:56,510
Leave it outside the door next time.

799
00:50:56,510 --> 00:50:58,320
-And knock!    -Yes.

800
00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:03,090
No entering during my lesson!

801
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:04,030
Yes, miss!

802
00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:08,140
Park Da-song!

803
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:09,400
Daddy!

804
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,610
Where are you?

805
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:16,600
Daddy!

806
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:17,690
Son!

807
00:51:17,690 --> 00:51:18,810
Walkie talkies!

808
00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:20,410
Walkie talkies!

809
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:21,460
Walkie talkies!

810
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:23,680
Who do you like better, your dad or the walkie talkie?

811
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:27,850
Da-song, how could you run out from your lesson?

812
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:31,830
When did you buy all this?

813
00:51:31,830 --> 00:51:33,170
It's no big deal.

814
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:33,910
Huh?

815
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:37,840
Huh?

816
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:40,000
What is it?

817
00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:44,340
What's he doing now?

818
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:46,830
Da-song, don't do that!

819
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:50,110
It's the same! They smell the same!

820
00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:53,620
What are you talking about? Go up to Jessica.

821
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,840
Jessica smells like that, too.

822
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:02,930
So do we all need to use different soap, now?

823
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:06,870
Dad, we'll need to use different laundry soap, too.

824
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:07,730
And fabric softener.

825
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:11,140
You mean doing four separate loads of laundry each time?

826
00:52:12,490 --> 00:52:13,970
That's not it.

827
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,970
It's the semi-basement smell.

828
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:20,220
We need to leave this home to lose the smell.

829
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:28,830
Anyway, aren't we fortunate to be worrying about things like this?

830
00:52:28,830 --> 00:52:29,940
Sure.

831
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:32,440
In an age like ours,

832
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:37,410
when an opening for a security
guard attracts 500 university graduates.

833
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:41,010
Our entire family got hired!

834
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:42,940
That's right, Dad!

835
00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:46,540
If we put our 4 salaries together?

836
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:50,380
The amount of cash coming from that house into ours is immense!

837
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:54,900
Let's offer a prayer of gratitude to the great Mr. Park.

838
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:56,800
And to Min!

839
00:52:57,270 --> 00:52:59,430
Ki-woo, that friend of yours turned into such a fine guy,

840
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:01,640
and thanks to him we're all...

841
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:02,870
Fuck, not again!

842
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:04,280
That asshole's dead.

843
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,700
Ki-woo's on the rampage!

844
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:13,990
Don't overdo it!

845
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:18,910
Use this instead.

846
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:20,930
Damn you!

847
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:27,880
Get a fucking grip!

848
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,080
Get a grip!

849
00:53:32,030 --> 00:53:32,980
Wow!

850
00:53:37,570 --> 00:53:39,360
It's a deluge!

851
00:53:56,070 --> 00:54:00,540
Current weather is clear, over. The clouds are moving.

852
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:02,980
But they're not rain clouds, over.

853
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:04,490
I hear you, over.

854
00:54:04,490 --> 00:54:08,370
Currently your sister's lip is pouting

855
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,300
like a duck's bill.

856
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:13,250
She's super annoyed, over.

857
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:16,690
Can't I stay home and study English?

858
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:18,430
And call Kevin?

859
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:22,260
Hey! Don't make a scene just as we're leaving.

860
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:24,710
If we have to go, let's have fun.

861
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:27,560
Da-hye, this is no ordinary camping trip.

862
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:28,280
That's right!

863
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:30,480
How could you miss your brother's birthday?

864
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:31,220
No way!

865
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:33,070
Even your busy father is taking time off to go.

866
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:36,120
Right! If you don't go, you'll regret it!

867
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:41,040
Oh, right. You know the beam projector?

868
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,350
The outdoor theater?

869
00:54:42,350 --> 00:54:44,060
Right, bring the outdoor beam projector.

870
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:44,850
Yes.

871
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:48,590
And look for Da-song's camping raincoat.

872
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:50,910
He loves it when it rains.

873
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:55,500
You remember now? Zoonie, Berry, and Fofoo.

874
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,800
Zoome and Berry get this.

875
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:59,740
Yes, Natural Balance Original Ultra.

876
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:01,760
Right, and for Foofoo...

877
00:55:02,370 --> 00:55:04,510
Kam-kamaboko. Japanese crab sticks.

878
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:05,160
Yes.

879
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:08,060
When you walk Zoonie, give him a long leash.

880
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:11,180
He needs to run around to feel happy.

881
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:13,740
He's like the canine version of Da-song!

882
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:41,010
Son!

883
00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:44,160
Why are you lying down outside?

884
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:46,930
Isn't he hot out there?

885
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:52,220
I'm gazing at the sky from home.

886
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:55,380
It's so great.

887
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:01,630
Mom, want some water?

888
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:02,950
There's sparkling, right?

889
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:05,610
Ki-jung, some water?

890
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:07,220
Telepathy... thank you.

891
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:31,380
Whoa.

892
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:36,300
Wow, all these varieties or alcohol.

893
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:41,120
Dad! Let me add another to the mix!

894
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:45,250
This is pretty classy.

895
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:49,700
Rain falling on the lawn, as we sip our whiskey...

896
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:55,860
Ki-woo, what's that yellow notebook you've been carrying?

897
00:56:57,020 --> 00:57:00,120
This? It's Da-hye's diary.

898
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,120
Her diary?

899
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:06,090
What a scumbag. How could you read her diary?

900
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:12,300
Just so we can understand each other deeper.

901
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:14,580
Fuck, are you two dating?

902
00:57:15,190 --> 00:57:19,190
I'm serious. She really likes me too.

903
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:22,210
Awhile back...

904
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:24,800
Never mind.

905
00:57:26,050 --> 00:57:28,540
When she enters university. I'll officially ask her out.

906
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:30,210
Seriously.

907
00:57:35,270 --> 00:57:36,720
My son!

908
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:41,480
Then this house will be your in-laws' house?

909
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:45,490
That's right.

910
00:57:46,790 --> 00:57:49,490
Fuck, then I'm washing dishes at my daughter-in-law's?

911
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:52,570
Sure, washing your daughter-in-law's socks!

912
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:09,440
I like her. She's a good kid.

913
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:14,160
She's pretty, but she's not wild.

914
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:19,180
Well, now that we're daydreaming...

915
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:22,730
If Da-hye and I marry,

916
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:27,000
we can bring in actors to be my mom and dad.

917
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,000
Look at her.

918
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:32,710
She got so many jobs acting in weddings last year.

919
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:37,250
even caught the bouquet from a bitch I've never met.

920
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,960
If you get the bouquet, they pay an extra $10.

921
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,120
That's how your acting got so good!

922
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:46,310
Acting is one thing,

923
00:58:46,310 --> 00:58:48,770
but this family is so gullible, right?

924
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:51,000
The madame especially.

925
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,370
You said it.

926
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:57,220
She's so naive, and nice.

927
00:58:58,170 --> 00:59:00,240
She's rich, but still nice.

928
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,640
Not "rich, but still nice."

929
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:05,970
"Nice because she's rich." You know?

930
00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:13,150
Hell, if I had all this money.

931
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:18,130
I'd be nice too!

932
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:19,380
Even nicer!

933
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,400
That's true. Your mom's right.

934
00:59:22,830 --> 00:59:25,240
Rich people are naive. No resentments.

935
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:27,700
No creases on them.

936
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:30,460
It all gets ironed out. Money is an iron.

937
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:33,690
Those creases all get smoothed out.

938
00:59:33,690 --> 00:59:34,740
Hey, Ki-woo.

939
00:59:35,850 --> 00:59:40,250
You know that driver, Yoon? Was it Yoon?

940
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:43,790
The driver before me.

941
00:59:43,790 --> 00:59:45,050
Yeah, Yoon.

942
00:59:45,050 --> 00:59:49,690
He must be working somewhere else now, right?

943
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:52,160
Sure, he must be.

944
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:55,080
He's young, got a nice physique.

945
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,930
He must've found a better job.

946
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:00,930
Fucking hell!

947
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:04,040
What's with her now?

948
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:10,500
We're the ones who need help. Worry about us, okay?

949
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:14,310
Dad! Come on, Dad!

950
01:00:14,730 --> 01:00:19,210
Just focus on us, okay? On us!

951
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:23,640
Not Driver Yoon, but me, please.

952
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:25,650
Awesome timing, huh?

953
01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:29,670
She speaks, and the lightning crashes!

954
01:00:32,490 --> 01:00:34,030
Hey, Jessica. Cheers.

955
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:41,300
Hey, when I went up before, and you were in the bath...

956
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:42,690
What about it?

957
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:46,710
How to put it? You fit in here.

958
01:00:47,330 --> 01:00:50,280
This rich house suits you. Not like us.

959
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:51,180
Fuck off.

960
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:52,160
I'm serious!

961
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,990
Dad, before...

962
01:00:53,990 --> 01:00:56,230
She was lying back in the tub, watching TV.

963
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:59,200
Like she's lived here for years.

964
01:01:01,570 --> 01:01:02,940
Speaking of which,

965
01:01:04,110 --> 01:01:07,470
if this became our house,

966
01:01:07,470 --> 01:01:11,370
if we lived here, which room would you want?

967
01:01:11,830 --> 01:01:16,630
What room in this masterwork by the great Namgoong?

968
01:01:17,110 --> 01:01:19,090
Fuck, I don't know.

969
01:01:19,090 --> 01:01:22,120
Get me the house first. Then I'll think about it.

970
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:25,030
We live here now, don't we?

971
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:29,300
Getting drunk in the living room.

972
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:32,890
Right, we live here. Why not?

973
01:01:32,890 --> 01:01:37,390
This is our home right now. It's cosy.

974
01:01:37,390 --> 01:01:40,160
Cosy? Are you feeling cosy?

975
01:01:40,750 --> 01:01:45,690
Sure, but suppose Park walked through that door now.

976
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:47,690
What about your dad?

977
01:01:47,690 --> 01:01:50,720
He'd run and hide like a cockroach.

978
01:01:51,590 --> 01:01:54,780
Kids, you know at our house,

979
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:59,440
when you turn on the light, and the cockroaches scatter?

980
01:01:59,890 --> 01:02:01,900
You know what I mean?

981
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:05,130
I'm getting fucking tired of this.

982
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,750
-A cockroach?    -Yeah.

983
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:11,760
Huh? What's wrong?

984
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:13,420
What's the matter?

985
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:18,260
Dad, don't do that. You only live once.

986
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:27,470
What the hell?

987
01:02:27,470 --> 01:02:29,510
I fooled you! Didn't I?

988
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:30,890
Jesus, Dad.

989
01:02:30,890 --> 01:02:32,880
I fooled you too, Ki-woo?

990
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:35,130
Did it look for real?

991
01:02:35,130 --> 01:02:37,890
If it was for real, I'd fucking kill you.

992
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:40,070
What is this? Fucking puppy.

993
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,540
Who is it at this hour'?

994
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,510
What is it?

995
01:02:58,890 --> 01:03:00,430
What's she doing here?

996
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:02,690
The old housekeeper?

997
01:03:03,410 --> 01:03:04,640
What's she here for?

998
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:09,980
She won't stop ringing it.

999
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:13,030
Raising a racket.

1000
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:15,930
Who is it?

1001
01:03:17,390 --> 01:03:20,250
Oh, hello! I'm...

1002
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:22,480
The madame's not in, right?

1003
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:23,590
What?

1004
01:03:23,590 --> 01:03:27,630
I worked here for a very long time.

1005
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:33,870
Above the monitor there, you see a photo of 3 dogs, right?

1006
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:35,830
Zoome, Berry, Foofoo.

1007
01:03:35,830 --> 01:03:40,160
I get it, but why are you here?

1008
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:44,650
You're my successor as housekeeper, right?

1009
01:03:50,050 --> 01:03:51,300
Anyway...

1010
01:03:52,530 --> 01:03:55,250
I'm very sorry to call on you so late.

1011
01:03:55,910 --> 01:03:57,250
It's just that...

1012
01:03:57,970 --> 01:04:04,700
I forgot something in the basement under the kitchen.

1013
01:04:05,490 --> 01:04:11,250
When I left, they pushed me out so quickly...

1014
01:04:15,110 --> 01:04:16,690
Would you let me in?

1015
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:20,560
What do we do?

1016
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:23,650
This isn't in the plan.

1017
01:04:31,590 --> 01:04:33,030
Sorry for the trouble.

1018
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:35,100
This way.

1019
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:36,700
Yes, thank you.

1020
01:04:39,390 --> 01:04:40,750
You can put your raincoat...

1021
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:42,990
It'll just be a second.

1022
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:47,630
Quite a meal there. That'll be a job to clean up.

1023
01:04:47,630 --> 01:04:50,640
But what did you leave below?

1024
01:04:55,510 --> 01:04:57,160
Want to come down with me?

1025
01:04:59,030 --> 01:05:01,830
Well, just go ahead.

1026
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:59,200
Help me push this!

1027
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:02,180
Pull it! From over there.

1028
01:06:02,210 --> 01:06:03,230
What?

1029
01:06:03,310 --> 01:06:04,480
Pull!

1030
01:06:06,790 --> 01:06:08,440
Pull it hard!

1031
01:06:12,230 --> 01:06:13,520
Are you okay?

1032
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:16,870
Did I scare you?

1033
01:06:18,910 --> 01:06:20,640
Thank you!

1034
01:06:21,550 --> 01:06:22,790
Thank you.

1035
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:32,180
Honey!

1036
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:33,410
What the hell?

1037
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:36,220
Hey!

1038
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:37,510
Honey!

1039
01:06:38,580 --> 01:06:39,990
Honey!

1040
01:06:42,590 --> 01:06:43,830
Wait!

1041
01:06:43,830 --> 01:06:45,960
Honey, I'm here!

1042
01:06:46,030 --> 01:06:47,330
What is all this?

1043
01:06:49,870 --> 01:06:50,970
Honey!

1044
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,890
Honey, I'm fine.

1045
01:06:52,990 --> 01:06:54,750
No you're not!

1046
01:06:54,850 --> 01:06:55,850
I'm fine, really.

1047
01:06:55,950 --> 01:06:57,190
How can you say that?

1048
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:59,300
But I'm really hungry.

1049
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:00,320
Suck it!

1050
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:01,840
How many days has it been?

1051
01:07:02,430 --> 01:07:04,940
You must've been so hungry!

1052
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:08,790
It's okay.

1053
01:07:08,790 --> 01:07:11,630
She's a nice woman. She let me in.

1054
01:07:11,630 --> 01:07:13,020
There was an iron plate, for grilling meat.

1055
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:15,390
It was wedged under the shelf.

1056
01:07:15,390 --> 01:07:16,500
So that's why.

1057
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:19,470
I couldn't open it from the inside.

1058
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:21,510
What's going on here?

1059
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:22,960
I know you must be startled.

1060
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:26,110
I would be too in this situation.

1061
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:31,030
But as two fellow workers... Right, Chung-sook?

1062
01:07:32,350 --> 01:07:34,320
How do you know my name?

1063
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:38,480
To be honest I'm still texting with the boy Da-song.

1064
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:41,030
I knew they were going camping,

1065
01:07:41,530 --> 01:07:43,850
so I came today.

1066
01:07:43,850 --> 01:07:46,140
I wanted to speak to you alone.

1067
01:07:46,770 --> 01:07:48,140
Talking about.

1068
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:52,450
Don't worry, Chung-sook.

1069
01:07:54,450 --> 01:07:56,020
I cut the wire on the CCTV by the gate.

1070
01:07:56,720 --> 01:08:00,460
Nobody knows I came. Isn't that good, sis?

1071
01:08:01,170 --> 01:08:02,580
Don't call me sis!

1072
01:08:02,580 --> 01:08:05,180
Sis, my name is Moon-gwang.

1073
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:10,230
This is my hubbie Oh Geun-sae. Say hello, honey.

1074
01:08:10,230 --> 01:08:13,900
This tastes great. What happened to your face?

1075
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:16,380
I'll tell you later.

1076
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:21,090
So you'd steal food every day while working in the kitchen.

1077
01:08:21,090 --> 01:08:22,230
Feeding your husband.

1078
01:08:22,230 --> 01:08:27,190
Not at all! I bought all his food with my salary.

1079
01:08:27,190 --> 01:08:30,140
That's so unfair!

1080
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:32,850
But how long has your husband been down here?

1081
01:08:32,850 --> 01:08:34,850
Hold on a sec. 4 years?

1082
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:39,070
4 years, 3 months and 17 days.

1083
01:08:39,070 --> 01:08:40,360
Right, it's June now.

1084
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:46,880
Four years ago when Mr. Namgoong moved to Paris,

1085
01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:50,160
in the time before Mr. Park's family moved in,

1086
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:54,150
I brought my husband down here.

1087
01:08:54,150 --> 01:08:58,770
Many rich houses have secret bunkers, where you can hide

1088
01:08:59,330 --> 01:09:02,240
in case North Korea attacks,

1089
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:04,070
or if creditors break in.

1090
01:09:04,070 --> 01:09:08,820
But it seems Mr. Namgoong was a bit embarrassed about this,

1091
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:13,250
because he never mentioned it to Mr. Park's family.

1092
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:15,910
So only I know about it.

1093
01:09:15,910 --> 01:09:17,690
So that's how it happened.

1094
01:09:18,310 --> 01:09:20,710
But now that I know,

1095
01:09:20,710 --> 01:09:22,900
I've no choice but to call the police!

1096
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:24,350
No please, sis!

1097
01:09:25,590 --> 01:09:27,870
As fellow members of the needy, please don't.

1098
01:09:27,870 --> 01:09:29,870
I'm not needy!

1099
01:09:29,870 --> 01:09:33,330
But we're needy!

1100
01:09:33,330 --> 01:09:37,240
We've no house, no money, only debts!

1101
01:09:37,970 --> 01:09:39,150
Sis, please!

1102
01:09:39,150 --> 01:09:43,650
Even after 4 years of hiding, those debt collectors won't give up.

1103
01:09:43,650 --> 01:09:48,020
They're still searching for him, threatening to stab him.

1104
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:49,340
You used loan sharks?

1105
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:52,130
It's all my fault.

1106
01:09:52,890 --> 01:09:56,630
The Taiwan cake shop.

1107
01:09:56,630 --> 01:09:58,990
My Taiwanese Wangshui castella shop went bust.

1108
01:09:58,990 --> 01:10:00,760
I was overwhelmed by debt.

1109
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:02,470
Please take this.

1110
01:10:03,180 --> 01:10:04,170
What's that?

1111
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:08,990
It's not much, just a modest sum.

1112
01:10:08,990 --> 01:10:11,310
But we'll send it to you every month.

1113
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:14,090
In return, just once every 2 days.

1114
01:10:14,090 --> 01:10:16,840
please leave him some food.

1115
01:10:17,830 --> 01:10:21,340
No no, just once a week.

1116
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:23,660
There's a refrigerator here. Just once a week.

1117
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:26,820
You've got some nerve! I'm calling the police.

1118
01:10:26,820 --> 01:10:28,210
Sis!

1119
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:31,210
Who is that?

1120
01:10:34,620 --> 01:10:36,060
Wait... Jessica?

1121
01:10:37,190 --> 01:10:38,390
Mr. Kim?

1122
01:10:38,390 --> 01:10:39,470
What the hell?

1123
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:42,710
Dad, my ankle!

1124
01:10:42,710 --> 01:10:43,820
You okay? Sorry.

1125
01:10:43,820 --> 01:10:45,750
Dad, my foot.

1126
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:47,750
Don't call me Dad!

1127
01:10:54,310 --> 01:10:57,990
I thought it was weird when the driver was fired.

1128
01:10:59,120 --> 01:10:59,910
Hey.

1129
01:10:59,910 --> 01:11:02,380
-Let's talk things over.    -What the hell?

1130
01:11:02,380 --> 01:11:03,760
Are you some family of charlatans?

1131
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:04,710
So, sis...

1132
01:11:04,710 --> 01:11:06,740
Don't fucking call me sis, you filthy bitch!

1133
01:11:07,470 --> 01:11:12,720
I'm gonna send this video to the madame, how about that?

1134
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:14,720
Dad, my foot.

1135
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:16,780
No reception in the basement, right?

1136
01:11:17,630 --> 01:11:19,630
-The phone works fine.    -Fuck.

1137
01:11:19,630 --> 01:11:24,390
Ma'am, to be honest, the jobs we have here...

1138
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:27,510
Shut up! It's too late now!

1139
01:11:27,510 --> 01:11:29,510
Let's all go to jail!

1140
01:11:29,510 --> 01:11:30,870
We're fucking going down!

1141
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:33,660
Lady, are you crazy?

1142
01:11:34,630 --> 01:11:39,360
If they see that video, Mr. Park and his wife will be so shocked!

1143
01:11:39,950 --> 01:11:42,560
What did those nice people ever do wrong?

1144
01:11:43,910 --> 01:11:44,940
Why do this to them?

1145
01:11:44,940 --> 01:11:45,960
Stop right there!

1146
01:11:46,590 --> 01:11:48,440
Or I'll push the 'send' button.

1147
01:11:49,030 --> 01:11:50,020
Follow me.

1148
01:11:51,230 --> 01:11:53,590
Calm down, ma'am.

1149
01:11:54,670 --> 01:11:56,310
Don't push!

1150
01:12:00,430 --> 01:12:01,930
Let's go up, honey.

1151
01:12:02,470 --> 01:12:05,350
Time for you to get some fresh air!

1152
01:12:22,510 --> 01:12:28,120
Honey, this 'send' button is like a missile launcher.

1153
01:12:29,070 --> 01:12:31,230
What do you mean, honey?

1154
01:12:31,230 --> 01:12:36,760
If we threaten to push it. those people can't do anything.

1155
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:41,040
It's like a North Korean rocket. A North Korean missile button!

1156
01:12:42,550 --> 01:12:46,500
Today our beloved Great Leader Kim Jong-un,

1157
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:49,550
after witnessing the charlatan family video,

1158
01:12:49,550 --> 01:12:52,350
was unable to contain his shock and fury

1159
01:12:52,350 --> 01:12:55,620
at their wicked, despicable provocation!

1160
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:57,560
I've missed your jokes, honey!

1161
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:59,400
Therefore our Great Leader,

1162
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:02,220
in this age of denuclearization,

1163
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:08,160
has commanded that the nation's last remaining nuclear warhead

1164
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:10,710
be driven down the throats of this wicked family!

1165
01:13:10,710 --> 01:13:15,440
No one can imitate North Korean news anchors like you!

1166
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:18,940
With their stinking guts serving as the last nuclear graveyard,

1167
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:25,620
our Dear Leaders wish to denuclearize and bring world peace can...

1168
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:26,920
Hands in the air, fuckers!

1169
01:13:27,790 --> 01:13:28,920
Higher!

1170
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:33,270
You scumbag family.

1171
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:34,680
Husband?

1172
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:35,420
Husband.

1173
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:36,380
Wife?

1174
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:37,260
Yes.

1175
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:38,430
Son?

1176
01:13:38,430 --> 01:13:38,980
Yes.

1177
01:13:38,980 --> 01:13:39,700
Daughter?

1178
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:40,360
Yes.

1179
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:42,460
You neanderthals.

1180
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:46,020
Is that all you can think to do, drink yourselves stupid?

1181
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:51,460
In this home suffused with Mr. Namgoong's creative spirit?

1182
01:13:52,150 --> 01:13:53,350
You cretins!

1183
01:13:53,350 --> 01:13:54,840
What do you know about art?

1184
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:56,840
What would they know?

1185
01:13:57,750 --> 01:14:00,360
When the sun was nice,

1186
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:04,750
we'd bask in those sunbeam, right?

1187
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:10,390
At such moments we could feel his artistic touch.

1188
01:15:20,950 --> 01:15:22,080
Give it to me!

1189
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:25,430
Good job! Delete it!

1190
01:15:25,430 --> 01:15:29,040
Careful, don't send it by accident.

1191
01:15:43,070 --> 01:15:44,020
Hello?

1192
01:15:44,950 --> 01:15:47,940
Listen, do you know how to make ram-don?

1193
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:50,260
Ram-don?

1194
01:15:50,260 --> 01:15:53,320
Da-song likes ram-don more than anything.

1195
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:57,880
If you boil the water now, the timing will be perfect.

1196
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:00,720
There's sirloin in the fridge, add that too.

1197
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:03,000
Then, the camping...?

1198
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,280
My god, what a disaster.

1199
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:11,960
The river overflowed and everyone was packing their tents,

1200
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:15,140
but Da-song was crying and refusing to go home.

1201
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:18,670
Anyway, ram-don as soon as we walk in, okay?

1202
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:21,960
Then you're almost here?

1203
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:24,880
8 minutes, according to the GPS.

1204
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:26,000
You arrive in 8 minutes...

1205
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,280
Start boiling the water right away!

1206
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:34,950
What the hell is ram-don?

1207
01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:45,870
Move, quickly!

1208
01:16:47,230 --> 01:16:49,390
Hurry!

1209
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:57,220
Ramen/Udon.

1210
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:02,160
Dad, I can't drag her any further!

1211
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:15,110
What are you doing?

1212
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:18,190
Dad!

1213
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:24,230
Go up quickly! Help upstairs.

1214
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:33,540
Take this!

1215
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:54,030
Welcome home!

1216
01:17:54,030 --> 01:17:57,120
Da-song, look! Let's eat ram-don!

1217
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:00,760
Da-song!

1218
01:18:04,390 --> 01:18:05,960
Da-song!

1219
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:08,320
Madame!

1220
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:34,150
Why don't you just eat the ram-don?

1221
01:18:34,150 --> 01:18:35,020
Shall I?

1222
01:18:35,020 --> 01:18:38,230
No, wait. I can give it to my husband.

1223
01:18:38,230 --> 01:18:39,830
There's sirloin in here.

1224
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:45,830
It's cooked through? Medium well done.

1225
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:15,950
Returning after a day's work... I love you so much, Mr. Park!

1226
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:23,460
Home from the office, Mr. Park is off duty now.

1227
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:30,150
Returning after a day's work... I love you so much, Mr. Park!

1228
01:19:30,150 --> 01:19:31,980
-What are you doing?    -Shut up!

1229
01:19:43,710 --> 01:19:46,360
Honey, do you want some ram-don?

1230
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:47,460
Da-song doesn't want it?

1231
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:48,180
No.

1232
01:19:48,180 --> 01:19:50,480
No, I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

1233
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:53,160
Why are you staring?

1234
01:19:54,460 --> 01:19:58,080
Mr. Park, you feed me and house me.

1235
01:19:58,080 --> 01:19:59,920
Respect!

1236
01:20:01,510 --> 01:20:03,080
You do this every day?

1237
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:08,760
Sure, I even send whole sentences to thank him.

1238
01:20:10,070 --> 01:20:12,040
Someone of your age should know it.

1239
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:13,070
Know what?

1240
01:20:13,070 --> 01:20:14,310
Morse Code.

1241
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:18,820
That sensor's going batty.

1242
01:20:27,550 --> 01:20:31,120
Da-song will know it, since he's a Scout.

1243
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:32,980
It's ridiculous, right?

1244
01:20:32,980 --> 01:20:35,950
Running around. trying to please a kid.

1245
01:20:36,550 --> 01:20:38,150
He's not some kind of prince.

1246
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:41,070
He's the youngest. It's common.

1247
01:20:42,430 --> 01:20:43,710
Please understand.

1248
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:47,540
Da-song's a bit... unwell.

1249
01:20:48,540 --> 01:20:51,150
He's receiving trauma therapy and art therapy.

1250
01:20:52,460 --> 01:20:54,550
There was an incident.

1251
01:20:54,550 --> 01:20:55,760
What incident?

1252
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:59,100
Sis, you believe in ghosts, too?

1253
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:04,560
Da-song saw a ghost in the house when he was in 1st grade.

1254
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:14,320
He had a birthday party at home that day.

1255
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:16,900
Late that night, when everyone was sleeping,

1256
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:21,560
Da-song crept down to the kitchen and took the cake out.

1257
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:24,430
The whipped cream on that cake was amazing.

1258
01:21:24,430 --> 01:21:26,840
Even in bed, he couldn't stop thinking about it.

1259
01:21:27,870 --> 01:21:32,960
So Da-song was sitting, eating his cake...

1260
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:45,760
He screamed, and I ran downstairs,

1261
01:21:46,540 --> 01:21:48,070
and he was all...

1262
01:21:49,060 --> 01:21:53,960
his eyes rolled back in his head, convulsions, foam in his mouth.

1263
01:21:56,340 --> 01:21:58,740
Have you ever seen a child have a seizure?

1264
01:21:58,740 --> 01:21:59,640
No.

1265
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:04,270
They need 15-minute treatment, or they're done for.

1266
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:08,560
That's the time you have to reach an emergency room, 15 minutes.

1267
01:22:10,420 --> 01:22:15,960
How can you live in a place like this?

1268
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:19,340
Well, lots of people live underground.

1269
01:22:19,340 --> 01:22:21,270
Especially if you count semi-basements.

1270
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:25,350
What'll you do? You don't have a plan?

1271
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:29,180
I just feel comfortable here.

1272
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:33,630
It feels like I was born here.

1273
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:37,300
Maybe I had my wedding here, too.

1274
01:22:38,060 --> 01:22:40,910
As for the National Pension, I don't qualify.

1275
01:22:42,550 --> 01:22:45,550
In my old age, love will comfort me.

1276
01:22:47,620 --> 01:22:52,390
So please. Let me live down here.

1277
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:55,660
Anyway...

1278
01:22:56,910 --> 01:23:01,860
My husband was away on business, so I had to deal with it all.

1279
01:23:02,620 --> 01:23:07,030
Since then we've always gone out for his birthday.

1280
01:23:07,060 --> 01:23:10,190
Last year my mother's house, this year, camping.

1281
01:23:10,190 --> 01:23:15,160
Da-song's dad says it's just a part of growing up.

1282
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:19,020
They say a ghost in the house brings wealth.

1283
01:23:21,150 --> 01:23:25,340
Actually, the money's been good recently.

1284
01:23:52,700 --> 01:23:54,600
Thank god.

1285
01:24:21,100 --> 01:24:23,480
Just stay here for now.

1286
01:24:34,750 --> 01:24:36,660
Zoonie, what's wrong?

1287
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:40,520
Something under there?

1288
01:24:41,950 --> 01:24:43,630
What is it?

1289
01:24:44,340 --> 01:24:45,630
Damn it!

1290
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:48,720
-Mom!    -Yeah?

1291
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:51,190
-How could you?    -What?

1292
01:24:51,190 --> 01:24:52,800
I like ram-don too!

1293
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:54,940
How could you not even ask me?

1294
01:24:54,940 --> 01:24:55,640
Well...

1295
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:58,760
Da-song didn't want it, so you asked Dad,

1296
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:00,360
then ate it yourself.

1297
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:02,340
Want her to make one?

1298
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:04,160
That's not the point!

1299
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:07,140
-Stop fighting over ramen!    -Why didn't you ask me?

1300
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:08,830
Oh, stop it! Just go to bed Go get changed.

1301
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:10,830
This way!

1302
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:18,340
Ki-jung?

1303
01:25:18,340 --> 01:25:19,680
Under there! Hurry!

1304
01:25:22,780 --> 01:25:27,140
One, two, three! One two three!

1305
01:25:27,140 --> 01:25:29,350
Da-song?

1306
01:25:29,350 --> 01:25:31,020
Da-song, cut it out!

1307
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:34,560
He's gone crazy! Get an umbrella.

1308
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:36,160
Hey Park Da-song!

1309
01:25:37,580 --> 01:25:41,350
What a monster. What the hell is he doing?

1310
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:47,040
Da-song, it's time for bed! You know how late it is?

1311
01:25:47,050 --> 01:25:48,240
Here.

1312
01:25:48,340 --> 01:25:49,710
Honey, here.

1313
01:25:53,260 --> 01:25:58,640
Who do you take after to be so stubborn! Look at this rain!

1314
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:07,820
OMG Kevin. Da-song camping in the yard.

1315
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:14,790
Hey, channel 3 for emergencies!

1316
01:26:14,790 --> 01:26:16,840
Keep it turned on.

1317
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:20,120
Let me have it. I can't believe him.

1318
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:22,940
Just leave him. He'll come in if he's tired.

1319
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:26,210
-I want you here, honey.    -I'm with you.

1320
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:27,180
Hey, Da-hye!

1321
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:29,880
Stop using your phone. Go to bed.

1322
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:32,760
Go sleep in your room. We'll take care of things.

1323
01:26:34,030 --> 01:26:36,080
This is the living room, do you copy?

1324
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:37,380
Copy, over.

1325
01:26:37,380 --> 01:26:41,420
Daddy is standing by for emergencies, over.

1326
01:26:41,420 --> 01:26:43,740
Got it, over.

1327
01:26:45,310 --> 01:26:47,480
Is that tent going to leak?

1328
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:50,750
We ordered from the U.S., it'll be fine.

1329
01:26:50,750 --> 01:26:53,960
-Should we sleep here?    -What?

1330
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:56,200
We've got a full view of the tent.

1331
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:58,190
Good idea. I'll feel much better.

1332
01:26:58,190 --> 01:26:58,950
Right?

1333
01:26:58,950 --> 01:27:00,600
Let's watch over him as we sleep.

1334
01:27:03,070 --> 01:27:04,640
What a kid...

1335
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:15,630
Wait a minute.

1336
01:27:17,630 --> 01:27:20,150
Where's that smell coming from?

1337
01:27:20,150 --> 01:27:21,510
What smell?

1338
01:27:21,510 --> 01:27:23,400
Mr. Kim's smell.

1339
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:25,230
-Mr. Kim?    -Yeah.

1340
01:27:25,790 --> 01:27:27,230
Not sure what you mean.

1341
01:27:27,230 --> 01:27:29,960
Really? You must have smelled it.

1342
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:34,590
That smell that wafts through the car, how to describe it?

1343
01:27:34,620 --> 01:27:37,460
-An old man's smell?    -No no, it's not that.

1344
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:39,100
What is it?

1345
01:27:39,750 --> 01:27:41,430
Like an old radish?

1346
01:27:42,350 --> 01:27:43,110
No.

1347
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:45,360
You know when you boil a rag?

1348
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:46,740
It smells like that.

1349
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:55,670
Anyway, even though he always seems about to cross the line,

1350
01:27:55,670 --> 01:27:59,760
he never does cross it. That's good.

1351
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:01,280
-I'll give him credit.    -Yeah.

1352
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:04,680
But that smell crosses the line.

1353
01:28:05,430 --> 01:28:07,620
It powers through right into the back seat.

1354
01:28:08,220 --> 01:28:09,980
How bad can it be?

1355
01:28:09,980 --> 01:28:10,980
I don't know.

1356
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:14,540
It's hard to describe.

1357
01:28:15,470 --> 01:28:19,180
But you sometimes smell it on the subway.

1358
01:28:19,180 --> 01:28:22,320
It's been ages since I rode a subway.

1359
01:28:23,160 --> 01:28:26,190
People who ride the subway have a special smell.

1360
01:28:26,190 --> 01:28:26,940
Yeah.

1361
01:28:43,830 --> 01:28:45,990
Isn't this like the cars back seat?

1362
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:50,700
What if Da-song comes back in?

1363
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:52,870
Don't worry!

1364
01:28:53,540 --> 01:28:55,940
I can just pull my hand back.

1365
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:03,240
We shouldn't...

1366
01:29:09,380 --> 01:29:10,940
Do it clockwise.

1367
01:29:11,870 --> 01:29:12,910
Right.

1368
01:29:16,310 --> 01:29:20,150
You know where.

1369
01:29:36,030 --> 01:29:39,900
You still have those cheap panties?

1370
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:41,310
Huh?

1371
01:29:41,310 --> 01:29:44,110
The ones Yoon's girlfriend left behind.

1372
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:47,840
If you wear those, I'll get really fucking hard.

1373
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:50,720
Really?

1374
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:52,200
Then buy me drugs.

1375
01:29:55,470 --> 01:29:56,980
Buy me drugs!

1376
01:29:58,980 --> 01:30:00,840
Eat this instead.

1377
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:13,440
You like it?

1378
01:30:34,900 --> 01:30:36,900
They're passed out cold. Sneak out now.

1379
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:13,020
Emergency! Emergency, over!

1380
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:17,030
-Emergency!    -What?

1381
01:31:18,340 --> 01:31:19,430
What is it, over!

1382
01:31:19,430 --> 01:31:21,180
Da-song, what's wrong?

1383
01:31:21,180 --> 01:31:23,360
I can't sleep, over.

1384
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:27,380
So stop it and come in, okay?

1385
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,740
Go sleep in your soft bed. over.

1386
01:31:30,740 --> 01:31:32,160
Right!

1387
01:31:32,160 --> 01:31:34,220
I don't want to. over.

1388
01:31:34,780 --> 01:31:36,470
Hey, Park Da-song.

1389
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:43,780
Let's just sleep...

1390
01:33:18,620 --> 01:33:22,430
How did it turn out back there?

1391
01:33:23,060 --> 01:33:24,430
What?

1392
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:28,340
The people in the basement.

1393
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:36,000
Well, I tied them up.

1394
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
What will we do now?

1395
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:40,420
Huh?

1396
01:33:42,980 --> 01:33:45,960
What do we do now, what's our plan?

1397
01:33:47,020 --> 01:33:49,710
I've been wondering...

1398
01:33:50,780 --> 01:33:54,100
What would Min do in this situation?

1399
01:33:55,660 --> 01:33:58,510
Min wouldn't be in this situation!

1400
01:33:58,510 --> 01:34:05,580
Look kids, we made it out of there safely, right?

1401
01:34:06,940 --> 01:34:11,750
And besides us, nobody knows what happened there. Right?

1402
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:14,800
So nothing happened. You understand?

1403
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:18,040
I've got my own plan.

1404
01:34:19,300 --> 01:34:23,620
So you two just forget about it, okay?

1405
01:34:25,540 --> 01:34:27,550
Let's go home.

1406
01:34:28,110 --> 01:34:30,070
Let's go take a bath.

1407
01:34:49,070 --> 01:34:51,520
What are you doing there? Hurry up!

1408
01:35:05,020 --> 01:35:07,590
What's going on?

1409
01:35:09,340 --> 01:35:12,440
You stay there. This is all sewage water.

1410
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:16,180
Was our window open?

1411
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:22,550
Help me out, Ki-taek!

1412
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:32,030
Ki-woo!

1413
01:35:34,240 --> 01:35:36,390
Hey Ki-woo, close the window!

1414
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:41,200
You got shocked?

1415
01:35:46,950 --> 01:35:48,880
I'm dizzy.

1416
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:56,310
Hold on a sec. Wait.

1417
01:36:02,140 --> 01:36:04,230
Shit, I'm dizzy.

1418
01:36:07,960 --> 01:36:10,190
Ki-jung, be careful.

1419
01:36:11,940 --> 01:36:13,510
Don't touch anything.

1420
01:36:25,990 --> 01:36:31,960
Honey, I've got a concussion.

1421
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:34,190
I can't see you.

1422
01:36:55,860 --> 01:37:00,160
Honey, that woman Chung-sook...

1423
01:37:01,180 --> 01:37:03,280
Oh, god.

1424
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:05,300
What a nice person.

1425
01:37:07,100 --> 01:37:10,000
She kicked me down the stairs.

1426
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:14,430
Repeat after me.

1427
01:37:15,550 --> 01:37:17,870
Chung-sook...

1428
01:37:19,750 --> 01:37:21,590
Chung-sook...

1429
01:37:32,910 --> 01:37:34,120
Hey, Ki-woo!

1430
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:36,950
What at are you doing there?

1431
01:37:36,950 --> 01:37:37,990
Huh?

1432
01:37:52,950 --> 01:37:55,900
H O L P... M...

1433
01:39:02,630 --> 01:39:03,580
Dad.

1434
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:05,240
Yeah?

1435
01:39:06,720 --> 01:39:10,120
What was your plan?

1436
01:39:12,120 --> 01:39:13,660
What are you talking about?

1437
01:39:15,190 --> 01:39:17,180
Before, you said you had a plan.

1438
01:39:18,110 --> 01:39:19,640
What will you do? About...

1439
01:39:20,940 --> 01:39:21,950
the basement.

1440
01:39:22,980 --> 01:39:28,140
Ki-woo, you know what kind of plan never fails?

1441
01:39:30,670 --> 01:39:32,560
No plan at all.

1442
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:34,470
No plan.

1443
01:39:35,440 --> 01:39:36,520
You know why?

1444
01:39:38,710 --> 01:39:44,460
If you make a plan, life never works out that way.

1445
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:47,320
Look around us.

1446
01:39:48,060 --> 01:39:51,550
Did these people think,

1447
01:39:51,550 --> 01:39:53,230
"Let's all spend the night in a gym?"

1448
01:39:54,470 --> 01:39:55,550
But look now.

1449
01:39:56,540 --> 01:39:59,700
Everyone's sleeping on the floor, us included.

1450
01:40:02,070 --> 01:40:04,590
That's why people shouldn't make plans.

1451
01:40:07,350 --> 01:40:10,720
With no plan, nothing can go wrong.

1452
01:40:11,470 --> 01:40:17,480
And if something spins out of control, it doesn't matter.

1453
01:40:19,190 --> 01:40:21,740
Whether you kill someone or betray your country.

1454
01:40:23,620 --> 01:40:26,840
None of it fucking matters. Got it?

1455
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:30,100
Dad.

1456
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:33,620
I'm sorry.

1457
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:36,070
For what?

1458
01:40:39,620 --> 01:40:40,580
Everything.

1459
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:43,040
All of it.

1460
01:40:45,860 --> 01:40:47,100
I'll take care of everything.

1461
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:50,320
What are you talking about?

1462
01:40:52,870 --> 01:40:54,880
Why are you hugging that stone?

1463
01:40:56,240 --> 01:40:57,380
This?

1464
01:41:03,380 --> 01:41:05,910
It keeps clinging to me.

1465
01:41:08,550 --> 01:41:12,150
I think you need some sleep.

1466
01:41:15,680 --> 01:41:17,320
I'm serious.

1467
01:41:19,230 --> 01:41:20,910
It keeps following me.

1468
01:41:33,950 --> 01:41:36,880
Miss Jessica! Sorry to call on Sunday morning.

1469
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:39,260
Are you free for lunch today?

1470
01:41:39,260 --> 01:41:42,760
We're having a birthday impromptu for Da-song.

1471
01:41:44,620 --> 01:41:46,420
A birthday party?

1472
01:41:46,420 --> 01:41:49,990
If you come too, Da-song will be so happy.

1473
01:41:49,990 --> 01:41:54,230
And have as much pasta, gratin, and salmon steak as you want.

1474
01:41:54,230 --> 01:41:56,480
Please come by 1PM,

1475
01:41:56,480 --> 01:41:59,510
and I'll count today as one of your lessons.

1476
01:41:59,510 --> 01:42:01,750
You know what I mean? See you soon!

1477
01:42:03,550 --> 01:42:05,040
-Mom.    -Yeah?

1478
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:08,790
For the impromptu, should we invite Kevin too?

1479
01:42:08,790 --> 01:42:11,710
Great idea! Why not? Will you call him?

1480
01:42:11,710 --> 01:42:17,070
Get some more sleep, honey! You must be tired after yesterday.

1481
01:42:17,070 --> 01:42:19,910
If we have a party, won't you need to do the rounds?

1482
01:42:19,910 --> 01:42:21,880
Right, the wine shop,

1483
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:24,240
supermarket, bakery, florist...

1484
01:42:24,240 --> 01:42:27,960
But I already told Mr. Kim to hurry over.

1485
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:29,440
I'll pay him overtime.

1486
01:42:29,440 --> 01:42:30,260
Perfect.

1487
01:42:40,830 --> 01:42:45,150
Everyone it down, I'll explain!

1488
01:42:45,770 --> 01:42:50,560
Da-hye: We're having a party, and mom said to invite you!

1489
01:42:52,870 --> 01:42:56,300
Sis, in the basement...

1490
01:42:56,300 --> 01:42:58,680
we have 10 outdoor tables.

1491
01:42:58,680 --> 01:43:02,440
First take them all out, then arrange them...

1492
01:43:03,230 --> 01:43:06,100
No, come to the window. I need to show you.

1493
01:43:08,150 --> 01:43:10,030
With Da-song's tent in the middle,

1494
01:43:10,030 --> 01:43:13,920
curve the tables outward...

1495
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:16,000
A crane's wing formation!

1496
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,040
Like Admiral Yi used, you know?

1497
01:43:18,040 --> 01:43:19,550
The Battle of Hansan Island!

1498
01:43:19,550 --> 01:43:21,990
Think of the tent as the Japanese warship.

1499
01:43:21,990 --> 01:43:27,390
And our tables will make a semicircular crane's wing formation.

1500
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:31,640
Then near the tent will be the barbeque grill, firewood and such.

1501
01:43:31,640 --> 01:43:34,110
Arrange them all there!

1502
01:43:34,110 --> 01:43:37,640
Oh sure, bring your husband too!

1503
01:43:37,640 --> 01:43:38,740
Yeah!

1504
01:43:38,740 --> 01:43:42,470
And definitely no presents, just come!

1505
01:43:42,470 --> 01:43:43,260
Yeah!

1506
01:43:43,260 --> 01:43:45,390
What dress code?

1507
01:43:45,390 --> 01:43:48,310
It's an impromptu. You can wear sweat pants!

1508
01:43:49,880 --> 01:43:52,590
And definitely no presents!

1509
01:43:52,590 --> 01:43:55,760
Just come and eat hors d'oeuvres!

1510
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:58,960
You know my culinary skills!

1511
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:03,500
Right! We'll get drunk in the daytime.

1512
01:44:04,300 --> 01:44:05,380
Yeah!

1513
01:44:05,380 --> 01:44:07,720
If you'd sing, that'd be grand!

1514
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:13,350
You know the one...

1515
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:27,910
Quiet, he's sleeping!

1516
01:44:27,910 --> 01:44:31,860
Today the sky's so blue, and no pollution!

1517
01:44:31,860 --> 01:44:33,780
Thanks to all the rain yesterday.

1518
01:44:34,640 --> 01:44:35,950
Right.

1519
01:44:36,420 --> 01:44:40,110
So we traded camping for a garden party.

1520
01:44:41,390 --> 01:44:43,120
Lemons into lemonade.

1521
01:44:46,310 --> 01:44:50,800
Right, that rain was such a blessing!

1522
01:44:52,670 --> 01:44:56,990
And definitely no presents, I mean it!

1523
01:44:57,860 --> 01:45:01,470
Right, just squeeze your Mini Cooper into the garage.

1524
01:45:01,470 --> 01:45:03,320
Go on up!

1525
01:45:03,320 --> 01:45:05,340
Right, back it in.

1526
01:45:05,340 --> 01:45:08,940
Just don't block the Benz!

1527
01:45:08,940 --> 01:45:12,440
You're here! It's been so long!

1528
01:45:12,440 --> 01:45:15,940
I told you no presents!

1529
01:45:34,870 --> 01:45:36,120
You were thinking of something else.

1530
01:45:37,140 --> 01:45:37,990
What?

1531
01:45:39,390 --> 01:45:42,240
While kissing me, you thought of something else.

1532
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:45,710
No.

1533
01:45:46,870 --> 01:45:49,750
What do you mean? You're doing it now, too.

1534
01:45:53,100 --> 01:45:54,260
Wow.

1535
01:45:56,260 --> 01:45:57,910
Everyone looks gorgeous, right?

1536
01:46:00,160 --> 01:46:03,550
Even for a sudden gathering, they're so cool.

1537
01:46:05,070 --> 01:46:06,480
And look so natural.

1538
01:46:09,110 --> 01:46:09,900
Da-hye.

1539
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:14,350
Do I fit in here?

1540
01:46:16,350 --> 01:46:17,300
What?

1541
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:20,880
In this setting, do I fit in?

1542
01:46:31,750 --> 01:46:33,480
Hey, where are you going?

1543
01:46:34,320 --> 01:46:35,270
I need to go down.

1544
01:46:36,020 --> 01:46:38,140
Just stay with me.

1545
01:46:39,220 --> 01:46:40,230
I need to go down there.

1546
01:46:41,720 --> 01:46:45,860
Why go to those boring people? Can't you stay here?

1547
01:46:47,120 --> 01:46:51,110
Not to those people, down lover.

1548
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:54,780
Wow, what is that?

1549
01:46:57,870 --> 01:47:01,070
God, I can't believe I'm doing this at my age.

1550
01:47:02,180 --> 01:47:03,740
It's so embarrassing.

1551
01:47:05,150 --> 01:47:07,030
I'm really sorry, Mr. Kim.

1552
01:47:07,030 --> 01:47:09,510
Da-song's mom insisted, it can't be helped.

1553
01:47:10,310 --> 01:47:13,110
But the concept is simple.

1554
01:47:13,110 --> 01:47:17,380
There'll be a parade with Jessica carrying a birthday cake.

1555
01:47:17,380 --> 01:47:21,480
Then we jump out and attack Jessica.

1556
01:47:21,480 --> 01:47:23,820
Swinging our tomahawks!

1557
01:47:23,820 --> 01:47:24,660
Right.

1558
01:47:24,660 --> 01:47:27,700
Just then, Da-song the good Indian will jump out

1559
01:47:27,700 --> 01:47:29,520
and we'll do battle.

1560
01:47:30,360 --> 01:47:32,820
Finally, he'll save Jessica, the cake princess,

1561
01:47:32,820 --> 01:47:34,420
and they'll all cheer.

1562
01:47:34,900 --> 01:47:36,220
Something like that.

1563
01:47:37,750 --> 01:47:38,800
Silly, isn't it?

1564
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:43,750
I guess your wife likes events and surprises.

1565
01:47:43,750 --> 01:47:45,790
Yeah, she does.

1566
01:47:45,790 --> 01:47:48,230
But she's particularly into this party.

1567
01:47:50,230 --> 01:47:52,630
You're trying your best, too.

1568
01:47:54,340 --> 01:47:56,830
Well, you love her, after all.

1569
01:48:02,590 --> 01:48:03,740
Mr. Kim.

1570
01:48:05,640 --> 01:48:07,980
You're getting paid extra.

1571
01:48:13,460 --> 01:48:16,470
Think of this as part of your work, okay?

1572
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:30,700
Did you go down below?

1573
01:48:30,700 --> 01:48:32,440
Not yet.

1574
01:48:32,440 --> 01:48:34,660
Shouldn't we talk to them?

1575
01:48:34,660 --> 01:48:36,580
Reach an understanding?

1576
01:48:36,580 --> 01:48:37,660
Exactly!

1577
01:48:37,660 --> 01:48:40,470
We all got too fucking worked up last night.

1578
01:48:40,470 --> 01:48:43,880
Dad was going on about some plan...

1579
01:48:44,870 --> 01:48:47,360
-I'm just going down there.    -Hold on.

1580
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:49,750
Take this down to them.

1581
01:48:49,750 --> 01:48:51,360
-They must be hungry.    -Right.

1582
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:53,300
Let them eat first.

1583
01:48:54,180 --> 01:48:56,710
Coffee next time for Sure!

1584
01:48:57,630 --> 01:48:59,720
Here you are, Jessica.

1585
01:48:59,720 --> 01:49:02,020
-This is so amazing.    -Isn't it great?

1586
01:49:02,020 --> 01:49:04,740
I've got a special favor to ask.

1587
01:49:04,740 --> 01:49:05,980
What is it?

1588
01:49:05,980 --> 01:49:08,300
This is... how to describe it?

1589
01:49:08,300 --> 01:49:10,470
Da-song's trauma recovery cake?

1590
01:49:10,470 --> 01:49:12,270
So it needs to be you who does it.

1591
01:49:12,270 --> 01:49:13,540
Today's highlight!

1592
01:50:36,510 --> 01:50:39,600
Hey, are you okay?

1593
01:50:44,980 --> 01:50:46,590
Are you...?

1594
01:50:56,500 --> 01:50:58,940
Wait, mister!

1595
01:52:45,300 --> 01:52:47,630
Kevin? Kevin!

1596
01:52:54,630 --> 01:52:57,600
Da-song, happy birthday!

1597
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:59,320
Congratulations!

1598
01:53:06,180 --> 01:53:07,830
Shit...

1599
01:53:13,190 --> 01:53:14,640
Stop!

1600
01:53:17,870 --> 01:53:21,660
Chung-sook!

1601
01:53:21,660 --> 01:53:23,040
Ki-jung!

1602
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:24,820
Come out here, Chung-sook!

1603
01:53:24,820 --> 01:53:27,820
Stop the blood! Push down on the wound!

1604
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:33,920
Da-song!

1605
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:35,390
Honey!

1606
01:53:36,780 --> 01:53:38,990
Let go, don't!

1607
01:53:45,430 --> 01:53:51,460
It hurts.

1608
01:53:56,180 --> 01:53:57,390
The emergency room!

1609
01:53:57,390 --> 01:53:58,670
Get the car!

1610
01:53:58,670 --> 01:54:00,790
Mr. Kim! What are you doing?

1611
01:54:00,790 --> 01:54:02,870
We can't wait for an ambulance!

1612
01:54:02,870 --> 01:54:05,280
Stop pushing, Dad!

1613
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:08,180
Makes it hurt more.

1614
01:54:08,180 --> 01:54:10,110
Car keys! The car keys!

1615
01:54:10,110 --> 01:54:12,920
Throw them! Throw me the key!

1616
01:54:29,600 --> 01:54:31,340
Are you okay?

1617
01:54:32,540 --> 01:54:34,080
Don't touch it!

1618
01:54:36,500 --> 01:54:38,880
Hello, Mr. Park.

1619
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:40,140
You know me?

1620
01:54:40,140 --> 01:54:41,590
Respect!

1621
01:56:08,660 --> 01:56:13,020
Opening my eyes for the first time in a month, I saw a detective.

1622
01:56:14,030 --> 01:56:18,630
You have the right to an attorney...

1623
01:56:18,630 --> 01:56:22,550
Who looked nothing like a detective.

1624
01:56:25,400 --> 01:56:26,790
Is he laughing?

1625
01:56:27,580 --> 01:56:28,620
Just a sec.

1626
01:56:29,630 --> 01:56:33,660
Then the doctor who looked nothing like a doctor spoke.

1627
01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:39,440
That happens sometimes after brain surgery.

1628
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:41,440
They keep laughing. For no reason.

1629
01:56:42,220 --> 01:56:44,120
Do you hear me?

1630
01:56:44,660 --> 01:56:46,120
Can you hear me?

1631
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:48,620
Then do I have to do it again?

1632
01:56:48,620 --> 01:56:49,500
Do what?

1633
01:56:49,500 --> 01:56:50,790
The Miranda thing.

1634
01:56:53,310 --> 01:56:56,310
You have the right to remain silent.

1635
01:56:56,310 --> 01:57:00,380
Anything you say can and will be used against you...

1636
01:57:00,380 --> 01:57:02,380
He keeps laughing, look!

1637
01:57:05,670 --> 01:57:10,940
Even when I heard how much Ki-jung bled that day...

1638
01:57:11,660 --> 01:57:14,100
Even when I heard the words forgery,

1639
01:57:14,100 --> 01:57:18,830
trespassing, foul play, self-defense

1640
01:57:19,710 --> 01:57:25,220
and we were lucky to get away with a probation...

1641
01:57:28,870 --> 01:57:32,180
Even when I finally got to see Ki-jung's face...

1642
01:57:32,200 --> 01:57:34,700
Kim Ki-jung. RIP.

1643
01:57:36,480 --> 01:57:38,460
I kept laughing.

1644
01:57:48,590 --> 01:57:53,560
Still, when I went back and watched the news reports,

1645
01:57:54,180 --> 01:57:55,870
I didn't laugh.

1646
01:57:56,280 --> 01:57:58,750
This sudden rampage in the back yard of an upper-class home

1647
01:57:58,750 --> 01:58:00,700
is a highly unusual case.

1648
01:58:00,700 --> 01:58:06,020
Since the homeless man who sparked the rampage died at the scene,

1649
01:58:06,020 --> 01:58:11,310
police are struggling to even establish a clear motive.

1650
01:58:11,310 --> 01:58:15,880
The driver Kim and the slain
Mr. Park are said to have been on good terms.

1651
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:20,860
For now the police investigation
is focused on locating the driver Kim.

1652
01:58:21,950 --> 01:58:26,070
Kim, after exiting this door and descending the stairs,

1653
01:58:26,070 --> 01:58:28,710
disappeared into the neighboring alleys.

1654
01:58:29,800 --> 01:58:34,420
Police searched the CCTVs of nearby homes to no avail,

1655
01:58:35,380 --> 01:58:37,990
and they have yet to find any witnesses.

1656
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:41,270
Given the situation,

1657
01:58:41,270 --> 01:58:45,600
it's not an exaggeration to say that Kim vanished into thin air.

1658
01:58:47,600 --> 01:58:54,590
Actually Mom and I had no idea where Dad was.

1659
01:58:56,910 --> 01:59:02,040
But those detectives still wore themselves out tailing us.

1660
01:59:06,480 --> 01:59:11,990
Eventually the news went quiet, and after the tails stopped,

1661
01:59:13,030 --> 01:59:16,430
I started going up that mountain.

1662
01:59:18,430 --> 01:59:22,880
From up there, you get a great view of the house.

1663
01:59:26,140 --> 01:59:29,500
That day, despite the cold.

1664
01:59:30,660 --> 01:59:32,710
I felt like staying longer.

1665
01:59:46,280 --> 01:59:49,390
Dash-dash-dot-dot.

1666
01:59:54,100 --> 02:00:12,200
Dash-dash-dot-dot.

1667
02:00:15,190 --> 02:00:16,100
Son!

1668
02:00:18,560 --> 02:00:19,760
Son!

1669
02:00:22,080 --> 02:00:25,270
Perhaps you, if no one else. will be able to read this letter.

1670
02:00:29,180 --> 02:00:34,640
You were a Boy Scout, so I'm writing this just in case.

1671
02:00:38,750 --> 02:00:40,980
Have your injuries healed?

1672
02:00:42,640 --> 02:00:46,120
I'm sure your mom is plenty healthy.

1673
02:00:50,870 --> 02:00:53,340
I'm doing fine in here.

1674
02:00:54,710 --> 02:00:57,120
Though thinking of Ki-jung makes me cry.

1675
02:01:00,670 --> 02:01:04,780
Even now, what happened that day doesn't seem real.

1676
02:01:06,680 --> 02:01:08,510
It feels like a dream,

1677
02:01:09,990 --> 02:01:11,670
and yet it doesn't.

1678
02:01:13,320 --> 02:01:17,550
That day as I went out the gate, I suddenly knew.

1679
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:20,480
Where I needed to go...

1680
02:02:00,260 --> 02:02:03,460
A house where such grisly crime took place

1681
02:02:03,460 --> 02:02:06,220
would surely not be easy to sell.

1682
02:02:09,790 --> 02:02:11,740
I'm sorry, Mr. Park.

1683
02:02:12,390 --> 02:02:17,840
I struggled to hold out like that in an empty house.

1684
02:02:21,380 --> 02:02:24,430
Still, thanks to the house being empty.

1685
02:02:24,430 --> 02:02:29,390
what was her name? Moon-gwang?

1686
02:02:29,390 --> 02:02:32,880
I was able to give her a proper send off.

1687
02:02:34,830 --> 02:02:40,450
I hear tree-side burials are trendy. so hell, I did my best.

1688
02:02:44,820 --> 02:02:48,120
But those real estate sharks sure are clever.

1689
02:02:53,040 --> 02:02:57,540
They hoodwinked some people who had just arrived in Korea

1690
02:02:57,540 --> 02:02:59,240
and managed to sell the house.

1691
02:03:00,960 --> 02:03:04,270
With the parents working, and the kids attending school,

1692
02:03:04,270 --> 02:03:07,100
the family is usually out.

1693
02:03:07,100 --> 02:03:11,800
But the goddamned housekeeper stays there 24 hours a day.

1694
02:03:12,640 --> 02:03:16,870
Each time I go upstairs, I take my life in my hands.

1695
02:03:20,040 --> 02:03:23,710
It turns out Germans eat more than just sausage and beer.

1696
02:03:24,820 --> 02:03:26,430
What a relief.

1697
02:03:29,630 --> 02:03:33,200
Passing the time down here, everything starts to go hazy.

1698
02:03:38,160 --> 02:03:41,830
Today at least I was able to write you a letter.

1699
02:03:44,240 --> 02:03:48,110
If I send out the letter this way every night,

1700
02:03:48,110 --> 02:03:52,320
maybe someday you'll see it.

1701
02:03:58,520 --> 02:04:00,040
So long.

1702
02:04:14,200 --> 02:04:15,560
You're home, Ki-woo?

1703
02:04:15,560 --> 02:04:16,540
Yeah.

1704
02:04:30,900 --> 02:04:35,180
Dad, today I made a plan.

1705
02:04:37,280 --> 02:04:39,110
A fundamental plan.

1706
02:04:42,270 --> 02:04:43,640
I'm going to earn money.

1707
02:04:44,820 --> 02:04:45,910
A lot of it.

1708
02:04:49,870 --> 02:04:53,910
University, a career, marriage. those are all fine,

1709
02:04:54,860 --> 02:04:56,880
but first I'll earn money.

1710
02:04:56,880 --> 02:05:01,820
You'll see once you go in, but it's very spacious.

1711
02:05:02,880 --> 02:05:07,710
Actually, we don't show this house to just anyone.

1712
02:05:07,710 --> 02:05:11,540
When I have money, I'll buy that house.

1713
02:05:13,060 --> 02:05:17,020
On the day we move in, Mom and I will be in the yard.

1714
02:05:17,980 --> 02:05:19,820
Because the sunshine is so nice there.

1715
02:05:21,580 --> 02:05:22,830
All you'll need to do

1716
02:05:23,790 --> 02:05:25,620
is walk up the stairs.

1717
02:06:49,480 --> 02:06:53,540
Take care until then.

1718
02:06:58,160 --> 02:07:00,750
So long.
