1
00:01:41,962 --> 00:01:43,002
How dare you

2
00:01:43,322 --> 00:01:44,282
come back?

3
00:01:46,282 --> 00:01:47,882
All my brothers,

4
00:01:48,362 --> 00:01:49,642
I will protect them.

5
00:01:57,002 --> 00:01:58,882
Master.

6
00:03:26,922 --> 00:03:27,922
Tiger

7
00:03:27,922 --> 00:03:29,162
Xiao,

8
00:03:29,162 --> 00:03:30,322
Break.

9
00:04:04,282 --> 00:04:05,482
Master.

10
00:04:11,802 --> 00:04:13,082
Other than Prince Rong,

11
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,802
you're the first one who can seriously hurt me.

12
00:04:17,402 --> 00:04:18,122
Are you okay?

13
00:04:27,162 --> 00:04:27,802
Your Majesty,

14
00:04:28,522 --> 00:04:29,202
you're injured.

15
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:29,962
It's okay. I didn't

16
00:04:30,722 --> 00:04:32,802
expect Cheng Dalei to be so good at it.

17
00:04:33,802 --> 00:04:35,162
Let me take a break.

18
00:04:38,642 --> 00:04:39,922
Since you're injured,

19
00:04:40,962 --> 00:04:42,362
why don't you die?

20
00:04:44,722 --> 00:04:45,842
He stabbed me in the back.

21
00:04:45,842 --> 00:04:47,162
This strategist is such a dog.

22
00:04:54,802 --> 00:04:55,562
I got

23
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,682
the Tiger Tally.

24
00:04:59,202 --> 00:05:00,322
You harmed me,

25
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:02,602
but it turned out to be a Tiger Tally,

26
00:05:03,402 --> 00:05:04,602
With the Tiger Tally,

27
00:05:05,682 --> 00:05:07,362
I can open the gate.

28
00:05:08,122 --> 00:05:09,722
To lure the Rong Clan into the Pass,

29
00:05:10,122 --> 00:05:11,842
and make a big plan together,

30
00:05:12,242 --> 00:05:13,842
He colluded with the Rong Clan.

31
00:05:14,322 --> 00:05:15,242
those years

32
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,162
You fought against the Rong Family and shocked the world,

33
00:05:20,242 --> 00:05:23,242
but you could have taken advantage of the Great Wu Empire

34
00:05:23,882 --> 00:05:25,202
and replaced it with the empire,

35
00:05:25,722 --> 00:05:27,082
You can have it at your fingertips.

36
00:05:27,602 --> 00:05:29,562
But you gave up your military power,

37
00:05:31,042 --> 00:05:33,602
took a corner and indulged in pleasure,

38
00:05:35,442 --> 00:05:37,282
I put up with you for more than ten years.

39
00:05:40,162 --> 00:05:41,522
You don't want to be the emperor?

40
00:05:42,162 --> 00:05:44,322
I'll be the one then.

41
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:46,722
I can't believe

42
00:05:49,162 --> 00:05:50,322
it's you.

43
00:05:51,842 --> 00:05:53,802
I knew there was a traitor in the city,

44
00:05:54,402 --> 00:05:56,682
so I pretended to indulge in pleasure.

45
00:05:56,682 --> 00:05:58,962
It was to make the rebels relax,

46
00:06:00,122 --> 00:06:01,242
to kill Xuan'er,

47
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:04,442
He led me and Cheng Dalei to fight to the death.

48
00:06:05,082 --> 00:06:07,082
It turns out that you colluded with the Rong Clan,

49
00:06:07,082 --> 00:06:08,562
so that you could reap the profits of the fishermen.

50
00:06:09,522 --> 00:06:12,322
Black Rock City was attacked by the Rong Clan several times before,

51
00:06:15,162 --> 00:06:16,802
and it was also you who ordered it, right?

52
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:18,202
As expected,

53
00:06:18,202 --> 00:06:20,722
he is still the Imperial Tiger who shook a city by himself.

54
00:06:21,242 --> 00:06:22,042
It's a pity that

55
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:24,362
you have the talent of an emperor,

56
00:06:24,362 --> 00:06:26,362
But he has no ambition

57
00:06:26,402 --> 00:06:27,442
to defend the country,

58
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,562
To keep the people of the empire safe.

59
00:06:29,562 --> 00:06:32,442
That's what we're dedicated to.

60
00:06:33,882 --> 00:06:35,402
Competing with each other,

61
00:06:36,082 --> 00:06:37,202
the people suffer,

62
00:06:38,562 --> 00:06:40,762
If you succeed, all your bones will wither,

63
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:43,442
and the people of Li will suffer.

64
00:06:44,402 --> 00:06:46,162
If you make the King the Prime Minister,

65
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:49,802
how many citizens of Li will die in the war?

66
00:06:51,522 --> 00:06:52,482
Fine,

67
00:06:53,642 --> 00:06:55,162
you're blinded by ambition,

68
00:06:56,002 --> 00:06:58,602
At this point, it's useless to say more,

69
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,922
since you've been following me for years,

70
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:03,562
Find your own way.

71
00:07:04,682 --> 00:07:06,242
I'll give you a decent face,

72
00:07:06,242 --> 00:07:07,762
and you'll give me a decent face,

73
00:07:10,682 --> 00:07:13,002
I don't want to give you this dignity.
