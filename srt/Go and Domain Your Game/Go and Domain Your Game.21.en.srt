1
00:01:39,002 --> 00:01:39,562
Please, please.

2
00:01:40,762 --> 00:01:41,842
-Let's do it. -Okay.

3
00:01:41,842 --> 00:01:42,722
Come on, let's do it

4
00:01:43,202 --> 00:01:43,802
After you

5
00:01:43,802 --> 00:01:45,282
Thank you, Master Cheng, for your help.

6
00:01:45,442 --> 00:01:46,442
Let's have a toast.

7
00:01:54,802 --> 00:01:56,922
Come on, drink it.

8
00:01:58,522 --> 00:01:59,602
My brother,

9
00:02:00,042 --> 00:02:01,682
it's all up to you this time.

10
00:02:01,682 --> 00:02:04,362
That's why we can save the Liu Army.

11
00:02:04,882 --> 00:02:07,242
How can I repay you.

12
00:02:08,162 --> 00:02:09,002
Miss Liu Zhi,

13
00:02:09,202 --> 00:02:10,042
it's easy.

14
00:02:10,162 --> 00:02:10,922
Don't mention it.

15
00:02:12,682 --> 00:02:14,202
Why didn't you

16
00:02:15,282 --> 00:02:18,522
invite Miss Su up the mountain?

17
00:02:19,202 --> 00:02:20,722
Lake fishing business is so good,

18
00:02:20,722 --> 00:02:22,002
she can't leave alone.

19
00:02:22,122 --> 00:02:22,762
Am I right?

20
00:02:25,962 --> 00:02:26,802
Miss Liu Zhi,

21
00:02:27,562 --> 00:02:28,682
drink less,

22
00:02:29,922 --> 00:02:30,882
Moderate drinking can ease one's mind.

23
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,482
My brother,

24
00:02:40,002 --> 00:02:41,762
Eldest Brother,

25
00:02:42,282 --> 00:02:44,882
What should I call you if you like?

26
00:02:45,322 --> 00:02:48,642
I think whatever you call it is easy to say.

27
00:02:49,842 --> 00:02:51,762
It's so tangled.

28
00:02:52,362 --> 00:02:54,922
You can call me whatever you want.

29
00:02:55,282 --> 00:02:56,002
Whatever.

30
00:02:57,162 --> 00:02:58,362
How can you save

31
00:02:58,642 --> 00:03:02,082
the entire Liu Army at will?

32
00:03:02,642 --> 00:03:03,642
For the rest of my life,

33
00:03:04,762 --> 00:03:06,362
when I'm a cow or a horse,

34
00:03:07,002 --> 00:03:09,482
I want to repay you.

35
00:03:13,162 --> 00:03:14,802
I didn't do it all by myself.

36
00:03:15,122 --> 00:03:16,202
It's all thanks to you.

37
00:03:16,682 --> 00:03:17,842
Right, Advisor?

38
00:03:17,842 --> 00:03:18,762
This is six,

39
00:03:20,682 --> 00:03:21,602
Advisor,

40
00:03:24,442 --> 00:03:25,522
it's no big deal.

41
00:03:25,522 --> 00:03:26,602
It's not a big deal.

42
00:03:27,042 --> 00:03:29,162
If I hadn't risked my life

43
00:03:29,162 --> 00:03:32,082
to fight with Du Mao.

44
00:03:32,402 --> 00:03:34,202
If the Seven Arrests and Seven Arbiters strategize,

45
00:03:34,202 --> 00:03:36,842
they might lose this battle.

46
00:03:37,122 --> 00:03:37,682
Come on.

47
00:03:38,002 --> 00:03:40,522
Remember that battle in Falling Leaf City,

48
00:03:40,842 --> 00:03:43,162
Du Mao used a good mace.

49
00:03:43,682 --> 00:03:46,962
I, the jade-faced scholar Xu Shenji, don't belittle him.

50
00:03:47,322 --> 00:03:49,122
When the battle came to a head,

51
00:03:49,122 --> 00:03:50,922
I only saw my luck in the Dantian,

52
00:03:51,042 --> 00:03:52,522
His figure is elegant,

53
00:03:52,962 --> 00:03:55,402
using the secret method of lost transmission of Xu family,

54
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:58,842
They are neck and neck,

55
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:02,882
Okay

56
00:04:05,002 --> 00:04:07,202
A cosy young man.

57
00:04:07,802 --> 00:04:09,042
Congratulations on completing

58
00:04:09,042 --> 00:04:11,602
all the tasks of running Toad Village,

59
00:04:13,642 --> 00:04:14,922
What's the next task?

60
00:04:15,082 --> 00:04:17,442
Let's talk about it after I wake up.

61
00:04:17,442 --> 00:04:18,362
The system still needs to sleep,

62
00:04:18,442 --> 00:04:21,042
and upgrading Toad Village by hand is very hard,

63
00:04:21,362 --> 00:04:23,042
For a long time,

64
00:04:23,042 --> 00:04:24,442
you won't be able to see me anymore.

65
00:04:25,322 --> 00:04:26,802
Don't miss me too much.

66
00:04:29,962 --> 00:04:30,842
If you don't have a task,

67
00:04:31,042 --> 00:04:32,642
you can sleep late.

68
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,082
Miss Liu Zhi,

69
00:04:57,242 --> 00:04:58,802
my brother,

70
00:05:00,082 --> 00:05:02,322
What are you

71
00:05:02,362 --> 00:05:03,402
doing?

72
00:05:05,082 --> 00:05:05,682
I'm sorry,

73
00:05:07,522 --> 00:05:08,802
my brother,

74
00:05:09,282 --> 00:05:13,322
Ever since the brothel saved me that day,

75
00:05:14,682 --> 00:05:16,002
Liu Zhi's heart

76
00:05:16,922 --> 00:05:20,122
has been in my brother's hands.

77
00:05:21,122 --> 00:05:22,242
From now on,

78
00:05:24,202 --> 00:05:25,362
let me

79
00:05:27,082 --> 00:05:30,122
stay by your side.

80
00:05:39,242 --> 00:05:40,162
I'm sorry,

81
00:05:40,362 --> 00:05:41,242
Miss Liu Zhi,

82
00:05:42,282 --> 00:05:43,242
I know what you mean.

83
00:05:48,162 --> 00:05:49,362
But I already

84
00:05:51,682 --> 00:05:53,122
have someone in my heart.

85
00:05:57,402 --> 00:05:58,322
Well,

86
00:05:58,722 --> 00:06:01,122
love can't be forced.

87
00:06:01,522 --> 00:06:02,162
Am I right?

88
00:06:03,642 --> 00:06:05,122
Do you understand what I mean?

89
00:06:10,882 --> 00:06:11,642
Hey,

90
00:06:11,802 --> 00:06:13,362
I can't even sleep late.

91
00:06:13,842 --> 00:06:16,002
You really have the heart to plant flowers but they won't bloom.

92
00:06:16,602 --> 00:06:17,642
Wu Xin,

93
00:06:20,362 --> 00:06:21,042
Su Ying,

94
00:06:21,322 --> 00:06:23,082
Now the restaurant is on the right track,

95
00:06:23,442 --> 00:06:25,682
why don't you come back to Toad Village with me.

96
00:06:33,922 --> 00:06:35,602
I'm just kidding.

97
00:06:36,002 --> 00:06:37,962
I know you can't live without Falling Leaf City now,

98
00:06:38,642 --> 00:06:40,562
and the restaurant business

99
00:06:40,562 --> 00:06:41,682
is on the right track now.

100
00:06:42,322 --> 00:06:43,362
Why are you willing to leave,

101
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:44,482
the landlady?

102
00:06:44,682 --> 00:06:45,122
Am I right?

103
00:06:45,402 --> 00:06:47,762
Then I'll come back to see you when I have time.

104
00:06:50,962 --> 00:06:51,402
Yes.

105
00:07:11,002 --> 00:07:11,802
Cheng Dalei,

106
00:07:13,402 --> 00:07:14,682
will you really come?
