1
00:01:37,802 --> 00:01:39,322
From today on,

2
00:01:41,002 --> 00:01:43,202
I'm here to rely on Master.

3
00:01:45,122 --> 00:01:48,082
Please take good care of me.

4
00:01:48,402 --> 00:01:49,162
Okay.

5
00:01:57,562 --> 00:01:58,362
Come on,

6
00:01:59,682 --> 00:02:01,642
wake up, young man.

7
00:02:01,642 --> 00:02:04,322
Put away your dirty thoughts.

8
00:02:04,842 --> 00:02:06,122
A new mission has appeared.

9
00:02:06,322 --> 00:02:08,042
Touching a beautiful girl's heart.

10
00:02:08,082 --> 00:02:10,442
You must not use any coercive means.

11
00:02:10,682 --> 00:02:13,522
Let Su Ying's goodwill rise to 30.

12
00:02:14,122 --> 00:02:15,522
Is this also called a mission?

13
00:02:15,762 --> 00:02:17,322
Thirty is not as easy as turning over a hand.

14
00:02:18,682 --> 00:02:19,842
Master,

15
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:21,402
Master,

16
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:22,602
Something bad happened.

17
00:02:22,602 --> 00:02:25,082
Miss Su refused to listen to the advice and insisted on going down the mountain,

18
00:02:25,082 --> 00:02:26,682
what should we do?

19
00:02:27,722 --> 00:02:28,842
Ling'er, don't panic.

20
00:02:28,922 --> 00:02:30,002
I'm going to talk to her.

21
00:02:30,122 --> 00:02:30,762
Wait for me.

22
00:02:33,402 --> 00:02:34,882
If Miss Su goes down the mountain,

23
00:02:35,162 --> 00:02:37,042
I'm afraid she'll fall into the hands of thieves again.

24
00:02:37,042 --> 00:02:39,282
I have to show my sincerity and persuade her to stay.

25
00:02:51,962 --> 00:02:52,602
Miss Su,

26
00:02:52,842 --> 00:02:53,682
what do you want to do?

27
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:54,482
Me,

28
00:02:55,322 --> 00:02:55,922
I'm telling you,

29
00:02:56,122 --> 00:02:56,642
I'm the legitimate daughter

30
00:02:56,642 --> 00:02:58,282
of the president of the Four Seas Chamber of Commerce in Falling Leaf City,

31
00:02:58,642 --> 00:02:59,402
As long as you let me go,

32
00:02:59,482 --> 00:03:00,922
the ransom won't be less than you.

33
00:03:01,082 --> 00:03:01,682
Miss Su,

34
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,162
I don't want money,

35
00:03:03,202 --> 00:03:03,522
You,

36
00:03:05,082 --> 00:03:07,482
I thought you were greedy for money,

37
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,002
but I didn't expect you

38
00:03:09,802 --> 00:03:10,682
to be dirty!

39
00:03:10,882 --> 00:03:11,602
Miss Su,

40
00:03:11,722 --> 00:03:12,562
let me explain.

41
00:03:13,002 --> 00:03:14,042
That's not who I am.

42
00:03:14,522 --> 00:03:15,802
Then what kind of person are you?

43
00:03:16,082 --> 00:03:17,242
Actually, I'm not a mountain thief,

44
00:03:18,602 --> 00:03:19,482
nor a robber.

45
00:03:20,482 --> 00:03:22,202
We are a group of self-improvement,

46
00:03:22,242 --> 00:03:24,042
ambitious and ambitious people,

47
00:03:24,442 --> 00:03:25,082
Abbreviated as

48
00:03:25,402 --> 00:03:26,042
"strongman",

49
00:03:28,002 --> 00:03:29,322
Me

50
00:03:29,802 --> 00:03:31,162
The reason why I saved Miss Su up the mountain,

51
00:03:31,202 --> 00:03:32,082
is that I don't want her

52
00:03:32,082 --> 00:03:33,402
to fall into the trap of the City Owner of Black Rock.

53
00:03:33,642 --> 00:03:34,322
I know it's useless

54
00:03:34,322 --> 00:03:35,242
to explain so much to Miss Su.

55
00:03:35,442 --> 00:03:36,922
Then I won't disturb Miss Su's rest.

56
00:03:37,482 --> 00:03:38,122
Goodbye.

57
00:03:48,042 --> 00:03:48,642
What are you doing?

58
00:03:52,322 --> 00:03:53,162
Master,

59
00:03:53,762 --> 00:03:55,362
I have a plan.

60
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,882
It can help you out.

61
00:03:58,922 --> 00:04:00,282
In this way,

62
00:04:00,322 --> 00:04:02,682
I'll sacrifice my own body,

63
00:04:02,682 --> 00:04:03,602
And then,

64
00:04:04,722 --> 00:04:05,562
in that case,

65
00:04:05,802 --> 00:04:06,922
Thank you, Advisor.

66
00:04:10,522 --> 00:04:11,122
This lady.

67
00:04:11,122 --> 00:04:11,682
Who are you?

68
00:04:11,922 --> 00:04:12,682
I'm coming.

69
00:04:12,842 --> 00:04:13,842
What are you doing?

70
00:04:13,922 --> 00:04:14,482
Hey,

71
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:15,962
I'm telling you, don't come near me.

72
00:04:16,202 --> 00:04:16,762
Hey, hey, hey,

73
00:04:17,442 --> 00:04:18,002
you scream,

74
00:04:18,482 --> 00:04:19,642
Look at Master,

75
00:04:19,682 --> 00:04:20,722
how dare you lewd thief,

76
00:04:21,002 --> 00:04:22,522
If you dare to touch a woman in charge,

77
00:04:22,802 --> 00:04:23,802
don't be presumptuous.

78
00:04:23,802 --> 00:04:24,442
Qin Man,

79
00:04:24,482 --> 00:04:24,842
alas,

80
00:04:25,042 --> 00:04:25,762
Oh,

81
00:04:25,762 --> 00:04:26,842
the boss asked me to come.

82
00:04:27,002 --> 00:04:27,842
Ouch,

83
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,282
where are you going to escape?

84
00:04:36,682 --> 00:04:39,362
I thought you were a vulgar person.

85
00:04:39,762 --> 00:04:42,042
I didn't expect you to be so insidious.

86
00:04:54,282 --> 00:04:56,402
Where is Yemu Township?

87
00:04:57,842 --> 00:05:01,082
The waning moon in the green hills is worrying.

88
00:05:02,082 --> 00:05:03,882
Why don't men take Wu Gou,

89
00:05:04,442 --> 00:05:06,402
and take over the 50 states of Guanshan.

90
00:05:10,842 --> 00:05:11,882
When the moon is in the sky,

91
00:05:12,722 --> 00:05:14,762
I thought I was the only one who felt it.

92
00:05:15,722 --> 00:05:16,362
I didn't expect

93
00:05:17,322 --> 00:05:18,082
that

94
00:05:22,762 --> 00:05:24,122
you're so literary.

95
00:05:24,882 --> 00:05:27,002
Although the artistic conception doesn't match at all,

96
00:05:27,282 --> 00:05:29,002
it still rhymes.

97
00:05:29,442 --> 00:05:30,442
Master,

98
00:05:30,882 --> 00:05:31,962
you are still young,

99
00:05:31,962 --> 00:05:34,042
I don't know what the girls are thinking.

100
00:05:34,762 --> 00:05:36,362
I have another plan,

101
00:05:36,362 --> 00:05:39,162
which can help you out.

102
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:51,202
How can you have such a useless attribute?

103
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:55,922
Why don't men take Wu Gou,

104
00:05:56,482 --> 00:05:59,482
and take over the 50 states of Guanshan.

105
00:06:04,562 --> 00:06:05,482
He's not a good person,

106
00:06:06,602 --> 00:06:08,122
he writes good poems,

107
00:06:09,282 --> 00:06:11,642
It seems that he is not evil,

108
00:06:12,082 --> 00:06:15,522
so he can only stay here for the time being.

109
00:06:16,002 --> 00:06:17,402
Bad news.

110
00:06:17,682 --> 00:06:19,322
Master,

111
00:06:20,362 --> 00:06:21,322
oh, oh,

112
00:06:21,442 --> 00:06:22,042
Master,

113
00:06:22,042 --> 00:06:22,762
bad news.

114
00:06:23,482 --> 00:06:24,722
The army is coming.

115
00:06:25,002 --> 00:06:25,802
Ah,
