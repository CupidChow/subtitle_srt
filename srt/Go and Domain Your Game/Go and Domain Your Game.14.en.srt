1
00:01:35,282 --> 00:01:37,962
From flower leader

2
00:02:04,442 --> 00:02:05,162
to idol,

3
00:02:05,482 --> 00:02:06,922
What do you think of her?

4
00:02:13,202 --> 00:02:13,722
My idol

5
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:18,242
got hurt when he got out of love.

6
00:02:19,362 --> 00:02:21,802
I didn't expect to see her here.

7
00:02:24,082 --> 00:02:26,402
Let's start with her when we find the Liu Army.

8
00:02:29,602 --> 00:02:30,922
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

9
00:02:31,242 --> 00:02:32,962
Tonight we're competing for painting,

10
00:02:32,962 --> 00:02:36,042
and the winner can have a chat with Miss Liu.

11
00:02:44,522 --> 00:02:46,762
Luckily, I know piano, chess, calligraphy and painting,

12
00:02:47,402 --> 00:02:47,882
idol

13
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:49,162
Everyone has their own strengths.

14
00:02:49,442 --> 00:02:50,802
Don't worry about it.

15
00:03:15,522 --> 00:03:17,722
He must have hidden the silver ticket in the cloth.

16
00:03:17,882 --> 00:03:19,602
Such a crude bribe,

17
00:03:19,602 --> 00:03:21,122
I've already tried it.

18
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:22,362
There's no way.

19
00:03:22,562 --> 00:03:23,042
Exactly

20
00:03:23,522 --> 00:03:24,842
It's not a rag.

21
00:03:30,842 --> 00:03:33,242
Miss Liu, please welcome my son upstairs for a chat.

22
00:03:34,042 --> 00:03:35,402
Please follow me upstairs.

23
00:03:36,362 --> 00:03:37,082
Ou Hou

24
00:03:37,642 --> 00:03:39,122
Everyone has their own strengths.

25
00:03:39,362 --> 00:03:40,682
Don't worry about it.

26
00:03:41,242 --> 00:03:42,202
There must be a mistake.

27
00:03:42,602 --> 00:03:44,082
You … You … Aren't you … What's

28
00:03:46,322 --> 00:03:48,482
wrong with him?

29
00:03:54,042 --> 00:03:56,162
In order to please me, those guests

30
00:03:56,722 --> 00:03:57,322
couldn't wait,

31
00:03:57,322 --> 00:03:58,642
He is proficient in piano, chess,

32
00:03:58,682 --> 00:04:00,682
calligraphy and painting, poetry, songs and poems,

33
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:04,882
I'm curious. What did you draw?

34
00:04:06,562 --> 00:04:08,242
This is the flag of Toad Fortress,

35
00:04:08,242 --> 00:04:10,122
I'm Toad King.

36
00:04:14,082 --> 00:04:16,922
That's what Toad King looks like.

37
00:04:17,602 --> 00:04:20,282
I didn't expect she's handsome.

38
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:23,362
But,

39
00:04:24,402 --> 00:04:25,922
Toad King,

40
00:04:26,562 --> 00:04:29,122
You came to my Falling Leaf City in such an ostentatious manner.

41
00:04:32,602 --> 00:04:33,962
Could it be

42
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:36,842
Aren't you afraid I'll report it to

43
00:04:38,842 --> 00:04:39,482
the government? No,

44
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:42,922
Because I'm here to save people,

45
00:04:44,482 --> 00:04:45,322
save people,

46
00:04:45,882 --> 00:04:46,602
Yes.

47
00:04:47,122 --> 00:04:48,882
A group of loyal people in Falling Leaf City

48
00:04:48,882 --> 00:04:51,282
were killed by traitors and forced to join the slave family.

49
00:04:51,842 --> 00:04:52,962
I came here this time,

50
00:04:53,242 --> 00:04:55,202
to save them in dire straits.

51
00:04:59,322 --> 00:05:00,082
My lord,

52
00:05:00,882 --> 00:05:02,962
if you can help me save my clan,

53
00:05:03,722 --> 00:05:05,762
That little girl must be an ox and a horse,

54
00:05:05,762 --> 00:05:07,362
to repay my prince for his kindness.

55
00:05:07,922 --> 00:05:09,522
Miss Liu, don't mention it. You can

56
00:05:10,202 --> 00:05:12,162
call me idol from now on.

57
00:05:14,282 --> 00:05:14,882
Idol.

58
00:05:19,562 --> 00:05:21,242
That's impossible.

59
00:05:24,722 --> 00:05:25,322
Ou Hou,

60
00:05:25,562 --> 00:05:28,122
my Young Master asks you to have a chat with Miss.

61
00:05:34,762 --> 00:05:37,242
Master really has deep feelings for you.

62
00:05:38,122 --> 00:05:40,762
I've risked my life

63
00:05:41,042 --> 00:05:41,562
to follow him.

64
00:05:53,482 --> 00:05:54,722
Give it to me. Save some for me.

65
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:55,802
Give it to me.

66
00:05:55,842 --> 00:05:56,682
You're all mine.

67
00:05:57,602 --> 00:05:58,882
Look at you. Look at you.

68
00:05:58,882 --> 00:05:59,842
Gosh.

69
00:06:03,522 --> 00:06:06,082
Thank you, idol, for redeeming me,

70
00:06:07,962 --> 00:06:09,282
Miss Liu Zhi, don't stand on ceremony.

71
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:12,242
The priority now is to save your clan.

72
00:06:13,442 --> 00:06:14,482
In the Liu family,

73
00:06:14,482 --> 00:06:15,802
other people are locked up

74
00:06:15,802 --> 00:06:18,602
in Du Mao's mansion as slaves,

75
00:06:20,242 --> 00:06:20,882
Du Mao,

76
00:06:22,242 --> 00:06:24,322
he's the one who framed my father.

77
00:06:25,842 --> 00:06:28,442
He has some power in Falling Leaf City,

78
00:06:29,642 --> 00:06:31,242
and he even sent people from the Liu Clan

79
00:06:32,322 --> 00:06:33,362
into slavery,

80
00:06:34,722 --> 00:06:36,002
Miss Liu Zhi, don't worry.

81
00:06:36,602 --> 00:06:38,122
I'll save

82
00:06:38,202 --> 00:06:39,402
all your people.

83
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:49,722
Oho,

84
00:06:50,722 --> 00:06:51,042
Let's go.

85
00:06:51,602 --> 00:06:52,922
Let's go meet Du Mao.
