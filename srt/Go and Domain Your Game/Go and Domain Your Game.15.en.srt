1
00:01:36,442 --> 00:01:37,602
I'll give you one

2
00:01:38,522 --> 00:01:39,842
or two taels,

3
00:01:40,482 --> 00:01:41,362
I'll give you 3 liang.

4
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:43,162
I'll give you 4 taels,

5
00:01:45,002 --> 00:01:46,362
Du Mao will say the same thing,

6
00:01:46,922 --> 00:01:49,122
These slaves are five taels of silver each.

7
00:01:49,322 --> 00:01:50,562
If you want it, hurry up.

8
00:01:50,882 --> 00:01:52,122
Official Du is frank.

9
00:01:52,442 --> 00:01:53,362
I'll buy ten.

10
00:01:53,402 --> 00:01:53,882
Okay,

11
00:01:54,442 --> 00:01:56,362
Bring those soldiers surnamed Liu here.

12
00:02:02,242 --> 00:02:04,522
These army slaves want

13
00:02:04,602 --> 00:02:05,882
10 taels of silver. Hurry up,

14
00:02:07,322 --> 00:02:09,282
It turns out that these slaves can be bought and sold,

15
00:02:10,442 --> 00:02:11,282
so that's easy to deal with.

16
00:02:13,602 --> 00:02:15,042
All our savings

17
00:02:15,522 --> 00:02:17,162
have been redeemed by Miss Liu.

18
00:02:17,442 --> 00:02:19,122
What should we do?

19
00:02:26,042 --> 00:02:26,962
There are only a few left.

20
00:02:28,162 --> 00:02:29,602
Why would I lie to you?

21
00:02:37,202 --> 00:02:38,322
Do you think the boss can't find you

22
00:02:38,322 --> 00:02:39,882
if you hide it?

23
00:02:40,122 --> 00:02:40,562
Childish.

24
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:43,642
These slaves will be charged at 10 liang each,

25
00:02:43,762 --> 00:02:44,642
so hurry up if you want them.

26
00:02:44,962 --> 00:02:45,562
Mr. Du,

27
00:02:46,642 --> 00:02:48,002
I'll take all these slaves.

28
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:48,962
All of them.

29
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:52,242
Do you know that there are as many as 100 soldiers?

30
00:02:52,362 --> 00:02:53,842
I want to be frank

31
00:02:54,282 --> 00:02:55,082
with 100 people,

32
00:02:55,282 --> 00:02:56,642
I, Du Mao, stand by your words. Wait

33
00:02:56,642 --> 00:02:57,562
a minute.

34
00:03:00,442 --> 00:03:01,442
What are you doing?

35
00:03:01,722 --> 00:03:03,762
There's no one who doesn't bargain in business.

36
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:06,562
Do you want it?

37
00:03:09,842 --> 00:03:10,402
Yes,

38
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:12,482
I still want it.

39
00:03:13,602 --> 00:03:16,562
This business is about honest trading,

40
00:03:19,442 --> 00:03:20,282
Mr. Du,

41
00:03:20,482 --> 00:03:21,082
What about us?

42
00:03:21,522 --> 00:03:23,882
I wanted to establish

43
00:03:23,882 --> 00:03:26,522
a long-term partnership with you.

44
00:03:27,562 --> 00:03:28,402
But,

45
00:03:29,162 --> 00:03:30,482
look at you, army slaves,

46
00:03:31,562 --> 00:03:32,242
Hey,

47
00:03:32,242 --> 00:03:32,882
Look at this.

48
00:03:33,162 --> 00:03:35,242
Look at how strong this man is,

49
00:03:35,722 --> 00:03:36,682
Is there a problem?

50
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:38,082
How much rice do you have to eat in a day?

51
00:03:38,122 --> 00:03:39,962
What should we do if we eat our family poor?

52
00:03:42,602 --> 00:03:43,522
Look at this.

53
00:03:43,802 --> 00:03:44,642
She's so handsome,

54
00:03:44,762 --> 00:03:46,802
how can my maid work with peace of mind?

55
00:03:49,282 --> 00:03:50,082
Hey,

56
00:03:50,442 --> 00:03:51,602
This is too much.

57
00:03:51,602 --> 00:03:52,882
What kind of person do you think this is?

58
00:03:52,882 --> 00:03:54,242
Pretending to be a good fish-eye,

59
00:03:54,362 --> 00:03:56,322
will he serve me or should I serve him?

60
00:03:56,322 --> 00:03:57,082
Am I right?

61
00:03:57,082 --> 00:03:58,562
Isn't it too much for a guy like this

62
00:03:58,562 --> 00:03:59,762
to be 10 liang each?

63
00:03:59,762 --> 00:04:00,002
Oh,

64
00:04:00,002 --> 00:04:00,802
we bought so many,

65
00:04:00,802 --> 00:04:01,402
Give me a 30% discount.

66
00:04:03,762 --> 00:04:05,282
After hearing what you said,

67
00:04:05,682 --> 00:04:07,962
it makes some sense.

68
00:04:08,242 --> 00:04:08,762
Okay,

69
00:04:09,162 --> 00:04:11,162
I, Du Mao, stand by my words,

70
00:04:11,162 --> 00:04:12,042
Then.

71
00:04:12,042 --> 00:04:13,242
This is ridiculous.

72
00:04:14,602 --> 00:04:16,922
The Liu family is the descendant of the Seven Generations'Generals, and

73
00:04:18,362 --> 00:04:20,122
our ancestors have the merit of following the dragon.

74
00:04:20,722 --> 00:04:23,002
If you are invincible on the battlefield,

75
00:04:23,922 --> 00:04:24,842
how can you be reduced

76
00:04:24,922 --> 00:04:25,882
to a bargain sale?

77
00:04:27,002 --> 00:04:28,722
Ten taels of silver

78
00:04:29,122 --> 00:04:30,522
and a 30% discount.

79
00:04:31,362 --> 00:04:33,642
I might as well kill myself here.

80
00:04:35,122 --> 00:04:36,242
Even if you sell it,

81
00:04:37,122 --> 00:04:39,002
it will cost at least 50 taels each.

82
00:04:39,042 --> 00:04:40,122
That's right.

83
00:04:40,162 --> 00:04:41,002
50 taels,

84
00:04:41,162 --> 00:04:46,482
50 taels,

85
00:04:46,482 --> 00:04:47,682
You can even raise your own price.

86
00:04:48,282 --> 00:04:48,922
Okay,

87
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:51,722
I, Du Mao, said no, no, no,

88
00:04:51,962 --> 00:04:53,682
no, no, no, no, no, no Shi 50 taels each with a total price of 5. 2

89
00:04:53,842 --> 00:04:55,562
thousand.

90
00:04:57,562 --> 00:04:58,842
You really have business acumen

91
00:04:59,162 --> 00:05:00,722
to make us pay five times more out of thin air.

92
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:01,962
Du Mao, given seven days,

93
00:05:01,962 --> 00:05:03,402
we can find a way

94
00:05:03,842 --> 00:05:04,562
to raise the 5. 2 thousand

95
00:05:05,042 --> 00:05:07,042
after drinking this bowl of porridge.

96
00:05:08,882 --> 00:05:09,642
Sir,

97
00:05:09,962 --> 00:05:12,042
two more plates of good shredded pickles,

98
00:05:12,402 --> 00:05:13,962
Okay, I'll be right there.
