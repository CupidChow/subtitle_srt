1
00:01:41,762 --> 00:01:42,762
Oh,

2
00:01:42,882 --> 00:01:44,642
it's so hard to make a girl happy.

3
00:01:45,362 --> 00:01:47,042
Sister Su has been staying in the room all day

4
00:01:47,202 --> 00:01:48,242
and it's so stuffy.

5
00:01:48,322 --> 00:01:49,602
Why are you so happy?

6
00:01:51,842 --> 00:01:53,562
Ling'er, do you have any good ideas?

7
00:01:55,522 --> 00:01:56,962
You have to ask her out.

8
00:01:57,682 --> 00:01:58,682
Give her a little something.

9
00:01:58,762 --> 00:01:59,802
Give her a little surprise.

10
00:02:01,122 --> 00:02:02,162
Oh,

11
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:03,802
How am I supposed to ask her out?

12
00:02:04,762 --> 00:02:05,762
Girls

13
00:02:06,282 --> 00:02:07,842
are not as complicated as you think,

14
00:02:14,682 --> 00:02:15,162
Miss Su,

15
00:02:15,882 --> 00:02:18,122
You've been staying in your room since you went up the mountain.

16
00:02:18,442 --> 00:02:19,482
Shall we?

17
00:02:21,042 --> 00:02:22,162
Let's go now.

18
00:02:28,962 --> 00:02:31,522
It's really not that hard to date a girl.

19
00:02:36,962 --> 00:02:37,562
Miss Su,

20
00:02:38,642 --> 00:02:40,922
I know you have prejudice against my profession.

21
00:02:41,602 --> 00:02:43,282
But I'm not who you think I am.

22
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,362
I brought you out today,

23
00:02:45,602 --> 00:02:46,802
just to show you,

24
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,722
How kind

25
00:02:48,762 --> 00:02:49,922
and helpful I am,

26
00:02:51,122 --> 00:02:51,562
Yes.

27
00:02:53,082 --> 00:02:53,442
Look,

28
00:02:53,682 --> 00:02:54,642
there's a woodcutter over there,

29
00:02:54,882 --> 00:02:56,122
It's so hard for him to carry firewood.

30
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:56,962
I'll go help him.

31
00:03:00,162 --> 00:03:02,002
A young man in love.

32
00:03:02,042 --> 00:03:03,402
Sorry to interrupt.

33
00:03:03,602 --> 00:03:05,202
I'm here to announce a new mission for you.

34
00:03:05,362 --> 00:03:06,442
From now on,

35
00:03:06,442 --> 00:03:08,722
rob the ten waves of passers-by you meet.

36
00:03:10,802 --> 00:03:11,762
He asked me to rob him.

37
00:03:12,922 --> 00:03:13,722
Yes,

38
00:03:14,122 --> 00:03:16,042
I won't interrupt your date then.

39
00:03:16,602 --> 00:03:19,042
Oh, no. We can't really rob him.

40
00:03:20,282 --> 00:03:21,962
No, we have to do something about it.

41
00:03:26,162 --> 00:03:26,842
Stop!

42
00:03:27,762 --> 00:03:29,322
I can only give it a try.

43
00:03:30,882 --> 00:03:31,322
Robbery?

44
00:03:33,362 --> 00:03:34,602
I'm just a woodcutter,

45
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:36,522
All I have,

46
00:03:36,522 --> 00:03:37,402
is this bundle of firewood.

47
00:03:38,002 --> 00:03:38,882
I want firewood, too

48
00:03:39,522 --> 00:03:40,122
Ah.

49
00:03:45,162 --> 00:03:45,842
This is it.

50
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:49,122
Sir,

51
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:50,082
your sword,

52
00:03:50,482 --> 00:03:52,002
It's not your sword.

53
00:03:52,202 --> 00:03:52,882
Get lost!

54
00:03:55,922 --> 00:03:57,722
Is this what you call helping others?

55
00:03:58,482 --> 00:03:59,322
Gosh.

56
00:03:59,762 --> 00:04:00,682
With this sword,

57
00:04:00,842 --> 00:04:02,442
I won't have to cut firewood this month.

58
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,962
You really met a good man.

59
00:04:04,962 --> 00:04:07,282
That's great. Looks like this will work.

60
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:09,362
When you climb the mountain later,

61
00:04:09,522 --> 00:04:10,802
you take this stick.

62
00:04:16,362 --> 00:04:16,802
Robbery.

63
00:04:21,082 --> 00:04:21,602
Robbery.

64
00:04:25,882 --> 00:04:26,442
Robbery,

65
00:04:26,842 --> 00:04:27,322
Robbery,

66
00:04:28,682 --> 00:04:30,322
Robbery.

67
00:04:40,602 --> 00:04:41,922
I didn't expect that in Qingniu Mountain,

68
00:04:41,922 --> 00:04:43,202
there's such a beautiful lake.

69
00:04:43,322 --> 00:04:44,562
It's so pleasant.

70
00:04:45,402 --> 00:04:46,682
What on earth are you doing

71
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:48,242
with those people's stuff?

72
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:55,802
This is for you.

73
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:09,522
Cheng Dalei,

74
00:05:10,722 --> 00:05:12,762
what kind of person are you?

75
00:05:17,122 --> 00:05:18,082
Actually, I don't know

76
00:05:18,082 --> 00:05:19,362
what kind of person I am, do I?

77
00:05:19,682 --> 00:05:20,602
Sometimes

78
00:05:21,122 --> 00:05:22,642
he is the head of Toad Village,

79
00:05:23,642 --> 00:05:24,602
Sometimes

80
00:05:24,682 --> 00:05:27,202
they are also what others call bandits and bandits.

81
00:05:28,402 --> 00:05:29,922
Ever since I came here,

82
00:05:30,722 --> 00:05:33,122
I've been like a leaf of Qingniu Mountain,

83
00:05:33,242 --> 00:05:34,122
A grain of sand,

84
00:05:34,602 --> 00:05:36,242
even if it's insignificant.

85
00:05:36,362 --> 00:05:38,162
I hope I can make a difference.

86
00:05:38,162 --> 00:05:38,882
So,

87
00:05:39,322 --> 00:05:40,362
what kind of person am I now?

88
00:05:40,362 --> 00:05:41,042
It doesn't matter.

89
00:05:41,482 --> 00:05:42,962
What matters is what kind of person he will be in the future.

90
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:44,322
What do you think?

91
00:05:44,322 --> 00:05:45,042
Miss Su.

92
00:05:48,122 --> 00:05:48,842
Miss Su,

93
00:05:51,202 --> 00:05:52,082
stop the car.

94
00:05:52,082 --> 00:05:52,842
Stop the car.

95
00:05:53,482 --> 00:05:54,242
Stop the car.

96
00:06:04,802 --> 00:06:06,722
Thank you for dropping by.

97
00:06:07,202 --> 00:06:09,562
It's not appropriate to stay in Toad Village all the time.

98
00:06:11,362 --> 00:06:12,402
You have to give something

99
00:06:13,162 --> 00:06:14,842
as well as a ride.

100
00:06:18,482 --> 00:06:18,962
Robbery.

101
00:06:24,642 --> 00:06:25,122
Miss Su,

102
00:06:25,162 --> 00:06:25,882
are you okay?

103
00:06:26,162 --> 00:06:27,522
I don't want you to worry about me. Just go!

104
00:06:31,922 --> 00:06:33,842
If I had advised her not to run around on her own,

105
00:06:34,242 --> 00:06:35,562
why would I have to be scolded for saving her?

106
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:36,762
I don't get it. I don't get it.

107
00:06:40,242 --> 00:06:42,002
A lovelorn boy.

108
00:06:42,242 --> 00:06:44,322
I didn't expect you to finish the task

109
00:06:44,322 --> 00:06:45,042
by cheating again.

110
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:46,602
Now let's start handing out rewards.

111
00:06:47,002 --> 00:06:47,962
Treasure fragments?

112
00:06:49,322 --> 00:06:50,362
What's the use

113
00:06:50,362 --> 00:06:51,402
of fragments?

114
00:06:51,562 --> 00:06:52,962
You'll know when you gather them.

115
00:06:54,722 --> 00:06:55,242
Bye.

116
00:07:08,682 --> 00:07:09,162
Miss Su,

117
00:07:09,442 --> 00:07:10,122
this is for you.

118
00:07:11,202 --> 00:07:12,122
Cheng Dalei,

119
00:07:13,002 --> 00:07:14,522
what kind of person are you?

120
00:07:15,282 --> 00:07:16,962
It doesn't matter what kind of person he is now.

121
00:07:18,042 --> 00:07:20,002
What matters is what kind of person he will be in the future.
