1
00:01:38,162 --> 00:01:39,042
Brothers,

2
00:01:40,442 --> 00:01:41,762
the thief Cheng Dalei

3
00:01:42,482 --> 00:01:43,762
did harm to the City Owner.

4
00:01:44,442 --> 00:01:47,602
He has a deep blood feud with me in Black Rock City.

5
00:01:48,362 --> 00:01:49,642
I will kill him.

6
00:01:49,802 --> 00:01:53,482
Revenge.

7
00:01:53,482 --> 00:01:54,602
Let's do

8
00:01:55,162 --> 00:01:55,642
Lu Hum now.

9
00:02:00,802 --> 00:02:01,282
Lu Hum,

10
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:02,762
I didn't kill the City Owner of Han.

11
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,962
Don't be fooled by Xue Banchuan.

12
00:02:06,242 --> 00:02:07,762
He colluded with the Rong Clan,

13
00:02:07,842 --> 00:02:09,082
and harmed City Owner Han.

14
00:02:09,402 --> 00:02:10,682
But evil dog thief,

15
00:02:11,162 --> 00:02:12,162
kill the City Owner first,

16
00:02:12,962 --> 00:02:13,602
Now,

17
00:02:13,922 --> 00:02:15,602
you still dare to use counter-tactics to provoke the relationship

18
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:16,962
between me and the Military Advisor,

19
00:02:17,642 --> 00:02:19,522
I'll kill you now.

20
00:02:20,442 --> 00:02:21,482
Hyah!

21
00:02:23,322 --> 00:02:24,122
Hyah!

22
00:02:26,562 --> 00:02:27,242
Hyah!

23
00:02:32,522 --> 00:02:34,322
Master, you're still smart.

24
00:02:34,682 --> 00:02:36,522
Ask Shaoyu to change into your clothes and lure the army away.

25
00:02:36,882 --> 00:02:37,642
Let's go back.

26
00:02:37,642 --> 00:02:38,602
Stealing Xue Banchuan's Tiger Tally.

27
00:02:54,122 --> 00:02:55,842
Which way should we go, Advisor?

28
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:57,682
I've seen the stars,

29
00:02:58,362 --> 00:02:59,562
Greed goes west,

30
00:02:59,722 --> 00:03:01,122
Misfortune

31
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:02,122
leads to the east. This way.

32
00:03:03,122 --> 00:03:03,642
Okay,

33
00:03:03,762 --> 00:03:04,322
Let's go.

34
00:03:23,602 --> 00:03:24,162
Stop!

35
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,002
Who are you?

36
00:03:26,202 --> 00:03:26,962
Hold on.

37
00:03:28,562 --> 00:03:30,722
These two are my guests.

38
00:03:38,562 --> 00:03:40,202
Why did you rush into the city?

39
00:03:41,042 --> 00:03:42,322
If they find out,

40
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:44,282
it will cause trouble, won't it?

41
00:03:47,522 --> 00:03:48,282
Why aren't you talking?

42
00:03:53,162 --> 00:03:54,122
It's good that

43
00:03:54,962 --> 00:03:55,602
you're alert enough.

44
00:03:57,242 --> 00:03:58,322
Let the prince rest assured that

45
00:03:59,202 --> 00:04:00,122
I have the Tiger Tally,

46
00:04:00,722 --> 00:04:01,882
We can dispatch troops to take you

47
00:04:01,882 --> 00:04:03,882
into the prison by midnight tonight.

48
00:04:04,442 --> 00:04:07,042
When I take down Dawu State and become the emperor,

49
00:04:07,562 --> 00:04:08,642
the land of Youbei.

50
00:04:09,362 --> 00:04:10,562
It will be yours

51
00:04:13,882 --> 00:04:14,962
until then,

52
00:04:15,442 --> 00:04:17,242
I hold the power

53
00:04:17,642 --> 00:04:19,242
and look down on the world.

54
00:04:22,082 --> 00:04:22,762
Come on.

55
00:04:30,442 --> 00:04:31,562
When I think about it carefully,

56
00:04:32,682 --> 00:04:34,042
Cheng Dalei

57
00:04:34,162 --> 00:04:35,442
is quite capable.

58
00:04:35,562 --> 00:04:36,522
Yes.

59
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:40,602
If we keep this person,

60
00:04:41,522 --> 00:04:43,242
it will be a big trouble.

61
00:04:46,082 --> 00:04:46,602
not be as good as

62
00:04:47,642 --> 00:04:49,362
We'll exterminate Toad Village tonight.

63
00:04:49,722 --> 00:04:51,442
Kill him clean.

64
00:04:57,002 --> 00:04:58,242
It doesn't matter.

65
00:04:59,202 --> 00:05:00,162
I'll be right back.

66
00:05:19,642 --> 00:05:20,442
Bro,

67
00:05:21,002 --> 00:05:22,362
which door should we go out faster?

68
00:05:22,362 --> 00:05:23,002
That way.

69
00:05:24,562 --> 00:05:25,402
What kind of person?

70
00:05:29,082 --> 00:05:30,482
Lu Hum, it's me.

71
00:05:31,922 --> 00:05:33,642
I didn't expect you to throw yourself into the net.

72
00:05:33,882 --> 00:05:35,762
Today is the day you die.

73
00:05:39,842 --> 00:05:40,722
It's just a small trick.

74
00:05:41,242 --> 00:05:42,042
You're dying,

75
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:43,282
yet you want to stab someone in the back?

76
00:05:43,682 --> 00:05:44,762
What's that?

77
00:05:48,562 --> 00:05:49,642
Tiger Tally?

78
00:05:52,922 --> 00:05:53,882
Keep it safe.

79
00:05:54,282 --> 00:05:55,922
If it falls into Xue Banchuan's hands,

80
00:05:56,082 --> 00:05:57,682
the State of Great Wu will be wiped out.

81
00:05:57,842 --> 00:05:58,682
At midnight,

82
00:05:58,682 --> 00:06:01,242
Xue Banchuan will open the city gate to lure the Rong Clan to invade,

83
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:02,642
Why should I believe you?

84
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:05,122
I dare not forget to worry about the country,

85
00:06:05,842 --> 00:06:09,682
how can I drive Lu to ask about cloth and silks.

86
00:06:13,042 --> 00:06:14,842
How do you know that?

87
00:06:25,442 --> 00:06:28,602
Did you see those two men in black?

88
00:06:28,882 --> 00:06:29,922
Those two distinguished guests?

89
00:06:30,042 --> 00:06:31,002
I showed them the way.

90
00:06:31,162 --> 00:06:32,242
They even praised me for being great.

91
00:06:38,642 --> 00:06:41,882
Go and get them back.

92
00:06:41,882 --> 00:06:42,562
Okay, okay.

93
00:06:45,282 --> 00:06:46,802
It's God's will.

94
00:06:52,002 --> 00:06:52,562
General,

95
00:06:52,562 --> 00:06:53,882
Xue Banchuan has escaped from the city.

96
00:06:54,562 --> 00:06:55,202
Lu,

97
00:06:55,282 --> 00:06:56,122
you go and regroup the troops,

98
00:06:56,122 --> 00:06:57,082
I'll go after Xue Banchuan.
