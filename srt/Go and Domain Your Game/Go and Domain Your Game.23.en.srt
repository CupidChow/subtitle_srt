1
00:01:39,002 --> 00:01:39,802
Master,

2
00:01:40,242 --> 00:01:42,482
this is the meeting place that Lu Hum agreed to meet.

3
00:01:42,842 --> 00:01:43,562
Master,

4
00:01:43,882 --> 00:01:45,602
are we taking too few people with us?

5
00:01:45,802 --> 00:01:47,082
We're here to form an alliance.

6
00:01:47,082 --> 00:01:47,962
I'm not here to fight. Why are you

7
00:01:47,962 --> 00:01:49,042
bringing so many people?

8
00:01:49,402 --> 00:01:49,962
Hey,

9
00:01:50,482 --> 00:01:52,282
Isn't Lu Hum here to form an alliance?

10
00:01:52,762 --> 00:01:54,162
Why isn't he here yet?

11
00:01:54,282 --> 00:01:55,042
Let me have a look.

12
00:02:11,962 --> 00:02:12,682
Your Highness,

13
00:02:12,962 --> 00:02:14,322
we have stolen

14
00:02:14,322 --> 00:02:15,682
all their luggage and horses.

15
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:17,522
But there's one thing I don't understand.

16
00:02:18,082 --> 00:02:19,482
Why are there so many of us?

17
00:02:19,562 --> 00:02:20,722
If we don't just go in,

18
00:02:23,202 --> 00:02:23,882
Master,

19
00:02:24,042 --> 00:02:24,922
Something bad happened.

20
00:02:24,962 --> 00:02:27,002
We can't find our luggage and horses.

21
00:02:27,802 --> 00:02:28,482
What's going on?

22
00:02:30,122 --> 00:02:30,802
But,

23
00:02:31,882 --> 00:02:34,522
I found a word "Man"

24
00:02:34,562 --> 00:02:35,722
on the ground,

25
00:02:35,962 --> 00:02:36,842
I don't think so.

26
00:02:44,522 --> 00:02:46,362
I've been familiar with the art of war for decades,

27
00:02:46,602 --> 00:02:48,002
as the saying goes, attacking the city is my weakness,

28
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:48,962
Focus on the heart,

29
00:02:49,242 --> 00:02:50,842
I want you to leave Qin Man's sewing kit

30
00:02:50,842 --> 00:02:51,602
at the scene,

31
00:02:52,042 --> 00:02:53,522
I knew that they would suspect that

32
00:02:53,522 --> 00:02:54,722
reckless man of stealing luggage,

33
00:02:55,362 --> 00:02:56,482
This is.

34
00:03:02,322 --> 00:03:03,482
This is a diversion.

35
00:03:03,882 --> 00:03:06,242
This plan will create a crisis of trust within them.

36
00:03:06,282 --> 00:03:06,842
Losing without a fight,

37
00:03:06,922 --> 00:03:07,442
Father,

38
00:03:08,002 --> 00:03:10,162
I must impress you.

39
00:03:13,642 --> 00:03:14,202
Your Highness,

40
00:03:15,202 --> 00:03:15,762
Your Highness,

41
00:03:16,602 --> 00:03:18,162
Your Highness, stop laughing.

42
00:03:19,442 --> 00:03:20,762
It turns out that our clothes,

43
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:24,002
Qin secretly mended them for us.

44
00:03:24,682 --> 00:03:25,882
I know not only how to stick,

45
00:03:26,642 --> 00:03:27,802
but also how to stitch.

46
00:03:31,042 --> 00:03:33,362
My dead wife taught me that.

47
00:03:36,122 --> 00:03:38,362
I just want to do more for you.

48
00:03:46,562 --> 00:03:48,402
Brother Qin, go for it.

49
00:03:48,402 --> 00:03:48,882
Brother Qin,

50
00:03:49,482 --> 00:03:50,202
come on!

51
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,282
It's not a sin for a man to cry.

52
00:03:52,402 --> 00:03:53,762
It's okay. Come on.

53
00:03:53,922 --> 00:03:54,562
Come on!

54
00:03:54,922 --> 00:03:56,202
Come on!

55
00:03:56,482 --> 00:03:57,242
Come on!

56
00:03:58,802 --> 00:03:59,882
Come on.

57
00:04:00,242 --> 00:04:01,122
Come on!

58
00:04:01,682 --> 00:04:02,282
Your Highness,

59
00:04:02,922 --> 00:04:04,282
let's not waste any more time.

60
00:04:05,322 --> 00:04:06,522
Go straight in now,

61
00:04:06,642 --> 00:04:07,082
Okay,

62
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,762
I studied hard for more than ten years,

63
00:04:11,002 --> 00:04:13,202
and this trick is called a bitter trick,

64
00:04:13,402 --> 00:04:14,282
I need someone

65
00:04:14,322 --> 00:04:16,042
to surrender Cheng Da Lei,

66
00:04:16,482 --> 00:04:19,082
Break them apart from the inside.

67
00:04:19,242 --> 00:04:20,682
But if they surrender for no reason,

68
00:04:20,682 --> 00:04:21,762
they won't believe it.

69
00:04:22,402 --> 00:04:22,842
So,

70
00:04:23,802 --> 00:04:24,682
I stabbed you.

71
00:04:25,362 --> 00:04:27,882
Let him believe that there is a big conflict between us.

72
00:04:29,162 --> 00:04:29,602
Father,

73
00:04:29,882 --> 00:04:32,722
I must make you look at me with new eyes and ears.

74
00:04:44,322 --> 00:04:44,762
Cheng.

75
00:04:48,562 --> 00:04:49,602
Master Cheng,

76
00:04:49,642 --> 00:04:51,602
I risked my life to escape to you

77
00:04:52,682 --> 00:04:54,802
because I have something important to tell you

78
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:56,002
Okay,

79
00:04:56,082 --> 00:04:56,722
Tell me.

80
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:57,642
Master,

81
00:04:57,642 --> 00:04:59,522
we just stabbed a wild boar outside.

82
00:04:59,522 --> 00:05:00,602
Let's have a ham.

83
00:05:01,882 --> 00:05:02,442
Me

84
00:05:04,482 --> 00:05:05,202
I'm not hungry.

85
00:05:08,562 --> 00:05:08,922
Hey,

86
00:05:09,322 --> 00:05:11,122
Don't you have something important to tell me?

87
00:05:11,202 --> 00:05:12,482
Tell me.

88
00:05:14,242 --> 00:05:15,642
How dare you kill my lieutenant!

89
00:05:16,602 --> 00:05:17,522
Soldiers, listen to the order.

90
00:05:17,642 --> 00:05:18,202
Yes

91
00:05:18,442 --> 00:05:19,402
Be on guard here.

92
00:05:20,202 --> 00:05:22,122
I'm going to meet Cheng Dalei for a while.

93
00:05:24,682 --> 00:05:26,122
Who is Cheng Dalei?

94
00:05:29,522 --> 00:05:30,282
Who are you?

95
00:05:30,802 --> 00:05:33,082
I'm Han Xuanzhi, the Crown Princess of Black Rock City,

96
00:05:33,402 --> 00:05:35,322
and this place has been surrounded by thousands of troops.

97
00:05:35,682 --> 00:05:36,202
Now,

98
00:05:36,682 --> 00:05:37,962
you only have two choices,

99
00:05:39,322 --> 00:05:41,762
This is a bottle of poison wine. It's extremely poisonous.

100
00:05:42,002 --> 00:05:43,202
You'll die immediately if you drink it.

101
00:05:43,922 --> 00:05:44,402
Of course,

102
00:05:45,002 --> 00:05:45,802
you don't have to drink it.

103
00:05:47,082 --> 00:05:48,042
In that case,

104
00:05:48,522 --> 00:05:50,082
all your brothers will die.

105
00:06:06,162 --> 00:06:07,442
Boss, let me do it.

106
00:06:09,922 --> 00:06:10,642
Let me do it.

107
00:06:10,802 --> 00:06:12,002
Let me do it.

108
00:06:12,162 --> 00:06:12,722
Let me do it.

109
00:06:12,762 --> 00:06:13,402
Let me do it.

110
00:06:13,482 --> 00:06:14,042
Let me do it.

111
00:06:14,042 --> 00:06:14,602
Go to hell.

112
00:06:14,722 --> 00:06:15,602
Let me do it.

113
00:06:15,602 --> 00:06:16,082
Go to hell.

114
00:06:16,082 --> 00:06:18,322
I'll come and go.

115
00:06:30,362 --> 00:06:31,722
I've already drunk two buckets of water.

116
00:06:31,722 --> 00:06:32,762
Why are you still throwing up?

117
00:06:33,082 --> 00:06:34,642
What did you eat last night? This is

118
00:06:34,762 --> 00:06:35,642
… Why did Master save

119
00:06:35,642 --> 00:06:36,722
him?

120
00:06:37,282 --> 00:06:37,962
Although he's stupid,

121
00:06:37,962 --> 00:06:39,322
he's not guilty enough to die, is he?

122
00:06:41,562 --> 00:06:44,122
I've been familiar with the art of war for decades,

123
00:06:44,562 --> 00:06:47,042
and this is the first time I've ever met a rival,

124
00:06:47,482 --> 00:06:49,322
You saved my life today.

125
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:50,922
I'll cut you some slack.

126
00:06:51,362 --> 00:06:53,202
When we meet again one day,

127
00:06:53,922 --> 00:06:55,162
you'll die.

128
00:07:02,162 --> 00:07:03,442
Didn't you say we're going to form an alliance?

129
00:07:03,642 --> 00:07:05,442
Why are they all weird people,

130
00:07:05,762 --> 00:07:06,162
Hey,

131
00:07:07,202 --> 00:07:09,002
Haven't you told us where the luggage is?

132
00:07:10,402 --> 00:07:11,882
Go! Go!

133
00:07:12,562 --> 00:07:14,042
Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up!

134
00:07:24,162 --> 00:07:26,562
Han Xuanzhi

135
00:07:26,962 --> 00:07:27,522
must be in trouble.

136
00:07:27,522 --> 00:07:28,482
Cheng Dalei,

137
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:30,882
how dare you,

138
00:07:31,682 --> 00:07:33,122
How dare you kill Her Highness?
