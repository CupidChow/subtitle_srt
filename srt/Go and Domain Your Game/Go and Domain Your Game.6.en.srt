1
00:01:48,802 --> 00:01:49,442
General Huang Shen,

2
00:01:50,042 --> 00:01:52,282
after crossing this cliff, the boundary of Toad Village will be reached.

3
00:01:52,842 --> 00:01:54,922
This time, I'm going to wipe out Toad Village,

4
00:01:55,362 --> 00:01:56,402
only if I win this battle,

5
00:01:56,722 --> 00:01:57,922
So that I can get rid of my shame.

6
00:01:58,082 --> 00:01:58,722
Hyah!

7
00:02:17,282 --> 00:02:18,762
In the face of the approaching army,

8
00:02:19,362 --> 00:02:20,842
he still looks calm.

9
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:22,642
There must be a trick.

10
00:02:24,322 --> 00:02:25,482
Let's just sit still

11
00:02:25,922 --> 00:02:27,082
and wait and see.

12
00:02:34,802 --> 00:02:35,962
I've come up with a plan.

13
00:02:36,242 --> 00:02:37,682
But I need someone to help me stop the army.

14
00:02:37,922 --> 00:02:38,642
I'll buy you some time,

15
00:02:38,962 --> 00:02:39,922
Boss.

16
00:02:40,282 --> 00:02:41,522
Master asked me

17
00:02:46,882 --> 00:02:48,282
to stop the army but I can't.

18
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:49,362
Lyre-playing, chess, calligraphy and painting are not bad.

19
00:02:57,642 --> 00:02:59,322
My dear mother.

20
00:03:00,402 --> 00:03:02,202
It's so scary. There's no need to lock it up

21
00:03:02,762 --> 00:03:05,202
even if we delay this battle.

22
00:03:05,322 --> 00:03:06,762
And the lock is so strong.

23
00:03:07,042 --> 00:03:08,042
Darn it!

24
00:03:08,242 --> 00:03:09,882
I'm going to fight for it.

25
00:03:40,162 --> 00:03:41,002
General Huang Shen,

26
00:03:41,322 --> 00:03:42,002
General Huang Shen,

27
00:03:42,442 --> 00:03:44,042
We've listened to three songs.

28
00:03:44,042 --> 00:03:44,922
How much longer do we have to wait?

29
00:03:51,362 --> 00:03:52,762
How dare you bluff me?

30
00:03:54,242 --> 00:03:56,042
When the whole army attacks,

31
00:03:57,882 --> 00:03:59,402
I'll strangle you.

32
00:04:02,522 --> 00:04:04,322
Don't come near me!

33
00:04:10,442 --> 00:04:11,602
I can't untie it.

34
00:04:11,602 --> 00:04:12,402
Advisor,

35
00:04:14,082 --> 00:04:15,162
stop trying.

36
00:04:15,482 --> 00:04:16,882
You can't break away from this chain.

37
00:04:25,162 --> 00:04:26,122
I advise you

38
00:04:26,242 --> 00:04:27,162
to retreat as soon as possible.

39
00:04:27,162 --> 00:04:28,362
I have magic power.

40
00:04:28,562 --> 00:04:29,682
May I ask Tianlei

41
00:04:30,122 --> 00:04:31,482
to pretend to be a god or a ghost?

42
00:04:31,762 --> 00:04:32,482
Go!

43
00:04:54,722 --> 00:04:55,962
Hurry up, Master.

44
00:04:56,042 --> 00:04:57,202
I didn't expect that when the Military Advisor bumped into him,

45
00:04:57,602 --> 00:04:58,842
he would come out of a secret room.

46
00:05:04,642 --> 00:05:05,522
What is this?

47
00:05:06,322 --> 00:05:08,162
So this is the mysterious treasure Black Gunpowder,

48
00:05:08,162 --> 00:05:09,282
Black Gunpowder,

49
00:05:10,682 --> 00:05:11,482
Gunpowder.

50
00:05:25,802 --> 00:05:27,482
Retreat.

51
00:06:04,042 --> 00:06:05,202
A smart young man.

52
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:07,202
Here comes your favorite System Fairy.

53
00:06:07,762 --> 00:06:08,762
Congratulations on your mission

54
00:06:08,762 --> 00:06:11,242
of resisting the attack of the Black Rock Army.

55
00:06:11,362 --> 00:06:13,562
Now let's start handing out the reward list.

56
00:06:19,402 --> 00:06:20,522
There are only five people

57
00:06:20,962 --> 00:06:22,202
in the stockade. Why do you need so many horses?

58
00:06:32,122 --> 00:06:33,202
Unexpectedly,

59
00:06:33,922 --> 00:06:35,202
Cheng Dalei,

60
00:06:35,802 --> 00:06:37,522
He defeated the Black Rock Army.

61
00:06:38,442 --> 00:06:40,322
When they grow bigger one day,

62
00:06:40,682 --> 00:06:41,922
they will definitely threaten us.

63
00:06:42,922 --> 00:06:44,082
I'll take advantage of it now.

64
00:06:44,322 --> 00:06:45,762
I caught them off guard.

65
00:06:46,082 --> 00:06:46,522
Head of the Fortress,

66
00:06:46,722 --> 00:06:47,122
look,

67
00:06:47,402 --> 00:06:48,802
It's people from other stockade,

68
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:50,482
but they want a piece of it too?

69
00:06:50,802 --> 00:06:51,282
Let's go.

70
00:06:51,282 --> 00:06:53,082
Kill him,
