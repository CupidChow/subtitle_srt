1
00:01:38,602 --> 00:01:39,442
The dishes are here.

2
00:01:42,642 --> 00:01:43,322
Fill it up.

3
00:01:43,322 --> 00:01:44,002
Okay,

4
00:01:44,282 --> 00:01:44,962
Take your time.

5
00:01:47,442 --> 00:01:48,602
In today's battle,

6
00:01:48,922 --> 00:01:51,722
we have severely damaged the arrogance of Black Rock City,

7
00:01:51,722 --> 00:01:52,562
From now on,

8
00:01:52,722 --> 00:01:54,762
no one dares to bully us anymore.

9
00:01:54,802 --> 00:01:55,882
Yes.

10
00:01:58,162 --> 00:01:59,042
No matter how you say it,

11
00:01:59,042 --> 00:02:01,922
it's all because of Feihu Village alone.

12
00:02:02,082 --> 00:02:03,362
Look at what you said.

13
00:02:03,362 --> 00:02:04,642
Divide it into yours and mine.

14
00:02:04,842 --> 00:02:06,882
Aren't we all from Qingniu Mountain?

15
00:02:06,882 --> 00:02:07,762
We're a family.

16
00:02:08,042 --> 00:02:08,562
Am I right?

17
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:09,562
Go away.

18
00:02:10,002 --> 00:02:10,322
Yes.

19
00:02:10,562 --> 00:02:11,602
Master Gao is right.

20
00:02:11,602 --> 00:02:12,922
He's a family member on the mountain.

21
00:02:13,002 --> 00:02:14,082
I don't care about you, me or him.

22
00:02:14,162 --> 00:02:16,442
So I decided that we should create an alliance together,

23
00:02:16,602 --> 00:02:18,642
and all the Head of the Fortress will make the decision together.

24
00:02:18,762 --> 00:02:19,922
Let's work together,

25
00:02:20,002 --> 00:02:22,642
let's really unite in Qingniu Mountain,

26
00:02:22,802 --> 00:02:24,842
We'll build a beautiful home in Qingniu Mountain.

27
00:02:25,442 --> 00:02:26,202
Okay,

28
00:02:27,922 --> 00:02:28,682
Cheers.

29
00:02:31,842 --> 00:02:32,362
Ridiculous.

30
00:02:33,162 --> 00:02:34,882
Why should we decide Qingniu Mountain together?

31
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,282
What do you mean?

32
00:02:37,242 --> 00:02:38,002
What do I mean?

33
00:02:38,882 --> 00:02:41,202
There is only one Head of the Fortress in Qingniu Mountain,

34
00:02:42,002 --> 00:02:43,282
and that is

35
00:02:46,282 --> 00:02:47,082
He,

36
00:02:50,082 --> 00:02:51,362
Gosh.

37
00:02:57,362 --> 00:02:58,602
What's wrong with him? This kid.

38
00:03:06,962 --> 00:03:07,842
Miss Su,

39
00:03:07,842 --> 00:03:08,682
what's wrong with you?

40
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:10,122
No.

41
00:03:11,682 --> 00:03:12,562
Brother Lei,

42
00:03:13,882 --> 00:03:15,322
have a bite with me.

43
00:03:16,402 --> 00:03:17,362
Head of the White Fortress,

44
00:03:17,362 --> 00:03:18,082
Me

45
00:03:18,202 --> 00:03:19,562
When did Master Cheng

46
00:03:20,162 --> 00:03:21,322
marry such a beautiful wife

47
00:03:21,322 --> 00:03:24,082
who suppressed the village?

48
00:03:24,602 --> 00:03:26,122
Who is his wife

49
00:03:26,362 --> 00:03:28,002
who suppresses the village?

50
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,922
Then I won't be a stranger.

51
00:03:35,002 --> 00:03:35,882
Drink it.

52
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:37,162
Mr. Bai,

53
00:03:39,442 --> 00:03:40,482
excuse us.

54
00:03:53,602 --> 00:03:55,162
Why did you leave without telling me?

55
00:03:59,002 --> 00:04:00,602
It's full of alcohol,

56
00:04:01,682 --> 00:04:02,842
so I came out to get some fresh air.

57
00:04:04,402 --> 00:04:06,402
You always stay alone in the house.

58
00:04:06,522 --> 00:04:07,642
Of course I feel bored.

59
00:04:08,162 --> 00:04:11,162
As it happens, I've made a travel strategy for Qingniu Mountain,

60
00:04:11,442 --> 00:04:12,402
so I can put it on the agenda.

61
00:04:13,922 --> 00:04:15,602
When the time comes,

62
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:16,762
I'll take you boating,

63
00:04:17,282 --> 00:04:18,362
Have some barbecue,

64
00:04:18,682 --> 00:04:20,962
and look at the scenery here,

65
00:04:20,962 --> 00:04:21,802
Please let me go.

66
00:04:30,482 --> 00:04:30,962
Because,

67
00:04:30,962 --> 00:04:31,642
you should go.

68
00:04:37,522 --> 00:04:38,002
That's right.

69
00:04:38,962 --> 00:04:40,642
We're not on the same side at all.

70
00:04:42,122 --> 00:04:44,402
A rich lady like you,

71
00:04:44,402 --> 00:04:46,082
how could she hang out

72
00:04:46,082 --> 00:04:47,122
with people like us?

73
00:04:47,122 --> 00:04:47,642
Right?

74
00:04:47,882 --> 00:04:49,402
We can't afford to climb high.

75
00:04:55,842 --> 00:04:57,002
I've been tired

76
00:04:58,722 --> 00:04:59,522
lately. It's getting late.

77
00:05:00,482 --> 00:05:01,602
I'm going back to rest.

78
00:05:31,882 --> 00:05:32,802
Master,

79
00:05:33,682 --> 00:05:35,282
did you really let Miss Su go?

80
00:05:36,162 --> 00:05:38,522
Don't regret it.

81
00:05:39,042 --> 00:05:40,282
Those who can keep her,

82
00:05:40,762 --> 00:05:41,882
can't keep her heart.

83
00:05:46,282 --> 00:05:47,082
Sister Su,

84
00:05:47,282 --> 00:05:49,002
it's because your father is seriously ill,

85
00:05:49,002 --> 00:05:49,882
That's why I'm in a hurry to go back.

86
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:51,802
Why didn't you make it clear to the boss?

87
00:05:52,442 --> 00:05:54,162
Master must have drunk too much too.

88
00:05:54,162 --> 00:05:54,762
A moment of anger?

89
00:05:54,922 --> 00:05:56,722
Don't take it to heart.

90
00:05:57,362 --> 00:05:58,082
Ling'er,

91
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:00,122
thank you for taking care of me these days,

92
00:06:01,082 --> 00:06:02,362
Let's meet again.

93
00:06:04,122 --> 00:06:04,762
Brother Lin,

94
00:06:04,762 --> 00:06:05,322
Brother Qin,

95
00:06:06,402 --> 00:06:07,162
Thank you for your hard work.

96
00:06:07,282 --> 00:06:08,202
It's no big deal.

97
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:09,402
Be careful on the way.

98
00:06:19,322 --> 00:06:20,282
Hey.

99
00:06:31,842 --> 00:06:34,162
I've made a travel strategy for Qingniu Mountain,

100
00:06:34,362 --> 00:06:35,322
so I can put it on the agenda.

101
00:06:35,842 --> 00:06:37,522
When the time comes,

102
00:06:37,842 --> 00:06:38,722
I'll take you boating,

103
00:06:39,242 --> 00:06:40,322
Have some barbecue,

104
00:06:40,682 --> 00:06:42,562
and look at the scenery here,

105
00:06:42,562 --> 00:06:43,282
Please let me go.

106
00:06:45,042 --> 00:06:47,242
Affectionate young man.

107
00:06:50,562 --> 00:06:51,522
Congratulations on completing all the tasks

108
00:06:51,522 --> 00:06:53,642
to pacify Qingniu Mountain,

109
00:06:54,722 --> 00:06:55,722
But next,

110
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:57,162
you and your little friend,

111
00:06:57,482 --> 00:06:59,842
will be in a more dangerous situation.

112
00:07:00,762 --> 00:07:02,362
to meet more difficult challenges.

113
00:07:04,442 --> 00:07:05,602
Life and death,

114
00:07:05,922 --> 00:07:07,682
often in your mind.

115
00:07:08,682 --> 00:07:10,402
So for every choice you make next,

116
00:07:10,842 --> 00:07:13,482
you must be very careful.

117
00:07:15,162 --> 00:07:16,002
It's because of me.

118
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:16,522
You should go.

119
00:07:22,482 --> 00:07:23,642
For you,

120
00:07:24,642 --> 00:07:28,002
staying in Falling Leaf City is the safest.

121
00:07:48,442 --> 00:07:49,762
When mountains and rivers meet,

122
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,242
there will be times when we meet.

123
00:07:51,322 --> 00:07:52,522
Ling'er, don't be too sad.

124
00:07:55,322 --> 00:07:56,282
I said

125
00:07:56,722 --> 00:07:59,042
Ling'er is crying because she's in a good relationship with Su Ying,

126
00:07:59,362 --> 00:08:00,522
Why are you crying, a grown-up?

127
00:08:00,722 --> 00:08:02,242
I don't know where Ling'er

128
00:08:02,242 --> 00:08:03,802
picked a bunch of red fruits,

129
00:08:03,802 --> 00:08:06,602
I feel like my nose and mouth are burning with fire,

130
00:08:07,042 --> 00:08:09,402
so I can't help but shed tears.

131
00:08:10,602 --> 00:08:11,122
Ah,

132
00:08:11,162 --> 00:08:12,242
Chili,
