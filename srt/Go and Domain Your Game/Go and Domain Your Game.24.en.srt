1
00:01:41,482 --> 00:01:42,522
Cheng Dalei,

2
00:01:44,602 --> 00:01:45,882
how dare you,

3
00:01:46,482 --> 00:01:47,642
How dare you kill Her Highness?

4
00:01:48,002 --> 00:01:49,282
If I say I didn't kill him.

5
00:01:49,962 --> 00:01:50,802
Believe it or not?

6
00:01:51,122 --> 00:01:52,162
You still want to argue.

7
00:01:52,842 --> 00:01:53,802
Kill them!

8
00:01:54,282 --> 00:01:54,682
Let's go.

9
00:02:10,762 --> 00:02:12,082
Which way are you going, Master?

10
00:02:13,562 --> 00:02:14,282
By the way,

11
00:02:14,682 --> 00:02:15,842
the awakening skill of the military adviser,

12
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:17,202
Advisor,

13
00:02:17,442 --> 00:02:18,602
as far as you can see,

14
00:02:18,682 --> 00:02:19,402
Which way should I go?

15
00:02:25,962 --> 00:02:26,402
This way.

16
00:02:26,482 --> 00:02:26,882
Okay,

17
00:02:29,362 --> 00:02:30,202
Hey,

18
00:02:30,322 --> 00:02:31,362
Where are you going?

19
00:02:38,042 --> 00:02:38,522
Advisor,

20
00:02:39,202 --> 00:02:39,802
which way should we go?

21
00:02:41,242 --> 00:02:41,682
Let's go that way.

22
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:42,162
Okay,

23
00:02:43,522 --> 00:02:43,962
Hey,

24
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:44,762
What are you doing?

25
00:02:44,842 --> 00:02:45,642
You don't listen to me.

26
00:02:46,002 --> 00:02:47,602
Come on.

27
00:02:48,082 --> 00:02:49,122
What are you doing?

28
00:02:49,202 --> 00:02:50,162
Go that way.

29
00:02:50,802 --> 00:02:52,202
Go that way.

30
00:02:52,322 --> 00:02:54,162
Go that way.

31
00:02:58,042 --> 00:02:58,522
Master

32
00:02:58,562 --> 00:02:59,242
is at a fork in the road again,

33
00:02:59,282 --> 00:03:00,082
What should I do?

34
00:03:02,442 --> 00:03:04,082
Advisor, in your opinion,

35
00:03:04,082 --> 00:03:04,682
which way should we go?

36
00:03:05,922 --> 00:03:06,402
I don't know.

37
00:03:07,402 --> 00:03:08,082
Stop messing around.

38
00:03:08,082 --> 00:03:08,882
Are you running for your life?

39
00:03:09,442 --> 00:03:11,722
Master, you're the one who's making a scene

40
00:03:12,282 --> 00:03:14,242
Okay, I used to offer brilliant ideas,

41
00:03:14,242 --> 00:03:15,082
You turned a deaf ear to it.

42
00:03:15,282 --> 00:03:15,922
This time,

43
00:03:16,442 --> 00:03:17,282
I won't talk about it.

44
00:03:18,602 --> 00:03:19,682
Advisor, I was wrong.

45
00:03:19,682 --> 00:03:20,282
Is it OK?

46
00:03:20,362 --> 00:03:22,962
This time, I'll go wherever you say.

47
00:03:22,962 --> 00:03:23,962
I'll definitely listen to you, okay?

48
00:03:24,202 --> 00:03:24,722
Really?

49
00:03:24,842 --> 00:03:25,402
Really?

50
00:03:27,722 --> 00:03:28,562
since

51
00:03:28,722 --> 00:03:31,322
Master lost his way and came back.

52
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:34,002
I'll point to a clear path,

53
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:36,842
although the path is steep,

54
00:03:37,122 --> 00:03:39,282
But with twists and turns,

55
00:03:40,082 --> 00:03:41,802
chasing troops is not easy to move forward,

56
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:42,882
Take the path.

57
00:03:48,082 --> 00:03:48,722
What?

58
00:03:49,522 --> 00:03:51,522
Advisor, I should

59
00:03:52,162 --> 00:03:52,722
take the main road.

60
00:03:52,842 --> 00:03:53,562
Master,

61
00:03:53,682 --> 00:03:55,162
you're teasing me again,

62
00:03:55,362 --> 00:03:57,802
This is a matter of life and death.

63
00:03:57,882 --> 00:03:58,442
If you don't leave,

64
00:03:58,882 --> 00:03:59,322
I'll leave.

65
00:03:59,802 --> 00:04:00,842
Don't, Advisor.

66
00:04:00,842 --> 00:04:01,562
I'm just showing you,

67
00:04:01,802 --> 00:04:02,842
I was right.

68
00:04:09,762 --> 00:04:11,762
Advisor.

69
00:04:25,922 --> 00:04:26,722
Master,

70
00:04:27,042 --> 00:04:28,642
the alliance turned out to be a conspiracy.

71
00:04:29,082 --> 00:04:30,282
They still want to kill us.

72
00:04:31,002 --> 00:04:31,722
However,

73
00:04:32,242 --> 00:04:33,522
Han Xuanzhi has to

74
00:04:33,522 --> 00:04:34,602
pay for his life.

75
00:04:35,802 --> 00:04:36,442
Master,

76
00:04:37,082 --> 00:04:39,122
who do you think killed Han Xuan Zhi?

77
00:04:39,762 --> 00:04:40,522
I don't know either.

78
00:04:41,442 --> 00:04:43,122
But one thing I know for sure,

79
00:04:43,562 --> 00:04:45,362
that person definitely doesn't want us

80
00:04:45,362 --> 00:04:46,842
to form an alliance with Black Rock City.

81
00:04:58,642 --> 00:04:59,802
Desperate young man.

82
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,162
I'm awake.

83
00:05:01,642 --> 00:05:02,882
Seeing how miserable you are,

84
00:05:03,082 --> 00:05:05,522
I'll give you the prize you accumulated

85
00:05:05,602 --> 00:05:06,762
in the previous stage.

86
00:05:13,162 --> 00:05:15,202
It's really a way out.

87
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:17,322
Judging from the way you look, you've already experienced

88
00:05:17,322 --> 00:05:18,522
the dangers of the new stage.

89
00:05:19,762 --> 00:05:20,562
At this stage,

90
00:05:20,642 --> 00:05:22,322
you will be faced with multiple tasks at the same time,

91
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,722
These tasks vary in difficulty.

92
00:05:25,002 --> 00:05:27,482
You can choose to do it or not.

93
00:05:27,602 --> 00:05:29,002
But every choice you make

94
00:05:29,082 --> 00:05:30,882
will affect and determine

95
00:05:30,882 --> 00:05:32,362
you and your partner,

96
00:05:32,362 --> 00:05:34,722
The fate and ending of the future.

97
00:05:45,242 --> 00:05:47,482
It's getting harder and harder.

98
00:06:01,682 --> 00:06:03,442
I'm sorry,

99
00:06:04,882 --> 00:06:08,202
it's all my fault that I was willful

100
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:11,522
and caused everyone to fall into this cave.

101
00:06:13,922 --> 00:06:14,362
adviser

102
00:06:14,362 --> 00:06:16,082
It's just a trivial matter. Why bother?

103
00:06:16,202 --> 00:06:17,522
I'm sorry,

104
00:06:20,202 --> 00:06:20,922
Advisor.

105
00:06:21,202 --> 00:06:21,962
Don't blame yourself.

106
00:06:25,522 --> 00:06:26,682
From now on,

107
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:28,922
I won't be a burden to you.

108
00:06:57,962 --> 00:06:59,682
She died and lived after her death.

109
00:06:59,682 --> 00:07:01,682
Everything is under control.

110
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:05,802
With this magic weapon, we can break through.

111
00:07:15,562 --> 00:07:16,402
It's gone.

112
00:07:17,242 --> 00:07:18,802
Why is it gone?

113
00:07:23,282 --> 00:07:25,722
I didn't expect this magic weapon to have durability.

114
00:07:27,042 --> 00:07:28,042
Why do you still have it?

115
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,202
This is.

116
00:07:41,122 --> 00:07:43,562
There are side effects.

117
00:07:46,882 --> 00:07:48,002
Master,

118
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:51,082
with the magic weapon, we are even more powerful now.

119
00:07:51,642 --> 00:07:52,922
Cheng Dalei,
