1
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:36,602
Master,

2
00:01:36,602 --> 00:01:39,602
something bad happened.

3
00:01:42,042 --> 00:01:43,202
What's wrong, Ling'er?

4
00:01:43,202 --> 00:01:44,042
Master,

5
00:01:44,042 --> 00:01:45,682
there are a lot of turnips here.

6
00:01:49,082 --> 00:01:49,762
Ling'er,

7
00:01:50,122 --> 00:01:51,842
do you have any misunderstanding

8
00:01:51,842 --> 00:01:52,602
about the word "bad for big things"?

9
00:01:53,882 --> 00:01:55,882
A boy with a false alarm.

10
00:01:56,202 --> 00:01:58,802
Is the reward of ten acres of fertile land surprising?

11
00:01:58,922 --> 00:01:59,562
Are you surprised?

12
00:02:00,122 --> 00:02:01,402
Then what comes with it

13
00:02:01,402 --> 00:02:02,802
is also a new task.

14
00:02:03,762 --> 00:02:04,522
Pull out all the turnips

15
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:07,922
in ten acres of fertile land in one day,

16
00:02:08,242 --> 00:02:08,802
Ah,

17
00:02:09,402 --> 00:02:10,402
There are so many turnips,

18
00:02:10,722 --> 00:02:12,082
they can't be pulled out in a week.

19
00:02:13,522 --> 00:02:14,202
Master,

20
00:02:15,042 --> 00:02:18,242
it's natural for you to let me go into battle and kill the enemy.

21
00:02:18,962 --> 00:02:19,882
But Xiatian

22
00:02:21,082 --> 00:02:21,962
has no experience.

23
00:02:23,562 --> 00:02:24,362
Yeah,

24
00:02:25,882 --> 00:02:27,602
I don't have any experience.

25
00:02:27,962 --> 00:02:28,802
Master,

26
00:02:29,202 --> 00:02:30,482
why do we have to pull out

27
00:02:30,482 --> 00:02:32,282
all these radishes in one day.

28
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,482
We don't have enough manpower.

29
00:02:43,842 --> 00:02:44,682
Don't look at me.

30
00:02:45,802 --> 00:02:46,682
I'm a scholar.

31
00:02:51,842 --> 00:02:53,522
The profiteers of Toad Village.

32
00:03:00,962 --> 00:03:01,362
Me,

33
00:03:02,202 --> 00:03:03,482
I'll fight with you.

34
00:03:13,602 --> 00:03:14,202
Cheng Dalei,

35
00:03:14,562 --> 00:03:15,602
you're shoddy,

36
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:17,962
You used bad horses to fool all the food

37
00:03:18,242 --> 00:03:18,962
in Feihu Village,

38
00:03:19,482 --> 00:03:20,402
I won't forgive you.

39
00:03:21,722 --> 00:03:22,882
What other tricks do you want to play?

40
00:03:23,802 --> 00:03:25,002
I won't buy it.

41
00:03:26,362 --> 00:03:27,242
Village Head Gao, calm down. How about

42
00:03:27,242 --> 00:03:28,722
I give you some food?

43
00:03:31,282 --> 00:03:32,282
Food.

44
00:03:40,362 --> 00:03:41,482
I can't believe it.

45
00:03:41,642 --> 00:03:43,242
You're doing farm work in the field.

46
00:03:43,642 --> 00:03:45,162
Feihu Fortress has lost all its face,

47
00:03:45,162 --> 00:03:46,322
Head of the Fortress,

48
00:03:46,522 --> 00:03:48,322
The Oviductus Village is willing to give us

49
00:03:48,602 --> 00:03:49,882
half of the harvest in the field for nothing,

50
00:03:50,802 --> 00:03:52,482
Isn't it better than picking up money?

51
00:03:52,802 --> 00:03:54,282
They're humiliating us.

52
00:03:54,282 --> 00:03:56,642
Maybe he's hiding somewhere and snickering.

53
00:03:57,042 --> 00:03:58,082
Brother, have some water.

54
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:03,042
Brother, you've worked hard.

55
00:04:03,122 --> 00:04:04,682
I'll send you some snacks later.

56
00:04:05,762 --> 00:04:06,362
I'm fine.

57
00:04:06,522 --> 00:04:07,842
Let's pull out

58
00:04:08,042 --> 00:04:08,882
the whole field.

59
00:04:09,002 --> 00:04:09,762
Wow,

60
00:04:10,202 --> 00:04:11,922
You've finished an acre of land

61
00:04:12,482 --> 00:04:14,002
so quickly. You're amazing.

62
00:04:15,802 --> 00:04:16,962
Well, it's nothing.

63
00:04:17,202 --> 00:04:18,642
Before I entered Feihu Village,

64
00:04:18,762 --> 00:04:19,682
but in our village,

65
00:04:20,082 --> 00:04:21,042
First place in pulling turnips.

66
00:04:21,362 --> 00:04:22,082
Nonsense,

67
00:04:22,442 --> 00:04:23,362
You losers!

68
00:04:23,962 --> 00:04:25,002
I'm so disappointed.

69
00:04:30,882 --> 00:04:31,482
See?

70
00:04:31,882 --> 00:04:32,882
At your speed,

71
00:04:33,042 --> 00:04:33,802
like a turtle,

72
00:04:34,362 --> 00:04:36,922
That's called pulling turnips.

73
00:04:44,682 --> 00:04:45,962
Without ten years of farming experience,

74
00:04:45,962 --> 00:04:47,202
I can't do this.

75
00:04:47,202 --> 00:04:48,842
Master Gao is indeed a cultivator.

76
00:04:57,082 --> 00:04:57,802
Sister Su,

77
00:04:58,122 --> 00:04:58,722
Sister Su,

78
00:04:58,722 --> 00:05:00,202
Something bad happened.

79
00:05:00,242 --> 00:05:00,802
What's wrong?

80
00:05:01,522 --> 00:05:02,002
They,

81
00:05:02,322 --> 00:05:03,282
They,

82
00:05:03,322 --> 00:05:04,762
They ate too much.

83
00:05:05,042 --> 00:05:06,282
I'm too busy in the kitchen.

84
00:05:06,282 --> 00:05:08,202
Can you help me?

85
00:05:10,482 --> 00:05:11,722
No problem.

86
00:05:12,242 --> 00:05:13,562
But Ling'er,

87
00:05:13,682 --> 00:05:16,522
do you have any misunderstanding

88
00:05:16,522 --> 00:05:17,642
about the word "bad things"?

89
00:05:27,602 --> 00:05:29,202
Sister Su is really ingenious,

90
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:31,162
even Wowotou can make it so beautiful.

91
00:05:31,722 --> 00:05:33,602
My Su family started out as a restaurant,

92
00:05:34,122 --> 00:05:36,402
and I followed my father since I was a child,

93
00:05:36,442 --> 00:05:37,842
So I learned some cooking skills,

94
00:05:38,242 --> 00:05:38,962
Wow,

95
00:05:39,402 --> 00:05:41,522
Then the boss and the others will be blessed in the future.

96
00:05:43,882 --> 00:05:44,642
Ling'er,

97
00:05:45,402 --> 00:05:46,882
you're a girl,

98
00:05:47,002 --> 00:05:49,362
When you hang out with these smelly men every day,

99
00:05:49,722 --> 00:05:51,242
you must have no choice.

100
00:05:51,562 --> 00:05:52,522
No.

101
00:05:52,962 --> 00:05:54,202
Now the world is in such a mess,

102
00:05:54,482 --> 00:05:55,922
we take care of each other on the mountain,

103
00:05:56,162 --> 00:05:57,282
Instead, I live a more stable life.

104
00:05:57,802 --> 00:05:59,642
And the boss is very kind to us,

105
00:05:59,882 --> 00:06:00,682
and he also told me,

106
00:06:00,882 --> 00:06:01,962
He asked me to spend more time with you.

107
00:06:03,962 --> 00:06:05,722
Cheng Dalei is the leader of the cottage,

108
00:06:06,522 --> 00:06:08,402
I don't believe that he is a good person?

109
00:06:09,562 --> 00:06:09,922
Miss Su,

110
00:06:09,922 --> 00:06:10,522
what a coincidence.

111
00:06:12,882 --> 00:06:14,962
You must be bored after staying at home for a long time.

112
00:06:16,962 --> 00:06:19,722
I didn't expect you guys to do farm work.

113
00:06:23,042 --> 00:06:24,842
This is their old job.

114
00:06:26,202 --> 00:06:27,522
If that's the case,

115
00:06:27,842 --> 00:06:29,682
why did you go to Shanla to help build the village?

116
00:06:29,802 --> 00:06:31,522
Because they are lazy and lazy,

117
00:06:32,282 --> 00:06:33,402
these people,

118
00:06:33,842 --> 00:06:35,322
They are ordinary people,

119
00:06:35,482 --> 00:06:38,202
and they also want to earn a living with their hands.

120
00:06:38,362 --> 00:06:40,242
You can gain something by sweat.

121
00:06:40,722 --> 00:06:42,082
If it wasn't for the wrong time,

122
00:06:42,482 --> 00:06:43,962
who would want to live on this mountain

123
00:06:44,042 --> 00:06:45,522
without a meal

124
00:06:45,522 --> 00:06:47,202
and worrying about it?

125
00:06:47,722 --> 00:06:49,322
Look how hard they work on farm work,

126
00:06:49,722 --> 00:06:50,282
Miss Su,

127
00:06:50,762 --> 00:06:52,202
Look at them now.

128
00:06:52,322 --> 00:06:52,962
Do you think

129
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,202
they are still the lazy people

130
00:06:54,202 --> 00:06:55,362
you call them?

131
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:03,482
Wow,

132
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:06,962
I haven't felt this full for a long time.

133
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:09,362
That's great.
