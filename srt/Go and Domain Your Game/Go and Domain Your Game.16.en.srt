1
00:01:50,122 --> 00:01:50,882
I didn't expect that

2
00:01:52,722 --> 00:01:54,122
you're quite good at cooking.

3
00:01:58,562 --> 00:02:01,322
My father started out as a restaurant,

4
00:02:01,762 --> 00:02:03,002
so.

5
00:02:09,002 --> 00:02:10,322
I'll get back to work.

6
00:02:16,802 --> 00:02:18,122
I'll eat it if you don't want to.

7
00:02:30,122 --> 00:02:30,722
Miss Su

8
00:02:39,442 --> 00:02:40,082
told me,

9
00:02:41,122 --> 00:02:42,162
What have you been through

10
00:02:42,842 --> 00:02:44,082
during this period?

11
00:02:52,882 --> 00:02:54,642
You've been living in the bandits'den for so long.

12
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,402
How dare you come back.

13
00:02:57,082 --> 00:02:57,922
You've really disgraced

14
00:02:58,282 --> 00:02:59,442
the Su family.

15
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:04,122
Now that Old Master has passed away,

16
00:03:04,522 --> 00:03:05,162
this family,

17
00:03:05,402 --> 00:03:08,242
I'm the only one who can barely support it.

18
00:03:10,602 --> 00:03:11,522
This is 520!

19
00:03:12,242 --> 00:03:12,882
Take it.

20
00:03:13,922 --> 00:03:15,122
From now on,

21
00:03:15,682 --> 00:03:17,202
You and my Su family,

22
00:03:17,762 --> 00:03:19,482
have nothing to do with each other.

23
00:03:27,362 --> 00:03:28,642
How dare he bully you like this?

24
00:03:29,002 --> 00:03:30,002
I'm going to find her now.

25
00:03:30,202 --> 00:03:30,722
Don't go!

26
00:03:30,802 --> 00:03:32,562
In this way, their slander will be confirmed.

27
00:03:45,602 --> 00:03:47,162
I thought when you came to Falling Leaf City,

28
00:03:47,642 --> 00:03:48,762
it was the best destination.

29
00:03:50,322 --> 00:03:51,602
I didn't expect it to turn out like this.

30
00:03:54,282 --> 00:03:55,522
Why don't you come back to Toad Village with me.

31
00:03:56,242 --> 00:03:57,442
I can protect you.

32
00:04:03,162 --> 00:04:04,682
I didn't ask for 520.

33
00:04:06,762 --> 00:04:08,242
But this restaurant,

34
00:04:10,962 --> 00:04:13,602
even though it's just a run-down small restaurant,

35
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,522
But it's where my father started.

36
00:04:20,042 --> 00:04:22,362
This is also my only thought.

37
00:04:25,922 --> 00:04:27,322
I'll always be there

38
00:04:31,442 --> 00:04:33,122
for the young man it reunites.

39
00:04:33,362 --> 00:04:35,282
I'm here to announce a new mission.

40
00:04:35,562 --> 00:04:37,122
To save a dilapidated restaurant,

41
00:04:37,282 --> 00:04:38,322
with your wisdom,

42
00:04:38,522 --> 00:04:41,362
Let this dilapidated restaurant come back to life.

43
00:04:43,042 --> 00:04:44,002
Let me help you.

44
00:04:53,482 --> 00:04:54,242
Uncle Oho,

45
00:04:54,282 --> 00:04:55,442
there you are.

46
00:04:55,842 --> 00:04:57,162
Miss Liu, have a seat.

47
00:04:58,962 --> 00:04:59,962
Uncle Ou Hou,

48
00:05:00,362 --> 00:05:01,242
not know

49
00:05:03,962 --> 00:05:06,522
Du Mao agreed to release the Liu Army.

50
00:05:06,562 --> 00:05:07,082
Really?

51
00:05:07,402 --> 00:05:08,242
That's great.

52
00:05:09,922 --> 00:05:10,762
However,

53
00:05:11,442 --> 00:05:13,202
they want 5. 2 thousand

54
00:05:13,882 --> 00:05:16,282
to take all the money in the stockade,

55
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:17,202
I paid the deposit.

56
00:05:18,202 --> 00:05:20,042
The rest is still being raised.

57
00:05:23,482 --> 00:05:24,762
My brother,

58
00:05:25,202 --> 00:05:26,402
you've done so much

59
00:05:27,442 --> 00:05:29,042
for the Liu family.

60
00:05:29,682 --> 00:05:30,322
Miss Liu,

61
00:05:30,802 --> 00:05:31,642
you're here.

62
00:05:32,442 --> 00:05:33,722
Brother Idol,

63
00:05:35,842 --> 00:05:37,922
that night in the brothel,

64
00:05:37,922 --> 00:05:39,042
You treat me.

65
00:05:42,682 --> 00:05:44,202
I thought

66
00:05:46,602 --> 00:05:48,602
you didn't expect you

67
00:05:51,562 --> 00:05:52,482
to be shameless!

68
00:05:55,642 --> 00:05:57,962
The hero is sad and the beauty is off.

69
00:05:59,602 --> 00:06:01,642
My brother.

70
00:06:05,042 --> 00:06:06,682
Miss Su,

71
00:06:07,162 --> 00:06:09,602
Master has been in the kitchen for many hours.

72
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:10,442
You've been sulking.

73
00:06:10,882 --> 00:06:12,282
Since you misunderstood,

74
00:06:12,282 --> 00:06:13,442
let's go in and have a look.

75
00:06:15,802 --> 00:06:17,642
He didn't explain it to me

76
00:06:17,682 --> 00:06:18,682
in the first place.

77
00:06:19,082 --> 00:06:21,042
He was insatiable for a while.

78
00:06:21,042 --> 00:06:22,202
I don't know why it's better to have a bird in hand

79
00:06:22,202 --> 00:06:24,042
than to have a flock of birds in the forest.

80
00:06:26,602 --> 00:06:27,562
What's that smell?

81
00:06:28,082 --> 00:06:28,802
It smells so good.

82
00:06:30,042 --> 00:06:31,402
I've found a way

83
00:06:31,402 --> 00:06:32,962
to bring this restaurant back to life.

84
00:06:40,922 --> 00:06:42,002
Drink some water,

85
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:44,642
all the restaurants

86
00:06:44,882 --> 00:06:46,162
in Falling Leaf City

87
00:06:46,482 --> 00:06:48,922
have been trampled under your feet by Jianghe Tower.

88
00:06:49,562 --> 00:06:51,482
Especially in the Four Seas Tower opposite,

89
00:06:51,842 --> 00:06:54,322
I think they even took off the signboard this morning.

90
00:06:54,602 --> 00:06:55,682
Thank you for taking care of me.

91
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,362
It's just that when I opened the door to do business,

92
00:06:57,802 --> 00:06:59,002
I was not careful,

93
00:06:59,402 --> 00:07:00,402
It's such a big business.

94
00:07:01,362 --> 00:07:01,962
Oh, my gosh,

95
00:07:01,962 --> 00:07:04,122
The business of our peers has collapsed.

96
00:07:04,162 --> 00:07:05,322
I can't bear it.
