1
00:01:18,082 --> 00:01:19,122
Master is dead.

2
00:01:19,122 --> 00:01:20,282
Let's run.

3
00:01:20,282 --> 00:01:21,202
Oh no.

4
00:01:21,202 --> 00:01:22,362
We're done talking nonsense in Toad Village.

5
00:01:22,362 --> 00:01:24,042
The officers and men of Black Rock will come at any time.

6
00:01:24,282 --> 00:01:25,162
Don't worry about the Head of the Fortress.

7
00:01:25,162 --> 00:01:26,682
Take the valuable stuff and leave.

8
00:01:28,402 --> 00:01:30,362
Player Cheng Dalei has logged in

9
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:34,762
and is loading the game.

10
00:01:40,442 --> 00:01:41,482
Where am I?

11
00:01:45,882 --> 00:01:47,202
Why am I wearing this?

12
00:01:52,562 --> 00:01:54,882
System loading completed.

13
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:56,482
Welcome to our world.

14
00:01:56,482 --> 00:01:58,162
At the beginning of a mountain,

15
00:01:58,162 --> 00:01:59,762
wealth depends on breaking through the barrier,

16
00:02:01,362 --> 00:02:04,402
You are about to enter the Great Wu State in troubled times,

17
00:02:04,402 --> 00:02:07,762
where the people are displaced and go up the mountain to build a village,

18
00:02:07,802 --> 00:02:09,642
And you will be the Head of Toad Village.

19
00:02:09,882 --> 00:02:12,282
To lead our partners to revitalize the youth of the cottage

20
00:02:13,002 --> 00:02:16,802
and to uphold justice with all their blood,

21
00:02:16,842 --> 00:02:19,922
Be a fake king who hoes the strong and helps the weak.

22
00:02:21,162 --> 00:02:22,122
I'm in the game.

23
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:23,042
Smart.

24
00:02:24,722 --> 00:02:25,882
From now on,

25
00:02:25,922 --> 00:02:27,722
As the Head of Toad Village,

26
00:02:28,162 --> 00:02:30,242
I'm going to give you the first mission.

27
00:02:30,242 --> 00:02:32,282
Keep the friends in the stockade.

28
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,522
What does this have to do with me?

29
00:02:34,442 --> 00:02:35,002
By the way,

30
00:02:35,402 --> 00:02:36,562
I forgot to tell you.

31
00:02:36,962 --> 00:02:38,442
If you can't finish the task,

32
00:02:41,042 --> 00:02:43,122
I'll kill you.

33
00:02:46,762 --> 00:02:47,922
Why should I listen to you?

34
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:49,082
You wicked woman,

35
00:02:49,322 --> 00:02:50,282
let me out!

36
00:02:52,442 --> 00:02:54,802
Who are you calling a bad woman?

37
00:03:00,402 --> 00:03:01,202
Well,

38
00:03:03,202 --> 00:03:04,442
let's talk it out.

39
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,242
Ah.

40
00:03:21,362 --> 00:03:22,682
Hey.

41
00:03:27,122 --> 00:03:29,562
Village Head tricked the corpse?

42
00:03:32,322 --> 00:03:33,762
I haven't even spoken yet.

43
00:03:34,082 --> 00:03:36,122
You gave me a chance to finish the task.

44
00:03:38,602 --> 00:03:41,722
Hey, I played a game and became the Head of the Fortress.

45
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:43,922
If you don't work harder, you'll be wiped out.

46
00:03:44,322 --> 00:03:45,562
Head of the Fortress,

47
00:03:45,562 --> 00:03:47,322
you're awake.

48
00:03:54,482 --> 00:03:55,322
Advisor,

49
00:03:57,722 --> 00:03:59,802
you made a fool of yourself when you went down the mountain.

50
00:03:59,802 --> 00:04:01,682
He's been in a coma for over a month.

51
00:04:01,882 --> 00:04:04,562
I've always been worried about you.

52
00:04:04,682 --> 00:04:05,402
Advisor Xu,

53
00:04:05,882 --> 00:04:06,922
it's a good thing you're willing to stay.

54
00:04:07,322 --> 00:04:09,522
Let's go and get our brothers back together.

55
00:04:09,962 --> 00:04:11,242
I want to give you a leg.

56
00:04:11,242 --> 00:04:12,482
You're holding on to my skin.

57
00:04:12,482 --> 00:04:13,882
This thing can be sold for a lot of money.

58
00:04:17,162 --> 00:04:18,322
Advisor, please stay.

59
00:04:19,522 --> 00:04:20,802
I still have something to say.

60
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,802
Thanks to the love of the Head of the Fortress,

61
00:04:23,922 --> 00:04:25,842
but the way the cottage is now,

62
00:04:25,842 --> 00:04:26,802
You saw it.

63
00:04:27,082 --> 00:04:28,522
The bottom is to rebound.

64
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,122
Squat down to jump higher.

65
00:04:30,322 --> 00:04:31,002
Our cottage

66
00:04:31,002 --> 00:04:32,322
can be revived.

67
00:04:32,482 --> 00:04:34,322
Advisor, please believe me.

68
00:04:34,882 --> 00:04:36,002
To be honest,

69
00:04:36,282 --> 00:04:37,882
Since you took over,

70
00:04:37,882 --> 00:04:39,602
have you had enough to eat?

71
00:04:40,802 --> 00:04:41,922
Do you know how to use a knife?

72
00:04:42,322 --> 00:04:43,962
In this dangerous world,

73
00:04:43,962 --> 00:04:45,282
can you survive?

74
00:04:48,282 --> 00:04:49,402
But Advisor,

75
00:04:49,882 --> 00:04:51,322
I want to try again.

76
00:04:51,362 --> 00:04:52,402
Okay,

77
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:55,682
That's what I've been waiting for all these years.

78
00:05:02,482 --> 00:05:03,242
Ah,

79
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,242
There's a reward for completing the task?

80
00:05:06,082 --> 00:05:06,562
Hey,

81
00:05:08,322 --> 00:05:09,282
Where are the weapons?

82
00:05:10,402 --> 00:05:11,282
Is it on you?

83
00:05:12,282 --> 00:05:12,842
Father,

84
00:05:12,962 --> 00:05:13,682
are you here?

85
00:05:13,722 --> 00:05:14,802
Let's go now.

86
00:05:24,602 --> 00:05:25,802
Ling'er,

87
00:05:25,842 --> 00:05:27,722
we're not leaving.

88
00:05:27,802 --> 00:05:29,282
You're not leaving again.

89
00:05:30,802 --> 00:05:32,682
I also said that I took this axe.

90
00:05:32,682 --> 00:05:34,322
Are you going to sell it down the mountain?

91
00:05:38,282 --> 00:05:39,162
Axe,

92
00:05:41,962 --> 00:05:42,602
Wow,

93
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,162
Send a magic weapon

94
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:45,722
as soon as you come up. Try it now.

95
00:05:53,202 --> 00:05:54,442
This is an interesting start.

96
00:05:55,842 --> 00:05:57,962
Why does the Head of the Fortress look like a different person?

97
00:05:59,882 --> 00:06:01,842
From now on, don't call me Head of the Fortress.

98
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:04,842
Calling me Master

99
00:06:16,282 --> 00:06:19,122
for such a big battle seems to be the people's fat and cream.

100
00:06:19,122 --> 00:06:21,082
That's too much

101
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:24,642
Let me see Boss,

102
00:06:25,122 --> 00:06:26,282
There are too many people here.

103
00:06:26,402 --> 00:06:28,042
Let's switch to a group with fewer people.

104
00:06:28,482 --> 00:06:29,042
It's them.

105
00:06:29,162 --> 00:06:29,562
Let's go.

106
00:06:34,162 --> 00:06:35,402
Then you are the villains.

107
00:06:35,442 --> 00:06:36,242
Today, with three axes,

108
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:37,362
I'm going to do justice for heaven.

109
00:06:37,562 --> 00:06:38,282
Miss Su,

110
00:06:38,562 --> 00:06:39,922
from today on,

111
00:06:40,042 --> 00:06:41,962
I'm your wife who suppresses the village,

112
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:42,762
Me,

113
00:06:42,762 --> 00:06:44,042
Canghai Lin Shaoyu.

114
00:06:44,122 --> 00:06:45,242
Come and challenge me.

115
00:06:45,242 --> 00:06:46,842
Someone is going to attack Toad Village.
