1
00:01:42,322 --> 00:01:44,482
I found the satisfaction of this kind of labor again.

2
00:01:45,642 --> 00:01:46,962
I'm so happy.

3
00:01:48,962 --> 00:01:49,482
Yes,

4
00:01:50,162 --> 00:01:52,202
when is the next busy farming season?

5
00:01:52,922 --> 00:01:53,602
I'm looking forward to it.

6
00:01:55,162 --> 00:01:56,322
Mr. Gao, thank you for your hard work.

7
00:01:57,282 --> 00:01:58,962
This kilo of radish is your reward.

8
00:01:59,842 --> 00:02:00,162
Well,

9
00:02:01,362 --> 00:02:01,842
Oh, by the way,

10
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,322
you left your knife in the field.

11
00:02:03,722 --> 00:02:04,202
Thank you.

12
00:02:06,682 --> 00:02:07,522
Knife,

13
00:02:10,482 --> 00:02:11,402
Who am I?

14
00:02:14,242 --> 00:02:15,082
Who am I?

15
00:02:28,562 --> 00:02:29,322
Head of the Fortress,

16
00:02:29,442 --> 00:02:31,802
you haven't taken the radish yet.

17
00:02:36,202 --> 00:02:37,682
Lazy boy.

18
00:02:38,402 --> 00:02:39,442
Congratulations for completing the task

19
00:02:39,442 --> 00:02:41,802
of harvesting ten acres of fertile land,

20
00:02:42,242 --> 00:02:44,522
Special reward for treasure fragments.

21
00:02:48,882 --> 00:02:50,362
Didn't you collect all the fragments?

22
00:02:51,722 --> 00:02:53,122
Give it to me.

23
00:03:01,202 --> 00:03:02,442
Darn Cheng Dalei,

24
00:03:03,042 --> 00:03:04,482
he made me his coolie.

25
00:03:04,962 --> 00:03:06,082
I, Gao Feihu,

26
00:03:06,642 --> 00:03:08,562
am the man who wants to be the thief king of the mountain,

27
00:03:09,882 --> 00:03:11,602
At this moment,

28
00:03:12,242 --> 00:03:13,842
I'm already hungry for this blade.

29
00:03:14,882 --> 00:03:15,762
Today,

30
00:03:16,602 --> 00:03:17,842
you must see some blood.

31
00:03:26,402 --> 00:03:27,642
Good timing.

32
00:03:29,002 --> 00:03:29,722
Guys,

33
00:03:30,802 --> 00:03:31,602
Go!

34
00:03:32,002 --> 00:03:34,402
Kill them.

35
00:03:43,042 --> 00:03:44,242
Gosh.

36
00:03:49,242 --> 00:03:49,762
Flying Leopard,

37
00:03:50,482 --> 00:03:51,762
can you tell me what's going on?

38
00:03:54,122 --> 00:03:55,202
So cruel.

39
00:03:56,642 --> 00:03:58,162
So cruel.

40
00:03:58,642 --> 00:03:59,722
Our Head of the Fortress.

41
00:04:00,002 --> 00:04:01,122
Our Head of the Fortress

42
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:04,402
is in a bad state of mind.

43
00:04:06,122 --> 00:04:06,762
My mind is broken.

44
00:04:07,682 --> 00:04:08,722
Why are you in a bad state of mind?

45
00:04:08,762 --> 00:04:09,202
Ah,

46
00:04:09,562 --> 00:04:10,002
Head of the Fortress,

47
00:04:10,322 --> 00:04:10,762
Head of the Fortress,

48
00:04:12,922 --> 00:04:13,362
Head of the Fortress.

49
00:04:17,282 --> 00:04:18,562
There are only three of them.

50
00:04:19,922 --> 00:04:22,162
But we can't fight back.

51
00:04:23,042 --> 00:04:25,162
If Qin Man hadn't passed by to save us,

52
00:04:25,522 --> 00:04:26,282
I'm afraid we would have,

53
00:04:28,122 --> 00:04:29,162
It's just a trivial matter.

54
00:04:29,682 --> 00:04:31,362
It's not a big deal.

55
00:04:34,362 --> 00:04:35,122
Brother Qin,

56
00:04:35,122 --> 00:04:35,922
are you okay?

57
00:04:58,202 --> 00:04:59,762
Thief, stop!

58
00:05:10,202 --> 00:05:11,602
Eat me.

59
00:05:39,242 --> 00:05:42,562
I wonder where he came from?

60
00:05:46,922 --> 00:05:47,802
His name is Lu Hum,

61
00:05:48,802 --> 00:05:51,522
claiming to be Black Rock's top warrior,

62
00:05:52,122 --> 00:05:53,242
He even asked me to bring a message,

63
00:05:55,722 --> 00:05:57,522
a gift for the King of Youzhou.

64
00:05:57,762 --> 00:05:59,682
Tomorrow, we'll pass through Qingniu Mountain again,

65
00:06:00,282 --> 00:06:02,362
and then all the cottages,

66
00:06:02,482 --> 00:06:04,042
Kneel down to greet me.

67
00:06:04,962 --> 00:06:05,642
Otherwise,

68
00:06:06,442 --> 00:06:07,082
kill people,

69
00:06:07,082 --> 00:06:07,962
Tu Zhai,

70
00:06:09,722 --> 00:06:10,282
oh,

71
00:06:10,282 --> 00:06:11,802
How can I do that?

72
00:06:12,682 --> 00:06:15,082
More than ten years ago, Black Rock City took action

73
00:06:16,002 --> 00:06:16,922
for one night,

74
00:06:17,122 --> 00:06:19,042
Then I killed a fake village.

75
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:20,642
I heard that

76
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,482
Lu Hum led the team to do it.

77
00:06:25,922 --> 00:06:27,082
What are we waiting for?

78
00:06:27,082 --> 00:06:28,082
Let's run.

79
00:06:28,682 --> 00:06:30,082
But now that the world is in chaos,

80
00:06:30,362 --> 00:06:32,202
where else can we go besides Qingniu Mountain?

81
00:06:33,722 --> 00:06:34,522
how about

82
00:06:35,202 --> 00:06:36,162
Let's kneel down.

83
00:06:36,242 --> 00:06:36,602
Hey,

84
00:06:36,762 --> 00:06:37,402
Okay, okay.

85
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:38,042
No way.

86
00:06:39,802 --> 00:06:41,242
Back then, it was Lu Hum

87
00:06:41,522 --> 00:06:42,962
who took over my fertile land.

88
00:06:43,282 --> 00:06:45,002
You made me a bandit.

89
00:06:46,162 --> 00:06:48,042
Kneel if you want.

90
00:06:48,562 --> 00:06:49,242
I won't kneel.

91
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:50,442
Master Cheng,

92
00:06:51,002 --> 00:06:51,562
in this battle,

93
00:06:52,722 --> 00:06:54,282
Goutou Ridge can't participate.

94
00:06:55,602 --> 00:06:58,162
But I, Gou Xiong, will fight with you alone,

95
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:01,442
Okay,

96
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:02,922
Then we'll be

97
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:03,522
the Head of the Fortress,

98
00:07:03,522 --> 00:07:04,162
Head of the Fortress,

99
00:07:04,482 --> 00:07:05,962
when we had no choice,

100
00:07:05,962 --> 00:07:07,402
You took us in.

101
00:07:07,842 --> 00:07:08,882
Even if I die,

102
00:07:08,882 --> 00:07:10,002
my brothers will stay with you.

103
00:07:10,162 --> 00:07:10,722
Head of the Fortress,

104
00:07:13,522 --> 00:07:14,682
why are you so silly?

105
00:07:19,442 --> 00:07:20,562
Good buddy.

106
00:07:26,242 --> 00:07:29,002
It seems that we can't escape this time.
