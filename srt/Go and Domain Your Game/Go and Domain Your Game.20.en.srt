1
00:01:39,522 --> 00:01:40,162
Brother,

2
00:01:40,442 --> 00:01:41,842
those two guys are back.

3
00:01:48,042 --> 00:01:49,242
I told you to get lost.

4
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:50,242
How dare you come back?

5
00:01:50,322 --> 00:01:51,762
You don't take me seriously.

6
00:01:51,762 --> 00:01:52,682
Mr. Du,

7
00:01:53,362 --> 00:01:54,202
wait a minute. This time,

8
00:01:54,202 --> 00:01:57,282
I'm here to send you a big gift to apologize.

9
00:02:00,602 --> 00:02:02,082
This wine comes from the Western Regions

10
00:02:02,082 --> 00:02:03,642
and is made from grapes.

11
00:02:03,642 --> 00:02:04,682
The color is red

12
00:02:04,682 --> 00:02:06,522
and the taste is sweet and sour.

13
00:02:06,602 --> 00:02:08,282
This time, in order to apologize to Mr. Du,

14
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:09,762
I made a special trip to the warehouse,

15
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:11,802
There are only a few jars left for Mr. Du.

16
00:02:12,042 --> 00:02:13,282
Hurry up, Master.

17
00:02:13,282 --> 00:02:15,482
Didn't we plan to give one jar to him?

18
00:02:15,522 --> 00:02:16,442
All of them have been sent away.

19
00:02:16,442 --> 00:02:18,482
One jar is 120.

20
00:02:18,482 --> 00:02:20,362
Western Snow Grape is restricted for sale.

21
00:02:20,522 --> 00:02:22,482
This one is seriously out of stock.

22
00:02:22,802 --> 00:02:23,562
It's on the black market,

23
00:02:23,562 --> 00:02:26,242
I can't believe it's 320 per jar.

24
00:02:26,242 --> 00:02:27,402
320,

25
00:02:27,962 --> 00:02:29,002
Gosh,

26
00:02:29,882 --> 00:02:30,842
What's wrong?

27
00:02:31,642 --> 00:02:34,362
What's wrong with giving it to my family?

28
00:02:36,402 --> 00:02:37,722
Oh,

29
00:02:37,882 --> 00:02:39,682
I can't send you anymore.

30
00:02:39,682 --> 00:02:42,162
If you send it again, you'll be ruined.

31
00:02:42,202 --> 00:02:43,442
It's really good wine.

32
00:02:43,602 --> 00:02:44,482
One more jar.

33
00:02:47,242 --> 00:02:47,602
Gosh,

34
00:02:47,602 --> 00:02:48,162
Mr. Du,

35
00:02:48,162 --> 00:02:50,082
you can't drink any more.

36
00:02:50,202 --> 00:02:51,362
There's something you don't know.

37
00:02:51,482 --> 00:02:53,522
This wine is not an ordinary liquor.

38
00:02:53,642 --> 00:02:55,402
Ordinary people drink half a jar,

39
00:02:55,402 --> 00:02:57,122
and then they get drunk and unconscious.

40
00:02:57,202 --> 00:02:58,562
I know you're a good drinker,

41
00:02:58,882 --> 00:03:00,482
but you're too drunk

42
00:03:00,762 --> 00:03:01,522
to drink a jar of wine!

43
00:03:02,202 --> 00:03:04,402
I, Du Mao, have been in the wine industry for decades,

44
00:03:04,682 --> 00:03:06,202
claiming to be a slacker in the wine industry,

45
00:03:06,522 --> 00:03:08,202
If I can only drink one jar,

46
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:09,562
no one can drink two jars.

47
00:03:16,002 --> 00:03:17,042
Gosh.

48
00:03:17,122 --> 00:03:19,042
How can you drink Mr. Du's wine?

49
00:03:19,402 --> 00:03:22,602
I know you're known as the Western Dionysian,

50
00:03:22,762 --> 00:03:24,762
and your capacity for drinking is well-known both inside and outside the country,

51
00:03:25,042 --> 00:03:27,682
But you can't let Mr. Du get down from the stage.

52
00:03:27,922 --> 00:03:28,962
Jack, Danny.

53
00:03:34,442 --> 00:03:36,442
Western Dionysian

54
00:03:37,002 --> 00:03:37,762
Okay,

55
00:03:38,162 --> 00:03:39,962
I'll fight with you today.

56
00:03:40,722 --> 00:03:42,922
I, Du Mao, stand by my words,

57
00:03:43,202 --> 00:03:45,042
if you can take me down today,

58
00:03:45,122 --> 00:03:46,842
Those people from the Liu family don't want one or two silvers,

59
00:03:46,842 --> 00:03:47,962
you take them all away.

60
00:04:13,842 --> 00:04:15,442
Come on!

61
00:04:23,842 --> 00:04:26,242
Why is he so good at drinking?

62
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:37,002
Come on, keep drinking.

63
00:04:38,522 --> 00:04:40,642
That's all you can do.

64
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:43,962
Look, I've drunk so many jars.

65
00:04:44,282 --> 00:04:44,882
Now,

66
00:04:45,682 --> 00:04:47,242
I'm just a little tipsy.

67
00:04:51,722 --> 00:04:53,082
Fighting power is only five.

68
00:04:53,602 --> 00:04:54,802
Good wine,

69
00:04:55,522 --> 00:04:57,242
Again, again,

70
00:05:03,842 --> 00:05:06,042
hide your unique skills. Drunk to dream,

71
00:05:07,202 --> 00:05:08,522
Keep drinking.

72
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:10,762
But then again,

73
00:05:11,442 --> 00:05:13,282
although your wine is not good enough,

74
00:05:13,322 --> 00:05:15,042
You can drink a lot.

75
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:16,882
What did you say?

76
00:05:19,162 --> 00:05:19,802
I mean,

77
00:05:20,122 --> 00:05:22,162
your wine is not good enough.

78
00:05:23,042 --> 00:05:23,962
Your capacity for drinking

79
00:05:24,202 --> 00:05:26,442
is not so good.

80
00:05:26,602 --> 00:05:28,122
You can look down on my capacity for drinking,

81
00:05:28,802 --> 00:05:30,882
but you can't look down on my wine making.

82
00:06:08,842 --> 00:06:10,762
This cup is called "getting drunk and dreaming".

83
00:06:11,042 --> 00:06:11,762
Do you dare to drink it?

84
00:06:21,802 --> 00:06:23,042
Drunk and dreaming,

85
00:06:23,362 --> 00:06:24,682
it's nothing more than that.

86
00:06:32,442 --> 00:06:34,642
So this is a real life-and-death dream.

87
00:06:34,762 --> 00:06:36,282
Can I get my 5. 2 thousand back?

88
00:06:36,722 --> 00:06:37,922
You must come back.
