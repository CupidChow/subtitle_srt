1
00:01:40,322 --> 00:01:40,922
Master,

2
00:01:41,162 --> 00:01:42,442
the spicy fruit in the stockade,

3
00:01:42,442 --> 00:01:43,242
All of them have moved here.

4
00:01:44,242 --> 00:01:44,842
Thank you for your hard work.

5
00:01:45,042 --> 00:01:46,682
I don't have enough chilies in the kitchen,

6
00:01:46,682 --> 00:01:48,402
but it finally comes in handy this time.

7
00:01:49,162 --> 00:01:49,882
Master,

8
00:01:49,882 --> 00:01:52,362
I didn't expect that you're good at cooking.

9
00:01:53,122 --> 00:01:54,442
Of course.

10
00:01:54,442 --> 00:01:55,722
We've finally got the silver.

11
00:01:55,722 --> 00:01:57,762
Let's redeem the Liu Army now.

12
00:02:02,162 --> 00:02:03,002
Official Du,

13
00:02:03,042 --> 00:02:04,242
the seven-day appointment has arrived.

14
00:02:04,322 --> 00:02:05,562
This is 4. 2 thousand silver,

15
00:02:05,642 --> 00:02:06,842
plus the previous deposit,

16
00:02:06,842 --> 00:02:08,002
That comes to 5. 2 thousand,

17
00:02:08,162 --> 00:02:08,522
Okay,

18
00:02:09,002 --> 00:02:10,402
I, Du Mao, stand by my words,

19
00:02:10,962 --> 00:02:11,922
this 5. 2 thousand,

20
00:02:11,962 --> 00:02:13,242
Take it as compensation for your trouble

21
00:02:13,242 --> 00:02:14,482
in Deciduous City.

22
00:02:14,682 --> 00:02:15,402
Get lost!

23
00:02:18,002 --> 00:02:18,682
What do you mean?

24
00:02:19,562 --> 00:02:20,242
What do you mean?

25
00:02:20,802 --> 00:02:22,002
I'd like to ask,

26
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:23,362
if you come to my Falling Leaf City,

27
00:02:23,362 --> 00:02:25,282
What do you mean by ruining Jianghe Tower?

28
00:02:26,762 --> 00:02:28,842
The boss behind Jianghe House is Du Mao,

29
00:02:30,762 --> 00:02:31,322
Okay,

30
00:02:31,842 --> 00:02:32,602
Then let's get lost.

31
00:02:34,882 --> 00:02:36,122
Because he wanted to save the Liu Army,

32
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:37,162
he ran Lake Fishing,

33
00:02:37,162 --> 00:02:37,882
He ran Lake Fishing,

34
00:02:37,882 --> 00:02:39,482
and offended Jianghe House,

35
00:02:39,482 --> 00:02:41,362
The owner of Jianghe House is Du Mao?

36
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:42,362
If you offend Du Mao,

37
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:43,522
you won't be able to save the Liu Army.

38
00:02:43,522 --> 00:02:44,842
We can't save the Liu Army

39
00:02:44,842 --> 00:02:46,122
just to save them.

40
00:02:47,162 --> 00:02:47,962
God's will,

41
00:02:47,962 --> 00:02:48,642
stop!

42
00:02:49,442 --> 00:02:51,042
You even want to take it away.

43
00:02:52,402 --> 00:02:53,482
Come on,

44
00:02:53,482 --> 00:02:54,722
run!

45
00:02:54,722 --> 00:02:55,802
Gosh.

46
00:03:39,962 --> 00:03:40,922
I'll lose if I lose.

47
00:03:40,922 --> 00:03:42,322
Why should I drown my sorrows in alcohol?

48
00:03:44,162 --> 00:03:45,082
Pretend to be drunk

49
00:03:45,122 --> 00:03:45,922
and escape from reality.

50
00:03:51,842 --> 00:03:52,442
Very happy.

51
00:03:52,442 --> 00:03:53,202
Very happy.

52
00:03:53,602 --> 00:03:55,402
It's been a long time since I had such a good time.

53
00:04:07,762 --> 00:04:08,322
He,

54
00:04:09,842 --> 00:04:10,682
Watch out!

55
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:17,842
No!

56
00:04:26,722 --> 00:04:27,482
It's gone.

57
00:04:28,362 --> 00:04:29,762
5. 2 Thousand is gone.

58
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:33,802
Are you all right?

59
00:04:37,082 --> 00:04:37,842
Master,

60
00:04:38,322 --> 00:04:39,642
what should we do now?

61
00:04:40,482 --> 00:04:41,162
This shop is open too.

62
00:04:41,162 --> 00:04:41,962
I've earned money.

63
00:04:42,762 --> 00:04:44,722
The Liu Family Army hasn't been rescued yet.

64
00:04:44,762 --> 00:04:45,762
What should we do?

65
00:04:45,962 --> 00:04:47,322
You did your best.

66
00:04:48,242 --> 00:04:50,162
A sad young man.

67
00:04:50,282 --> 00:04:51,322
Congratulations on your mission

68
00:04:51,442 --> 00:04:53,082
to save the restaurant.

69
00:04:53,242 --> 00:04:55,282
Reward one chance to draw a warrior.

70
00:04:56,202 --> 00:04:57,162
God is helping me.

71
00:05:05,522 --> 00:05:06,002
Ah,

72
00:05:06,642 --> 00:05:07,922
Why did you pick a foreign warrior?

73
00:05:08,962 --> 00:05:12,322
I wish I could stay drunk for a long time.

74
00:05:12,402 --> 00:05:15,682
I'll share my sorrow with you forever.

75
00:05:15,962 --> 00:05:16,642
Sir,

76
00:05:17,122 --> 00:05:19,082
two more pots of good wine.

77
00:05:24,602 --> 00:05:25,882
His combat strength is only five.

78
00:05:26,682 --> 00:05:28,082
Why did he pick such a loser?

79
00:05:31,482 --> 00:05:32,162
Good wine.

80
00:05:33,442 --> 00:05:34,122
Again,

81
00:05:34,362 --> 00:05:35,122
Again,
