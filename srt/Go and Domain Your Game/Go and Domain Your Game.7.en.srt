1
00:01:34,562 --> 00:01:37,322
Kill him.

2
00:01:39,282 --> 00:01:41,002
What are you busy with? Long time no see,

3
00:01:42,562 --> 00:01:43,122
Cheers,

4
00:01:45,442 --> 00:01:46,282
Gao,

5
00:01:46,802 --> 00:01:47,402
Gao,

6
00:01:48,162 --> 00:01:49,402
What took you so long?

7
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:50,882
Everyone is waiting for you.

8
00:01:51,122 --> 00:01:51,842
Come on, let's go.

9
00:01:52,922 --> 00:01:53,962
Let's go eat.

10
00:01:54,402 --> 00:01:54,962
Come on, guys.

11
00:02:00,082 --> 00:02:03,562
What auction?

12
00:02:04,802 --> 00:02:05,242
Head of the Fortress,

13
00:02:05,842 --> 00:02:07,362
we've made a lot of money this time.

14
00:02:07,842 --> 00:02:09,122
I just asked around.

15
00:02:09,242 --> 00:02:10,762
Cheng Dalei wants to auction his horse,

16
00:02:11,282 --> 00:02:12,562
starting with 20 jin of grain.

17
00:02:12,802 --> 00:02:14,562
I heard that the value of each military horse

18
00:02:14,642 --> 00:02:16,722
is at least 200 jin of grain.

19
00:02:17,122 --> 00:02:17,962
How is that possible?

20
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:21,602
Congratulations to Head Bai, with 30 jin of grain,

21
00:02:21,602 --> 00:02:24,202
you like to bring a jade lion to Zhaoye,

22
00:02:26,202 --> 00:02:28,042
Congratulations.

23
00:02:31,962 --> 00:02:33,682
Congratulations. Thank you, Master Cheng.

24
00:02:37,682 --> 00:02:38,082
Ladies and gentlemen,

25
00:02:38,602 --> 00:02:40,122
after the bidding of Village Head Bai,

26
00:02:40,122 --> 00:02:41,922
I believe you all know

27
00:02:41,922 --> 00:02:42,962
the rules of blind shooting.

28
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:45,442
I know.

29
00:02:45,882 --> 00:02:47,282
So after the red cloth is uncovered,

30
00:02:47,602 --> 00:02:50,042
whether it's a donkey or a horse,

31
00:02:50,162 --> 00:02:51,362
It depends on your luck.

32
00:02:51,482 --> 00:02:53,402
Come on. Hurry up.

33
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:55,322
Head of the Fortress,

34
00:02:55,762 --> 00:02:57,362
we must shoot the next round.

35
00:02:57,442 --> 00:02:58,322
What do you know?

36
00:02:59,122 --> 00:03:00,402
The underground world of martial arts

37
00:03:01,202 --> 00:03:02,122
is dangerous. This is fishing,

38
00:03:02,122 --> 00:03:02,482
Fishing,

39
00:03:02,842 --> 00:03:03,882
Next,

40
00:03:03,882 --> 00:03:05,162
Start bidding for the second horse.

41
00:03:05,402 --> 00:03:07,122
The starting price is 20 jin of grain,

42
00:03:07,362 --> 00:03:08,002
30 jin,

43
00:03:08,002 --> 00:03:08,882
50 jin,

44
00:03:08,882 --> 00:03:09,762
70 jin,

45
00:03:09,842 --> 00:03:10,482
80,

46
00:03:10,962 --> 00:03:11,962
100 jin.

47
00:03:16,762 --> 00:03:17,602
See?

48
00:03:18,202 --> 00:03:19,642
They have been carried away

49
00:03:19,642 --> 00:03:20,482
by the sweetness just now.

50
00:03:20,602 --> 00:03:21,442
It's already done.

51
00:03:21,562 --> 00:03:23,442
Cheng Dalei has started to close the net.

52
00:03:23,922 --> 00:03:26,282
Head of the Fortress is indeed as good as he expected.

53
00:03:27,002 --> 00:03:28,482
Did Goutouling get

54
00:03:28,482 --> 00:03:30,282
a good horse or a bad one?

55
00:03:31,762 --> 00:03:34,202
It's a flying electric horse,

56
00:03:35,642 --> 00:03:36,682
oh,

57
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,642
It's actually a flying electric horse,

58
00:03:39,922 --> 00:03:43,202
which is the best horse with no market price.

59
00:03:44,042 --> 00:03:44,682
Yes.

60
00:03:45,002 --> 00:03:45,562
No,

61
00:03:46,242 --> 00:03:46,682
Gosh,

62
00:03:47,962 --> 00:03:48,842
I'm telling you,

63
00:03:49,082 --> 00:03:50,882
don't take it from me later.

64
00:04:09,402 --> 00:04:10,882
There are ten horses left.

65
00:04:10,962 --> 00:04:12,522
Do you want to bid?

66
00:04:15,682 --> 00:04:16,842
I want them all.

67
00:04:17,122 --> 00:04:17,842
Did you hear it right?

68
00:04:18,402 --> 00:04:19,642
I'll take all ten of them.

69
00:04:20,162 --> 00:04:21,122
But Head Gao

70
00:04:21,402 --> 00:04:22,522
hasn't bid yet,

71
00:04:22,882 --> 00:04:23,762
That's right,

72
00:04:23,762 --> 00:04:24,602
That's right.

73
00:04:24,602 --> 00:04:25,522
800 jin,

74
00:04:25,922 --> 00:04:26,882
I fly tiger,

75
00:04:27,562 --> 00:04:28,962
Out of 800 jin of grain,

76
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:31,042
bought all the ten horses.

77
00:04:33,762 --> 00:04:34,882
Do you have anyone taller than me?

78
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:35,562
Is there?

79
00:04:35,762 --> 00:04:36,562
Is there?

80
00:04:36,682 --> 00:04:37,362
You didn't, did you?

81
00:04:37,922 --> 00:04:39,242
No, it belongs to me, Gao Feihu.

82
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,322
Buy it and leave!

83
00:04:41,762 --> 00:04:42,402
Head of the Fortress,

84
00:04:43,002 --> 00:04:43,362
Head of the Fortress,

85
00:04:43,802 --> 00:04:46,282
There's only 800 jin of grain in our village.

86
00:04:46,362 --> 00:04:47,322
You don't know anything.

87
00:04:47,362 --> 00:04:49,362
Others are greedy and I fear them.

88
00:04:49,642 --> 00:04:51,562
Others are afraid that I'm greedy.

89
00:04:53,082 --> 00:04:53,682
Hurry up.

90
00:04:53,722 --> 00:04:54,682
Bring all my horses out.

91
00:04:54,802 --> 00:04:55,442
Head Gao,

92
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:56,282
please

93
00:04:56,842 --> 00:04:58,082
reconsider it.

94
00:04:58,282 --> 00:04:59,122
I'm afraid

95
00:04:59,282 --> 00:04:59,922
so. See?

96
00:05:00,242 --> 00:05:00,682
Are you scared?

97
00:05:00,762 --> 00:05:01,282
Are you scared?

98
00:05:01,762 --> 00:05:02,642
Cut it out! Buy it

99
00:05:02,882 --> 00:05:03,722
and leave!

100
00:05:03,722 --> 00:05:04,482
Don't go back on your word.

101
00:05:04,962 --> 00:05:05,842
The last ten horses,

102
00:05:06,002 --> 00:05:07,522
they must all be good horses at the bottom of the box.

103
00:05:07,642 --> 00:05:09,442
You can hide it from my eyes.

104
00:05:10,682 --> 00:05:11,122
Hurry up.

105
00:05:11,122 --> 00:05:12,162
Bring out all my good horses.

106
00:05:12,202 --> 00:05:12,642
Hurry up.

107
00:05:19,082 --> 00:05:21,362
Can the bangs look at the road?

108
00:05:24,362 --> 00:05:25,762
Ouch! What a big butt!

109
00:05:26,042 --> 00:05:27,282
Ha ha,

110
00:05:29,642 --> 00:05:31,722
Oh, it got shot.

111
00:05:32,962 --> 00:05:34,002
Oh,

112
00:05:34,202 --> 00:05:36,042
Sweating donkey.

113
00:05:47,082 --> 00:05:48,522
Despicable Cheng Dalei,

114
00:05:49,922 --> 00:05:50,962
how dare you use a bad horse.

115
00:05:51,842 --> 00:05:54,402
You used a bad horse to lie to me,

116
00:05:54,762 --> 00:05:56,762
and played with my feelings like this.

117
00:05:58,042 --> 00:05:59,202
I want to cancel the deal.

118
00:05:59,482 --> 00:06:00,202
Cancel it.

119
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:03,682
Since Gao Village mainly cancels the deal,

120
00:06:03,842 --> 00:06:04,882
we'll start

121
00:06:05,202 --> 00:06:07,122
all the bidding again.

122
00:06:17,482 --> 00:06:19,962
Trade these horses for food.

123
00:06:20,242 --> 00:06:23,362
It turns out that everything is under Master's control.

124
00:06:23,442 --> 00:06:24,682
Wonderful.

125
00:06:30,082 --> 00:06:31,202
Fragments of treasures,

126
00:06:32,362 --> 00:06:33,242
Master,

127
00:06:33,362 --> 00:06:36,282
Something bad happened.
