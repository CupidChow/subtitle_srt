1
00:01:40,482 --> 00:01:42,322
A mountain thief is a mountain thief.

2
00:01:42,842 --> 00:01:43,962
You don't know anything about etiquette.

3
00:01:44,642 --> 00:01:45,922
Do you want me

4
00:01:46,402 --> 00:01:47,882
to teach you again?

5
00:01:52,002 --> 00:01:52,802
Kneel down.

6
00:02:03,562 --> 00:02:04,402
You look good. I wish

7
00:02:05,602 --> 00:02:07,242
you were younger.

8
00:02:08,162 --> 00:02:08,802
General,

9
00:02:09,282 --> 00:02:09,882
the person who ordered

10
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:11,122
Toad Village is not here.

11
00:02:18,042 --> 00:02:20,762
General, spare me.

12
00:02:21,042 --> 00:02:22,602
I still have

13
00:02:22,602 --> 00:02:26,202
a daughter to feed.

14
00:02:31,882 --> 00:02:32,242
Father,

15
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,522
Does this cushion work?

16
00:02:34,122 --> 00:02:36,082
This new cotton is a little soft.

17
00:02:36,362 --> 00:02:37,722
Prepare one for the boss, too,

18
00:02:37,922 --> 00:02:38,202
Hey,

19
00:02:38,322 --> 00:02:38,922
Where's the boss.

20
00:02:50,642 --> 00:02:52,002
I didn't expect Black Rock City

21
00:02:52,002 --> 00:02:53,202
to be so overbearing.

22
00:02:55,402 --> 00:02:56,362
If you don't want to kneel,

23
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:57,642
just run away.

24
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:02,282
If it were you,

25
00:03:02,322 --> 00:03:03,482
what would you choose?

26
00:03:09,042 --> 00:03:10,602
If a man has gold under his knee,

27
00:03:11,162 --> 00:03:12,562
it's impossible to kneel.

28
00:03:13,882 --> 00:03:15,202
If you want to escape,

29
00:03:16,762 --> 00:03:18,162
in this troubled times,

30
00:03:18,522 --> 00:03:20,042
Will my brothers and I

31
00:03:20,402 --> 00:03:22,322
just keep running away like this?

32
00:03:24,522 --> 00:03:25,202
Oh,

33
00:03:27,522 --> 00:03:29,242
this is

34
00:03:35,562 --> 00:03:36,242
the boss,

35
00:03:36,642 --> 00:03:38,242
If we don't leave now,

36
00:03:38,522 --> 00:03:40,122
I'm afraid there's no way out.

37
00:03:41,122 --> 00:03:42,042
How can there be so many things

38
00:03:42,042 --> 00:03:43,482
in this world that have a way out?

39
00:03:44,242 --> 00:03:46,002
How sure are you?

40
00:03:47,562 --> 00:03:48,562
Even if it's only 10%,

41
00:03:49,042 --> 00:03:50,122
I have to give it a try.

42
00:03:50,642 --> 00:03:51,602
Qin Man,

43
00:03:51,842 --> 00:03:54,522
I didn't expect you to be greedy and afraid of death.

44
00:03:54,522 --> 00:03:56,482
It's too late for you to dig a hole and run away.

45
00:03:56,642 --> 00:03:57,242
Gosh, I'll go.

46
00:04:00,402 --> 00:04:01,002
Master,

47
00:04:01,362 --> 00:04:02,882
what is this thing for?

48
00:04:05,122 --> 00:04:06,122
The secret must not be revealed.

49
00:04:06,962 --> 00:04:09,082
This might be a lifeline for Toad Village.

50
00:04:13,522 --> 00:04:15,002
Is this Toad Village?

51
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:16,922
Why didn't anyone come out?

52
00:04:17,282 --> 00:04:18,522
Guys, listen up.

53
00:04:18,522 --> 00:04:19,362
Within 10 breaths,

54
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:20,722
If the gate doesn't open,

55
00:04:21,082 --> 00:04:22,202
break the door with me,

56
00:04:22,322 --> 00:04:23,082
One.

57
00:04:27,362 --> 00:04:27,962
how

58
00:04:28,762 --> 00:04:29,562
I've figured it

59
00:04:30,202 --> 00:04:31,122
out. Kneel down.

60
00:04:31,962 --> 00:04:32,882
General Lu, you're joking.

61
00:04:33,202 --> 00:04:35,602
Why don't you kneel down and demonstrate,

62
00:04:36,202 --> 00:04:37,522
How dare you tease me?

63
00:04:38,042 --> 00:04:40,202
Today, I'm going to bloodbath this Toad Village,

64
00:04:40,722 --> 00:04:41,522
Liang.

65
00:04:49,402 --> 00:04:50,122
This is.

66
00:04:50,402 --> 00:04:51,122
Lu Hum,

67
00:04:51,602 --> 00:04:52,682
you're rebellious and belligerent,

68
00:04:52,682 --> 00:04:53,642
Killing innocent people indiscriminately,

69
00:04:54,162 --> 00:04:56,522
today my Toad Village is going to do justice for heaven,

70
00:04:57,082 --> 00:04:57,562
Brothers,

71
00:04:57,762 --> 00:04:58,642
kill and destroy the village,

72
00:04:58,722 --> 00:04:59,442
Go.

73
00:05:03,482 --> 00:05:04,322
Shoot!

74
00:05:29,842 --> 00:05:30,802
You brat.

75
00:05:31,442 --> 00:05:32,322
What do you want?

76
00:05:33,642 --> 00:05:35,162
I once held the Book of Sages,

77
00:05:35,482 --> 00:05:36,322
held the Sword of Green Blade,

78
00:05:37,002 --> 00:05:38,922
I once thought about acquiring arts and culture,

79
00:05:39,042 --> 00:05:40,042
goods and imperial family,

80
00:05:41,042 --> 00:05:41,642
As far as I can see,

81
00:05:41,802 --> 00:05:42,802
refugees are like pigs and dogs,

82
00:05:43,122 --> 00:05:44,122
As powerful as a tiger and wolf,

83
00:05:44,602 --> 00:05:45,202
at that time,

84
00:05:45,922 --> 00:05:46,802
I have an ideal,

85
00:05:48,242 --> 00:05:49,402
to save the world from fire and water.

86
00:05:49,842 --> 00:05:51,082
The relief of the people is upside down.

87
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,842
To seek justice for heaven and earth.

88
00:05:54,842 --> 00:05:55,362
Kneel down!

89
00:05:56,482 --> 00:05:57,442
Who on earth are you?

90
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:04,322
Call me Toad King.

91
00:06:10,282 --> 00:06:10,882
Your Majesty,

92
00:06:11,122 --> 00:06:13,282
Cheng Da Lei not only humiliated me, Jiang Lu Hum,

93
00:06:13,442 --> 00:06:15,122
How dare you write a letter to provoke you?

94
00:06:15,122 --> 00:06:16,562
What a traitor.

95
00:06:16,562 --> 00:06:18,162
We must kill him.

96
00:06:18,522 --> 00:06:20,562
Knowing that there are tigers on the mountain,

97
00:06:21,042 --> 00:06:22,922
I prefer to go to Tiger Mountain.

98
00:06:28,882 --> 00:06:31,442
This guy is interesting,
