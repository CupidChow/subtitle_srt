1
00:01:44,482 --> 00:01:45,562
There are so many people

2
00:01:47,202 --> 00:01:48,122
who can't see clearly.

3
00:01:49,082 --> 00:01:50,482
There are so many ill-sighted youngsters

4
00:01:51,482 --> 00:01:53,082
at the foot of the mountain.

5
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:55,682
You can use a small map to observe the number of enemies.

6
00:02:00,082 --> 00:02:00,962
Ah,

7
00:02:01,322 --> 00:02:02,442
There are more than 1000 people.

8
00:02:03,242 --> 00:02:04,042
What?

9
00:02:06,282 --> 00:02:07,642
Master, you have good eyesight.

10
00:02:07,882 --> 00:02:09,002
Do you have any solutions?

11
00:02:09,002 --> 00:02:09,602
What are you afraid of?

12
00:02:09,962 --> 00:02:10,602
Fight with them.

13
00:02:10,722 --> 00:02:11,002
Yes.

14
00:02:11,162 --> 00:02:12,122
Fight with them for speed.

15
00:02:12,362 --> 00:02:13,522
It's not too late for us to run.

16
00:02:13,522 --> 00:02:14,122
Let's go.

17
00:02:14,202 --> 00:02:14,762
Don't be afraid.

18
00:02:15,482 --> 00:02:16,482
Trigger a new task.

19
00:02:16,522 --> 00:02:17,962
If you defend Toad Village ten times

20
00:02:18,082 --> 00:02:20,522
and run away, you'll be killed by me.

21
00:02:20,722 --> 00:02:21,442
What?

22
00:02:21,802 --> 00:02:22,562
Who are you

23
00:02:29,122 --> 00:02:30,322
talking to again?

24
00:02:30,322 --> 00:02:31,162
I don't know.

25
00:02:32,442 --> 00:02:33,722
What should we do?

26
00:02:41,642 --> 00:02:42,002
Let's go.

27
00:02:44,682 --> 00:02:45,282
What are you afraid of?

28
00:02:48,522 --> 00:02:49,362
It's that kid.

29
00:02:55,482 --> 00:02:57,002
Isn't he from Black Rock City?

30
00:03:05,042 --> 00:03:05,682
Is he dead?

31
00:03:08,642 --> 00:03:10,642
For the brothers of Toad Village,

32
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:12,882
we can only use this idiot.

33
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:17,562
I found a way to defeat the enemy.

34
00:03:26,242 --> 00:03:27,562
You thieves,

35
00:03:27,602 --> 00:03:28,922
today it falls into your hands,

36
00:03:29,282 --> 00:03:30,202
If you want to kill him or cut him,

37
00:03:30,402 --> 00:03:31,202
do as you please.

38
00:03:32,482 --> 00:03:32,922
No!

39
00:03:39,202 --> 00:03:39,802
Let's go.

40
00:03:43,522 --> 00:03:44,322
Don't regret it.

41
00:03:46,362 --> 00:03:47,402
Isn't releasing him today

42
00:03:47,762 --> 00:03:49,122
releasing the tiger back to the mountain?

43
00:03:49,842 --> 00:03:50,482
What are you afraid of?

44
00:03:50,722 --> 00:03:52,122
Isn't he just a defeated opponent?

45
00:03:52,322 --> 00:03:54,082
Does he dare to come back for revenge?

46
00:03:54,562 --> 00:03:55,442
Oh,

47
00:03:55,562 --> 00:03:56,162
I thought,

48
00:03:56,162 --> 00:03:58,402
He has a little bit of dignity as a warrior.

49
00:03:59,002 --> 00:04:00,882
I didn't expect that,

50
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:03,122
He slipped away with his tail between his legs.

51
00:04:04,002 --> 00:04:06,002
I am Lin Shaoyu from Canghai.

52
00:04:06,322 --> 00:04:07,642
I'm here to challenge you.

53
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:09,242
Oh,

54
00:04:09,442 --> 00:04:10,842
someone is going to attack Toad Village.

55
00:04:10,842 --> 00:04:11,442
So scary.

56
00:04:11,442 --> 00:04:13,242
Help!

57
00:04:14,882 --> 00:04:15,442
Get him!

58
00:04:24,162 --> 00:04:25,362
That's great. It really works.

59
00:04:25,442 --> 00:04:26,042
Hurry up.

60
00:04:26,082 --> 00:04:26,882
Apply gold wound medicine to him.

61
00:04:29,282 --> 00:04:30,042
Oh,

62
00:04:30,042 --> 00:04:31,162
you're amazing.

63
00:04:31,642 --> 00:04:33,242
It's no big deal. Let's have a drink.

64
00:04:33,842 --> 00:04:35,122
When are you going to teach me,

65
00:04:36,002 --> 00:04:37,202
a lowlife like me?

66
00:04:37,482 --> 00:04:38,922
I, Qin Man, punched just one

67
00:04:38,922 --> 00:04:39,882
punch. Awesome.

68
00:04:40,042 --> 00:04:40,602
Master,

69
00:04:40,762 --> 00:04:41,602
I bet ten cents,

70
00:04:42,842 --> 00:04:44,682
I'm sure he'll come back for revenge.

71
00:04:44,682 --> 00:04:45,642
I'll bet you 20.

72
00:04:45,642 --> 00:04:46,842
He won't come back for sure.

73
00:04:47,202 --> 00:04:49,562
I know this kind of person too well.

74
00:04:49,962 --> 00:04:52,042
If he fails once, he'll become a coward.

75
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,642
Do you think he deserves to be a warrior?

76
00:04:54,362 --> 00:04:55,762
I am Lin Shaoyu from Canghai.

77
00:04:56,082 --> 00:04:57,082
I'm here to challenge you.

78
00:04:57,722 --> 00:04:58,682
Oh,

79
00:04:58,682 --> 00:05:00,602
it's the second time someone has attacked Toad Village,

80
00:05:00,602 --> 00:05:02,082
I'm scared again.

81
00:05:02,082 --> 00:05:03,762
Gosh, it's scary.

82
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:10,762
Thank you for your hard work.

83
00:05:12,242 --> 00:05:14,122
I am Lin Shaoyu from Canghai.

84
00:05:14,122 --> 00:05:15,682
I'm here to challenge you.

85
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:35,282
Newspaper,

86
00:05:35,282 --> 00:05:36,602
Toad Village is right ahead,

87
00:05:37,722 --> 00:05:38,242
Okay,

88
00:05:38,802 --> 00:05:39,962
I'm going to kill them.

89
00:05:40,722 --> 00:05:41,162
Newspaper,

90
00:05:41,402 --> 00:05:42,042
The City Owner has an order

91
00:05:42,122 --> 00:05:42,802
to return to the city immediately.

92
00:05:43,002 --> 00:05:43,562
What?

93
00:05:46,842 --> 00:05:47,762
Back to the city.

94
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:55,202
Your Majesty,

95
00:05:55,602 --> 00:05:57,122
the 1000 elite soldiers I sent to suppress bandits,

96
00:05:57,362 --> 00:05:59,122
Why are you summoned back urgently?

97
00:06:00,082 --> 00:06:02,842
Of course it's because of an emergency.
