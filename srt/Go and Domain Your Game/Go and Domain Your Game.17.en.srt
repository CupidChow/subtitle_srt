1
00:01:35,442 --> 00:01:36,482
Come here.

2
00:01:36,482 --> 00:01:37,162
I'm here.

3
00:01:39,362 --> 00:01:40,922
Do you know what to say

4
00:01:42,682 --> 00:01:43,962
now that there are so many guests?

5
00:01:44,122 --> 00:01:44,522
I know.

6
00:01:44,522 --> 00:01:46,282
So I went to the Four Seas Building across the street and told them,

7
00:01:46,602 --> 00:01:48,522
lend us some stools.

8
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:50,882
You don't have any customers anyway.

9
00:01:52,082 --> 00:01:52,522
Go ahead.

10
00:01:54,202 --> 00:01:56,322
The grapes you brought here are delicious.

11
00:01:58,882 --> 00:01:59,922
Is No. 9 here?

12
00:02:00,122 --> 00:02:01,202
No. 9.

13
00:02:01,202 --> 00:02:02,242
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

14
00:02:02,242 --> 00:02:03,042
Come in, please.

15
00:02:03,042 --> 00:02:03,762
The 10th?

16
00:02:03,762 --> 00:02:04,842
Is the 10th here?

17
00:02:05,322 --> 00:02:06,322
Please come in.

18
00:02:06,562 --> 00:02:07,922
-We're here. -Hurry up.

19
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:08,962
Please come in.

20
00:02:09,882 --> 00:02:10,962
This way.

21
00:02:12,762 --> 00:02:14,882
Do you have it on the 17th?

22
00:02:15,122 --> 00:02:16,002
It's not good on the 17th. Shopkeeper's,

23
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:17,002
Bad news. Bad news.

24
00:02:18,362 --> 00:02:20,402
I just borrowed some stools.

25
00:02:20,402 --> 00:02:21,162
I don't want to borrow it.

26
00:02:21,202 --> 00:02:22,242
It's not about the stool.

27
00:02:22,322 --> 00:02:23,882
They... They've reopened.

28
00:02:25,322 --> 00:02:27,362
Do you have it on the 28th? Please

29
00:02:27,602 --> 00:02:28,402
come in on the 28th.

30
00:02:29,842 --> 00:02:30,922
Lake fishing,

31
00:02:31,322 --> 00:02:32,522
slow down.

32
00:02:33,802 --> 00:02:35,002
Eat up.

33
00:02:36,602 --> 00:02:37,682
Be careful.

34
00:02:40,842 --> 00:02:43,202
It's so delicious.

35
00:02:47,962 --> 00:02:48,922
How is that possible?

36
00:02:50,602 --> 00:02:51,922
This must be childcare.

37
00:02:54,482 --> 00:02:55,762
Eat slowly.

38
00:02:59,162 --> 00:03:00,202
It's so delicious.

39
00:03:00,882 --> 00:03:01,562
Ah,

40
00:03:01,602 --> 00:03:04,082
Wish you a long and happy life.

41
00:03:04,082 --> 00:03:05,962
The second prize is coconut.

42
00:03:06,322 --> 00:03:07,722
You won the prize.

43
00:03:07,762 --> 00:03:09,562
Who else wants to draw a lottery?

44
00:03:10,242 --> 00:03:11,282
Three, two, one.

45
00:03:22,122 --> 00:03:23,322
It's delicious.

46
00:03:23,482 --> 00:03:24,322
So cool!

47
00:03:25,562 --> 00:03:28,042
Are you Mr. Li from Jianghe House?

48
00:03:28,722 --> 00:03:31,122
I didn't expect you to visit us today.

49
00:03:33,882 --> 00:03:35,082
Mr. Li,

50
00:03:36,562 --> 00:03:37,442
we're here today,

51
00:03:37,442 --> 00:03:39,082
There are too many guests.

52
00:03:39,762 --> 00:03:41,882
I wonder if I can borrow some benches

53
00:03:42,082 --> 00:03:43,002
from Jianghe Building?

54
00:03:48,442 --> 00:03:49,202
Take care.

55
00:03:50,202 --> 00:03:51,042
Fight with me.

56
00:03:51,322 --> 00:03:53,242
You only deserve the base when I eat hot pot?

57
00:03:54,482 --> 00:03:56,562
That one was humiliating you before.

58
00:03:56,562 --> 00:03:58,002
Mr. Li who borrowed the bench from you.

59
00:03:58,402 --> 00:03:58,922
Yes.

60
00:03:59,202 --> 00:04:00,962
I helped you vent your anger just now.

61
00:04:02,562 --> 00:04:03,522
You're usually

62
00:04:03,842 --> 00:04:05,322
quite insolent,

63
00:04:05,482 --> 00:04:07,722
I didn't expect you to have so many ideas.

64
00:04:09,002 --> 00:04:10,722
But what on earth

65
00:04:10,722 --> 00:04:11,682
is that red fruit?

66
00:04:12,602 --> 00:04:14,362
The red fruit is called chili,

67
00:04:15,082 --> 00:04:17,242
and it has a burning sensation when you eat it.

68
00:04:17,522 --> 00:04:19,482
But it will cheer you up.

69
00:04:19,562 --> 00:04:20,242
It's hearty.

70
00:04:23,482 --> 00:04:25,122
Everything is under my control.

71
00:04:25,402 --> 00:04:26,122
Within seven days,

72
00:04:26,122 --> 00:04:28,722
we will collect all the money to redeem the Liu Army.

73
00:04:30,642 --> 00:04:31,362
My brother,

74
00:04:31,642 --> 00:04:33,442
I didn't expect you not only have chivalrous feelings,

75
00:04:33,602 --> 00:04:35,082
With such a business mind,

76
00:04:35,282 --> 00:04:36,962
you must be exhausted in the past two days, right?

77
00:04:37,242 --> 00:04:38,202
Go get some rest.

78
00:04:38,202 --> 00:04:39,402
It's enough to have us here.

79
00:04:41,842 --> 00:04:43,162
Get out of here if you're angry.

80
00:04:44,122 --> 00:04:45,842
It's all thanks to everyone.

81
00:04:46,562 --> 00:04:47,642
Sir,

82
00:04:47,722 --> 00:04:48,602
how can I help you?

83
00:04:48,642 --> 00:04:49,282
I'm here.

84
00:04:52,122 --> 00:04:53,922
My brother is not only outstanding,

85
00:04:54,082 --> 00:04:55,722
but also modest.

86
00:04:55,922 --> 00:04:58,002
Being able to meet my brother,

87
00:04:58,042 --> 00:05:00,122
Liu Zhi is really a blessing from a previous life.

88
00:05:06,362 --> 00:05:07,402
I'm going to

89
00:05:08,162 --> 00:05:10,202
destroy you,
