1
00:01:37,562 --> 00:01:38,522
Have some melon seeds,

2
00:01:38,522 --> 00:01:39,482
some fruits,

3
00:01:39,922 --> 00:01:40,562
You're here.

4
00:01:42,882 --> 00:01:43,562
Oh,

5
00:01:44,642 --> 00:01:46,402
the services you have at Lake Bottom Fishing,

6
00:01:46,842 --> 00:01:48,562
We have all of them in Jianghe House.

7
00:01:48,802 --> 00:01:50,682
And it's even more high-end,

8
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:52,842
how can you fight with me?

9
00:01:53,162 --> 00:01:53,842
Boss,

10
00:01:54,082 --> 00:01:55,402
the customer hasn't ordered much yet,

11
00:01:55,402 --> 00:01:56,322
That's all we've invested.

12
00:01:56,322 --> 00:01:56,962
Did you lose money?

13
00:01:57,122 --> 00:01:58,322
How long have you known me?

14
00:01:58,682 --> 00:02:01,482
It's been ten years.

15
00:02:01,722 --> 00:02:03,362
We've attracted the guests first.

16
00:02:03,362 --> 00:02:04,682
Then I'll kill him.

17
00:02:05,602 --> 00:02:06,322
In the end,

18
00:02:06,322 --> 00:02:07,642
we can earn

19
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:08,682
as much as we want.

20
00:02:08,882 --> 00:02:11,642
There are four tables left at the bottom of the lake.

21
00:02:17,402 --> 00:02:18,642
Ah,

22
00:02:20,442 --> 00:02:21,602
You forced me to do that.

23
00:02:21,682 --> 00:02:22,482
You forced me.

24
00:02:22,482 --> 00:02:25,322
Drive my guest

25
00:02:29,402 --> 00:02:30,482
to take care!

26
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:41,762
What do you think?

27
00:02:44,162 --> 00:02:45,082
Just so-so.

28
00:02:46,002 --> 00:02:46,962
Jerk

29
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,482
There's a shoe in the pot.

30
00:02:49,762 --> 00:02:51,442
What nonsense are you talking about?

31
00:02:52,402 --> 00:02:53,042
Let me do it.

32
00:02:54,522 --> 00:02:55,562
Is this how your black shop

33
00:02:55,602 --> 00:02:57,002
treats its customers?

34
00:02:57,202 --> 00:02:58,082
Dear guest,

35
00:02:58,162 --> 00:02:59,362
this is our negligence.

36
00:02:59,362 --> 00:03:00,882
I'll get you another pot right away.

37
00:03:01,002 --> 00:03:03,362
Your spending today is free of charge.

38
00:03:10,722 --> 00:03:12,002
Is that all?

39
00:03:12,122 --> 00:03:14,042
Sa Jia also lost an axe here.

40
00:03:14,282 --> 00:03:15,722
If I don't get an explanation for Sa's family,

41
00:03:15,722 --> 00:03:16,962
I'll make a scene here.

42
00:03:16,962 --> 00:03:17,882
Dear guest,

43
00:03:17,962 --> 00:03:20,002
did you drop this golden axe?

44
00:03:20,082 --> 00:03:21,682
Or this jade axe?

45
00:03:24,442 --> 00:03:25,362
It seems to be

46
00:03:26,362 --> 00:03:27,282
this golden axe.

47
00:03:34,362 --> 00:03:35,362
Even so,

48
00:03:35,362 --> 00:03:36,882
I still have to stay here today

49
00:03:40,242 --> 00:03:42,402
with cold stomach, spleen deficiency and strong liver fire,

50
00:03:42,402 --> 00:03:45,362
Do you often feel pain in your lower body?

51
00:03:45,362 --> 00:03:46,122
Chest tightness, shortness of breath,

52
00:03:46,122 --> 00:03:47,442
buzzing head,

53
00:03:48,442 --> 00:03:49,402
A little,

54
00:03:49,842 --> 00:03:50,682
dear guest,

55
00:03:50,882 --> 00:03:52,242
We specially prepared soup for you

56
00:03:52,242 --> 00:03:53,522
to warm your stomach by removing fire.

57
00:03:53,682 --> 00:03:55,602
I'll send someone to bring it to you right away.

58
00:03:56,722 --> 00:03:57,362
Okay.

59
00:04:02,282 --> 00:04:03,122
Take care.

60
00:04:04,002 --> 00:04:05,082
Come on, let me tell you something,

61
00:04:05,442 --> 00:04:06,002
bro,

62
00:04:06,002 --> 00:04:08,122
Remember to take the medicine on time,

63
00:04:08,162 --> 00:04:08,802
and don't stay up late.

64
00:04:09,602 --> 00:04:11,002
Thank you, shopkeeper.

65
00:04:11,722 --> 00:04:14,002
If anyone dares to make trouble at the bottom of the lake in the future,

66
00:04:14,242 --> 00:04:15,762
the Sa family will teach him to be a man.

67
00:04:17,682 --> 00:04:19,122
Next, we'll wait and see.

68
00:04:19,202 --> 00:04:20,642
Recruit people.

69
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:24,042
This time,

70
00:04:24,642 --> 00:04:25,962
I'm going to break you up

71
00:04:26,762 --> 00:04:28,362
from the inside.

72
00:04:49,002 --> 00:04:50,122
Hello, sir.

73
00:04:51,202 --> 00:04:52,562
How are things going?

74
00:04:52,842 --> 00:04:53,282
Hold on.

75
00:04:53,282 --> 00:04:54,322
I'll be right there.

76
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:57,162
You really think of yourself as a waiter.

77
00:04:57,162 --> 00:04:59,202
I told you to drug me.

78
00:05:00,322 --> 00:05:01,682
I put up with you again and again,

79
00:05:01,682 --> 00:05:02,962
but you were so aggressive.

80
00:05:03,042 --> 00:05:05,442
Threatening and framing my family.

81
00:05:05,882 --> 00:05:07,642
If the shopkeeper hadn't told me to pull back from the brink,

82
00:05:08,322 --> 00:05:10,002
I would have gone astray.

83
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,322
Who doesn't make mistakes when he's young?

84
00:05:12,522 --> 00:05:13,682
Don't take it to heart.

85
00:05:13,682 --> 00:05:14,882
Let's do it in a down-to-earth manner.

86
00:05:15,042 --> 00:05:16,002
When the time comes, we can definitely

87
00:05:16,002 --> 00:05:17,442
settle down in Falling Leaf City,

88
00:05:17,762 --> 00:05:18,562
Where are we fishing at the bottom of the lake?

89
00:05:18,562 --> 00:05:19,642
I will also support you.

90
00:05:20,122 --> 00:05:20,682
By the way,

91
00:05:21,082 --> 00:05:22,602
Mid-Autumn Festival is coming soon.

92
00:05:22,602 --> 00:05:24,562
Bring your parents here.

93
00:05:24,562 --> 00:05:26,002
We had a lively holiday.

94
00:05:26,002 --> 00:05:26,642
Okay?

95
00:05:27,602 --> 00:05:28,322
You,

96
00:05:28,322 --> 00:05:29,202
You … Your boss treats me like a

97
00:05:29,602 --> 00:05:31,482
family,

98
00:05:31,682 --> 00:05:32,362
And you?

99
00:05:33,642 --> 00:05:34,722
I've been with you for ten years,

100
00:05:34,922 --> 00:05:36,562
except humiliation, beating and scolding the shopkeeper

101
00:05:36,802 --> 00:05:38,122
and setting you up.

102
00:05:39,562 --> 00:05:40,242
I'll beat him for you.

103
00:05:40,682 --> 00:05:41,842
It's okay.

104
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:42,602
Calm down.

105
00:05:42,602 --> 00:05:43,282
Stop running!
