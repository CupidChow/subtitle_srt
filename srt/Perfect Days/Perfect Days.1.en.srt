00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,290
PERFECT DAY

2
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,580
Hello.

3
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,620
Sorry, the traffic is heavy.

4
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,160
I hate the morning shift.

5
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,660
There was always vomit everywhere.

6
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,080
Like yesterday at Nanago Dori Park

7
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,267
in Hatagaya.

8
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,120
It was a real nightmare.

9
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,830
It took a long time to come out.

10
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,370
The horror scale is 8 out of 10.

11
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,950
Are you listening to me?

12
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:18,580
Don't worry, Mr. Hiyarama.
It would be dirty again anyway.

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,410
Mother!

15
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,490
What is it?

16
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,240
Are you here with your mother?

17
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,040
Everything will be fine.

18
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,290
Yosuke?

19
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,120
Mom is looking for you!

20
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,290
Where have you been?

21
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,370
Mom is looking for you everywhere!

22
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,700
Didn't I tell you
not to go too far?

23
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,370
I searched all over the park!

24
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,410
I'm sorry dear.

25
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,660
Now he was crying too.

26
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,040
I apologize.

27
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,290
It doesn't matter.

28
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,990
How does it work?

29
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,200
Thank you very much.

30
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,450
Hello, welcome.

31
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,950
Welcome back!

32
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,790
For all your hard work!

33
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:38,870
Yes!  Beat it!

34
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,830
Insert?

35
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,830
Enter!  Look?

36
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,080
Hey! What are you doing?

37
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:50,620
Bet? Where's the fun in that?

38
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,410
Kat-chan! Retreat!

39
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:58,160
Always respect athletes in other
people's sports or religions. High five!

40
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:01,540
Now go. Okay!

41
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,620
They cheat.

42
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,120
They use great players
from other teams.

43
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:06,490
Oh Lord!

44
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,450
Yes! You did it!

45
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:11,870
What a surprise! 10 out of 10!

46
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,040
Wait a moment!
This is the last place.

47
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,950
I'm almost done!

48
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:23,120
So you can work fast
whenever you want.

49
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:25,970
There was a woman waiting
for me. I'm done for today.

50
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,120
Come on!

51
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,370
Mr. Hiyarama, may
I borrow your car?

52
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:16,080
I can't miss this opportunity.
Mr. Hiyarama, please!

53
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:19,740
I beg you!

54
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,200
Come on.

55
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:32,910
Introducing Mr.

56
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:36,330
Hiyarama, my supervisor at work.

57
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:39,330
Hard worker, but very quiet.

58
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,330
I don't even know
what it sounds like.

59
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,700
Mr. Hiyarama, this is Aya.
Definitely a 10 out of 10!

60
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,490
Stop saying that.

61
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,200
Can I play this?

62
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:29,240
Mr Hiyarama...

63
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:47,080
I like the sound.

64
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,500
Yes?

65
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,540
Smith?

66
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:52,540
Very common name.

67
00:35:58,370 --> 00:35:59,580
Mr. Hiyarama Do

68
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:02,290
you really like this job?

69
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,040
You have your own
equipment and tools.

70
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:09,120
How can you work so
hard in a job like this?

71
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:14,160
You don't need to answer.

72
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:16,160
I just wanted to know.

73
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,040
This person is strange.

74
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:20,660
9 out of 10 on the freak scale.

75
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:24,580
I like the sound of cassettes.

76
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:29,870
Yes! The tape sounds great!

77
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,056
This is my first
time listening to it.

78
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,040
The first time is always good!

79
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,700
Drop me off there.

80
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:52,490
Aren't we dating?

81
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,016
I have an extra
shift at the bar.

82
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,410
If you come, I'll be
with you all night.

83
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,950
I'm still waiting for my salary.

84
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:32,830
Mr.

85
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:39,950
Hiyarama, this is
very important to me.

86
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:43,870
What happened to this world?

87
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:46,160
Is this modern times?

88
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:53,370
How much does it cost?

89
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,910
Don't you want to know?

90
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:01,990
I just wanted to know!

91
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:05,990
Analog is back in style.
This can be very valuable.

92
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:11,580
I'm really curious! I know
a great place in Shimokiti.

93
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,330
It is too far.

94
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,700
It only takes less
than 30 minutes.

95
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,040
It should be here...

96
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,370
There he is! That's the sign.

97
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:32,620
Excuse me.

98
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,490
WELCOME.

99
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:44,580
Excuse me, how much is it?

100
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,990
This one is rare, it's Lou Reed.

101
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:50,950
This one, 12 thousand yen.

102
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,200
Are you serious?

103
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:57,620
- This one is 8000.
 - Is it true?

104
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:59,550
Where did you get these tapes?

105
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,950
This is my boss's.

106
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,910
This one is 4000 yen.

107
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,540
Are you serious?

108
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:11,790
This one can be sold for 6000. You
can make a lot of money from this.

109
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:16,240
This is my estimate.

110
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,660
Geez!

111
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:23,290
Extraordinary!
Mr. Hiyarama, let's sell it!

112
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:26,080
We'll take it all.
The trend tape.

113
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:28,540
Especially cassettes
from the 70s and 80s.

114
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,740
We have to sell
your entire collection.

115
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:34,240
Twelve thousand
just for this recording!

116
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:36,700
Now is the perfect time!

117
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:39,700
OK, just one.
We'll just sell one.

118
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:43,040
So I can go to the bar and meet Aya.
This is a very important night for me.

119
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,200
This is a very
important night for me!

120
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,830
If I miss this opportunity.

121
00:39:57,370 --> 00:40:00,330
There is no love if we
are poor. Is not that true?

122
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:39,330
Correct?

123
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:43,540
Thank you very much!

124
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,580
You saved me! I go!

125
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,450
You're the best, Mr. Hiyarama!

126
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:00,830
Thank you for coming.

127
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:15,450
Deep sleep.

128
00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:09,330
Thank You!

129
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,290
Mr Hiyarama...

130
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:15,910
I don't think I have a chance
with Aya. Chances are 2 out of 10.

131
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,870
But that doesn't mean I give up.

132
00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:36,330
Mr. Hiyarama, you're

133
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:38,450
not married yet, right?

134
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:42,240
Alone at your age...

135
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,580
Have you ever felt lonely?

136
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:52,120
Takashi!

137
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:53,700
Oh, hey!

138
00:54:53,830 --> 00:54:55,040
Takashi!

139
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:59,040
- We haven't seen each other for a long time.
 - Takashi!

140
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:01,370
How are you?

141
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:04,870
I am looking for you.

142
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:06,990
- Is it true?
 - Yes.

143
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:11,200
Mr.

144
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:14,040
Hiyarama, this is
Dera-chan, my friend.

145
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:18,540
As you can see,
he likes my ears.

146
00:55:18,830 --> 00:55:21,740
Every time he meets me, he
touched it. He always finds me.

147
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,200
10 out of 10. Dera-chan is friends with

148
00:55:25,410 --> 00:55:28,950
my ears, I'm just his accessory, right?

149
00:55:29,450 --> 00:55:31,120
- Yes.
 - Or not?

150
00:55:31,330 --> 00:55:32,450
Correct!

151
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:34,080
Correct!

152
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:30,830
Excuse me!

153
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:36,370
I want to return this to you.

154
00:56:38,330 --> 00:56:39,660
This.

155
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,830
Can I listen to it one more time?

156
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,450
Thank You.

157
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:33,580
Takashi said something?

158
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:34,080
Welcome back.

159
00:59:48,330 --> 00:59:50,160
For all your hard work!

160
01:03:31,330 --> 01:03:32,330
Hello.

161
01:03:32,450 --> 01:03:33,450
Hello.

162
01:03:57,580 --> 01:03:58,830
Thank You.

Aya Koda.

166
01:06:32,830 --> 01:06:35,700
Aya Koda should be more famous.

He uses the same words we use, but becomes special with them.

168
01:07:00,410 --> 01:07:01,910
Good afternoon, Mr Hiyarama.

169
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:05,040
As usual?

170
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:08,700

Have you read it?

174
01:07:17,790 --> 01:07:19,370
You're quite intellectual.

175
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:21,830
I don't think so.

176
01:07:22,620 --> 01:07:24,830
Here's your potato salad,

177
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,290
and here's to a long day.

178
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:33,410
Mom, I can't buy
those appetizers.

179
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:35,790
I give you.

180
01:07:36,370 --> 01:07:38,930
We had some but we
never had that many.

181
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:42,240
No.  We're all equal here, right?

182
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:47,830
I'll have to look up "equality" in the dictionary.

183
01:07:47,950 --> 01:07:50,660
Ah, girls don't like petty guys.

184
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:54,080
You always have wrinkles here?

No no, next door. Here.

186
01:08:01,830 --> 01:08:04,040
Mom, do you have fried tofu?

187
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:08,490
No, we're out of stock. I'll
make it if you want to buy it.

188
01:08:08,790 --> 01:08:11,830
His wife left him.

189
01:08:12,200 --> 01:08:14,490
How could he be so cheerful?

190
01:08:15,950 --> 01:08:17,080
You talking about me?

191
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:18,540
Nothing.

192
01:08:19,450 --> 01:08:23,120
How can you be cheerful
when your wife leaves you?

193
01:08:23,330 --> 01:08:26,620
Easy. Finally I am
happy to be single again.

194
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:29,040
It makes all the men happy.

195
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:34,290
It was a relief to be free
from nagging women.

196
01:08:34,620 --> 01:08:36,240
You're just pretending
to be strong.

197
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:40,450
Soon you'll be here crying,
venting how lonely you are.

198
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:42,950
The story is always the same...

199
01:08:44,290 --> 01:08:46,200
One more drink?

200
01:08:46,620 --> 01:08:47,990
This.

201
01:08:55,370 --> 01:08:57,990
Why can't everything stay the same?

202
01:08:59,410 --> 01:09:00,660
Mom.

203
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:02,370
Sing us that song.

204
01:09:02,660 --> 01:09:03,790
Our favorite.

205
01:09:05,450 --> 01:09:06,660
Oh yes!

206
01:09:09,290 --> 01:09:12,410
But Mr. Hiyarama had just arrived.

207
01:09:12,790 --> 01:09:14,540
- Don't disappoint us.
- Please!

208
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:16,740
This is it, this is it.

209
01:09:17,790 --> 01:09:19,290
Come on.

210
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:22,740
Since you've already got the
guitar out... Let's get started.

211
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:25,080
This is a beautiful song.

212
01:09:35,450 --> 01:09:41,620
<i>I arrived at that place</i>

213
01:09:43,830 --> 01:09:46,830
<i>in New Orleans</i>

214
01:09:49,450 --> 01:09:54,290
<i>In a place they call a brothel.</i>

215
01:09:57,870 --> 01:10:02,080
<i>"House of the Rising Sun".</i>

216
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:10,240
<i>The man I love</i>

217
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:16,490
<i>he didn't come back.</i>

218
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:24,290
<i>That's when I left</i>

219
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:30,660
<i>to your homeland.</i>

220
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:37,910
<i>I got on the train,</i>

221
01:10:41,410 --> 01:10:44,830
<i>and for a moment...</i>

222
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:17,410
Two hard lemonades!

223
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:20,200
Oh, wait a minute!

224
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:27,990
For all your hard work!

225
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:19,370
Uncle.

226
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:21,450
Where are you?

227
01:14:22,450 --> 01:14:23,830
I've been waiting a long time.

228
01:14:29,330 --> 01:14:30,990
Which door is your house?

229
01:14:32,250 --> 01:14:33,950
Above or below?

230
01:14:41,950 --> 01:14:43,370
Nico?

231
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:50,870
You've grown so much!

232
01:16:45,870 --> 01:16:46,990
Uncle

233
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:48,740
Are you going to work?

234
01:16:51,410 --> 01:16:53,160
Can I go with you?

235
01:16:56,790 --> 01:16:58,660
You'd better take me.

236
01:16:58,750 --> 01:17:01,750
If you leave me alone, I don't
know what I'm going to do.

237
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:27,870
Enter from over there.

238
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,450
Would you like coffee?

239
01:17:38,580 --> 01:17:39,580
Of course.

240
01:17:40,660 --> 01:17:41,870
Same as me?

241
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Yes.

242
01:17:50,790 --> 01:17:51,790
Thank You.

243
01:18:05,870 --> 01:18:07,700
- You want to put it in?
 - Yes.

244
01:18:08,700 --> 01:18:10,160
No, no.

245
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:12,330
This side.

246
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:14,240
- Like this?
 - Yes.

247
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:16,790
The recording is on this side.

248
01:18:41,870 --> 01:18:43,700
That's the Sky Tree?

249
01:18:44,950 --> 01:18:46,620
Yes.

250
01:19:05,910 --> 01:19:08,040
So this is a cassette?

251
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,700
Like from ancient times?

252
01:19:10,950 --> 01:19:12,240
From ancient times.

253
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:16,040
Can I play this on my iPhone?

254
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:18,200
What is it written?

255
01:19:18,660 --> 01:19:20,410
Van Morrison.

256
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:22,950
Is this on Spotify?

257
01:19:26,290 --> 01:19:27,870
I don't know.

258
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:31,330
Where is it?

259
01:19:32,830 --> 01:19:34,330
What?

260
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:36,410
That shop.

261
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:39,660
This is not from a shop.

262
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:04,540
Ah, what is that thing!

263
01:22:06,750 --> 01:22:10,120
You mean this? Old camera.

264
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:11,950
Look!

265
01:22:14,540 --> 01:22:15,740
How?

266
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,620
You do not remember?

267
01:22:18,580 --> 01:22:20,620
You gave it to me, Uncle.

268
01:22:25,700 --> 01:22:27,830
- Oh yes.
 - Liar.

269
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:30,990
You don't remember, right?

270
01:22:41,910 --> 01:22:44,660
That tree is your friend?

271
01:22:45,910 --> 01:22:47,160
Friend?

272
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:48,750
Yes?

273
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:56,160
I think so.

274
01:22:57,290 --> 01:22:59,200
The tree is my friend.

275
01:24:35,750 --> 01:24:37,200
Uncle?

276
01:24:40,830 --> 01:24:42,290
Can I borrow this book?

277
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:43,660
Which one?

278
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,120
"Eleven Short Stories."

279
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:50,240
Of course.

280
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:54,290
This man, Victor, from
the story "The Turtle"...

281
01:24:54,910 --> 01:24:56,330
He's like me.

282
01:24:57,750 --> 01:25:00,410
I understand what
he's going through.

283
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:12,450
May I help?

284
01:25:12,790 --> 01:25:14,160
Really?

285
01:25:31,830 --> 01:25:32,830
Thank You.

286
01:25:54,330 --> 01:25:58,200
Uncle, why don't you
and my mother get along?

287
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:02,790
Is that what he told you?

288
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:06,290
Every time I talk about

289
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:08,830
you he changes the subject.

290
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:13,330
So.

291
01:26:16,750 --> 01:26:18,740
Did you quarrel
with your mother?

292
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,290
That's it.

293
01:26:23,950 --> 01:26:26,290
Do you always run
away from home?

294
01:26:27,370 --> 01:26:28,830
This is my first experience.

295
01:26:30,700 --> 01:26:34,990
It was my plan to
stay with you, Uncle.

296
01:26:36,620 --> 01:26:38,700
What does it mean?

297
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,370
Hello.

298
01:27:03,290 --> 01:27:04,290
Here he is.

299
01:27:05,410 --> 01:27:07,580
Thank You. I go there?

300
01:27:08,370 --> 01:27:10,950
See you in 10
minutes. That's too fast.

301
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:12,910
20 minutes then.

302
01:27:20,870 --> 01:27:22,040
Yes. Okay.

303
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:25,410
Yes OK.

304
01:27:31,950 --> 01:27:33,240
Are you hungry?

305
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:36,160
- We're going to have lunch.
- Hooray!

306
01:27:38,910 --> 01:27:40,580
- Put the towel here.
- Thank You.

307
01:27:54,410 --> 01:27:57,620
You and my mother are not the same.

308
01:27:58,700 --> 01:27:59,990
What do you mean?

309
01:28:01,250 --> 01:28:06,040
He says you live in a different world.

310
01:28:07,290 --> 01:28:08,830
That's probably true.

311
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:10,620
Is it true?

312
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:17,160
This world is made of
many different worlds.

313
01:28:18,330 --> 01:28:22,580
Some are related and some are not.

314
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:25,740
my world,

315
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:29,410
and your mother's world is very different.

316
01:28:31,250 --> 01:28:32,580
What about my world?

317
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:35,410
In what world am I in?

318
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:51,120
This river flows into the sea?

319
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:53,700
Yes, to the sea.

320
01:28:55,250 --> 01:28:56,620
Can we go there?

321
01:29:00,450 --> 01:29:01,660
Next time.

322
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:03,620
When?

323
01:29:05,370 --> 01:29:06,910
Next time next time.

324
01:29:07,580 --> 01:29:09,200
And when exactly is that?

325
01:29:10,370 --> 01:29:11,990
Next time next time.

326
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:14,700
Now now.

327
01:29:15,620 --> 01:29:17,160
Next time next time.

328
01:29:19,290 --> 01:29:20,740
Now now.

329
01:29:35,290 --> 01:29:37,200
Next time next time.

330
01:29:37,700 --> 01:29:39,240
Now now.

331
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:41,950
Next time next time.

332
01:29:42,330 --> 01:29:43,660
Now now.

333
01:30:27,370 --> 01:30:28,580
Bro.

334
01:30:29,870 --> 01:30:31,290
It's been a long time.

335
01:30:34,910 --> 01:30:36,740
So you live here?

336
01:30:38,250 --> 01:30:41,370
I'm not trying to be rude.
Niko, get your things.

337
01:30:41,700 --> 01:30:43,830
- I don't want to!
- That's not an option.

338
01:30:43,950 --> 01:30:44,950
Uncle!

339
01:30:45,620 --> 01:30:46,620
Come on, quickly.

340
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:48,240
Uncle!

341
01:30:50,410 --> 01:30:52,490
Come visit whenever you want.

342
01:30:53,580 --> 01:30:55,940
I haven't even finished
reading your book.

343
01:30:57,250 --> 01:30:58,770
You can take him.

344
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:06,160
I'll be like Victor.

345
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:09,580
No, it won't.

346
01:31:10,750 --> 01:31:12,820
- Do not say that.
- Niko!

347
01:31:37,330 --> 01:31:39,120
For all your problems.

348
01:31:41,370 --> 01:31:43,080
Your favorite chocolate.

349
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:52,200
He's a good boy.

350
01:31:53,540 --> 01:31:55,080
I'm not sure about that.

351
01:31:57,790 --> 01:31:58,830
Our father

352
01:31:59,910 --> 01:32:02,740
he didn't remember anything else.

353
01:32:04,040 --> 01:32:06,370
Will you visit him at the nursing home?

354
01:32:07,370 --> 01:32:09,660
He wouldn't
behave like last time.

355
01:32:23,290 --> 01:32:26,830
Is it true that you
work cleaning toilets?

356
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:51,450
Uncle.

357
01:32:53,950 --> 01:32:54,950
Thank You.

358
01:35:34,580 --> 01:35:35,790
This is Takashi.

359
01:35:37,330 --> 01:35:38,990
This is Takashi, hello?

360
01:35:39,410 --> 01:35:40,660
I hear you.

361
01:35:42,540 --> 01:35:45,700
Mr. Hiyarama, you've
been good to me.

362
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,040
I really appreciate
it. 9 out of 10!

363
01:35:48,370 --> 01:35:52,040
That's why it's hard for me
to say this, but I stopped.

364
01:35:53,370 --> 01:35:54,370
What?

365
01:35:54,660 --> 01:35:56,870
I will pay you back soon.

366
01:35:57,660 --> 01:36:00,040
Wait a moment,
how about your shift?

367
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:14,790
Yes.

368
01:36:14,830 --> 01:36:17,346
We couldn't find a
replacement in such a short time.

369
01:36:17,370 --> 01:36:20,410
There's no replacement?
What should I do?

370
01:36:20,540 --> 01:36:21,976
You have to cover today's shift.

371
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,000
What?

372
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:28,450
May I?  Sorry, I'll be quick.

373
01:36:28,620 --> 01:36:29,990
Excuse me.

374
01:36:34,080 --> 01:36:35,540
Excuse me!

375
01:36:36,660 --> 01:36:39,040
- You're new?
- I'm almost done.

376
01:37:03,580 --> 01:37:04,580
What is it?

377
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:07,240
Where's Takashi?

378
01:37:56,200 --> 01:37:59,290
I've called three times.
Why didn't anyone pick up?

379
01:37:59,620 --> 01:38:02,490
Look, I'm just
doing this for today.

380
01:38:03,080 --> 01:38:05,540
Find someone, okay?

381
01:39:54,040 --> 01:39:56,910
I'm Sato. I was told to
come here immediately,

382
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:59,660
and taking over shifts
from previous employees.

383
01:40:00,580 --> 01:40:01,830
Should I start there?

384
01:40:01,950 --> 01:40:03,200
Ah yes.

385
01:43:07,750 --> 01:43:09,080
- Hello.
- Hello.

386
01:44:09,620 --> 01:44:12,450
Do you remember what used to be here?

387
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:22,580
That means we are getting older.

388
01:44:56,950 --> 01:45:00,910
Patricia Highsmith
knows all about anxiety.

389
01:45:01,790 --> 01:45:05,620
He showed me fear and
anxiety are different things.

390
01:45:44,450 --> 01:45:45,950
What are you doing here?

391
01:45:48,540 --> 01:45:49,700
Do you know...

392
01:45:54,410 --> 01:45:55,580
Can I come in?

393
01:45:59,950 --> 01:46:00,950
Enter.

394
01:46:34,870 --> 01:46:37,160
Cigarettes and plastic.

395
01:47:54,620 --> 01:47:56,450
Can I ask?

396
01:48:06,474 --> 01:48:28,474
Translation: Kuda Lumping
Medan, 01 March 2024

397
01:48:32,580 --> 01:48:34,580
I haven't smoked for a long time.

398
01:48:45,040 --> 01:48:47,290
Did you see us at the bar earlier?

399
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:01,580
It seems like you're always there.

400
01:49:02,790 --> 01:49:03,790
Yes.

401
01:49:04,700 --> 01:49:09,370
Since it opened, five or six years ago.

402
01:49:10,870 --> 01:49:11,870
So.

403
01:49:13,620 --> 01:49:14,870
It's a great place.

404
01:49:23,910 --> 01:49:25,540
I'm her ex-husband.

405
01:49:29,580 --> 01:49:32,160
Ah, I see.

406
01:49:34,950 --> 01:49:38,490
It's been seven years since we divorced.

407
01:49:39,830 --> 01:49:41,540
I've remarried.

408
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:46,740
It's been seven years
since I last saw him.

409
01:49:57,410 --> 01:49:58,870
I have cancer.

410
01:50:00,330 --> 01:50:02,200
And it has spread.

411
01:50:05,330 --> 01:50:07,830
My body is swollen from chemotherapy.

412
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:16,410
Then me

413
01:50:17,540 --> 01:50:20,080
suddenly felt,
I owe him an apology.

414
01:50:20,620 --> 01:50:23,160
Nothing bad happened.

415
01:50:25,080 --> 01:50:27,290
Maybe that's not an apology.

416
01:50:29,450 --> 01:50:31,290
I want to thank him.

417
01:50:32,790 --> 01:50:35,080
No, that's not all.

418
01:50:37,870 --> 01:50:40,660
I just want to
meet him, that's all.

419
01:50:53,370 --> 01:50:54,740
Do you want a drink?

420
01:50:55,160 --> 01:50:57,580
- No, thank you.
- I still have one more.

421
01:50:59,870 --> 01:51:01,580
Okay.

422
01:51:02,660 --> 01:51:03,660
I'll take one.

423
01:51:30,200 --> 01:51:31,910
Please take care of him.

424
01:51:32,330 --> 01:51:35,790
- No, we don't have that kind of relationship.
- I'm counting on you.

425
01:51:37,160 --> 01:51:38,790
It is not like that.

426
01:51:52,910 --> 01:51:53,910
Shadow

427
01:51:55,250 --> 01:51:57,540
do the colors get darker
when they overlap each other?

428
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:04,370
I don't know.

429
01:52:06,120 --> 01:52:08,580
There are still many
things I don't understand.

430
01:52:09,450 --> 01:52:11,450
That's how life goes.

431
01:52:12,620 --> 01:52:14,160
That's how it is.

432
01:52:28,620 --> 01:52:30,450
Let's find out now.

433
01:52:31,620 --> 01:52:33,040
What?

434
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:46,490
Stand there.

435
01:52:48,330 --> 01:52:49,330
What?

436
01:52:56,540 --> 01:52:57,620
What do you see?

437
01:53:01,620 --> 01:53:03,290
Looks the same to me.

438
01:53:03,700 --> 01:53:05,370
Isn't this darker?

439
01:53:06,580 --> 01:53:08,160
I doubt that.

440
01:53:10,450 --> 01:53:12,370
It looks darker to me.

441
01:53:14,700 --> 01:53:16,700
I don't see the difference.

442
01:53:18,410 --> 01:53:20,910
Here, look!

443
01:53:21,540 --> 01:53:23,870
It gets darker!
That's the logic.

444
01:53:24,870 --> 01:53:26,700
You're very persistent.

445
01:53:28,830 --> 01:53:30,830
Still no change?

446
01:53:32,370 --> 01:53:35,620
Just forget it.

447
01:53:40,950 --> 01:53:42,830
I agree.

448
01:53:54,410 --> 01:53:56,330
Want to play shadow tag?

449
01:53:58,580 --> 01:54:00,870
I'm the one chasing.

450
01:54:02,040 --> 01:54:03,450
Ready?

451
01:54:04,120 --> 01:54:05,540
I start.

452
01:54:06,500 --> 01:54:08,120
Run!

453
01:54:13,330 --> 01:54:14,910
- You are okay?
 - This is difficult.

454
01:54:16,410 --> 01:54:17,636
Now I'm the one chasing him.

455
01:54:17,660 --> 01:54:20,240
- Are you sure?
 - Ready?  - I start.

456
01:54:20,620 --> 01:54:22,160
Gotcha!

457
01:54:30,910 --> 01:54:32,330
Very melty.

458
01:54:33,410 --> 01:54:35,410
This is tiring. Gotcha!

459
01:54:37,870 --> 01:54:39,910
- Almost.  I stepped on you.
 - Is it true?

460
01:54:40,040 --> 01:54:41,080
Yes.
