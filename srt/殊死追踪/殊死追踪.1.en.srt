<i>You come across certain
people as you live your life.</i>

5
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:05,201
People who always cause
trouble whenever they meet.

6
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:12,917
As if by fate's joke, those people
gathered in one place recently.

7
00:01:13,584 --> 00:01:18,297
Not just two, but three.

8
00:01:19,548 --> 00:01:21,759
Hey! Stop right there!

9
00:01:27,682 --> 00:01:29,432
- Dammit!
- Asshole!

10
00:01:47,827 --> 00:01:49,954
I got you, you son of a bitch!

11
00:01:50,997 --> 00:01:54,167
How dare you sell drugs to kids?

12
00:01:55,293 --> 00:01:56,586
Get over here, punk!

13
00:01:56,919 --> 00:01:58,421
Wait, what are you doing!?

14
00:02:01,424 --> 00:02:04,051
This cop is killing me!

15
00:02:06,679 --> 00:02:09,015
That bastard is at it again.

16
00:02:09,307 --> 00:02:12,185
Cho Su-gwang! You can't
cause any more trouble!

17
00:02:12,685 --> 00:02:14,538
Let him go, you'll break his leg.

18
00:02:14,604 --> 00:02:15,604
Pull him off.

19
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,333
Shit! Let go of me!

20
00:02:18,398 --> 00:02:19,793
Let go!

21
00:02:19,859 --> 00:02:22,778
What's wrong with a
cop catching a criminal?!

22
00:02:24,447 --> 00:02:29,785
Cho Su-gwang doesn't just catch
criminals but almost end their lives.

23
00:02:30,035 --> 00:02:34,999
And the master of disguise, and
infamous con man, Kim In-hae.

24
00:02:37,627 --> 00:02:40,564
<i>He once started a con
with a fake $30 pearl,</i>

25
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,257
<i>and made off with a $4M plot in Sokcho.</i>

26
00:02:45,009 --> 00:02:46,594
Pearl!

27
00:02:46,844 --> 00:02:48,846
What?! A pearl?!

28
00:02:50,848 --> 00:02:51,848
Pearl!

29
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:57,063
This is the natural pearl
that was on the news?

30
00:02:57,563 --> 00:03:00,942
That's right, it's extremely rare.

31
00:03:01,609 --> 00:03:04,528
I'll take it, this should cover it.

32
00:03:08,407 --> 00:03:12,846
Francis Sandro Bublé, you
have a keen eye for art.

33
00:03:12,912 --> 00:03:16,290
I'd like to take this painting.

34
00:03:17,624 --> 00:03:18,834
Mamma mia.

35
00:03:21,295 --> 00:03:26,300
I don't have much time
left, I have no regrets now.

36
00:03:29,178 --> 00:03:34,433
That's all I have, I
want you to have it.

37
00:03:34,767 --> 00:03:38,229
But that's your prized treasure…

38
00:03:44,026 --> 00:03:50,908
I want you to build your
orphanage on my Sokcho land.

39
00:03:51,242 --> 00:03:54,078
But Madam Wang…

40
00:03:54,745 --> 00:03:56,747
Thank you, Madam.

41
00:04:02,086 --> 00:04:08,485
Lastly, the Black Society drug lord
operating out of Hong Kong and Taiwan,

42
00:04:08,551 --> 00:04:10,636
Zhu Lin-fang.

43
00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:23,774
I hear the kids are going nuts

44
00:04:24,317 --> 00:04:26,736
to buy fentanyl that you cooked.

45
00:04:27,278 --> 00:04:28,130
Yes, that's right.

46
00:04:28,196 --> 00:04:29,714
But whose

47
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,342
permission did you get
to push drugs in Taiwan?

48
00:04:32,408 --> 00:04:33,843
I'm sorry.

49
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:36,829
I'll pay as much tax as possible.

50
00:04:37,246 --> 00:04:39,848
You think I'm doing this
for some petty tax dollars?

51
00:04:39,915 --> 00:04:40,916
What? Then what…

52
00:05:03,856 --> 00:05:05,316
Where is the lab?

53
00:05:05,941 --> 00:05:07,168
Chairman Chu Lin-pang.

54
00:05:07,234 --> 00:05:09,779
I'll pay my dues as you wish,

55
00:05:10,196 --> 00:05:12,698
but to hand over the lab is…

56
00:05:21,374 --> 00:05:22,875
Where is the lab?!

57
00:05:25,044 --> 00:05:26,146
It's in…

58
00:05:26,211 --> 00:05:28,315
Mailiao Xiang,

59
00:05:28,381 --> 00:05:30,675
1238.

60
00:05:31,425 --> 00:05:32,510
Back.

61
00:05:32,927 --> 00:05:34,345
Take the lab.

62
00:05:47,274 --> 00:05:48,651
Life is all about

63
00:05:49,526 --> 00:05:51,904
living like fire before time's up.

64
00:05:52,196 --> 00:05:53,197
Am I right?

65
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:04,959
This case started when
these three men arrived

66
00:06:06,544 --> 00:06:08,129

108
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,912
Why is the arcade still in disarray?

109
00:09:29,246 --> 00:09:32,267
I'm still working on
the buyout process.

110
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:35,895

ya destroyin' families,

121
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:11,621
and shatterin' lifelong pride!

122
00:10:12,164 --> 00:10:14,875

00:10:26,804 --> 00:10:30,825
Ma'am, ya have no
idea who ya talkin' to!

126
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:34,812
I could care less who they're,
listen to me carefully.

127
00:10:36,647 --> 00:10:43,153
Before I'm six feet under,
ya will not touch this land.

128
00:10:43,445 --> 00:10:47,991

Ma'am!

132
00:11:00,754 --> 00:11:02,840
What? What do you mean?!

133
00:11:03,173 --> 00:11:05,217
Transfer to Jeju Island?!

134
00:11:06,009 --> 00:11:08,887
You thought you'd be safe

00:11:09,138 --> 00:11:12,784
You break suspects' legs,
arms, necks and teeth,

136
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:15,495
you're committing crimes too.

137
00:11:15,561 --> 00:11:19,332
Jeju is nice and warm, enjoy
the breeze for a few months.

138
00:11:19,398 --> 00:11:22,210
Be precise, Captain,
how many months exactly?

139
00:11:22,276 --> 00:11:25,254
Who knows, when I pay off
my car I got 2 months ago?

140
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,407
Holy shit! I knew it!

141
00:11:28,741 --> 00:11:32,011
You got it financed for 48 months!

142
00:11:32,077 --> 00:11:35,456
I even wore a cute sweater
to treat my anger issue!

143
00:11:35,664 --> 00:11:37,916
I'm gonna tear this to pieces!

144
00:11:38,834 --> 00:11:40,586
Why's this so tight?!

145
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:44,315
All done? Do it a bit more.

146
00:11:44,381 --> 00:11:47,193
If you can't control it,
you'll be stripped for good.

147
00:11:47,259 --> 00:11:49,303
See, I don't even get
angry in this situation.

148
00:11:49,636 --> 00:11:53,449
Don't cause any troubles
when you're down there.

149
00:11:53,515 --> 00:11:55,284
If you do,

150
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:58,037
reinstatement will be
the least of your worries!

151
00:11:58,103 --> 00:12:00,664
Your bones will be buried
in the Mt. Halla crater!

152
00:12:00,731 --> 00:12:03,167
I can't control my
temper in front of you!

153
00:12:03,233 --> 00:12:05,402
You think I can't take
my clothes off too?!

154
00:12:29,592 --> 00:12:31,970
Let me feel Dr. Yang's
touch, it's been a while.

155
00:12:32,596 --> 00:12:34,264
Certainly, I'll get ready.

156
00:12:37,893 --> 00:12:41,145
I'm sure you've heard,

157
00:12:41,563 --> 00:12:45,084
a Seoul idiot named Cho
Su-gwang is joining us.

158
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,276
Yes.

159
00:12:47,152 --> 00:12:52,533
Then we have to decide
who will be his partner.

160
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,054
Hey, where are you all going?!

161
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,705
Sorry, I'm late!

162
00:13:02,251 --> 00:13:04,669
What was that? Where are they going?

163
00:13:05,796 --> 00:13:07,047
I almost forgot…

164
00:13:07,297 --> 00:13:12,803
We had Jeju Police's pride
and ace detective Lee Su-jin.

165
00:13:15,013 --> 00:13:18,433
Why are you grinning like that?

166
00:13:26,233 --> 00:13:31,738
There's a saying in China,
"Money makes money."

167
00:13:32,406 --> 00:13:36,535
This is like a charm that
represents that saying.

168
00:13:39,413 --> 00:13:40,706
Manage it well.

169
00:13:41,789 --> 00:13:43,017
Of course, Chairman.

170
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,335
I'm taking special care of it.

171
00:13:45,836 --> 00:13:48,087
The procedure is
ready, please sit down.

172
00:13:59,308 --> 00:14:03,770
You administer propofol
like no other, Dr. Yang.

173
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:05,981
Thank you.

174
00:14:18,201 --> 00:14:23,975
Have you heard of 'fentanyl'?

175
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:28,604
Yes, it's a trendy recreational drug
popular among young people.

176
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:31,214
Cheap, strong and addictive.

177
00:14:32,257 --> 00:14:33,383
Why do you ask?

178
00:14:34,384 --> 00:14:40,432
I'll be distributing it from Taiwan.

179
00:14:41,642 --> 00:14:43,393
Right here in Jeju.

180
00:14:45,479 --> 00:14:48,124
But this is Korea without
any proper connections.

181
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:51,068
Distributing drugs
will create problems.

182
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:56,239
It wouldn't be any
fun without problems.

183
00:14:56,907 --> 00:14:58,283
Am I right?

184
00:15:07,376 --> 00:15:10,021
<i>First! Don't cause trouble in Jeju</i>

185
00:15:10,087 --> 00:15:11,606
You're so bad at this.

186
00:15:11,672 --> 00:15:13,840
Stop teasing me!

187
00:15:14,716 --> 00:15:18,362
So bad! Admit it! Are you pissed?

188
00:15:18,428 --> 00:15:20,764
Don't make fun of me!

189
00:15:26,937 --> 00:15:28,438
Oh my, I'm sorry.

190
00:15:31,942 --> 00:15:35,112
I'm so sorry about that!

191
00:15:35,737 --> 00:15:38,591
Ma'am! Stop fondling me!

192
00:15:38,657 --> 00:15:40,927
Buddy! We're almost
there, wake the hell up!

193
00:15:40,993 --> 00:15:45,163
Lady! Do something about your bastards!

194
00:15:55,882 --> 00:15:57,426
Good ta see ya.

195
00:15:57,926 --> 00:15:59,636
I just got here.

196
00:16:01,054 --> 00:16:02,406
Police station, please.

197
00:16:02,472 --> 00:16:03,682
Sure.

198
00:16:08,645 --> 00:16:11,231
Ya lick comin' here to Jeju?

199
00:16:12,107 --> 00:16:13,692
I'm licking who?

200
00:16:14,234 --> 00:16:16,319
What? What dee I say?

201
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,531
You said I have to lick someone.

202
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:26,163
Tis Jeju dialect, that's how we talk.

203
00:16:27,122 --> 00:16:32,544
Comin', goin', ya know
Hyeeunyi's song 'Leaving'?

204
00:16:33,128 --> 00:16:34,605
♪ Leaving, leaving ♪

205
00:16:34,671 --> 00:16:38,359
She sang so well.

206
00:16:38,425 --> 00:16:39,676
I see, I see.

207
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:44,448
I haven't been here in a decade,
so many skyscrapers now.

208
00:16:44,514 --> 00:16:46,325
All these buildings,

209
00:16:46,391 --> 00:16:51,188
built by Chinese folks,
not us islanders.

210
00:16:52,355 --> 00:16:57,986
We sold houses, lands to
Chinese and made moneys.

211
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,506
That's nice.

212
00:17:00,572 --> 00:17:02,908
Making money thanks to Chinese.

213
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:08,830
Why didn't my ancestors
ever buy lands in Jeju?

214
00:17:09,623 --> 00:17:10,558
Indeed.

215
00:17:10,624 --> 00:17:13,894
Ma ancestor lived in
Jeju all their lives,

216
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,338
but why didn't they buy lands?

217
00:17:16,921 --> 00:17:18,565
I heard it takes 5 minutes

218
00:17:18,632 --> 00:17:22,445
to get to the station from the
airport, why is it taking so long?

219
00:17:22,511 --> 00:17:26,014
Don't try to scam me, I'm a cop.

220
00:17:27,724 --> 00:17:29,577
It ain't that at all,

221
00:17:29,642 --> 00:17:32,163
I only cam ta Jeju
less than a year ago.

222
00:17:32,229 --> 00:17:37,793
Tis so complicated here,
one-ways everywhere,

223
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:39,712
I'll hurry, sorry.

224
00:17:39,777 --> 00:17:43,049
But you use Jeju dialect like crazy.

225
00:17:43,115 --> 00:17:45,258
Gotta fit in, ya know?

226
00:17:45,325 --> 00:17:49,180
Us, taxi drivers, gotta
use other languages,

227
00:17:49,246 --> 00:17:55,210
and dialects to git sum
tips, tis job pays so little.

228
00:17:55,836 --> 00:18:00,733
There're two police stations
in Jeju, and ya didn't specify,

229
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,592
which one are ya goin'?

230
00:18:04,844 --> 00:18:06,304
The Jeju City one.

231
00:18:07,055 --> 00:18:10,450
Ya shoulda said so earlier!

232
00:18:10,517 --> 00:18:14,497
I'm feelin' under the weather,
we're going da opposite way!

233
00:18:14,563 --> 00:18:17,357
Why didn't ya tell me?!

234
00:18:17,774 --> 00:18:21,027
It'll take at least 50 minutes!

235
00:18:21,611 --> 00:18:24,906
I can't read minds, ya shoulda told me!

236
00:18:25,198 --> 00:18:27,575
I didn't wanna work today…

237
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,637
He crashed into him!

238
00:18:29,703 --> 00:18:31,079
Ran him over!

239
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,183
Watcha watching?

240
00:18:34,248 --> 00:18:36,251
What? It's nothing.

241
00:18:39,296 --> 00:18:40,671
YouTube again?

242
00:18:41,965 --> 00:18:44,843
Oh, this moron.

243
00:18:45,177 --> 00:18:46,529
Why are you watching this?

244
00:18:46,594 --> 00:18:48,263
She doesn't know.

245
00:18:49,514 --> 00:18:51,909
This guy's got a fiery side.

246
00:18:51,975 --> 00:18:56,622
The asshole getting beaten up,
sold drugs to high schoolers,

247
00:18:56,688 --> 00:19:00,292
but he got released whenever
he got arrested for some reason,

248
00:19:00,358 --> 00:19:04,796
and he kept dealing drugs to kids,
and ended up in Cho's hands.

249
00:19:04,863 --> 00:19:09,743
Since justice doesn't work,
Cho beat the crap out of him.

250
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,037
It's his form of justice.

251
00:19:13,872 --> 00:19:15,516
Screw justice.

252
00:19:15,582 --> 00:19:19,019
A cop using violence ain't
justice, that's venting his anger.

253
00:19:19,085 --> 00:19:23,840
It's a disorder, he
needs to be treated.

254
00:19:24,424 --> 00:19:25,734
I am getting treated.

255
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,969
You see? I was so right…

256
00:19:32,806 --> 00:19:35,352
Oh gosh, Lt. Cho's here already?

257
00:19:36,728 --> 00:19:37,771
Yes, sir.

258
00:19:46,321 --> 00:19:48,424
Su-jin, easy, easy, please calm down.

259
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:49,824
And don't swear.

260
00:19:52,786 --> 00:19:55,121
Shit, I ain't doing it!

261
00:19:56,414 --> 00:19:59,417
Cap! You said he's a stud from Seoul!

262
00:20:00,543 --> 00:20:01,979
Fine, he's from Seoul.

263
00:20:02,045 --> 00:20:03,939
But you said he's hot!

264
00:20:04,005 --> 00:20:08,319
He's fine, but you
didn't say he's a lunatic!

265
00:20:08,385 --> 00:20:10,488
Calm down and listen to me.

266
00:20:10,554 --> 00:20:12,364
How could I calm down right now?!

267
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:15,183
Jeju people have anger issues.

268
00:20:19,145 --> 00:20:21,523
Damn, look at the dust…

269
00:20:33,785 --> 00:20:34,995
Holy shit!

270
00:20:37,455 --> 00:20:40,059
This room's rent is $2,000 a month.

271
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:43,187
What? This crappy room is
more expensive than Seoul?

272
00:20:43,253 --> 00:20:45,255
Miss, come over here.

273
00:20:47,716 --> 00:20:50,486
That mainlander looks
like he'll run off soon.

274
00:20:50,552 --> 00:20:53,072
Ma'am! What's wrong with how I look?!

275
00:20:53,138 --> 00:20:56,433
<i>Friendly Realtor</i>

276
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,352

277
00:20:59,728 --> 00:21:02,939
Then why do you
have these listings up?!

278
00:21:11,239 --> 00:21:12,782
Det. Lee.

279
00:21:13,241 --> 00:21:15,636
Why did you call me, I'm really busy.

280
00:21:15,702 --> 00:21:18,514
Bullshit, there are only
petty criminals here.

281
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:22,042
I'm still busy, what do you want?

282
00:21:22,334 --> 00:21:26,397
I'm trying to rent a room, but they say

283
00:21:26,463 --> 00:21:29,440
things only get done when
I know someone in Jeju.

284
00:21:29,507 --> 00:21:33,553
What was that phrase, some connection.

285
00:21:34,012 --> 00:21:35,638
- Kinship connection.
- Say what?

286
00:21:36,097 --> 00:21:40,494
Connection by means
of relatives or kinship!

287
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:44,707
Why can't I even get a room
without knowing someone here?

288
00:21:44,773 --> 00:21:46,315
That makes sense?

289
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,419
Give me a second.

290
00:21:48,485 --> 00:21:51,696
I don't like a damn thing
on this stupid island.

291
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:04,417
Aren't ya the Seogwipo cop

292
00:22:04,709 --> 00:22:05,811
Am I right?

293
00:22:05,877 --> 00:22:08,463
Yes, ya got good memory.

296
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,469

298
00:22:25,814 --> 00:22:28,733
You can't run your business like this.

299
00:22:29,025 --> 00:22:32,379
Why is mine beef-less beef noodles?

300
00:22:32,445 --> 00:22:33,571
I'm the one paying.

I'm the owner, eat what ya given.

302
00:22:38,284 --> 00:22:40,662
Does he think he's Gordon Ramsay?

303
00:22:41,204 --> 00:22:45,125
No need to get angry,
you can have some of mine.

304
00:22:47,335 --> 00:22:48,336
Hi!

305
00:22:48,586 --> 00:22:49,838

- It's this house!
- This is it!

307
00:22:56,844 --> 00:22:59,740
There's a small room here,

308
00:22:59,806 --> 00:23:02,267
the owner wants to rent it out.

309
00:23:05,812 --> 00:23:07,748
This must be it.

310
00:23:07,814 --> 00:23:08,748
Isn't it nice?

311
00:23:08,815 --> 00:23:10,024
It's so nice!

312
00:23:10,233 --> 00:23:12,944
I can't live with other people.

313
00:23:13,402 --> 00:23:14,988
I can't live with ya either!

314
00:23:16,865 --> 00:23:19,284
Who gave ya permission
to show the house?

315
00:23:20,075 --> 00:23:23,180
- Get outta here!
- Wait, sir!

316
00:23:23,246 --> 00:23:26,517
I already talked to the home owner.

317
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:29,186
Wait, he's not the owner?

318
00:23:29,252 --> 00:23:31,045
No, he's not.

319
00:23:31,504 --> 00:23:33,298
Who are you, sir?

320
00:23:34,757 --> 00:23:39,429
I manage this estate
with utmost responsibility.

321
00:23:39,888 --> 00:23:41,806
I'm the home owner.

322
00:23:44,601 --> 00:23:46,352

326

The rent amount is
here, and the rental terms,

327
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,179
so, please take a look carefully.

328

Piss. Off.

330
00:24:16,883 --> 00:24:18,718
Who is that old man?

331
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,142
He must've woken up on
the wrong side of the bed.

332
00:24:26,726 --> 00:24:30,164
He must be worried
because he's an outsider,

333
00:24:30,229 --> 00:24:34,150
but you won't find a renter more
reliable and trustworthy than him.

334
00:24:34,692 --> 00:24:35,692
Is that so?

335
00:24:36,027 --> 00:24:38,112
We're cops.

336
00:24:40,573 --> 00:24:42,342
I dun care if he's a cop,

337
00:24:42,408 --> 00:24:45,453
bringing in outsiders
will bring down the house!

338
00:24:45,995 --> 00:24:46,995
No way!

00:24:52,252 --> 00:24:53,252

340
00:24:53,628 --> 00:24:57,298

It was a daughter last time.

Did you make sure to keep
it quiet from the arcade?

388
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:49,381
Send him to the hospital

How do you speak Korean
better than Koreans?

397
00:29:56,472 --> 00:29:58,474
My father was a Korean.

398
00:30:00,768 --> 00:30:02,019
No wonder.

399
00:30:02,436 --> 00:30:05,773
Korean blood flows inside you.

400
00:30:07,024 --> 00:30:10,653
He abandoned me and
my mother when I was five.

401

403
00:30:22,832 --> 00:30:26,002
Being here in Jeju like this,

Chairman!

435
00:34:25,782 --> 00:34:29,179
I was working on the arcade,

436
00:34:29,245 --> 00:34:32,498
how could you resort
to violence like this?

437
00:34:33,499 --> 00:34:36,669

439
00:34:42,383 --> 00:34:46,470
You should've done the work
that you were paid to do.

440
00:34:47,304 --> 00:34:51,517
I don't think you understand,

441

much longer will ya sleep?

Why are you here so early?

455
00:36:22,691 --> 00:36:28,405
We'll do full house
cleanin' on weekends.

456
00:36:28,989 --> 00:36:30,366
I'm fine.

457
00:36:30,532 --> 00:36:32,409
Git the hell up!

458
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,579
I'm allergic to cleaning.

Good morning, Chairwoman.

465
00:37:14,576 --> 00:37:17,512
How are you holding up with Man-bok?

466
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:20,958
You know, we get along okay.

467
00:37:24,253 --> 00:37:26,481
Could I ask you something?

468
00:37:26,547 --> 00:37:27,565
Sure.

469
00:37:27,631 --> 00:37:30,509
Is there anywhere nearby
that is quiet and scenic?

470
00:37:31,468 --> 00:37:33,262
Why somewhere quiet?

471
00:37:33,512 --> 00:37:38,267
I have a small disorder, and
meditation is good for it.

472
00:37:38,892 --> 00:37:42,187
As you know, I can't do that
with Mr. Man-bok around.

473
00:37:43,188 --> 00:37:44,499
I see.

474
00:37:44,565 --> 00:37:48,235
There's a spot that only I know about.

475
00:37:50,154 --> 00:37:51,864
Thank you so much.

476
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:00,581
How are you liking Jeju so far?

477
00:38:00,998 --> 00:38:05,294
Windy, temperamental
weather, very high prices,

478
00:38:05,711 --> 00:38:12,509
and I didn't know when I was visiting,
but people here feel defensive.

479
00:38:13,177 --> 00:38:15,346
It's like they're keeping
distance from mainland folks.

480
00:38:16,387 --> 00:38:20,184
People here have had
many wounds for a long time.

481
00:38:21,393 --> 00:38:27,483
It's just like that at first,
but after a while, you'll see.

482
00:38:28,483 --> 00:38:33,530
Jeju's people are more
exquisite than its scenery.

483
00:38:34,531 --> 00:38:37,368
I won't stay here long
enough to feel that.

484
00:38:38,327 --> 00:38:41,306
Your memories of Jeju
must be quite sour.

485
00:38:41,372 --> 00:38:42,557
Indeed,

486
00:38:42,623 --> 00:38:44,791
I even met a cranky neighbor.

487
00:38:46,168 --> 00:38:49,981
He's a good person when
ya get to know him.

488
00:38:50,047 --> 00:38:51,715
Just like this island.

489
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,218
We'll see…

490
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:42,516
This is stunning, ma'am.

491
00:39:43,308 --> 00:39:45,686
My father raised horses here.

492
00:39:46,103 --> 00:39:48,355
This land is left undisturbed nowadays.

493
00:39:48,646 --> 00:39:49,999
How come?

494
00:39:50,065 --> 00:39:53,610
I heard the land value went up
thanks to the Chinese buyers.

495
00:39:54,111 --> 00:39:57,298
You could make a ton
of money if you sell this.

496
00:39:57,364 --> 00:40:03,120
It feels like Jeju is losing its
original self as foreigners buy it up.

497
00:40:04,454 --> 00:40:07,749
It's so beautiful when
left alone like this.

498
00:40:10,544 --> 00:40:13,297
I would never sell even
if I'm offered millions.

499
00:40:24,016 --> 00:40:28,687
This was a barn, but I put in WiFi.

500
00:40:31,356 --> 00:40:34,193
Come and use this space
whenever you want.

501
00:40:35,152 --> 00:40:38,614

00:40:40,365 --> 00:40:41,592
Nice chair.

503
00:40:41,657 --> 00:40:45,662
I'm still renovating it, but that's
a good spot for flix and chill.

504
00:40:46,038 --> 00:40:48,499
You know about that, huh?

505
00:40:48,957 --> 00:40:51,376

519
00:41:25,827 --> 00:41:28,764
If he's back here despite being wanted,

520
00:41:28,829 --> 00:41:30,974
there's gotta be a reason.

521
00:41:31,041 --> 00:41:31,727
Right.

522
00:41:31,793 --> 00:41:37,172
If he's back, it could only mean
he's planning a job here.

523
00:41:37,339 --> 00:41:39,716
It's our job to find that out.

524

Where did Mr. Lee go?

525
00:41:48,016 --> 00:41:52,187
According to Mr. Choi, he got
paid and left for the mainland.

526
00:41:53,105 --> 00:41:54,749
There's no way he'd do that.

00:42:33,103 --> 00:42:36,374
Check all security cams between
the hours it was stolen,

538
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,640
and send the car to forensics.

539
00:42:37,691 --> 00:42:39,627
I'll look into smugglers.

540
00:42:39,693 --> 00:42:41,045
Let's move!

541
00:42:41,111 --> 00:42:42,111
Yes, sir!

542
00:42:46,325 --> 00:42:49,828
They're like a well-oiled
machine while I sit back.

543
00:42:50,871 --> 00:42:53,999
Shit, I took a shit!

544
00:42:55,334 --> 00:42:57,336
I'll take this first.

545
00:42:57,836 --> 00:43:01,423
Oh dear, I feel so bad,
I'm sorry about that!

546
00:43:01,798 --> 00:43:05,152
I'll take a card each, and call stop.

547
00:43:05,218 --> 00:43:07,471
Let's all tally our points.

548
00:43:09,056 --> 00:43:11,808
Hey! Don't move!

549
00:43:12,851 --> 00:43:16,664
Isn't there a smuggler
called 'Octopus' among you?

550
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:17,856
Which one is it?

551
00:43:18,815 --> 00:43:21,818
Fess up before I cook you alive!

552
00:43:22,569 --> 00:43:23,862
Sons of bitches.

553
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:28,116
<i>Chairwoman Yoo</i>

554
00:43:28,909 --> 00:43:29,636
Yes, ma'am.

555
00:43:29,702 --> 00:43:32,287
I'm a little busy at the moment.

556
00:43:32,829 --> 00:43:33,914
Hey!

557
00:43:36,791 --> 00:43:38,168
Move out of the way!

558
00:43:48,428 --> 00:43:49,363
Don't come after me!

559
00:43:49,429 --> 00:43:51,098
Don't run then, asshole!

560
00:43:55,268 --> 00:43:57,062
I thought he threw a rock!

561
00:43:57,521 --> 00:44:00,190
Ma'am, move! You'll get hurt!

562
00:44:09,741 --> 00:44:11,302
Thought you could get away from me?

563
00:44:11,368 --> 00:44:13,286
What are you doing?

564
00:44:13,954 --> 00:44:15,640
There's a security cam here!

565
00:44:15,706 --> 00:44:17,391
Wanna get disciplined again?

566
00:44:17,457 --> 00:44:18,310
Let him go!

567
00:44:18,376 --> 00:44:19,835
Thank you so much.

568
00:44:22,796 --> 00:44:25,650
If you're gonna beat him up, I
know a blind spot over there.

569
00:44:25,716 --> 00:44:28,635
What are you talking
about? Let's not go over there!

570
00:44:31,887 --> 00:44:34,032
What do we do now?

571
00:44:34,099 --> 00:44:37,561
Had we known this'd happen,
I shoulda sold it early.

572
00:44:38,311 --> 00:44:40,856
If the shop value tanks,

573
00:44:42,065 --> 00:44:44,377
we could get kicked
out without any money.

574
00:44:44,443 --> 00:44:47,320
Just holdin' out won't
make this go away.

575
00:44:47,529 --> 00:44:51,450
Maybe it's better to get some
money like Mr. Choi said.

576
00:44:52,032 --> 00:44:54,286
That's all ya got?

577
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:57,079
Then just give up here.

578
00:44:57,956 --> 00:45:02,228
By the way, ya's not a shopkeeper here,

579
00:45:02,294 --> 00:45:04,755
why are ya so into it?

580
00:45:07,174 --> 00:45:11,052
Didn't ya late wife run a
hangover soup shop years ago?

581
00:45:11,261 --> 00:45:13,781
Ya mean Mrs. Woo?

582
00:45:13,847 --> 00:45:16,599
Didn't she pass away
suddenly because of an illness?

583
00:45:16,892 --> 00:45:19,662
I heard she divorced her husband.

584
00:45:19,728 --> 00:45:23,940
He was supposedly an asshole
who gambled night and day…

585
00:45:24,566 --> 00:45:26,276
That's what I heard…

586
00:45:28,987 --> 00:45:33,407
She loved this place.

587
00:45:34,284 --> 00:45:36,953
I know it's pointless to regret now,

588
00:45:38,413 --> 00:45:42,709
and I was a terrible man all ma life.

589
00:45:43,293 --> 00:45:45,712
So, even if I didn't protect her,

590
00:45:46,421 --> 00:45:49,633
perhaps I can cleanse my
sins by protectin' this place.

591
00:45:50,842 --> 00:45:55,680
I'm sorry that a geezer is
meddling with ya affairs.

592
00:45:56,056 --> 00:45:59,017
Don't say that, ya
helping like it's ya affair.

593
00:45:59,267 --> 00:46:03,079
She's right, I shouldn't
have said what I said.

594
00:46:03,146 --> 00:46:05,941
I take back what I said about ya.

595
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:11,988
If I can help even, I'll
do whatever it takes.

596
00:46:12,739 --> 00:46:13,739
Very well.

597
00:46:14,366 --> 00:46:16,201
Everyone okay with that?

598
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:20,306
Let's not stand back and watch,

599
00:46:20,372 --> 00:46:22,974
we should go on the offensive.

600
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:24,041
Yeah.

601
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:27,963
<i>Please Save Our Arcade</i>

602
00:46:33,134 --> 00:46:34,886
Please take a look at this.

603
00:46:38,723 --> 00:46:39,723
Thank ya.

604
00:46:45,814 --> 00:46:47,816
His face changes every day.

605
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:51,587
It's not just a disguise,
he's someone else entirely.

606
00:46:51,653 --> 00:46:54,465
A diver one day, a jeweler the next…

607
00:46:54,531 --> 00:46:57,576
Oh! He even disguised as an old man.

608
00:46:58,118 --> 00:46:59,703
Are you gonna kiss me?

609
00:47:00,328 --> 00:47:02,998
I can hear you fine,
sit back down, asshole.

610
00:47:06,626 --> 00:47:10,547
So, what's his latest disguise?

611
00:47:15,594 --> 00:47:16,737
He's using

612
00:47:16,803 --> 00:47:20,532
the alias 'Raymond Kim,' a
Singapore-born diamond dealer,

613
00:47:20,599 --> 00:47:24,227
<i>and I smuggled him
into Jeju a year ago.</i>

614
00:47:25,437 --> 00:47:28,707
<i>What? Kim arrived here a year ago?</i>

615
00:47:28,773 --> 00:47:30,751
<i>Yes, he's been in hiding,</i>

616
00:47:30,817 --> 00:47:33,695
<i>but re-emerged recently.</i>

617
00:47:42,954 --> 00:47:44,974
He didn't say why he came here?

618
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,333
No.

619
00:47:47,041 --> 00:47:49,645
<i>As you know, he's a
very secretive person…</i>

620
00:47:49,711 --> 00:47:54,817
<i>Oh, he came by a few months ago,
and requested an old man's mask.</i>

621
00:47:54,883 --> 00:47:57,677
<i>He said he needed it for a large job.</i>

622
00:47:59,137 --> 00:48:02,098
<i>An old man? What did it look like?</i>

623
00:48:02,682 --> 00:48:05,101
<i>Well, it's a punchable face.</i>

624
00:48:05,894 --> 00:48:07,395
<i>Punchable…</i>

625
00:48:27,666 --> 00:48:29,668
The clinic is beautiful
just like its owner.

626
00:48:31,211 --> 00:48:34,881
Sure is, just on the surface.

627
00:48:36,132 --> 00:48:38,819
Who could be causing you harm?

628
00:48:38,885 --> 00:48:41,179
I could fix that for you.

629
00:48:42,847 --> 00:48:44,366
Are you capable of that?

630
00:48:44,432 --> 00:48:46,142
Even if you're loaded.

631
00:49:00,782 --> 00:49:04,911
Gold Medi Valley, I'm
interested in it too.

632
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:11,251
I got a big headache because of that.

633
00:49:16,965 --> 00:49:18,800
Don't let it bother you.

634
00:49:19,259 --> 00:49:24,222
I could replace Zhu Lin-fang
as the new financier.

635
00:49:24,472 --> 00:49:25,724
Really?

636
00:49:26,599 --> 00:49:31,396
I can make this full island be yours.

637
00:49:32,896 --> 00:49:35,233
You sure know how to flirt with women.

638
00:49:59,174 --> 00:50:00,759
Wait, wait!

639
00:50:02,469 --> 00:50:05,447
But even if I wanted to
become the new financier,

640
00:50:05,512 --> 00:50:07,407
it'll be impossible with Zhu...

641
00:50:07,474 --> 00:50:09,702
Don't worry, I can get rid of him.

642
00:50:09,768 --> 00:50:11,061
How exactly?!

643
00:50:11,895 --> 00:50:15,040
I've stashed away his
weakness in my hiding spot.

644
00:50:15,106 --> 00:50:16,106
His weakness?!

645
00:50:23,031 --> 00:50:25,950
Yes, Mrs. Yoo, I'm back home.

646
00:50:26,493 --> 00:50:27,493
Right now?

647
00:50:29,746 --> 00:50:31,181
Yes, certainly.

648
00:50:31,247 --> 00:50:33,041
I'll get ready for the rally.

649
00:50:34,291 --> 00:50:38,296
If it's for Uni Arcade,
I'll give it all.

650
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:40,924
I'll be right there.

651
00:50:43,468 --> 00:50:46,947
I'll get a change of
undies, so, get a shut-eye.

652
00:50:47,012 --> 00:50:48,014
Okay.

653
00:50:48,348 --> 00:50:51,410
Why is she calling me at this hour…

654
00:50:51,476 --> 00:50:54,229
I'm gonna use the hot
shower while he's gone!

655
00:50:56,606 --> 00:50:58,233
So nice!

656
00:51:01,486 --> 00:51:03,070
No more undies?

657
00:51:16,209 --> 00:51:20,171
What? The geezer wears Calvin Klein?

658
00:51:22,924 --> 00:51:26,761
I feel so reassured to
have Man-bok with us.

659
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:31,182
The media will come
to our rally tomorrow.

660
00:51:31,724 --> 00:51:35,562
We'll be on the news
and on the internet too.

661
00:51:36,479 --> 00:51:40,817
The more we stand up, the less
Chinese guys mess with us.

662
00:51:41,568 --> 00:51:45,488
He really is a clever man.

663
00:51:46,823 --> 00:51:49,367
Anyway, hurry up and come over.

664
00:52:12,557 --> 00:52:14,224
Shit, it's not dry.

665
00:52:17,979 --> 00:52:19,164
Yeah, I'm heading back.

666
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:20,624
<i>We got Kim on a security cam.</i>

667
00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:21,376
<i>What?</i>

668
00:52:21,442 --> 00:52:22,960
<i>I'll send you a capture.</i>

669
00:52:23,026 --> 00:52:24,152
Copy that.

670
00:52:28,489 --> 00:52:30,282
So, this is Raymond Kim?

671
00:52:33,203 --> 00:52:34,204
Eh?

672
00:52:35,622 --> 00:52:37,665
Why are the lights off?

673
00:52:38,625 --> 00:52:40,960
Did she call me and go to bed?

674
00:52:45,798 --> 00:52:48,050
Mrs. Yoo, are you asleep?

675
00:52:51,095 --> 00:52:52,095
Chairwoman!

676
00:53:36,391 --> 00:53:37,767
You son of a bitch!

677
00:54:58,473 --> 00:54:59,932
Chairwoman!

678
00:55:00,308 --> 00:55:01,434
Chairwoman!

679
00:55:01,768 --> 00:55:03,853
Chairwoman! No!

680
00:55:06,439 --> 00:55:11,211
Grandma, please stay awake!

681
00:55:11,277 --> 00:55:14,822
Grandma, In-hae's back.

682
00:55:17,325 --> 00:55:18,802
In-hae, is that you?

683
00:55:18,868 --> 00:55:22,454
Yes, it's me. I'm right here.

684
00:55:24,332 --> 00:55:26,709
How did you…

685
00:55:27,543 --> 00:55:30,046
I came to see you.

686
00:55:36,052 --> 00:55:40,181
I'm so thankful that I got
to see you before dying…

687
00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:42,517
I missed you so much…

688
00:55:46,145 --> 00:55:52,402
I have to prepare your birthday meal…

689
00:55:54,028 --> 00:55:56,423
Grandma, please don't die on me!

690
00:55:56,489 --> 00:55:58,199
Grandma! Grandma!

691
00:56:03,079 --> 00:56:04,079
Oh my god…

692
00:56:04,497 --> 00:56:08,000
No, I didn't do this.

693
00:56:08,709 --> 00:56:09,752
9…

694
00:56:10,628 --> 00:56:11,896
911…

695
00:56:11,963 --> 00:56:13,714
I didn't…

696
00:56:15,842 --> 00:56:19,195
Hello? Help!

697
00:56:19,262 --> 00:56:21,055

Welcome!

702
00:56:55,631 --> 00:56:57,008
Hi!

703
00:57:02,597 --> 00:57:05,183
Aren't there 3 birthdays this month?

704
00:57:06,017 --> 00:57:06,702
Yes.

705
00:57:06,768 --> 00:57:11,439
But one of them didn't
want to have a party.

706
00:57:26,704 --> 00:57:28,206
In-hae, can I sit here?

707
00:57:29,207 --> 00:57:30,208
Sure.

708
00:57:34,795 --> 00:57:36,481
Don't you want a birthday party?

709
00:57:36,547 --> 00:57:38,925
It's not even my real birthday.

710
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:43,387
Today is just the day I
arrived at the orphanage.

711
00:57:44,931 --> 00:57:47,850
I don't think it's a bad thing.

712
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:52,104
People here became your family.

713
00:57:52,730 --> 00:58:00,279
And it's another special day
to celebrate with a new family.

714
00:58:03,658 --> 00:58:05,952
Wanna make a promise?

715
00:58:06,827 --> 00:58:10,456
Come to my arcade this time every year.

716
00:58:10,998 --> 00:58:15,253
And I'll fix you a real birthday meal.

717
00:58:16,837 --> 00:58:17,856
Really?

718
00:58:17,922 --> 00:58:19,131
Sure!

719
00:58:19,423 --> 00:58:21,026
Come see me.

720
00:58:21,092 --> 00:58:23,487
Mrs. Yoo at Uni Arcade, okay?

721
00:58:23,553 --> 00:58:24,637
Okay.

722
00:59:00,798 --> 00:59:01,691
One moment.

723
00:59:01,757 --> 00:59:02,610
Chairwoman Yoo!

724
00:59:02,676 --> 00:59:03,801
Let us through.

725
00:59:10,141 --> 00:59:11,141
What happened?

726
00:59:12,143 --> 00:59:14,770
According to the witness, the
perp was a man in his 40s.

727
00:59:16,188 --> 00:59:19,358
He already wrote her
a will on this phone,

728
00:59:20,318 --> 00:59:24,196
so it was likely an attempted murder.

729
00:59:42,006 --> 00:59:43,215
What's this?

730
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:50,890
Goddammit!

731
01:00:37,019 --> 01:00:39,438
How could you resort to killing?!

732
01:00:40,147 --> 01:00:41,291
This is Korea.

733
01:00:41,357 --> 01:00:44,151
Even you can't do whatever you want!

734
01:00:56,247 --> 01:00:59,583
Why are Koreans so loud?

735
01:01:03,379 --> 01:01:05,840
You can't cause problems like this.

736
01:01:06,048 --> 01:01:08,092
How will you clean up this mess?

737
01:01:12,012 --> 01:01:13,264
Clean up?

738
01:01:14,306 --> 01:01:16,308
That's your job.

739
01:01:16,976 --> 01:01:20,396
I put you in that seat for this reason.

740
01:01:22,565 --> 01:01:25,568
Are you saying you'll
put everything on me?

741
01:01:25,943 --> 01:01:31,699
Take care of it before
it becomes a mess.

742
01:01:36,245 --> 01:01:39,391
Excuse me, have you seen this man?

743
01:01:39,457 --> 01:01:41,250
He's about 184 cm…

744
01:01:41,917 --> 01:01:43,586
Have you seen this guy?

745
01:01:44,253 --> 01:01:45,253
No, I haven't.

746
01:01:47,214 --> 01:01:48,758
Good day, sir.

747
01:01:49,592 --> 01:01:52,178
Have you seen him?

748
01:01:52,470 --> 01:01:53,679
Never.

749
01:01:54,555 --> 01:01:55,931
- You haven't?
- Nope.

750
01:02:08,152 --> 01:02:10,672
No evidence? Any witnesses?

751
01:02:10,738 --> 01:02:12,740
No, there's nothing.

752
01:02:13,449 --> 01:02:15,218
These are Kim In-hae's belongings,

753
01:02:15,284 --> 01:02:18,179
let's dig into them together,
we might find something.

754
01:02:18,245 --> 01:02:21,141
<i>Next is the news about the
robbery incident in Jongdali.</i>

755
01:02:21,207 --> 01:02:25,645
<i>The victim, identified as
Yoo, is currently unconscious.</i>

756
01:02:25,711 --> 01:02:26,730
<i>According to an eyewitness…</i>

757
01:02:26,754 --> 01:02:30,150
Chairwoman Yoo visited
us at the orphanage

758
01:02:30,216 --> 01:02:34,136
every month to take care of us.

759
01:02:36,347 --> 01:02:38,700
Please arrest whoever did this,

760
01:02:38,766 --> 01:02:40,785
I'm beggin' ya, detectives.

761
01:02:40,851 --> 01:02:43,771
Yes, we'll get him.

762
01:02:44,104 --> 01:02:45,773
Don't worry too much.

763
01:02:47,024 --> 01:02:48,192
Thank you.

764
01:02:50,486 --> 01:02:51,737
Thank you.

765
01:02:55,241 --> 01:02:56,242
Nothing.

766
01:02:57,827 --> 01:02:58,911
Nothing.

767
01:03:03,207 --> 01:03:05,417
Shit, there's nothing.

768
01:03:06,752 --> 01:03:07,854
Did you find anything?

769
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,981
There's not a damn thing!

770
01:03:10,047 --> 01:03:11,316
Wait! Wait!

771
01:03:11,382 --> 01:03:12,817
That's evidence!

772
01:03:12,883 --> 01:03:14,110
Don't destroy it!

773
01:03:14,176 --> 01:03:15,612
Right, this is evidence.

774
01:03:15,678 --> 01:03:17,304
You startled me…

775
01:03:19,765 --> 01:03:22,035
Why do you have so much pent-up anger?

776
01:03:22,101 --> 01:03:24,829
Do I need a reason to be angry?!

777
01:03:24,895 --> 01:03:26,581
I get angry because I get angry!

778
01:03:26,647 --> 01:03:28,875
Everyone in the world gets angry,

779
01:03:28,941 --> 01:03:31,694
but why can't you hold it in?

780
01:03:49,461 --> 01:03:52,631
I arrested a drug
addict a long time ago.

781
01:03:54,758 --> 01:03:58,929
But his father was a high-ranking official,
so he got off with special treatment.

782
01:04:01,181 --> 01:04:04,852
But as soon as he was
released, he got high again,

783
01:04:07,396 --> 01:04:10,441
and drove over and killed
a family out on a walk.

784
01:04:17,698 --> 01:04:20,242
The kid was only five.

785
01:04:22,328 --> 01:04:25,247
And even then, he got
off with a probation.

786
01:04:25,915 --> 01:04:31,211
Since then, whenever I see criminals,
I just can't contain my anger!

787
01:04:37,927 --> 01:04:41,013
It's killing me that
I can't control it.

788
01:04:44,099 --> 01:04:49,271
I think I understand
why you're like that.

789
01:04:57,196 --> 01:05:00,550
Do you think the reason
why Kim came here

790
01:05:00,616 --> 01:05:03,011
is related to Chairwoman Yoo?

791
01:05:03,077 --> 01:05:05,054
Who knows what he's scheming.

792
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:07,581
She could have been his scam target.

793
01:05:10,501 --> 01:05:14,188
How do we find him on this big island?

794
01:05:14,254 --> 01:05:17,216
It's a needle in a haystack.

795
01:05:17,716 --> 01:05:19,516
People think Jeju is small...
<i>YooDuriSpeaker</i>

796
01:05:19,577 --> 01:05:20,404
People think Jeju is small...

797
01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:21,929
Give me your key.

798
01:05:54,837 --> 01:05:56,940
Kim In-hae, you son of a bitch!

799
01:05:57,006 --> 01:05:58,549
No! No! Listen...

800
01:06:03,137 --> 01:06:04,722
You bastard!

801
01:06:05,014 --> 01:06:07,492
Is it fun playing around with people?!

802
01:06:07,558 --> 01:06:08,559
Let go of me!

803
01:06:14,732 --> 01:06:19,278
My respect for the elderly held
me back from beating you!

804
01:06:19,778 --> 01:06:22,382
But you stabbed a person?!

805
01:06:22,448 --> 01:06:23,633
An elderly lady at that?!

806
01:06:23,699 --> 01:06:26,118
It wasn't me, asshole!

807
01:06:27,536 --> 01:06:29,830
Don't give me that shit!

808
01:06:53,812 --> 01:06:56,356
Asshole, you woke up?

809
01:06:57,357 --> 01:07:00,986
Start briefing me on
what exactly went down

810
01:07:02,279 --> 01:07:04,239
here on Jeju Island.

811
01:07:08,243 --> 01:07:09,828
So, you understand?

812
01:07:12,206 --> 01:07:14,333
That stings, you bastard!

813
01:07:15,667 --> 01:07:17,645
Untie me at once!

814
01:07:17,711 --> 01:07:20,422
You still can't read the room,

815
01:07:21,048 --> 01:07:22,859
how dare you scream at me?

816
01:07:22,925 --> 01:07:24,736
- Come here.
- No, don't come!

817
01:07:24,802 --> 01:07:27,012
- Hold still!
- Wait! Hold on!

818
01:07:27,763 --> 01:07:30,516
All right, one, two, three!

819
01:07:31,308 --> 01:07:33,477
That stings!

820
01:07:34,103 --> 01:07:36,122
Son of a bitch!

821
01:07:36,188 --> 01:07:39,233
Are you motivated to talk to me?

822
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:43,987
Or we can do this all night.

823
01:07:44,238 --> 01:07:46,740
Stop! I'll talk!

824
01:07:48,784 --> 01:07:50,494
It all started…

825
01:07:52,913 --> 01:07:57,167
with Omerta Clinic's
owner, Dr. Yang Se-ra,

826
01:07:58,961 --> 01:08:02,047
when she moved to China.

827
01:08:03,298 --> 01:08:04,353
I'll take a glass.

828
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:06,777
<i>2 years ago, China</i>

829
01:08:06,844 --> 01:08:14,143
Even the same propofol
feels different when she does it.

830
01:08:14,601 --> 01:08:16,287
It feels like I'm reborn.

831
01:08:16,353 --> 01:08:18,372
Watch what you say.

832
01:08:18,438 --> 01:08:20,917
Doing drugs can get you
the death penalty here.

833
01:08:20,983 --> 01:08:23,461
It's not drugs, it's medicine.

834
01:08:23,527 --> 01:08:25,546
She's a doctor from Korea.

835
01:08:25,612 --> 01:08:30,593
<i>Dr. Yang used propofol and other
narcotic painkillers on her VIP clients,</i>

836
01:08:30,659 --> 01:08:33,679
<i>but fled to China after her
medical license was revoked.</i>

837
01:08:33,745 --> 01:08:36,415
<i>That's where she hooked
up with Zhu Lin-fang.</i>

838
01:08:38,250 --> 01:08:42,688
<i>Black Society is the name of
the most vicious Triad group.</i>

839
01:08:42,754 --> 01:08:46,216
<i>And Zhu is the head of Black Society.</i>

840
01:08:48,510 --> 01:08:51,489
<i>He made bank in Hong Kong
and Taiwan with drugs,</i>

841
01:08:51,555 --> 01:08:54,641
<i>and he turned to Jeju as
a new market opportunity.</i>

842
01:08:55,225 --> 01:08:57,120
<i>He sent Dr. Yang to Jeju</i>

843
01:08:57,186 --> 01:09:00,647
<i>as a ruse to build a medical complex,
which will be used as a drug hub.</i>

844
01:09:01,397 --> 01:09:06,862
<i>He can break ground but Uni Arcade
is in the middle of the proposed land.</i>

845
01:09:07,654 --> 01:09:10,258
<i>He bought off shops to tank the arcade,</i>

846
01:09:10,324 --> 01:09:13,177
<i>and turned shopkeepers
against one another,</i>

847
01:09:13,243 --> 01:09:15,388
<i>but the locals held their ground.</i>

848
01:09:15,454 --> 01:09:18,415
<i>It's all thanks to
Chairwoman grounding them.</i>

849
01:09:18,790 --> 01:09:22,812
<i>So, she was a thorn in Zhu's side.</i>

850
01:09:22,878 --> 01:09:26,339
<i>That's why he went after her.</i>

851
01:09:27,966 --> 01:09:30,761
Think carefully.

852
01:09:31,386 --> 01:09:34,306
Who'd benefit the most if she died?

853
01:09:35,432 --> 01:09:39,120
Obviously, it's going to be Zhu.

854
01:09:39,186 --> 01:09:42,689
You sure got a golden
tongue like a pro con man.

855
01:09:43,732 --> 01:09:46,526
You forgot the most important thing.

856
01:09:46,860 --> 01:09:47,986
You.

857
01:09:48,820 --> 01:09:52,491
There's gotta be a reason
why a scammer got involved.

858
01:09:52,866 --> 01:09:56,429
So many cops are after you,
which means you got a tasty job

859
01:09:56,495 --> 01:09:59,098
on your sights to crawl back here!

860
01:09:59,164 --> 01:10:01,183
Tasting stuff isn't what I do.

861
01:10:01,250 --> 01:10:02,542
What did you say?

862
01:10:03,543 --> 01:10:05,313
When I went to China,

863
01:10:05,379 --> 01:10:07,839
I approached Zhu to pull a job on him.

864
01:10:10,299 --> 01:10:14,805
<i>And he told me he was
buying up lands in Jeju,</i>

865
01:10:16,348 --> 01:10:20,269
<i>and that Uni Arcade was
part of the takeover.</i>

866
01:10:21,103 --> 01:10:24,373
Knowing this, I couldn't hold back.

867
01:10:24,439 --> 01:10:25,439
Because…

868
01:10:25,482 --> 01:10:29,194
I owe Chairwoman since
my orphanage days.

869
01:10:30,279 --> 01:10:35,659
She poured her life into that arcade,
and Zhu was about to bulldoze it,

870
01:10:36,159 --> 01:10:37,703
how could I not do anything?

871
01:10:38,704 --> 01:10:41,330
<i>But since I had to hide my identity,</i>

872
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:46,753
<i>I borrowed Man-bok's
identity and disguised as him.</i>

873
01:10:47,671 --> 01:10:51,067
<i>I stayed by Chairwoman for many months,</i>

874
01:10:51,133 --> 01:10:54,720
<i>protecting her from any
potential harm by Zhu.</i>

875
01:10:55,971 --> 01:10:58,491
You actually expect me
to believe that bullshit?

876
01:10:58,557 --> 01:11:01,744
I don't care if you
believe me, it's the truth!

877
01:11:01,810 --> 01:11:03,395
That's a load of crap!

878
01:11:06,481 --> 01:11:08,025
You don't have to believe me,

879
01:11:09,109 --> 01:11:10,902
just don't get in the way.

880
01:11:17,534 --> 01:11:18,618
You son of...

881
01:11:24,082 --> 01:11:26,727
You gents tossed me
and sucked up to Zhu,

882
01:11:26,793 --> 01:11:28,837
so why are you back here?

883
01:11:29,254 --> 01:11:30,731
It's pathetic.

884
01:11:30,797 --> 01:11:35,010
Zhu is a total lunatic,
just like you said.

885
01:11:35,510 --> 01:11:36,821
He's uncontrollable.

886
01:11:36,887 --> 01:11:40,140
Dr. Yang, do you have a plan?

887
01:11:40,473 --> 01:11:42,558
What could there be?

888
01:11:43,310 --> 01:11:46,605
He needs to be cut off
from Gold Medi Valley.

889
01:11:47,647 --> 01:11:51,294
I got some footage that
could get him deported.

890
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:53,487
What kind of footage?

891
01:11:54,446 --> 01:11:58,616
Videos of him administering drugs.

892
01:11:59,451 --> 01:12:02,621
Dr. Yang, you sure
are good at this job!

893
01:12:04,915 --> 01:12:06,290
But I have a condition.

894
01:12:07,751 --> 01:12:12,714
Hand over all your
shares of Gold Medi Valley.

895
01:12:26,436 --> 01:12:29,731
What's going on? What did you do?!

896
01:12:30,190 --> 01:12:34,337
I've been doing this for years.
Uncuffing is no work at all.

897
01:12:34,403 --> 01:12:37,781
Free me at once! Uncuff me, asshole!

898
01:12:38,156 --> 01:12:39,658
Free me!

899
01:12:40,575 --> 01:12:41,575
Jeez.

900
01:12:43,453 --> 01:12:45,830
Hey, can you pull me up?

901
01:12:46,123 --> 01:12:48,625
- Pull me up!
- Just look at this idiot.

902
01:12:51,503 --> 01:12:55,649
Wait a minute, are those my undies?

903
01:12:55,714 --> 01:12:57,777
Who cares about undies!

904
01:12:57,843 --> 01:12:59,261
Pull me up.

905
01:12:59,719 --> 01:13:01,138
Come on, pull me up!

906
01:13:05,892 --> 01:13:11,290
Calm down, I called a guy
who could verify my story,

907
01:13:11,356 --> 01:13:12,691
so hear him out first.

908
01:13:12,982 --> 01:13:14,001
Who's the guy?

909
01:13:14,067 --> 01:13:17,755
Goddammit, even if Korea
is known for deliveries,

910
01:13:17,821 --> 01:13:20,073
delivering noodles is…

911
01:13:23,034 --> 01:13:24,578
It's been a while, Fatty.

912
01:13:27,497 --> 01:13:29,708
In-hae, is that you?

913
01:13:30,375 --> 01:13:32,669
Where the hell have you been?

914
01:13:33,378 --> 01:13:36,714
Chairwoman Yoo… Have
you heard about her?

915
01:13:37,048 --> 01:13:39,885
She waited so long for you.

916
01:13:40,218 --> 01:13:43,239
Sorry, I was busy taking
care of something.

917
01:13:43,305 --> 01:13:47,827
Skip the pleasantries,
and pull me up first!

918
01:13:47,893 --> 01:13:52,522
Eh? What is the detective doing here?

919
01:14:15,670 --> 01:14:17,589
The package has arrived.

920
01:14:18,714 --> 01:14:20,926
This is Chairwoman Yoo.

921
01:14:21,301 --> 01:14:23,804
This chubby kid is him.

922
01:14:24,304 --> 01:14:25,031
Yeah.

923
01:14:25,097 --> 01:14:28,016
And this handsome kid is me.

924
01:14:28,266 --> 01:14:30,286
This is you?

925
01:14:30,352 --> 01:14:32,646
It's a long story.

926
01:14:33,021 --> 01:14:36,024
Would this help?

927
01:14:39,819 --> 01:14:40,630
I'm not sure…

928
01:14:40,696 --> 01:14:42,006
Dammit!

929
01:14:42,072 --> 01:14:44,674
Detective, that's In-hae.

930
01:14:44,741 --> 01:14:46,952
You can trust him.

931
01:14:47,244 --> 01:14:49,120
How can I blindly trust your words?

932
01:14:49,371 --> 01:14:51,182
Have you been lied to all your life?!

933
01:14:51,248 --> 01:14:53,017
Why can't you trust
another man's words?!

934
01:14:53,083 --> 01:14:56,836
I trust men's words, but
not scammers like you!

935
01:14:57,420 --> 01:15:02,467
Detective, I don't know what scams
he pulled in the outside world,

936
01:15:03,093 --> 01:15:07,472
but he won't ever lie about anything
regarding Chairwoman Yoo.

937
01:15:10,725 --> 01:15:14,062
As good faith, uncuff me first.

938
01:15:14,312 --> 01:15:15,605
Then I'll trust you.

939
01:15:16,272 --> 01:15:17,440
Yeah, uncuff him.

940
01:15:37,669 --> 01:15:39,021
Shit…

941
01:15:39,087 --> 01:15:40,481
That was brutal.

942
01:15:40,547 --> 01:15:42,316
You scared me…

943
01:15:42,382 --> 01:15:47,804
Let's say you're right,
how'd you catch Zhu?

944
01:15:50,307 --> 01:15:51,408
What?!

945
01:15:51,473 --> 01:15:53,160
What are you talking about?!

946
01:15:53,226 --> 01:15:55,520
You want to trust that scammer?

947
01:15:55,895 --> 01:15:57,205
Will you be quiet?

948
01:15:57,272 --> 01:15:59,441
How can I be quiet right now?!

949
01:16:02,861 --> 01:16:04,571
Did you have a drink already?

950
01:16:04,904 --> 01:16:08,616
I can't let this slide, I have
to report it to Captain.

951
01:16:08,908 --> 01:16:10,076
Hey, Su-jin.

952
01:16:10,243 --> 01:16:11,328
Su-jin!

953
01:16:13,371 --> 01:16:14,807
- Captain!
- Su-jin!

954
01:16:14,873 --> 01:16:16,350
Hey! Are you thick?!

955
01:16:16,415 --> 01:16:19,586
Send out an APB for Kim
In-hae as a murder suspect!

956
01:16:20,420 --> 01:16:21,796
But, sir,

957
01:16:22,255 --> 01:16:25,359
if we designate him as a
suspect without all due process,

958
01:16:25,424 --> 01:16:28,470
you know it'll create confusion
during the investigation.

959
01:16:29,638 --> 01:16:33,200
Lee Taek-joong, just do
as you're told, asshole!

960
01:16:33,266 --> 01:16:35,995
It's not like you ever worked
a proper case in your life.

961
01:16:36,061 --> 01:16:39,022
Jerk off in the office
like you always did!

962
01:16:39,481 --> 01:16:44,903
Is a unit captain giving
Chief Detective a lecture?!

963
01:16:46,696 --> 01:16:50,909
If you lack hair, at
least have some tact.

964
01:16:52,327 --> 01:16:55,080
You're stepping out of the line!

965
01:16:56,289 --> 01:16:57,290
What?

966
01:17:00,335 --> 01:17:02,187
You're that moron from Seoul?

967
01:17:02,253 --> 01:17:06,049
What does it matter if I'm
from Seoul or the Moon?

968
01:17:09,761 --> 01:17:12,364
I've heard you were a nutjob,

969
01:17:12,430 --> 01:17:15,451
looks like you're more than that.

970
01:17:15,517 --> 01:17:19,145
Even if I am one, I know
what is right and wrong.

971
01:17:20,230 --> 01:17:22,833
Everyone here knows

972
01:17:22,899 --> 01:17:25,169
that Captain is right
in this situation.

973
01:17:25,235 --> 01:17:27,087
What the hell is right?

974
01:17:27,153 --> 01:17:30,214
It's certain that Kim
In-hae is the perp here.

975
01:17:30,281 --> 01:17:34,536
If I bring in evidence
that Kim is not the perp,

976
01:17:35,412 --> 01:17:36,830
what will you do then?

977
01:17:37,539 --> 01:17:41,918
If you do, I'll formally apologize
for what I said today.

978
01:17:42,544 --> 01:17:45,088
But if you do not,

979
01:17:47,424 --> 01:17:54,264
every one of your heads
will roll, got that?

980
01:17:55,390 --> 01:17:56,700
Very well.

981
01:17:56,766 --> 01:17:59,310
I'll bring you the evidence.

982
01:18:00,895 --> 01:18:03,272
Det. Lee, let's move out!

983
01:18:03,690 --> 01:18:05,209
- Me?
- Yeah, who else?

984
01:18:05,275 --> 01:18:07,795
All of a sudden? Wait!

985
01:18:07,861 --> 01:18:11,089
<i>No Trespassing</i>

986
01:18:11,156 --> 01:18:14,909
Zhu has completely
taken over Uni Arcade.

987
01:18:17,370 --> 01:18:21,624
Why don't we bring Kim in
for an official cooperation?

988
01:18:22,292 --> 01:18:25,396
Shit will hit the fan if
he comes to the station.

989
01:18:25,462 --> 01:18:26,462
Captain…

990
01:18:26,671 --> 01:18:30,008
Did ya think I didn't
know what went on here?

991
01:18:30,508 --> 01:18:34,345
They're all one or two steps
away from friends and family,

992
01:18:35,096 --> 01:18:39,726
I tried to hold it all in,
but I can't do it anymore.

993
01:18:40,769 --> 01:18:42,103
Where is Kim?

994
01:18:52,405 --> 01:18:54,406
What the hell…

995
01:18:54,656 --> 01:18:57,410
I'm the idiot for trusting him!

996
01:18:57,952 --> 01:19:00,789
He'll see us and flee
through the back door.

997
01:19:02,665 --> 01:19:04,292
I knew he'd do that…

998
01:19:09,422 --> 01:19:12,776
And devised a little plan.

999
01:19:12,842 --> 01:19:14,010
Shit…

1000
01:19:15,637 --> 01:19:19,116
I thought you were betraying
me, this is embarrassing.

1001
01:19:19,182 --> 01:19:21,493
You still don't get it.

1002
01:19:21,558 --> 01:19:24,246
You put duct tape on me and ripped...

1003
01:19:24,312 --> 01:19:26,874
- You're a swindler!
- I uncuffed you right away!

1004
01:19:26,940 --> 01:19:30,109
Enough! Stop! Be quiet!

1005
01:19:33,363 --> 01:19:36,674
Can we do this on our own?
Shouldn't we get our team?

1006
01:19:36,741 --> 01:19:39,577
Then that bastard will clue in.

1007
01:19:40,703 --> 01:19:42,705
What will you do then?

1008
01:19:43,705 --> 01:19:45,976
Su-jin, start making calls.

1009
01:19:46,042 --> 01:19:48,670
Jeju is all about kinship connection.

1010
01:19:49,337 --> 01:19:51,064
That's a good idea.

1011
01:19:51,130 --> 01:19:53,924
This plan is about going loud.

1012
01:19:56,010 --> 01:19:59,681
<i>Zhu will bribe all officials
in this part of the island.</i>

1013
01:19:59,889 --> 01:20:01,575
<i>Captain, gather evidence of that.</i>

1014
01:20:01,641 --> 01:20:02,641
<i>Okay!</i>

1015
01:20:03,268 --> 01:20:06,538
<i>Det. Lee, get some people
who'll drive Dr. Yang crazy.</i>

1016
01:20:06,604 --> 01:20:08,565
<i>Loud and obnoxious ones.</i>

1017
01:20:08,815 --> 01:20:10,482
<i>Okay, leave it up to me.</i>

1018
01:20:12,026 --> 01:20:14,505
<i>And I'll pretend to hand over
the investment capital,</i>

1019
01:20:14,571 --> 01:20:18,884
<i>and confirm where she's keeping
Zhu's incriminating videos.</i>

1020
01:20:18,950 --> 01:20:21,619
Keep it in a secret place.

1021
01:20:22,287 --> 01:20:26,624
I don't show my secret place to anyone…

1022
01:20:33,839 --> 01:20:38,219
<i>While handing it over, I'll
demand her share as well.</i>

1023
01:20:42,473 --> 01:20:46,644
Her share is in name
only, so she won't refuse.

1024
01:20:48,313 --> 01:20:52,317
But the problem is the videos
that she supposedly possesses.

1025
01:20:52,775 --> 01:20:55,194
She's unlikely to hand them over.

1026
01:20:56,279 --> 01:20:59,132
So, we have to extract them ourselves.

1027
01:20:59,198 --> 01:21:00,198
Very good.

1028
01:21:00,241 --> 01:21:03,828
We need those to lock Zhu up.

1029
01:21:04,579 --> 01:21:08,333
And void Uni Arcade's takeover.

1030
01:21:08,625 --> 01:21:12,045
That is the core of this plan.

1031
01:21:13,004 --> 01:21:15,816
<i>Codename: Plan Jeju Connect.</i>

1032
01:21:15,882 --> 01:21:16,734
Please leave.

1033
01:21:16,799 --> 01:21:18,885
How dare you!

1034
01:21:19,177 --> 01:21:20,177
This isn't allowed...

1035
01:21:22,513 --> 01:21:24,140
What's going on here?!

1036
01:21:24,473 --> 01:21:25,642
Dr. Yang…

1037
01:21:28,519 --> 01:21:32,899
These ladies are demanding that
they be allowed in the VIP room…

1038
01:21:33,607 --> 01:21:36,110
Are ya the boss here?

1039
01:21:36,694 --> 01:21:38,422
Yes, may I help you?

1040
01:21:38,488 --> 01:21:42,909
I wanted some treatment from ya,

1041
01:21:43,576 --> 01:21:45,870
and this guy's not lettin' me!

1042
01:21:46,704 --> 01:21:49,141
As per my clinic's protocol,

1043
01:21:49,207 --> 01:21:53,753
only the VIP members
can be treated by me.

1044
01:21:54,212 --> 01:21:57,214
VIP? What a load o' crap!

1045
01:21:57,423 --> 01:22:00,193
Ya sure used a fancy
word for callin' us poor!

1046
01:22:00,259 --> 01:22:01,612
I know, eh?

1047
01:22:01,678 --> 01:22:05,741
So, poor ladies can be ignored?

1048
01:22:05,807 --> 01:22:07,034
- Right?
- Yeah?

1049
01:22:07,100 --> 01:22:10,329
Even so, you shouldn't shove ma chest!

1050
01:22:10,395 --> 01:22:12,705
- You shouldn't!
- Wait a minute.

1051
01:22:12,772 --> 01:22:13,772
Huh?

1052
01:22:15,357 --> 01:22:16,127
He touched me.

1053
01:22:16,193 --> 01:22:18,295
Me? No! I didn't touch her!

1054
01:22:18,361 --> 01:22:19,654
Touched you?!

1055
01:22:19,946 --> 01:22:21,089
You bastard!

1056
01:22:21,155 --> 01:22:23,967
That man groped me!

1057
01:22:24,033 --> 01:22:26,386
When my hubby won't,
though I ask him to.

1058
01:22:26,452 --> 01:22:29,556
But this anchovy sexually molested me!

1059
01:22:29,622 --> 01:22:32,834
Sexual molestation!

1060
01:22:34,043 --> 01:22:37,171
Which bastard fondled
ma wife's boobies?!

1061
01:22:37,547 --> 01:22:38,631
Was it you?!

1062
01:22:39,132 --> 01:22:41,801
I don't even touch them! Shit!

1063
01:22:43,886 --> 01:22:45,447
Fondle my boobies too, asshole!

1064
01:22:45,513 --> 01:22:48,307
Grope them all you want!

1065
01:22:49,350 --> 01:22:51,078
What are you waiting for?!

1066
01:22:51,144 --> 01:22:53,330
- Are they too small?
- Yes, I mean…

1067
01:22:53,396 --> 01:22:55,064
Call the police!

1068
01:22:55,397 --> 01:22:58,168
I received a sexual harassment report.

1069
01:22:58,234 --> 01:23:00,028
Who called the police?

1070
01:23:00,445 --> 01:23:01,445
Already?

1071
01:23:02,322 --> 01:23:04,716
I was on the way here to get Botox.

1072
01:23:04,781 --> 01:23:07,260
Could I check the security cams?

1073
01:23:07,326 --> 01:23:09,287
Yeah, check those first.

1074
01:23:10,038 --> 01:23:11,789
Did it make you…

1075
01:23:12,415 --> 01:23:13,875
- happy?!
- Yes, I mean, no.

1076
01:23:32,435 --> 01:23:34,037
I should've asked you earlier,

1077
01:23:34,103 --> 01:23:36,248
have you ever tried rappelling?

1078
01:23:36,314 --> 01:23:38,732
Dude, I was in a marine.

1079
01:23:39,357 --> 01:23:41,110
Screw that.

1080
01:23:41,652 --> 01:23:43,547
- What about you?
- Boy Scouts.

1081
01:23:43,613 --> 01:23:44,613
What?

1082
01:23:44,822 --> 01:23:46,633
Childhood Climbing and Rappelling.

1083
01:23:46,699 --> 01:23:48,510
Early childhood programs
are very important.

1084
01:23:48,576 --> 01:23:52,080
Soccer stars like Son Heung-min
were in Boy Scouts.

1085
01:23:53,414 --> 01:23:57,043
He was never in Boy
Scouts, that's fake news.

1086
01:23:57,251 --> 01:23:58,461
Is that right?

1087
01:24:02,298 --> 01:24:03,298
What's the commotion?

1088
01:24:03,341 --> 01:24:05,902
Clients caused a scene
and police are here.

1089
01:24:05,968 --> 01:24:09,597
It's nothing, everything
will blow over soon.

1090
01:24:10,932 --> 01:24:12,600
Something stinks…

1091
01:24:18,815 --> 01:24:21,734
See? No breasts were touched.

1092
01:24:25,655 --> 01:24:28,406
This angle is not very clear.

1093
01:24:29,325 --> 01:24:31,828
Are there any other
cameras in the lobby?

1094
01:24:32,995 --> 01:24:34,806
I said this is the only one!

1095
01:24:34,872 --> 01:24:36,999
Anyway, can you rewind it once more?

1096
01:24:40,837 --> 01:24:41,879
Hello?

1097
01:24:42,296 --> 01:24:43,923
<i>Captain, now!</i>

1098
01:24:44,214 --> 01:24:45,299
Okay!

1099
01:24:47,385 --> 01:24:49,345
What's going on?

1100
01:24:49,929 --> 01:24:51,389
Rooftop team, penetrate!

1101
01:25:09,365 --> 01:25:10,365
Penetration, complete.

1102
01:25:13,661 --> 01:25:16,098
Zhu's weakness in
Dr. Yang's possession,

1103
01:25:16,164 --> 01:25:18,040
it has to be in here.

1104
01:25:34,140 --> 01:25:35,200
Something wrong?

1105
01:25:35,266 --> 01:25:36,266
Hold on.

1106
01:25:40,313 --> 01:25:41,397
Bingo.

1107
01:25:45,193 --> 01:25:46,628
I told you to paint it properly.

1108
01:25:46,694 --> 01:25:48,380
The paint's coming off.

1109
01:25:48,446 --> 01:25:51,156
There was no time to dry them.

1110
01:26:00,708 --> 01:26:03,211
That's weird, it should be here…

1111
01:26:03,586 --> 01:26:05,689
You said it'd be here,
look for it properly!

1112
01:26:05,755 --> 01:26:07,839
Look in the back over there!

1113
01:26:09,634 --> 01:26:11,653
We got a situation, buy
us some more time.

1114
01:26:11,719 --> 01:26:15,223
What? How am I supposed to do that now?

1115
01:26:15,765 --> 01:26:18,935
This is nuts, look for it faster!

1116
01:26:28,527 --> 01:26:32,865
Everyone, clear the
room, except the detective.

1117
01:26:44,627 --> 01:26:47,546
I knew something was off…

1118
01:26:48,673 --> 01:26:50,525
Be honest now.

1119
01:26:50,591 --> 01:26:53,261
What were you looking for?

1120
01:26:59,308 --> 01:27:01,477
Dr. Yang…

1121
01:27:03,646 --> 01:27:05,815
You clue in quickly.

1122
01:27:06,107 --> 01:27:09,610
You thought this clumsy
plan would work?

1123
01:27:10,444 --> 01:27:15,967
These men are captured
illegally searching my office

1124
01:27:16,033 --> 01:27:17,785
without a warrant.

1125
01:27:18,869 --> 01:27:24,417
If you don't talk, I'll get my
lawyer to relay it to the media.

1126
01:27:28,713 --> 01:27:30,214
Zhu Lin-pang.

1127
01:27:32,924 --> 01:27:36,262
We're looking for
evidence to arrest him.

1128
01:27:39,432 --> 01:27:42,560
You took a hard approach
to an easy problem.

1129
01:27:43,311 --> 01:27:47,165
I think we can come to an agreement.

1130
01:27:47,231 --> 01:27:50,318
But I'll need something in return.

1131
01:27:51,652 --> 01:27:54,697
Are you implying a deal?

1132
01:27:55,156 --> 01:27:58,075
I need to hear the conditions
before deciding to do a deal.

1133
01:27:59,702 --> 01:28:00,870
Very well.

1134
01:28:01,537 --> 01:28:03,914
If you hand over
evidence to arrest Zhu,

1135
01:28:04,373 --> 01:28:08,753
we'll allow you to completely
take over this Omerta clinic.

1136
01:28:15,509 --> 01:28:18,679
It's so easy to talk
to beautiful girls.

1137
01:28:23,476 --> 01:28:27,646
So, that's the deal,
where's the evidence?

1138
01:28:40,951 --> 01:28:42,387
What are you doing?!

1139
01:28:42,453 --> 01:28:43,746
What else?

1140
01:28:45,122 --> 01:28:46,123
Arresting you.

1141
01:28:46,582 --> 01:28:47,582
What?

1142
01:28:50,753 --> 01:28:53,422
<i>I secured Zhu's videos.</i>

1143
01:28:53,756 --> 01:28:55,758
What? How?

1144
01:28:55,924 --> 01:28:58,969
<i>I'll fill you in later, just
come to the lobby.</i>

1145
01:29:00,888 --> 01:29:01,889
Let's go.

1146
01:29:03,473 --> 01:29:06,811
Shit, who are these bozos?
Where did they come from?

1147
01:29:08,187 --> 01:29:09,289
Let's give it a go.

1148
01:29:09,355 --> 01:29:11,333
Give us a second to get ready.

1149
01:29:11,399 --> 01:29:13,150
Stay still for 10 seconds.

1150
01:29:14,944 --> 01:29:16,338
- Bud.
- What?

1151
01:29:16,404 --> 01:29:19,781
See that guy in the back,
who looks like a mochi?

1152
01:29:20,533 --> 01:29:22,410
He's the one who stabbed Chairwoman.

1153
01:29:22,952 --> 01:29:26,122
Then we gotta get him,
that mochi bastard.

1154
01:29:29,959 --> 01:29:34,004
You're so close, it's really too bad.

1155
01:29:34,713 --> 01:29:36,714
Have fun with them.

1156
01:29:38,092 --> 01:29:39,343
Begin!

1157
01:30:05,453 --> 01:30:06,704
You're pretty good.

1158
01:30:08,414 --> 01:30:09,848
Where are you going? It's not over.

1159
01:30:09,915 --> 01:30:11,167
Right.

1160
01:31:27,535 --> 01:31:28,911
Go after Zhu! Go!

1161
01:31:32,205 --> 01:31:34,250
It's been a while, Mochi.

1162
01:31:39,296 --> 01:31:41,924
Goddammit!

1163
01:32:48,699 --> 01:32:50,635
Stay here and stop the cop.

1164
01:32:50,701 --> 01:32:51,702
Yes, sir.

1165
01:32:59,918 --> 01:33:01,104
Who are you?

1166
01:33:01,170 --> 01:33:02,713
You can't just hop in.

1167
01:33:05,007 --> 01:33:06,007
Start the engine.

1168
01:33:07,635 --> 01:33:09,929
A client, I see. Where
would you like to go?

1169
01:33:28,656 --> 01:33:29,656
Out of the way!

1170
01:35:17,973 --> 01:35:20,326
Let me just go home.
One, two, three, four…

1171
01:35:20,392 --> 01:35:22,519
So many of them…

1172
01:35:28,357 --> 01:35:29,357
Don't move!

1173
01:37:24,641 --> 01:37:26,183
Zhu Lin-fang!

1174
01:37:28,896 --> 01:37:30,164
Get over here.

1175
01:37:30,230 --> 01:37:33,417
Wait, I'll give you the money.

1176
01:37:33,482 --> 01:37:35,711
Take it and call it a day, yeah?

1177
01:37:35,777 --> 01:37:40,365
I'll send you 5 times
more in China! 10 times!

1178
01:37:40,616 --> 01:37:41,658
Money?

1179
01:37:42,409 --> 01:37:43,952
I don't need money!

1180
01:37:50,167 --> 01:37:51,167
What are these?

1181
01:37:55,172 --> 01:37:56,548
Aren't these fentanyl?

1182
01:37:57,424 --> 01:38:00,736
Yeah, are you into fentanyl?

1183
01:38:00,802 --> 01:38:04,348
I'll give you a lifetime supply!

1184
01:38:06,558 --> 01:38:07,558
Fentanyl!

1185
01:38:16,985 --> 01:38:21,966
I once arrested a dealer,
who sold fentanyl to kids,

1186
01:38:22,031 --> 01:38:23,825
do you know what happened to him?

1187
01:38:24,576 --> 01:38:27,746
He'll live his remaining
life in a wheelchair.

1188
01:38:38,674 --> 01:38:40,926
Wait! Wait!

1189
01:38:41,635 --> 01:38:43,887
Are cops allowed to do this?

1190
01:38:44,388 --> 01:38:46,390
Yeah, I'm allowed.

1191
01:38:51,019 --> 01:38:54,189
You conniving fox, this
is a violation of our deal!

1192
01:38:55,147 --> 01:38:57,150
Like hell is it.

1193
01:38:57,484 --> 01:38:59,361
Did we write a contract?!

1194
01:39:00,237 --> 01:39:01,881
Give me your passcode for this.

1195
01:39:01,947 --> 01:39:04,926
You're a total psycho!

1196
01:39:04,991 --> 01:39:07,720
Why should I tell you?
You'll never unlock it!

1197
01:39:07,786 --> 01:39:10,914
That evidence is out of
your reach, you hear me?!

1198
01:39:12,165 --> 01:39:14,001
I have no choice then…

1199
01:39:27,889 --> 01:39:28,575
Seriously?!

1200
01:39:28,641 --> 01:39:29,659
Face, face!

1201
01:39:29,725 --> 01:39:31,077
Grab her face!

1202
01:39:31,143 --> 01:39:32,227
That's it!

1203
01:39:33,103 --> 01:39:35,272
This hag is really stubborn.

1204
01:39:35,564 --> 01:39:36,564
"Hag"?!

1205
01:39:39,192 --> 01:39:40,610
Nice, bingo!

1206
01:39:41,737 --> 01:39:45,281
What are you waiting for,
put this hag in the wagon.

1207
01:39:45,781 --> 01:39:50,304
"Hag"?! How dare you?!

1208
01:39:50,370 --> 01:39:52,164
"Hag"?!

1209
01:40:26,364 --> 01:40:30,577
Jeju is stunning, Captain!

1210
01:40:53,391 --> 01:40:57,729
Chairwoman Yoo is here! She's back!

1211
01:41:01,775 --> 01:41:03,502
How are ya feeling?

1212
01:41:03,568 --> 01:41:04,795
I'm feeling good.

1213
01:41:04,861 --> 01:41:08,115
- Thank goodness.
- I'm so relieved to see ya.

1214
01:41:09,574 --> 01:41:10,926
<i>Here's the next news.</i>

1215
01:41:10,991 --> 01:41:14,346
<i>An international drug ring distributing
over $10M worth of fentanyl</i>

1216
01:41:14,412 --> 01:41:16,915
<i>has been busted in Jeju.</i>

1217
01:41:17,290 --> 01:41:22,980
<i>So-called "zombie drug" is
popular among 20-somethings</i>

1218
01:41:23,046 --> 01:41:26,859
<i>for its cheap price and
strong hallucinogenic effects.</i>

1219
01:41:26,924 --> 01:41:31,680
<i>It has emerged as a societal
issue in the USA and South America.</i>

1220
01:41:31,847 --> 01:41:35,493
<i>Korea Customs has called
for tougher measures</i>

1221
01:41:35,558 --> 01:41:38,770
<i>following a surge in drug smuggling…</i>

1222
01:41:51,741 --> 01:41:53,052
How did it go?

1223
01:41:53,118 --> 01:41:57,998
I checked your office as you
asked, but there was no frame.

1224
01:41:59,374 --> 01:42:00,726
What do you mean?

1225
01:42:00,792 --> 01:42:02,103
There was no frame?

1226
01:42:02,169 --> 01:42:05,338
I ordered my men to look for it again,

1227
01:42:05,839 --> 01:42:08,424
I guess it was an
important object to you?

1228
01:42:12,137 --> 01:42:13,656
Do you know how much that's worth?

1229
01:42:13,722 --> 01:42:16,348
$20M! 20 million!

1230
01:42:16,975 --> 01:42:19,269
What? $20M?

1231
01:42:19,728 --> 01:42:20,913
But how could a frame...

1232
01:42:20,979 --> 01:42:22,439
You ignorant bastard!

1233
01:42:22,772 --> 01:42:25,859
It contained misprinted
bills! Misprint bills!

1234
01:42:26,193 --> 01:42:30,631
How many misprints
do you think there are?

1235
01:42:30,697 --> 01:42:35,594
One in a few years, no, in a decade!

1236
01:42:35,660 --> 01:42:40,975
All the bills in the frame were
misprinted bills that circulated in China!

1237
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:43,668
All that is worth over $20M...

1238
01:42:46,588 --> 01:42:49,758
Find it no matter what! Hurry!

1239
01:42:50,759 --> 01:42:51,759
Fight!

1240
01:42:51,885 --> 01:42:53,762
- Hurry!
- Fight!

1241
01:42:54,095 --> 01:42:57,658
You dumbass, not 'fight', 'hurry'!

1242
01:42:57,723 --> 01:43:01,245
Hurry, hurry!

1243
01:43:01,311 --> 01:43:03,313
Now! Go!

1244
01:43:05,397 --> 01:43:06,816
Please help him!

1245
01:43:07,817 --> 01:43:09,336
Get over here!

1246
01:43:09,402 --> 01:43:12,506
No, hurry up and go!

1247
01:43:12,572 --> 01:43:14,091
I'll kill you all!

1248
01:43:14,156 --> 01:43:16,743
Eat shit and die!

1249
01:43:16,952 --> 01:43:20,306
You're hurting me! Stop it!

1250
01:43:20,372 --> 01:43:24,918
<i>10 months later</i>

1251
01:43:38,640 --> 01:43:39,808
Boss!

1252
01:43:43,561 --> 01:43:45,021
Welcome back, sir.

1253
01:43:46,772 --> 01:43:49,084
Did you sell all the misprints?

1254
01:43:49,150 --> 01:43:49,836
Yes.

1255
01:43:49,902 --> 01:43:51,987
Here you go.

1256
01:43:53,738 --> 01:43:55,115
Please verify it.

1257
01:43:56,366 --> 01:43:58,201
<i>Bank Account: $20M</i>

1258
01:44:03,748 --> 01:44:08,295
How did you know those
misprints were at Omerta?

1259
01:44:13,799 --> 01:44:14,944
Nice meeting you.

1260
01:44:15,010 --> 01:44:19,431
I was looking around the
office while waiting and…

1261
01:44:20,557 --> 01:44:21,975
that thing…

1262
01:44:23,310 --> 01:44:24,978
caught my eyes.

1263
01:44:27,105 --> 01:44:31,359
So, you chased after it ever
since and came to Jeju?

1264
01:44:32,402 --> 01:44:35,113
You are incredible.

1265
01:44:37,073 --> 01:44:38,926
I live up to my infamy!

1266
01:44:38,991 --> 01:44:42,203
I'm the man! Let's go!

1267
01:44:42,829 --> 01:44:44,622
Go! Go!

1268
01:44:47,751 --> 01:44:49,419
Let's go!

1269
01:45:01,306 --> 01:45:06,019
Miss, why are you
telling me this story?

1270
01:45:06,770 --> 01:45:07,937
Well…

1271
01:45:08,813 --> 01:45:14,586
When you travel somewhere, the
guide tells you interesting things.

1272
01:45:14,652 --> 01:45:17,989
I was explaining what happened here.

1273
01:45:18,239 --> 01:45:21,093
Are you a guide here?

1274
01:45:21,159 --> 01:45:23,161
No, I'm not a guide…

1275
01:45:24,746 --> 01:45:26,557
Remember the case I told you?

1276
01:45:26,623 --> 01:45:31,061
I played an important
role in that case...

1277
01:45:31,127 --> 01:45:32,837
Det. Lee, what are you doing?

1278
01:45:33,463 --> 01:45:34,547
You're back.

1279
01:45:35,382 --> 01:45:40,553
Formal transfer to Jeju, how
do you feel on your first day?

1280
01:45:41,554 --> 01:45:44,366
It feels nice to be back.

1281
01:45:44,432 --> 01:45:48,228
You were desperate
to get out of the island,

1282
01:45:48,645 --> 01:45:50,230
why did you come back?

1283
01:45:50,522 --> 01:45:54,275
You know, my last trip was too short,

1284
01:45:54,818 --> 01:45:57,987
I never got to say goodbye
properly to the locals,

1285
01:45:58,279 --> 01:46:02,700
and when I was back
in Seoul, I missed Jeju.

1286
01:46:02,991 --> 01:46:04,244
Welcome back.

1287
01:46:05,078 --> 01:46:06,597
Chairwoman and others doing well?

1288
01:46:06,663 --> 01:46:08,665
Of course, they're all waiting.

1289
01:46:09,165 --> 01:46:10,250
Your son?

1290
01:46:12,001 --> 01:46:13,753
He's so not my son!

1291
01:46:14,129 --> 01:46:15,129
Bye!

1292
01:46:17,424 --> 01:46:19,551
<i>I'm not even married yet!</i>

1293
01:46:20,844 --> 01:46:23,155
<i>So you like being back?</i>

1294
01:46:23,221 --> 01:46:24,490
<i>Well…</i>

1295
01:46:24,556 --> 01:46:26,766
<i>How much do you like it?</i>

1296
01:46:27,808 --> 01:46:28,744
<i>Embarrassed?</i>

1297
01:46:28,810 --> 01:46:30,395
<i>Stop asking.</i>
