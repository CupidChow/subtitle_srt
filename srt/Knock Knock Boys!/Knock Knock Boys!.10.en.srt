00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:22,150
When will you go back home with me?

11
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,520
I want you to actually go back,

12
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,880
and not run away again.

13
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,500
Father.

14
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,220
So...

15
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:36,380
- I...
- What is this?

16
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,560
How could you live here?

17
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:43,850
So, who are you?

18
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,680
I am the one who is civilized enough

19
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,600
to not ask questions randomly like "Who are you?"

20
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,280
I politely asked you.

21
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,130
You should have good manners too.

22
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,660
If you don't apologize to me,

23
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,040
I will not let your son
live in this house anymore.

24
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:59,810
Excuse me,

25
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,590
are you the owner of the house?

26
00:01:01,845 --> 00:01:03,195
And you are the owner?

27
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,970
I have the right because my son lives here.

28
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:06,760
- I can come into this house.
- My son lives here too.

29
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,730
- Where is your son living?
- You don't have any right.

30
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:10,540
- Don't point your finger at me.
- Stop yelling at me.

31
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,560
Stop.

32
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,400
I will go back with you.

"Knock Knock, Boys!"
(Episode 10)

49
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,420
Almond. Almond.

50
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,920
Kill this one for me.

51
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,130
- Oh, I am dying.
- I am killing it now.

52
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,420
You are too slow.

53
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,780
We died.

54
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,780
It's because of you.

55
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,810
I died already.

56
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,690
Take it and play it yourself.

57
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,270
I won't play anymore.

58
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,820
Come on, I will do it myself.

59
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,060
What are you doing?

60
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,560
Is this a new way to show that
you are sulking?

61
00:03:48,408 --> 00:03:50,818
I think it's strangely quiet outside.

62
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,450
Should we go take a look?

63
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,450
They didn't kill each other, right?

64
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,750
If we go out, we might interrupt them.

65
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,050
It's been a while since they were together.

66
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,570
I think it's not normal.

67
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,720
You need to go home with me tonight.

68
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,560
No way, sir.

69
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,320
You just can't go home tonight

70
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,430
because...

71
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,350
Because...

72
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:56,880
Because it's quite late now.

73
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:01,420
And you just arrived here,

74
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:04,000
it's quite dangerous to
drive this late at night.

75
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,940
Let's say, we stay overnight here,

76
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,240
and then we'll talk about it
tomorrow, okay?

77
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:13,470
I don't think so.

78
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:14,770
If we keep delaying,

79
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,430
we won't make it for
the wedding this month.

80
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,160
If it's past the auspicious time,

81
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,960
you'll have to wait another three months.
I don't want to wait.

82
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,080
I think

83
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,710
we have a task.

84
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:27,530
What?

85
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,200
Uncle, please believe me. I am worried.

86
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:37,430
Then, I'll find a hotel here.

87
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,480
No.

88
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,050
I will sleep here tonight.

89
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,730
Tomorrow morning
you have to go home with me.

90
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:55,170
But...

91
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,730
Okay, Uncle.

92
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,330
So, you will sleep in Peak's room tonight.

93
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:08,060
And Peak will sleep on the sofa
outside with me.

94
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,710
Is it okay? So I will watch him for you.

95
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:12,530
Okay.

96
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,640
Come on. Let's prepare him a bed.

97
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,860
So, you can follow us.

98
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,240
It doesn't look good.

99
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,070
The situation is so tense.

100
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,890
What should we do?

101
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:58,870
Latte.

102
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,420
They might see us.

103
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,960
What is it?

104
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,680
Are you wearing something like this now?

105
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,950
It's actually mine.

106
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,640
Is Jane wearing boxers now?

107
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:25,810
Yes.

108
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,560
I just tried it.

109
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,010
And I like it, it is so comfy and cool.

110
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,690
It's also a trend now, Uncle.

111
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,860
This design is trendy now.

112
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,380
Are you sure?

113
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,310
I might have remembered it wrong.

114
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:47,720
Is that yours?

115
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:51,730
Don't be shy.

116
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,200
He has a cute and playful side, Uncle.

117
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,190
Right?

118
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:02,890
Yes.

119
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,750
Whose boxers are it?

120
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,320
It's Almond's.

121
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,470
What are you looking for?

122
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,680
Where are my strawberry boxers?

123
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,790
Wow.

124
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,680
Haven't you thrown away that one yet?

125
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,440
It's my favorite.

126
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,800
Where is it?

127
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,110
I went out of my way to buy it.

128
00:08:35,741 --> 00:08:36,961
And it was the only one.

129
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:40,730
Why are you sitting here?

130
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,060
Help me find it.

131
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,570
Yes, yes. All right.

132
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,240
Did you find it?

133
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,400
I will sleep here tonight.

134
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,150
Clean the room now.

135
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,410
Okay. Yes.

136
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,630
Hey.

137
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,720
There are bundles of books near the bed.

138
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,560
Yes.

139
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,120
It's all tidy now. Okay.

140
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,970
If there's anything,
you can always call me.

141
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,320
Thank you.

142
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,290
Good night, Uncle.

143
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:44,860
I am sorry

144
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,810
that I only caused you trouble.

145
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,630
I also spoke to you harshly.

146
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,280
My problem with my dad and Jane.

147
00:10:57,566 --> 00:10:58,986
Is there anything I can help you with?

148
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:05,060
Just sit here.

149
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,340
For me,

150
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,990
Jane really is my best friend
and I like her the most.

151
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,480
So much that

152
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,440
if one day I have to marry someone
to make my father happy,

153
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,740
that person would probably be Jane.

154
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,760
If it is the case,

155
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,770
why did you run away?

156
00:11:34,772 --> 00:11:36,432
Because I looked at Jane's
face, and I couldn't do it.

157
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,360
If I marry her,

158
00:11:41,854 --> 00:11:43,054
she's stuck with me.

159
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,490
Because her family
is indebted to my father a lot.

160
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,780
If I have to confront my father,

161
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,680
I don't dare to.

162
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:59,310
So, does your mother know that
you don't want to get married?

163
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,400
My mother is already in heaven.

164
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,910
But I am right beside you.

165
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,880
Will Peak be really okay?

166
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,760
He has to fight.

167
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,610
Or he can give up.

168
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:06,810
There are only two choices.

169
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:10,640
When I see him like this...

170
00:13:12,931 --> 00:13:15,011
Does Peak really have to go back home?

171
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,120
He is on good terms with Thanwa now.

172
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,200
Or do we need to help them?

173
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:27,950
But I am scared.

174
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,380
But still I want to help.

175
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:35,930
What should I do? I'm
getting a headache now.

176
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,010
Come on. Come here now.

177
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,400
Just get some sleep.

178
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,940
There's nothing we can do.

179
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,130
Why is Latte in this room?

180
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,250
You can go sleep in your own room.

181
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,980
Tonight I will sleep here.

182
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:08,350
Why are you laughing?

183
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:13,550
I just feel guilty.

184
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,800
But why did you laugh?

185
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,040
I actually feel guilty,

186
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,080
but I am happy at the same time.

187
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:25,220
That's why you laugh?

188
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:28,530
What is it about?

189
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,130
Peak, I am sorry.

190
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:32,950
But now,

191
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:35,280
I am super happy.

192
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,660
You are crazy.

193
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,740
You just smiled, you are crazy too.

194
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,060
I am not smiling.

195
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,920
You are the crazy one.

196
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,280
Then...

197
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:01,870
Do you want to do it?

198
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:04,000
You know, when we kiss,

199
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,560
we will go to the next lesson.

200
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:10,500
Are you taking it seriously?

201
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,350
You have studied the
theory in the club before.

202
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,080
Would you like to try practicing?

203
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,840
Eh.

204
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:25,680
But you...

205
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,580
You have tried doing
it with yourself, right?

206
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:34,350
I was a rookie back then.

207
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,690
You are with a professional now.

208
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,240
You don't have to use a dildo anymore.

209
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,580
I will do it slowly.

210
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:17,790
Just a moment!

211
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm afraid I will get hurt like last time.

212
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,680
I don't want to make
Peak and Thanwa worried.

213
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,270
Maybe next time.

214
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,710
So what should I do tonight?

215
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,440
Just sleep together.

216
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,300
Sleep together.

217
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,310
It's difficult.

218
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,020
This is the request
that no one would ever ask me.

219
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,900
So, here you are. I am the first one.

220
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,640
So, you won't forget me.

221
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:38,490
Well,

222
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,994
I won't forget how
much I have to be patient.

223
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,000
Sleep now.

224
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,270
Have a good dream.

225
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,520
Have a good dream too.

226
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:46,550
Can you sleep?

227
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,200
Yeah.

228
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:50,290
Okay.

229
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,560
I am sorry.

230
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,210
When I called you,
I didn't think Uncle would overhear.

231
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,570
When he knew where you lived,

232
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:03,990
he rushed to come here.

233
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,990
I tried to call you

234
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,660
but you didn't answer the phone.

235
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:12,170
That's all right.

236
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,170
Even if you hid his car,

237
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,570
he would find a way to come.

238
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:19,670
That's true.

239
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,880
I also didn't answer his call.

240
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,380
Dad called several times.

241
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,380
But I didn't know how to begin
to tell him about this.

242
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,585
So, what would you do then?

243
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:33,560
Are you going with the flow like this?

244
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,300
Well...

245
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,010
Do you remember that

246
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,380
we both tried to escape Uncle before?

247
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,470
But we didn't make it.

248
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,470
I think we both were in primary school.

249
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,120
Come on.

250
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,970
Wait for me, Jane.

251
00:19:59,995 --> 00:20:02,235
Peak, follow me, come on.

252
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,240
I am tired.

253
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,500
Jane and Peak, come and have lunch now.

254
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:21,420
I still remember Uncle's scolding voice.

255
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,170
It's very frightening.

256
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:25,190
But thanks to you,

257
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,950
you took all the blame that day.

258
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,850
"I took Jane out to ride her bike, Dad."

259
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,720
So manly, right?

260
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,210
Yes, you were brave.

261
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,960
I am sorry

262
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,070
that I can't help you this time.

263
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,350
No need to be sentimental.

264
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,600
It's me who needs to apologize.

265
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,220
You got involved in my messy family.

266
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,670
If I were brave enough,

267
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,980
this matter wouldn't have gone this far.

268
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,730
You still have time to tell your dad.

269
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,010
I am afraid.

270
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,170
I am afraid if I tell my dad

271
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,410
that I don't want to marry you,

272
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:19,540
not just you, I don't want to marry
any woman, he will not accept it.

273
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:28,090
I don't want to disappoint him

274
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:31,510
or he will be sad like
when Mother passed away.

275
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:35,800
If that is the case,

276
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:37,880
I would agree to get married,

277
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,120
agree to have children,

278
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,130
or whatever.

279
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,200
I just want Dad to smile again.

280
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,010
Hm...

281
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:50,370
It must be difficult for a son like you.

282
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,880
Seriously,

283
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,660
I don't dare to introduce
my boyfriend to my family.

284
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,337
I'm afraid they won't be
able to accept it.

285
00:21:59,362 --> 00:22:01,011
Afraid that they will be
embarrassed of others too.

286
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,060
So,

287
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,320
is your boyfriend okay with this?

288
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,410
Is he not angry that
you have to marry me?

289
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,780
He was angry at first.

290
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,460
Now, he is okay.

291
00:22:13,945 --> 00:22:15,625
Trust is important.

292
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:19,880
Sincerely expressing feelings
to each other is important as well.

293
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,040
Just go to bed with Thanwa.

294
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,380
Are you crazy?

295
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,240
My dad asked me to sleep here with you.

296
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,790
You idiot,

297
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,470
if you want to do something, just do it.

298
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,520
Just tell Thanwa that you can't sleep.

299
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,000
You can tell him that I snore too loud.

300
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:02,490
But...

301
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:04,750
If you don't go,

302
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,660
I won't help you anymore.

303
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:15,170
I'll leave it with you.

304
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:16,250
Okay.

305
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:37,270
I am coming.

306
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,800
I'd like to sleep with you.

307
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:48,980
What kind of mood is it?

308
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:53,170
She snored so loud, I couldn't sleep.

309
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,330
I'll ask you again.

310
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:56,730
What kind of mood is it?

311
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,310
Jane told me to sleep here.

312
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,190
I thought you wanted to come yourself.

313
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,620
Even if she didn't tell me,

314
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,880
I would wait until she
sleeps to come up here.

315
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,840
I mean it.

316
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,760
What is it?

317
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,480
Did you wears glasses when you slept?

318
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:43,900
Oh, yes.

319
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:46,330
That's true.

320
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,510
What kind of person
wears glasses when sleeping?

321
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,220
Well,

322
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,100
a person who wants to see
everything clearly.

323
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,720
You are just joking.

324
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,940
I want to see everything
in my dreams clearly.

325
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,660
And I could clearly see the person
in front of me when I woke up.

326
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,510
Very clear.

327
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,000
Take a shower now.

328
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,760
Do you want to join me in the shower?

329
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,470
You go first.

330
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,720
Oops, sorry.

331
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:42,510
It's so clear.

332
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:43,450
What?

333
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,390
My dad.

334
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,620
What should we do?

335
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,760
No, just don't.

336
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,060
Dad is in front of the room.

337
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,830
If you open the door

338
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,150
and he knows that I slept inside,

339
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,230
he would be so angry.

340
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,640
What should we do?

341
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:08,990
Jane.

342
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:12,260
- Help us.
- My dad!

343
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,840
What?

344
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:15,240
My dad.

345
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:17,960
Take him away.

346
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,060
Okay.

347
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,370
Oh, Jane.

348
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:24,230
Are you done taking a shower?

349
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,070
Yes.

350
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,520
I was about to ask you to exercise with me.

351
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,400
Oh, I will join you.

352
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:29,310
I have new exercise routines to show you.

353
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:31,310
This one is now trendy, Uncle.

354
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,020
Lift your left leg,

355
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,740
like this.

356
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,100
I'll do it now.

357
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:38,340
Then lift your left arm,

358
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:40,630
and

359
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:41,990
shake off.

360
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,110
Shake off.

361
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,050
Oh! Good morning, Uncle.

362
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,440
Good morning.

363
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:56,320
I heard some noise,
what are you doing here?

364
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,310
Jane taught me a exercise routine.

365
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,390
All right.

366
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:02,800
I like exercise too.

367
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,960
Can I join you?

368
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,970
Come.

369
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:06,130
- Come on.
- Thank you.

370
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:07,410
Thanwa, do like this.

371
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:10,570
- Lift your left leg.
- Left leg.

372
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,360
Lift the right arm.

373
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:16,420
And breathe out.

374
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,710
Shake off the hand too, right?

375
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,010
It's up to you.

376
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:25,120
I think since we lived in this house,

377
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:28,150
there have been quite
a few peaceful mornings.

378
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:31,890
But I think it was not that bad
during the first few weeks.

379
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:34,830
Who told you, Mr. Latte?

380
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,950
For the first few weeks,

381
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:39,570
your alarm clock got on my nerves.

382
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,590
Darn it!

383
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:11,970
I am sorry. So sorry.

384
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:13,510
- Darn it.
- Keep your voice down.

385
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,340
What is it?

386
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:20,260
"Knock Knock, Boys!"

387
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,710
Come on, Latte.

388
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,540
Why do you stop?

389
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,660
Mom?

390
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,610
- Almond, my baby.
- Hello, Mom.

391
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:32,460
Oh...

392
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,860
We haven't seen each other for a while.

393
00:28:36,245 --> 00:28:38,515
My baby is so thin now.

394
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:42,400
That why you always post "Hungry"
on your Instagram.

395
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,340
Mom, I've gained three kilos.

396
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,040
Oh, that's impossible.

397
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,830
Your clothes are loose.

398
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:53,170
Three kilos are not on your body for sure.

399
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:55,980
This is my friend, Latte.

400
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,180
- Hello.
- Hello.

401
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,410
You must be tired from driving.

402
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:02,760
Would you like us
to take you to a cool coffee?

403
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,490
I'm not tired at all.

404
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:06,130
I have my driver.

405
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,460
Actually,

406
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:10,210
I thought I would stop at your condo first.

407
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,280
But I realized that today
you have morning class.

408
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:16,890
So, I brought food and snacks here.

409
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,770
The condo that you mentioned,

410
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,080
you must mean the house.

411
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,840
A condo means a house.

412
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,900
Yes, your condo.

413
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,980
You choose whatever you want to eat.

414
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:27,940
I will bring

415
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,160
the rest of them to your condo.

416
00:29:30,307 --> 00:29:31,337
Okay.

417
00:29:31,362 --> 00:29:32,512
That's all right, Mom.

418
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:34,647
But, can you not come to my condo?

419
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,406
I'll... I'll...

420
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,210
I'll eat all of them.

421
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:42,500
Me and Almond will eat all of these.

422
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,660
- Yes.
- That's good.

423
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,730
I will eat all of these.

424
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:46,320
I will share the food
with my friends in the class too.

425
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,540
That's good, you are so kind.

426
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,780
You can go back first.

427
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,400
Okay, I'll go now.

428
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,310
Okay.

429
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,710
Just eat all of these, all right?

430
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,310
Latte. Almond.

431
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,240
Oh...

432
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,050
- My friend is here too.
- Hello.

433
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:00,110
I have to go to the class now.

434
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:03,180
The teacher just said in the group
that today's class is canceled.

435
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,020
I called but you guys didn't answer.

436
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:07,260
So, today we are free.

437
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,780
I'm very happy that
I will have time to write novels.

438
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,090
I am going now.

439
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:12,750
I have to go now, Auntie.

440
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:13,890
Bye, my girl.

441
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,910
Wow...

442
00:30:20,013 --> 00:30:22,943
This is so good. You have free time now.

443
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:26,630
Then let's go and have breakfast
at the condo.

444
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:27,660
It's good, right?

445
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,350
- It's good. Let's go.
- Yes, Mom.

446
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:33,190
Mom, I think we should
eat at the cafeteria.

447
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,480
The food there is very delicious.

448
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,690
You will also know

449
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,980
which dishes that Almond likes to eat.

450
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,450
That's right, Mom.

451
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:43,480
Okay, good idea. Let's go.

452
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,590
Let's go now, Mom.

453
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:46,070
So, help me take all of these.

454
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,300
Yes.

455
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,490
Is it delicious, Uncle?

456
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:05,270
Thanwa cooked us the meal.

457
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:09,160
Next time, feel free to tell me
what you want to eat.

458
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,480
I will do it for you.

459
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:21,350
Peak, I will go to work.
Wash the dishes too.

460
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:22,760
Bye, Uncle.

461
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,640
All right.

462
00:31:34,717 --> 00:31:36,777
Does Thanwa cook for you every morning?

463
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,370
Most of the time.

464
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:42,250
We share the cost of the ingredients

465
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,260
then assign the duty in the house.

466
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:48,270
Living like this,

467
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,000
are you happy?

468
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:07,620
Yes.

469
00:32:08,703 --> 00:32:10,323
I'll look at it for you now.

470
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,150
Yes. All right.

471
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,740
Uh...

472
00:32:15,886 --> 00:32:17,156
Okay. Yes.

473
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:18,790
Oh!

474
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:21,270
This issue shouldn't
take long to be resolved.

475
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:24,012
I will check for you now, please wait.

476
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:26,210
All right.

477
00:32:31,045 --> 00:32:34,195
Wait for Peak to finish clearing things up
and then we will talk, Uncle.

478
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:44,290
Are you full?

479
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,410
So full.

480
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:46,440
- Is it delicious?
- Yes.

481
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:47,370
- Do you want some more?
- Everything is good.

482
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:49,200
I will order another set for you.

483
00:32:49,505 --> 00:32:51,775
I can't eat anymore, Auntie. So full.

484
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,890
- But I think...
- Come to see me at the cafeteria now.

485
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,480
I need help.

486
00:32:57,505 --> 00:32:58,525
Roast suckling pig.

487
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,830
I can treat you with something like that.

488
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,730
I often eat it at home.

489
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,710
Auntie, I can't eat anymore.

490
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:05,550
Okay.

491
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:06,940
Now that we're full,

492
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,960
let's go to the condo.

493
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,250
Please wait, Mom.

494
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,630
What is it?

495
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,930
What are you waiting for?

496
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:14,370
I am waiting...

497
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,410
Oh, Jumper. Shawn.

498
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,280
- Hello, Mother.
- Hello.

499
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,220
They are my friends.

500
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,970
This is Jumper and Shawn.

501
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:27,320
Oh, they're so cute.

502
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,460
Would you like some snacks?
I will pay for you.

503
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:30,990
It's okay, Mom.

504
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:32,610
We came here for...

505
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:33,740
We need Almond to do group work.

506
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:36,170
- Today we have to go to the library.
- Oh really?

507
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:38,920
I thought his class was canceled today.

508
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,320
Do you have group work?

509
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,070
That's right, Mom.

510
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,310
It's a shame

511
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:45,550
that I can't take you
to see the condo right now.

512
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:47,660
I want to be a good group leader.

513
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,610
I have to be responsible for the report.

514
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,390
You are right. That is good.

515
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,170
You all just go then.

516
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:54,210
Hey, Jumper.

517
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,400
- You are so good.
- The teacher postponed class to 9.30 am.

518
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,310
Come on now.

519
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,990
Wow!

520
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,360
You don't have to do the group work then.

521
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,570
Just go or you will be late.

522
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,790
I am sorry. Let's go now.

523
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,340
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

524
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:15,020
So you are free now?

525
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,010
That's good. I am quite tired,

526
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:21,020
so I can spend some time
with you the whole day.

527
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,470
Shall we go?

528
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:23,990
Ah, yes. Let's go now.

529
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,240
Yes, let's go. What are you waiting for?
Let's go.

530
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,560
(STUDIO 1)

531
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:37,990
What's wrong with you again?

532
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,430
Well... I...

533
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:43,730
Tell me.

534
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,050
Kit. Are people

535
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,820
being forced into
marriages by their families

536
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,450
that they can't refuse?

537
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,260
Yes, something like this can happen.

538
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,340
Anyway, are you being
forced into a marriage?

539
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,390
No, no.

540
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,040
It's my friend
who was forced into a marriage.

541
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,580
He doesn't want to get married.

542
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:06,540
But he can't honestly tell his family
because he doesn't want to hurt them.

543
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:08,530
So, he is the one who gets hurt.

544
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:09,650
He just endures it.

545
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:10,770
Is that right?

546
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,360
Something like that.

547
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:14,500
The person who will marry him

548
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,820
also doesn't want him
to get stuck with her.

549
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,820
So she feels awkward to marry him.

550
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,520
That's right.

551
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,460
What should he do?

552
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,370
I think he needs to speak up.

553
00:35:27,444 --> 00:35:29,784
So, what if he doesn't dare to talk?

554
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,300
Then he must go with the flow.

555
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,640
If you don't say it
or are afraid to say it,

556
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,430
you must face the consequences.

557
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:39,770
And what about his fear
that his family would be disappointed?

558
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,510
Have you asked his parents yet?

559
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:44,600
Just don't think for him.

560
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,510
Let it be his business.

561
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:49,180
You didn't scold me, did you?

562
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,020
Not at all.

563
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,390
I mean your friend.

564
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,050
You tell him

565
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,500
that he doesn't have to
think for his parents.

566
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,020
He needs to fight for himself.

567
00:35:58,790 --> 00:35:59,680
Life is short.

568
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:01,390
Don't think too much.

569
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:03,420
If he's afraid to say it,

570
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,300
you have to encourage him.

571
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,490
Pump up the courage.

572
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:10,020
- Pump up the courage?
- Yes.

573
00:36:10,784 --> 00:36:11,864
Sometimes people

574
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,290
need encouragement

575
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,810
and support to be brave.

576
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:17,890
If there are athletics,

577
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,290
there must be cheerleaders.

578
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:23,170
One, two, one, two, three.
One, two, one, two, one.

579
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:25,820
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

580
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:28,955
- Yeah!
- We sold our work already.

581
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,695
Are you cheering me up?

582
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,590
- Yes, this is for you.
- Cheering you up.

583
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,140
Yes, I am so happy for you.

584
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,760
So we have to brain storm and think.

585
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,800
Yes, sir.

586
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,810
The client is waiting for us.

587
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,700
- Do it.
- Just do it like he says.

588
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,640
Belt, turn left here.

589
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:48,130
Yes, sir.

590
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:52,900
Turn left again.

591
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,530
And turn left again.

592
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,740
Yes, sir.

593
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:09,390
What should I do?

594
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:12,080
I don't want Mom to know that
I live in the house.

595
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,780
My mom would kill me.

596
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,990
I don't know how long
I will keep lying to her.

597
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:21,620
So, we only have one way to go.

598
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,120
Just honestly tell her.

599
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,730
I think you should gradually
explain to your mom.

600
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,040
(Peak)

601
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,540
Turn left again.

602
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,650
Left again.

603
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:42,210
So where do you go next?

604
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,050
Turn left again.

605
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,110
After you turn left,

606
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,870
go straight and make a u-turn.

607
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:53,220
- Then turn left again.
- Ouch!

608
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,120
Stop!

609
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,810
When?

610
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:03,670
Belt,

611
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:04,710
when will we reach there?

612
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:06,270
When you are going to tidy my hair?

613
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:09,990
Are you going home like this every day?

614
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:12,060
Do you lose the way every day?

615
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:14,690
Latte,

616
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,090
you live in the same condo with Almond.

617
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:18,750
Do you know the direction?

618
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:22,590
If you don't tell me the truth,

619
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:24,500
I will cut your allowance

620
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:25,700
from now on

621
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,430
until you tell me the truth.

622
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:31,090
Okay, Mom.

623
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:36,110
I will take you to the actual
accommodation I'm staying at right now.

624
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,420
Belt,

625
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,400
make a U-turn and go straight.

626
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,890
After that make a left turn.

627
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:46,380
Do you see that little lane?

628
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,960
When you see that lane,
you make a right turn.

629
00:38:48,221 --> 00:38:50,301
Turn right again
and you will get there.

630
00:38:51,339 --> 00:38:52,179
Okay.

631
00:38:53,926 --> 00:38:55,196
Just tidy up my hair.

632
00:38:56,088 --> 00:38:56,928
Yes, Mom.

633
00:39:00,823 --> 00:39:02,143
I am going to puke.

634
00:39:03,698 --> 00:39:05,048
I think that's about it.

635
00:39:06,372 --> 00:39:07,472
Yes, I will do it.

636
00:39:07,972 --> 00:39:09,472
If you need help, please call me.

637
00:39:10,272 --> 00:39:11,012
Yes.

638
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,013
Are you ready to talk?

639
00:39:23,437 --> 00:39:24,277
Yes.

640
00:39:25,602 --> 00:39:26,972
When will you go back with me?

641
00:39:27,772 --> 00:39:29,202
I mean it,

642
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,520
not going back and running away again.

643
00:39:32,482 --> 00:39:33,322
Dad.

644
00:39:37,162 --> 00:39:38,002
Well...

645
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:40,969
- I...
- What is going on here?

646
00:39:44,232 --> 00:39:45,982
How do you all live here?

647
00:39:46,312 --> 00:39:47,862
Do you sleep together or separately?

648
00:39:48,252 --> 00:39:49,092
Who are you?

649
00:39:50,292 --> 00:39:51,132
And who are you?

650
00:39:51,462 --> 00:39:53,812
Let me ask you first who you are.

651
00:39:54,562 --> 00:39:56,722
I'm a polite person

652
00:39:56,982 --> 00:39:59,692
who doesn't ask who people are.

653
00:40:00,092 --> 00:40:00,932
You...

654
00:40:01,677 --> 00:40:03,777
I just asked, why do you
have to say harsh words?

655
00:40:03,802 --> 00:40:05,652
You walked into the house with your shoes,

656
00:40:05,652 --> 00:40:07,022
are you a foreigner?

657
00:40:07,592 --> 00:40:09,972
Why raise your voice?

658
00:40:10,272 --> 00:40:12,692
I am the mother of my son who lives here.

659
00:40:13,052 --> 00:40:15,972
You are a butler of this rental house.
How can you talk like this?

660
00:40:16,292 --> 00:40:17,882
I am not a butler.

661
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:19,512
My son is living here.

662
00:40:19,682 --> 00:40:20,982
If you are his son,

663
00:40:20,982 --> 00:40:22,532
please teach your father some manners

664
00:40:22,912 --> 00:40:25,092
that he shouldn't ask
a person he's meeting the first time

665
00:40:25,092 --> 00:40:26,442
the question "Who you are?"

666
00:40:26,442 --> 00:40:28,702
So, do you want me to ask
"What do you do for a living?"

667
00:40:28,727 --> 00:40:30,207
- "Are you rich?"
- You are rude.

668
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:33,212
You should dye your hair too.

669
00:40:33,212 --> 00:40:35,442
You should put on makeup too.

670
00:40:35,442 --> 00:40:36,342
I don't know you...

671
00:40:36,342 --> 00:40:37,252
Don't point your finger at me.

672
00:40:37,252 --> 00:40:39,272
Excuse me, Uncle and Auntie.

673
00:40:39,272 --> 00:40:40,722
I beg you.

674
00:40:40,842 --> 00:40:42,672
Please calm down.

675
00:40:43,472 --> 00:40:44,832
Please calm down.

676
00:40:45,232 --> 00:40:46,452
If you don't apologize to me,

677
00:40:47,107 --> 00:40:48,997
I will not let your son
live in this house anymore.

678
00:40:49,172 --> 00:40:50,992
Are you the owner of the house?

679
00:40:51,262 --> 00:40:52,462
So, are you?

680
00:40:52,832 --> 00:40:54,572
I have the right to tell you
because my son lives here.

681
00:40:54,572 --> 00:40:56,362
- I came into this house...
- My son lives here too.

682
00:40:56,362 --> 00:40:58,312
- No, your son just came in here.
- What is wrong with you?

683
00:40:58,312 --> 00:41:00,292
- What type of person you are?
- Stop.

684
00:41:03,622 --> 00:41:04,632
I will go back home with you.

685
00:41:09,192 --> 00:41:10,322
I agree to go back with you.

686
00:41:11,352 --> 00:41:12,852
Please give me time to pack my stuff.

687
00:41:13,102 --> 00:41:13,942
I will go back now.

688
00:41:17,432 --> 00:41:18,272
Peak.

689
00:41:33,112 --> 00:41:34,372
Do you need my help?

690
00:41:42,972 --> 00:41:44,602
I am sorry.

691
00:41:45,462 --> 00:41:47,532
I didn't think this matter
would get out of control like this.

692
00:41:50,052 --> 00:41:50,892
That's all right.

693
00:41:52,742 --> 00:41:54,162
Last night I decided that no matter what,

694
00:41:54,162 --> 00:41:56,372
I had to go back
before it was too late.

695
00:41:57,032 --> 00:41:58,182
I know that.

696
00:41:58,782 --> 00:42:00,412
I still feel bad anyway.

697
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:04,362
Don't feel bad, Jane.

698
00:42:05,662 --> 00:42:07,202
I have to fight for you too.

699
00:42:08,632 --> 00:42:09,472
You are so manly.

700
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:13,112
So brave.

701
00:42:16,382 --> 00:42:17,222
Let's go, Dad.

702
00:42:21,352 --> 00:42:22,582
Are you really going?

703
00:42:27,632 --> 00:42:28,472
Peak.

704
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,720
Will you come back?

705
00:42:34,282 --> 00:42:35,182
See you.

706
00:42:42,152 --> 00:42:42,992
My baby,

707
00:42:43,802 --> 00:42:45,452
what is your story?

708
00:42:46,382 --> 00:42:47,452
Tell me about it.

709
00:42:48,852 --> 00:42:49,722
Well...

710
00:42:50,197 --> 00:42:51,847
I want to hear it from the beginning.

711
00:42:53,702 --> 00:42:54,542
Yes.

712
00:42:57,592 --> 00:42:58,432
(KK TOUR)

713
00:42:59,362 --> 00:43:00,762
I will give you a tour.

714
00:43:01,352 --> 00:43:03,552
(KK TOUR)

715
00:43:06,572 --> 00:43:09,332
Welcome to Knock Knock House.

716
00:43:09,332 --> 00:43:11,412
I lived here without telling you.

717
00:43:11,412 --> 00:43:12,532
I apologize for that.

718
00:43:13,272 --> 00:43:14,412
Don't waste time here.

719
00:43:14,412 --> 00:43:16,682
I will give you a tour
to see the inside of this house.

720
00:43:16,682 --> 00:43:18,952
Please follow me and come into this house.

721
00:43:19,492 --> 00:43:21,822
Here is our patio.

722
00:43:21,822 --> 00:43:24,302
We will sit here and wear shoes
before we go to school.

723
00:43:24,302 --> 00:43:27,412
We will now meet our first guest.

724
00:43:27,692 --> 00:43:28,532
This is...

725
00:43:29,132 --> 00:43:30,502
Ta-dah. This is Latte.

726
00:43:30,502 --> 00:43:31,722
Hello, Mom.

727
00:43:31,722 --> 00:43:32,822
Please have an iced-water.

728
00:43:33,412 --> 00:43:34,782
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

729
00:43:35,022 --> 00:43:36,392
And this is a zone

730
00:43:36,742 --> 00:43:37,832
for the living room.

731
00:43:37,832 --> 00:43:38,992
Before we tour the living room,

732
00:43:38,992 --> 00:43:40,672
I will introduce you to this.

733
00:43:40,672 --> 00:43:42,722
This is a house's keychain holder.

734
00:43:42,722 --> 00:43:44,092
Put the keys here.

735
00:43:44,092 --> 00:43:45,972
Wait. Let me see the feng shui.

736
00:43:46,452 --> 00:43:48,722
Let's see our living room area.

737
00:43:48,722 --> 00:43:51,212
We will have a party here every Saturday.

738
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:52,402
And then...

739
00:43:52,732 --> 00:43:54,362
this is the kitchen.

740
00:43:54,362 --> 00:43:57,692
Thanwa will make breakfast for us
every day here.

741
00:43:58,162 --> 00:43:59,422
Do you need a steamed bun?

742
00:43:59,672 --> 00:44:00,982
Thank you.

743
00:44:01,632 --> 00:44:02,622
Let's go to the next room.

744
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:30,022
The story is like this.

745
00:44:31,612 --> 00:44:34,462
I must apologize for lying to you.

746
00:44:36,022 --> 00:44:37,352
But I am very happy

747
00:44:37,772 --> 00:44:41,282
that I'm living my life
the way I always wanted to.

748
00:44:42,752 --> 00:44:43,822
I have Latte here

749
00:44:44,912 --> 00:44:45,822
and Peak

750
00:44:46,532 --> 00:44:48,012
and Thanwa who look after me.

751
00:44:48,532 --> 00:44:49,702
I am very happy.

752
00:44:52,062 --> 00:44:53,122
I like living here so much.

753
00:44:54,052 --> 00:44:54,892
So,

754
00:44:56,392 --> 00:44:57,882
don't let me move.

755
00:45:02,502 --> 00:45:03,342
Oh!

756
00:45:04,012 --> 00:45:04,892
The needle's keep moving.

757
00:45:05,612 --> 00:45:06,752
There is some energy here.

758
00:45:08,052 --> 00:45:09,502
Give me your date of birth.

759
00:45:11,692 --> 00:45:15,162
Tuesday, 20 April

760
00:45:15,452 --> 00:45:16,762
in the year of 2004.

761
00:45:17,322 --> 00:45:18,162
What is your time of birth?

762
00:45:18,692 --> 00:45:20,742
It was 6:33 a.m.

763
00:45:20,952 --> 00:45:23,132
Wow, this is so surprising.

764
00:45:24,172 --> 00:45:25,432
Aries!

765
00:45:25,782 --> 00:45:26,802
- Yes.
- Stop.

766
00:45:27,252 --> 00:45:28,092
No more talking.

767
00:45:34,082 --> 00:45:34,922
Eh?

768
00:45:36,279 --> 00:45:37,349
So, Latte.

769
00:45:38,412 --> 00:45:41,412
Are you the same person
who went out with Almond recently?

770
00:45:42,332 --> 00:45:43,172
Yes.

771
00:45:47,552 --> 00:45:49,792
(They are made for each other,
they are destined)

772
00:45:55,892 --> 00:45:56,732
Okay.

773
00:45:58,162 --> 00:45:59,002
It's very good.

774
00:46:00,844 --> 00:46:02,024
I am relieved now.

775
00:46:04,437 --> 00:46:06,887
If Almond lives here and he is happy,

776
00:46:08,712 --> 00:46:11,232
I am okay with it.

777
00:46:12,902 --> 00:46:14,682
I apologize to you too

778
00:46:15,002 --> 00:46:17,142
that I might be bossy to you.

779
00:46:17,982 --> 00:46:18,972
That's why

780
00:46:19,352 --> 00:46:22,342
you lied to me and moved to live here.

781
00:46:23,492 --> 00:46:25,152
I am sorry too that

782
00:46:25,152 --> 00:46:26,592
I lied to you.

783
00:46:32,052 --> 00:46:33,552
I love you, Mom.

784
00:46:33,692 --> 00:46:34,672
Kiss, kiss.

785
00:46:37,172 --> 00:46:39,322
I love you, my child.

786
00:46:40,372 --> 00:46:41,862
Don't ever lie to me again.

787
00:46:41,862 --> 00:46:42,702
Just tell me everything.

788
00:46:42,832 --> 00:46:43,672
Yes,

789
00:46:44,002 --> 00:46:45,192
I will never do it again.

790
00:46:46,612 --> 00:46:48,722
I love you the most.

791
00:46:50,772 --> 00:46:51,902
You have good physiognomy.

792
00:46:52,102 --> 00:46:53,012
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

793
00:46:54,062 --> 00:46:55,012
I am happy now.

794
00:47:02,032 --> 00:47:03,122
Wait for me a moment, Jane.

795
00:47:03,122 --> 00:47:04,812
I will order some work,
then I'll drive you home.

796
00:47:04,812 --> 00:47:05,652
Okay.

797
00:47:13,762 --> 00:47:15,742
Peak, are you okay?

798
00:47:23,272 --> 00:47:24,392
(Thanwa)

799
00:47:26,198 --> 00:47:27,038
Won't you answer the phone?

800
00:47:31,962 --> 00:47:32,802
Why?

801
00:47:33,412 --> 00:47:34,992
Don't you want to talk with him?

802
00:47:35,942 --> 00:47:36,782
I'd rather not.

803
00:47:37,774 --> 00:47:39,804
Thanwa shouldn't suffer from this.

804
00:47:47,512 --> 00:47:48,522
Let's go, Jane.

805
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,170
Peak. I'll go to meet Uncle Wichian.

806
00:47:51,932 --> 00:47:53,912
So, he can lend us some helpers.

807
00:47:54,272 --> 00:47:55,642
You also need to review your wedding plan.

808
00:47:56,912 --> 00:47:57,752
Yes, Dad.

809
00:47:58,642 --> 00:47:59,652
Take care of yourself.

810
00:49:15,462 --> 00:49:16,382
Good morning.

811
00:49:23,172 --> 00:49:24,472
Thanwa, are you really okay?

812
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:26,282
You look distracted.

813
00:49:27,792 --> 00:49:28,902
Peak is not here anymore.

814
00:49:31,442 --> 00:49:32,822
I still cooked for him.

815
00:49:33,332 --> 00:49:35,322
Good morning, children.

816
00:49:35,322 --> 00:49:36,262
Good morning.

817
00:49:37,652 --> 00:49:39,792
Did you cook breakfast for me?

818
00:49:40,182 --> 00:49:43,142
You are such a nice guy.

819
00:49:43,142 --> 00:49:44,822
I bought for everyone.

820
00:49:44,822 --> 00:49:46,932
- Thank you.
- This looks yummy.

821
00:49:49,932 --> 00:49:50,942
Let's eat.

822
00:49:51,332 --> 00:49:52,932
Peak isn't here, so it's not fun at all.

823
00:49:54,865 --> 00:49:57,192
This coming Monday
is a compensatory holiday.

824
00:49:58,332 --> 00:49:59,172
It's a pity

825
00:49:59,812 --> 00:50:01,042
that we can't have a party.

826
00:50:03,446 --> 00:50:04,626
It's a shame,

827
00:50:06,052 --> 00:50:07,592
we all have holidays.

828
00:50:10,972 --> 00:50:11,812
That's right.

829
00:50:12,802 --> 00:50:13,722
It's really a shame.

830
00:50:15,562 --> 00:50:16,442
If we were all together,

831
00:50:17,392 --> 00:50:18,362
it would be good.

832
00:50:21,752 --> 00:50:23,022
Let's go find Peak.

833
00:50:24,322 --> 00:50:25,162
- Yes.
- Yes.

834
00:50:25,722 --> 00:50:27,022
Are you going to party in another province?

835
00:50:27,302 --> 00:50:28,382
Shall I go with you?

836
00:50:29,902 --> 00:50:32,612
Mom, next time. Please.

837
00:50:34,652 --> 00:50:36,512
This is Thanwa's important mission.

838
00:50:37,422 --> 00:50:39,302
I can't have fun with you guys then.

839
00:50:41,092 --> 00:50:41,982
That's all right.

840
00:50:42,892 --> 00:50:44,302
Are you going to see Peak?

841
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:45,632
That's right.

842
00:50:46,562 --> 00:50:48,062
When will you go?

843
00:50:49,362 --> 00:50:50,202
Uh...

844
00:50:50,662 --> 00:50:51,502
Hello?

845
00:50:52,302 --> 00:50:53,142
Is there anyone available?

846
00:50:54,052 --> 00:50:55,182
Send a van urgently.

847
00:50:56,342 --> 00:50:59,532
Yes. That's right. Come here right now.

848
00:51:01,642 --> 00:51:03,892
- All done.
- It's all right, Mom.

849
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:05,282
If Peak

850
00:51:05,662 --> 00:51:07,332
is an important person in your life,

851
00:51:09,372 --> 00:51:10,462
you have to go and find him.

852
00:51:12,052 --> 00:51:13,012
Trust me.

853
00:51:13,602 --> 00:51:15,772
I'm sure he probably needs help.

854
00:51:16,802 --> 00:51:18,172
Look at his father.

855
00:51:18,562 --> 00:51:19,962
I feel so sorry for him.

856
00:51:20,312 --> 00:51:21,842
I don't know
how he could grow up like that.

857
00:51:23,862 --> 00:51:25,162
Is your mom the owner of the tour bus?

858
00:51:26,192 --> 00:51:27,272
She is surly a rich woman.

859
00:51:28,762 --> 00:51:30,062
She always does things impromptu.

860
00:51:30,632 --> 00:51:33,912
She does whatever she wants.

861
00:51:34,662 --> 00:51:37,432
Thank you, Mother Kade. Thank you so much.

862
00:51:39,582 --> 00:51:40,422
It's all right, dear.

863
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,932
The trip to Peak's home. Let's go now.

864
00:51:51,752 --> 00:51:52,692
Mom.

865
00:51:53,372 --> 00:51:54,212
Come on.

866
00:51:58,322 --> 00:52:00,062
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

867
00:52:00,612 --> 00:52:02,242
