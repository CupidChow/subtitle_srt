Calm down.

Calm down, calm down.

12
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,400
It's always me
who is as stupid as a buffalo.

13
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,430
Come on,

14
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,700
don't ever think that way.

15
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,170
Don't compare yourself to a buffalo.

16
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,770
Yes, because buffaloes aren't stupid.

17
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,590
Latte!

18
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:42,000
- Come on.
- I'm just kidding.

19
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:44,100
- It's all right.
- I just want to make you smile.

20
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,270
It's okay, Almond.

21
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,940
We are here for you.

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,600
What the heck?

23
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,480
- What's the matter, Latte?
- What?

24
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,280
Look.

25
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:03,890
What are you watching?

26
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,350
No. Nothing.

27
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:06,660
Cat clips.

28
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,240
- That's right.
- Cat clips.

29
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,330
Male or female cat?

30
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:10,730
- Both of them.
- Yes.

31
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:13,060
- You want to adopt them, right?
- Yes, that's right.

32
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,480
So cute.

(Episode 5)

50
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,430
- Why did you push me?
- Latte!

51
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,970
Did you do something to me last night?

52
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,360
Oh, look at you.

53
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,380
You're so spoiled.

54
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,590
Whose shirt is it?

55
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,950
Give it back, it belongs to Jumper.

56
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,510
I won't give it to you,
what are you going to do?

57
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,920
I will give it back to Jumper.

58
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,760
I won't give it.

59
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,910
If you wan it, try to take it from me.

60
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,540
Hey, Latte, give it back.

61
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,910
No way, no way.

62
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,180
Give it back. You are bad.

63
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,360
Try me, it smells good.

64
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,720
Give it back. Latte! Ouch!

65
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,230
Excuse me.

66
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:09,740
Who are you looking for?

67
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,320
Where is Peak?

68
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:14,210
Hello.

69
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,100
Oh!

70
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,240
Here it is.

71
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,610
Don't sit here. Go!

72
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,760
Everyone,

73
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,510
uh... this is...

74
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,620
Jane.

75
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,950
You told us when you were
at the front of the closet.

76
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,800
Officially,

77
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,180
Jane.

78
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,280
Hello, Jane.

79
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,320
I am Almond.

80
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,470
This is Latte.

81
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,450
This is Thanwa.

82
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,950
We are Peak's housemates.

83
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,670
So you are...

84
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:50,890
She is...

85
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,820
You are...

86
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,400
She is...

87
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,290
You are...

88
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,210
She is...

89
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,110
- You are...
- I am Peak's fiance.

90
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,840
Oh, fiance.

91
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,280
Excuse me, I didn't know.

92
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,400
Am I right, Peak?

93
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,270
Yeah.

94
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,880
Then let me go take a shower
and get dressed.

95
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,750
In case you two need some private talk.

96
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,720
My mom just called me.

97
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:32,930
Excuse me.

98
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,560
What's the matter? I have nothing to do.

99
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:56,930
- I want to know about them.
- Shh!

100
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:03,390
We'll talk right here, right?

101
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,040
Wait.

102
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,440
Do you know where my room is?

103
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,070
I'll follow you.

104
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:23,750
Yes.

105
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,890
Watch your tone when you said "yes".

106
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,960
How did you get here?

107
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:11,920
How did you know I am here?

108
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,780
Have you forgotten about my uncle?

109
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:18,150
It's very easy to find out
someone's whereabouts.

110
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,230
Jane, if you had something,
you could have called first.

111
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:24,800
Would you pick up my call?

112
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,920
I came to clear up the matter
that we left off.

113
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,670
Things that you must take
responsibility for.

114
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,270
I thought we would see them making out.

115
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,710
Instead, we're seeing this tense scene.

116
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,420
Have you figured out
how to solve the problem yet?

117
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,420
It's really hard.

118
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,770
And out of the blue, you just came.

119
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,510
I thought

120
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,150
I already gave you plenty of time.

121
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,700
I don't know what to do.

122
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:02,870
But I am trying.

123
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,340
Please give me more time.

124
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,740
Sure.

125
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,610
But this time, I will be here with you.

126
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,680
What?

127
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,640
Yes.

128
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:17,100
You left me with all the relatives there.

129
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:17,940
You know?

130
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,090
Everyone was nagging every day.

131
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,790
I did not know

132
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,510
how should I answer them.

133
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,940
You ran away, so I ran away too.

134
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,760
Doing this ruins everything.

135
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,070
Then let it ruin both of us.

136
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,040
I also want to know

137
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,630
how fun will it be to run away.

138
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,920
Jane.

139
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:42,870
Please go back.

140
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,590
No way.

141
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:48,050
Jane! How can you stay? Go back.

142
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:49,820
I will stay.

143
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,630
Go back.

144
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:57,740
No!

145
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,080
Just go back.

146
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,540
Go back.

147
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,350
Coming to think about it...

148
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:11,740
I'd rather stay.

149
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,230
- Jane.
- Hm?

150
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,430
- Yes!
- Yes.

151
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,510
Yes.

152
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,130
Ciao.

153
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,220
Let's live together!

154
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,740
Yes.

155
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,500
Almond, why don't you clean here?

156
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,150
All dusty!

157
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,320
Let's clean it.

158
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,200
Can you drop the garbage for me?

159
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,370
If you are good, just come down.

160
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:19,950
All righty.

161
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,760
Latte!

162
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,420
Come on, it's no big deal.

163
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:04,970
It's a big deal.

164
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,010
All the colored-shirts are falling off.

165
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:11,820
No way.

166
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,750
I just bought this shirt
to wear for Jumper.

167
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,940
I just wore it once.

168
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,340
No way.

169
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,940
My little strawberry

170
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,280
didn't survive as well?

171
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:30,990
All right.

172
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:32,500
I will buy you a new one.

173
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:38,450
What's wrong with him?

174
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,600
I helped him do laundry.

175
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,350
Do you really like Jumper that much?

176
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:04,750
Yeah.

177
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,580
He is the only one I really like.

178
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:10,900
Why's that?

179
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:14,900
Well,

180
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,550
since we studied together,

181
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,450
I have never felt that way about others

182
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,150
like the way I feel about Jumper.

183
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:26,390
I want to be near him.

184
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,660
I want to see his face every day.

185
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,250
I want to know what he's doing.

186
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,480
Just thinking about it,

187
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:37,640
my heart is pounding,

188
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:40,640
I feel very happy already.

189
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,440
That much?

190
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,300
Why?

191
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,190
Have you never felt that way about anyone?

192
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,460
You are delirious.
All right, just dry the clothes.

193
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,980
Really? I am not delirious.

194
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,400
If you don't know anything,
you don't have to talk about it, okay?

195
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,830
Are you going to sit here all night?

196
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,660
Yes!

197
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,370
Up to you.

198
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,070
Yes.

199
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,780
(Thanwa)

200
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:26,180
(Father)

201
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:42,900
Yes, Uncle.

202
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,360
I am okay. Don't worry about me.

203
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,220
Uncle, can't you sleep again?

204
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,440
Because of Peak, right?

205
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,150
Peak is really bad.

206
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,720
He likes to make you worry all the time.

207
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,350
But don't worry,

208
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:05,740
I will take care of him.

209
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,250
You can trust me.

210
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,130
You go to bed now.

211
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:15,990
Have a sweet dream.

212
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:18,140
All right, bye.

213
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,360
Peak.

214
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,200
Jane.

215
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:31,530
Hi.

216
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,800
Peak.

217
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,270
Peak.

218
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,020
Peak.

219
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,110
Peak.

220
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:11,970
Peak.

221
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,020
Peak.

222
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,610
Peak. Peak. Peak. Peak.

223
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:24,740
Peak. Peak. Peak. Peak.

224
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,780
Peak. Peak. Peak. Peak. Peak.

225
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:41,810
What the heck!

226
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,870
- Ouch!
- Peak, you just wash the dishes.

227
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,270
Otherwise, Jane would wake up.

228
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,850
She would wake up because of you.

229
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,210
Lower your voice.

230
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:52,330
That's all right, I already woke up.

231
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,730
I was just making breakfast.

232
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:56,780
Jane, do you want to eat together?

233
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,420
Or you want to eat something special?

234
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,460
That's okay.
I'd like to take a shower first.

235
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:04,790
Close the door too,
there are too many mosquitoes.

236
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,770
Yes, because of Peak.

237
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:07,760
Because of you.

238
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,020
I am doing good.

239
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,100
You don't have to come here.

240
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,800
Hello? Hello?

241
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,110
Bad signal, Mom. That's it for now.

242
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:36,320
It's always me.

243
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,350
Woo!

244
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,400
Latte.

245
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:45,200
The alarm clock doesn't help.

246
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:57,070
Your luck for relationship is not good
this year.

247
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,880
Be careful with Aries people.

248
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,410
There is a birthmark
underneath the clothes.

249
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:02,540
And he has high sex drive.

250
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:06,960
This time, I have to find it.

251
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,540
Hi, Almond.

252
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,310
Is my dragon big for you?

253
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:56,550
You're crazy!

254
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,960
That's not a dragon.

255
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,990
It's just an earthworm.

256
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,910
Let's go to the class.

257
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,050
Or we will be late.

258
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,390
Where would I sit?

259
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,870
You can sit at the head of the table.

260
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,160
Breakfast is already ready.

261
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,430
Here's a coffee for you.

262
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,470
Jane usually doesn't eat breakfast.

263
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:42,240
Are you talking via a psychic?

264
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,820
I'm hungry,
otherwise I'll get to eat first.

265
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,730
Sorry, but usually

266
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:48,780
Jane doesn't eat breakfast.

267
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,620
I do eat now.

268
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,440
I like having breakfast the most.

269
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:09,480
My dragon is truly real.

270
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,610
Oh, have you guys finished yet?

271
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:13,980
- Yes.
- Not yet.

272
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:15,290
Oh!

273
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,870
Come and sit down, breakfast is ready.

274
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,060
Hurry up, eat while it's still hot.

275
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,320
Come on.

276
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,310
I think

277
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:42,880
I will have breakfast at university.

278
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:45,480
Right, Latte?

279
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,130
Yes.

280
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,860
I want to have steamed rice
topped with chicken and fried eggs.

281
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,590
Bye.

282
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,350
Ah, I will go to work now.

283
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:14,650
Same here.

284
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:16,410
It's okay.

285
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,750
Leave it here, I will wash it for you.

286
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,290
No, I will do it.

287
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:20,130
It's fine.

288
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:22,850
- I'll wash it myself.
- Well, it's all right.

289
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:25,100
You look like lovers who live
in the same house.

290
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,760
Jane.

291
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,090
Just teasing.

292
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:31,120
Both of you leave them here.
I will wash them.

293
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,770
I get to eat for free and sleep for free.

294
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,950
Thanwa is a good chef.

295
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:56,880
Thanks, Jane.

296
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,520
I am glad you like my food.

297
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,670
You are the most dependable person
in the house.

298
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:03,820
Not at all.

299
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:06,630
I must rely on everyone's help too.

300
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:13,900
Peak is so useless.

301
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:16,230
Really?

302
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:20,190
I think Peak has his own expertise.

303
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,250
When it comes to solving IT tasks,

304
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,660
he is good at it.

305
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,530
All done.

306
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,150
I will go out to meet friends.

307
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,440
Thanks for breakfast.

308
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,290
Yeah, okay.

309
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:41,960
Next time, tell me
what you want to eat.

310
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,760
Okay, thank you. Bye.

311
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:56,740
(Max)

312
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,620
Jumper.

313
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,520
Oh, what's up, guys?

314
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,890
How are you guys doing?

315
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,770
How about you?
What do you remember?

316
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,440
I remember everything.

317
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,210
That night was fun.

318
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:16,130
Yes.

319
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:17,860
Yes.

320
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:20,530
You and I had the most fun.

321
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,990
Just rolling in the bedroom.

322
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:27,040
Oh, Almond, I left my clothes
at your house, right?

323
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:28,660
Bring them back to me, would you?

324
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,350
Okay, I will bring them to you.

325
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,190
Thank you.

326
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:34,930
It's so good.

327
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,290
Where do we find them... Ouch!

328
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,020
What are you looking at, Lookpeach?

329
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,540
All X-poeple.

330
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:50,520
They share clips where
the lovers make out in university.

331
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,690
Those people

332
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:54,610
are the worst.

333
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:59,550
This is our university, right?

334
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:00,900
Yes.

335
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,800
That's right.

336
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,110
Right.

337
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,160
Class will begin soon.

338
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:08,370
- Shall we go now?
- Yeah.

339
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,610
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

340
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:10,770
Let's go.

341
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:12,570
Okay.

342
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,290
Which building?

343
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,040
Follow me.

344
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:22,940
"Knock Knock, Boys!"

345
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,640
You eat first.

346
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:34,890
I ordered it for you.

347
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,280
Cappuccino.

348
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,130
This is your favorite.

349
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:40,650
I remember it.

350
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,340
It's okay. I've already eaten.

351
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,670
And I don't think there's any need to talk.

352
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,600
Wow.

353
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:52,310
You're so mean to me.

354
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,420
How are you doing?

355
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:55,670
We haven't seen each other for so long.

356
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,260
Are you doing okay?

357
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,290
Yes.

358
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,660
Do you have anything?

359
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:04,210
What are you doing around here?
Suddenly you wanted to meet me.

360
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,680
Oh...

361
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,910
I came to work in this area.

362
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:10,020
And I remembered that
Thanwa moved to this area too.

363
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:11,880
So I asked you to have coffee with me.

364
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,790
It's better to get to the point, Max.

365
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,320
You want to meet me,

366
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,130
because you want me
to give you a chance, right?

367
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:24,030
That's right.

368
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,160
Well...

369
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,850
Thanwa,

370
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:29,730
I am sorry.

371
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,310
I've realized my mistake.

372
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,530
I promise I'll be a better person.

373
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:39,150
Thanwa, come back to live with me.

374
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:46,310
Do you still miss it?

375
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,380
Memories of the past

376
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,880
between us.

377
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:57,080
I think I will excuse myself.

378
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,540
Thanwa.

379
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,810
If there's anything,
you can always call me.

380
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:26,110
I am sorry, I went to meet my adviser.

381
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:26,950
Sorry, everyone.

382
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,200
That's alright, Latte.

383
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,260
Okay, everyone.

384
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,800
Let's begin now.

385
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,940
Today we will talk about “Consent”.

386
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,990
Consent literally means "agree to do".

387
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:38,990
Consent

388
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,410
is not just one-sided.

389
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:43,500
It has to be agreed by both sides.

390
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:44,710
Lately,

391
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,480
there have been a lot of leaked clips.

392
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,660
Some of you have probably
seen them already.

393
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:50,570
I want to tell everyone that

394
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:52,600
consent is not just about sex

395
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:55,240
or about sexual orientation.

396
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,230
It includes asking for permission
to film clips of each other as well.

397
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,450
Like clips on the news channel

398
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:03,200
where we should censor people's faces.

399
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,540
If we don't ask whether he consents,
is that right?

400
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,500
Yes,

401
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,130
this is very important

402
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:10,200
but a lot of times people don't consider it.

403
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,290
We thought we could do it,
and we thought it would be okay.

404
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,410
But actually it isn't okay at all.

405
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,060
What are you doing?

406
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:43,230
It was dirty, so I wiped it clean.

407
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:44,370
Really?

408
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:47,470
Why?

409
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:51,370
Nothing, it was newly bought.
How come it got dirty?

410
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:54,940
It's quite soft.

411
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,430
I thought dildo

412
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,800
is quite interesting.

413
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:16,510
Crazy!

414
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,420
I just want to touch it.

415
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,010
Oh, really?

416
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,620
Really!

417
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,740
Oh...

418
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:29,070
You go home first, all right?

419
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,270
I am going to do some warm-up.

420
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,000
So, tonight

421
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,210
I have a party.

422
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,020
Going to a party?

423
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:42,880
Yes.

424
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:49,240
Well, if you have something more fun to do,

425
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:51,710
I might not go.

426
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,670
Feel free to do whatever you want.

427
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:04,930
He is so strong!

428
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:12,770
Peak.

429
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:14,700
Why are you sleeping here?

430
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:16,520
And where is Jane?

431
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:18,830
Jane?

432
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:23,980
She was sleeping in my room.

433
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,100
So, I slept on the couch.

434
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:28,970
Then you go and sleep in my room,
it will be more comfortable.

435
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:31,250
So, are you sleeping on the couch?

436
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:34,540
I mean you go and sleep with me
in my room.

437
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,760
Sleep with you?

438
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,470
Yes, let's go.

439
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,880
Or you want to sleep here all night
and feed the mosquitoes.

440
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,050
I am fine with it.

441
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,430
Oh, wait for me.

442
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:47,270
Come on.

443
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:48,900
Thanwa.

444
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,620
- Wait for me.
- Come on.

445
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,970
Umm, you... I...

446
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:07,360
Just sleep and do nothing else.

447
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:15,500
I wanna thank you
for letting me sleep with you.

448
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,220
That's okay.

449
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,900
Well, about Jane,

450
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,300
what are you going to do with her?

451
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:38,200
Me and Jane have already agreed
not to tell anyone about this.

452
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,390
Because in the end,

453
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:45,690
the two of us must go back there
and deal with this matter.

454
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,540
Yeah.

455
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,920
I can feel it.

456
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:56,070
But now it's me who isn't ready to go back.

457
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,870
I also don't know when I will be ready.

458
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:10,450
What's wrong with you?

459
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,840
Nothing.

460
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,590
Just get some sleep.
I have a job interview tomorrow morning.

461
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,210
You have a job interview, right?

462
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,100
Fighting!

463
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:08,480
What's wrong with you?

464
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,550
You should brush your teeth first.

465
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,320
I will get dressed.

466
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,580
Hello?

467
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:48,910
Where are you?

468
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:50,220
Where did you go so early?

469
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,860
My mom went to see me,

470
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,500
so I came to meet her.

471
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,370
So, you didn't tell me anything.

472
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:00,950
It's my mom who came, not your mom.

473
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:02,240
That's all.

474
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,580
Can I help you?

475
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:13,820
That would be good.

476
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,390
What's up, young man?

477
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,330
Ah, it just happened...

478
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,420
This one?

479
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,600
(From Mystery Reviewing Team)

480
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:55,180
Hello, are you free?

481
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,090
Let's eat.

482
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,130
Why did you get something
to eat near my office?

483
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:07,080
Nothing. I had to review the food.

484
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:08,650
So, I came here.

485
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,740
Oh.

486
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,800
I have another job.
I work as an anonymous reviewer.

487
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:17,890
I have to keep reviewing food
at any restaurants.

488
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:20,060
There are various food.

489
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,030
An anonymous reviewer.

490
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,430
The name looks cool.

491
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:27,310
Do you make a lot of money?

492
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,000
My income?

493
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,480
Not much.

494
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:33,240
But I can try a lot of food.

495
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:35,880
There were food that I liked
and there were food that I didn't like.

496
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,430
It suits you.

497
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:42,950
- Oh, Peak.
- Yeah.

498
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,960
I have something to consult you.

499
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,310
If you have to choose between

500
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:52,090
a job you love and a stable job,

501
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,490
what would you choose?

502
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,230
Why?

503
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:58,030
I think I can't be a freelancer
to find contents

504
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:59,610
for my senior like this for long.

505
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,570
With this anonymous review job,

506
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:03,220
the money isn't enough.

507
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,160
If it was me,

508
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:12,890
I'd live a life for what I love.

509
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,530
It's my ultimate dream.

510
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,730
So, you are not afraid to completely fail?

511
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,380
I am afraid.

512
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:27,450
But

513
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,440
if I love that thing enough,

514
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,900
it may worth a try, right?

515
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:47,350
When you want something and don't get it,

516
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:51,470
you can't get it out of your head.

517
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:54,730
That's true.

518
00:38:58,670 --> 00:38:59,510
Having said that,

519
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:03,020
just don't do something

520
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,210
that you will regret later.

521
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:40,080
So, you came back?

522
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:41,630
You scared me, Latte.

523
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,070
How have you been with your mother?

524
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,870
Well, it was good. Nothing much.

525
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:51,950
No!
So, is that a souvenir?

526
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:55,710
What?

527
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,160
I just want to help you carry it.

528
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,540
I can carry it myself, it's my stuff.

529
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,450
You're so possessive.

530
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:03,050
- No.
- Give it to me.

531
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,480
- No, it's mine.
- Give it to me.

532
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,430
- No.
- Come on.

533
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:06,950
He is gone!

534
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,800
He is gone?

535
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:12,120
Buffalo turns.

536
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:15,980
He is gone! Buffalo turns.

537
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,910
Oh!

538
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:21,130
You can trick me now.

539
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,070
Almond, did you just call my name?

540
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,000
Almond, is there something wrong with you?

541
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,830
Why did you come into my room?

542
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:52,460
If I hadn't come in, I wouldn't see...

543
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:53,940
that you are about to...

544
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,610
Get out, Latte.

545
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,560
Why did you come in?

546
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:06,850
Oh...

547
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,330
If you don't know how to use it properly,

548
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,350
let me teach you.

549
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,400
Just get out.

550
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:16,490
Get out now!

551
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:31,890
Yes, Uncle,

552
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:33,490
I haven't found him yet.

553
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:36,760
I tried to look for different places
where Peak might go.

554
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,820
- Peak! Did you get dressed yet?
- But I couldn't find him...

555
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,860
- Will you...
- Quiet.

556
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:43,050
No, it's not him.

557
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:46,130
You probably miss Peak so much,
so your ears are ringing.

558
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:47,940
I will find him for you.

559
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:49,690
So, Peak is kissing Thanwa.

560
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:54,020
Your ears are definitely ringing, Uncle.

561
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,850
I will find him as soon as possible.

562
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:58,530
Okay, that's all. Bye.

563
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:03,200
You should call your father sometime.

564
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:05,920
I am sorry.

565
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,200
I will go out now.

566
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:11,960
Um, Jane?

567
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,190
- Are you going out?
- Yes.

568
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,170
Can you give me a ride?

569
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:16,010
Of course.

570
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:18,020
Let's go.

571
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:21,940
Peak.

572
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,670
I got another anonymous review job.
I want you to come with me, would you come?

573
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:26,350
Fine.

574
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:27,900
Let's go then.

575
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:41,740
Hello?

576
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:43,070
Where did you go?
Why didn't you tell me?

577
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:45,100
Because you are bad luck.

578
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,910
I don't want you to ruin my golden moment.

579
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:49,650
I will return Jumper's clothes.

580
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:52,070
So, you lied to me and went out alone.

581
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,240
All right, at the sports center, right?

582
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:57,050
I will come to see you now.

583
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:58,610
No need to come, that's all.

584
00:44:09,370 --> 00:44:10,440
Almond, what are you doing here?

585
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:11,730
Oh, Ben,

586
00:44:12,370 --> 00:44:14,210
I came here to meet Jumper.

587
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:16,300
Today, we finished practicing early.

588
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:18,050
Coach had something urgent to do.

589
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:20,500
Um, I think they all have gone.

590
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:21,780
All right.

591
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:25,090
But Jumper always
takes the longest shower.

592
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:26,780
He may still be here.

593
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:29,890
You can go and check out
the locker room there.

594
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:33,130
Okay, thank you so much.

595
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,670
Don't tease me.

596
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,070
You look so teasing.

597
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:13,830
You called me here

598
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:15,460
because of this?

599
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:18,680
Yes.

600
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:54,210
What's wrong with you, Almond?

601
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:55,580
- Sit down now.
- Okay.

602
00:45:56,510 --> 00:45:57,350
Come here.

603
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,450
Easy, easy.

604
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:01,860
Let me help take off his bag.

605
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:03,980
Lift your arms.

606
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:08,460
Latte, what's wrong with Almond?
Why is he in a bad shape?

607
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,030
I really don't know.

608
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:11,580
He called me all of a sudden

609
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:13,830
to pick him up from the sports center.

610
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:16,060
After that,

611
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:18,160
he became like this.

612
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:24,550
Almond.

613
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:30,230
I saw Jumper and Shawn...

614
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:34,520
They were kissing each other.

615
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:42,810
- Can I be of any help?
- Oh, uh...

616
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,090
Sorry for my bad manners.

617
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:47,450
Come on.

618
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:49,510
You are so mean with your girlfriend.

619
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,630
Oh, it's not.

620
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,050
Just a friend.

621
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:54,320
So, you go there quite often.

622
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:56,350
Oh, almost every Saturday.

623
00:46:56,350 --> 00:46:57,280
I go there whenever I have time.

624
00:46:57,950 --> 00:46:58,880
What time?

625
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:00,210
- Shawn.
- Hm?

626
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:03,060
He wants to invite us to Saturday's party.

627
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,270
All righty.

628
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:06,550
Peak.

629
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:07,390
What?

630
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:08,620
See you on Saturday.

631
00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:14,910
Go home.

632
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,630
Let's go home.

633
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:17,800
Come on.

634
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:19,130
We're leaving now.

635
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:20,370
Go home safely.

636
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:26,960
So, I'll see you at the gym
in the evening, right?

637
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:28,490
Yes.

638
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:30,160
Hi, Shawn.

639
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:31,430
How are you?

640
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:33,260
- How long have you been waiting?
- Not that long.

641
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:35,030
Thank you.

642
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,430
Let's go.

643
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:43,360
So, this means...

644
00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:46,160
Jumper is dating Shawn.

645
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:52,000
It's okay, it's okay.

646
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:58,250
It's always me
who is as stupid as a buffalo.

647
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,870
Oh, don't think about yourself that way.

648
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:04,020
That's right.
Don't say you are like a buffalo.

649
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:06,340
Buffalo is not stupid.

650
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:07,960
Latte.

651
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:11,460
- Sorry, I am just kidding.
- Don't cry.

652
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,120
- It's gonna be okay.
- I just want to make you smile.

653
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:17,900
We are here for you.

654
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:25,470
What the heck?

655
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:28,340
What's the matter, Latte?

656
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:33,970
What are you looking at?

657
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:35,400
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

658
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,670
- Cat clips.
- Cat clips.

659
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:38,280
- Cat clips.
- That's right.

660
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,120
Male or female cat?

661
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:40,840
Both of them.

662
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:42,370
They are so cute, right? I want to...

663
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:44,490
- You want to adopt them, right?
- Yes, that's right.

664
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:48,860
So cute.

665
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:50,440
Oh, that's...

666
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:59,000
(Inside university's toilet,
love is blossoming)

667
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,510
Did...

668
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:05,470
Did you film that clip?

669
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:08,340
Don't say that.

670
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,160
