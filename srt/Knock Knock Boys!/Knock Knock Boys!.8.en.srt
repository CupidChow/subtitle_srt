10
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:26,850
This is the room.

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,830
Shall we go in now?

12
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:29,950
Wait,

13
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:30,970
calm down.

14
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,840
Maybe the culprit is in this room.

15
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:36,320
And if he opens the door,
what will we do?

16
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:37,900
Just punch him.

17
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,230
I agree.

18
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:46,730

00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,010
Latte.

36
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:32,240
Wake up now.

37
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,080
You are going to be late.

38
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,180
Come on, quick.

39
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:50,740
Hello, Mom.

40
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,100
Almond,

41
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,430
let's have some breakfast.

42
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,180
Fire!

43
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,360
- Fire! Fire!
- Is there a fire?

44
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,470
- Get out of the house now!
- Fire!

45
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,220
Fire! There's a fire!

46
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,270
- Please help...
- No!

47
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,360
Where is it? What should I do?

48
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,160
You need to run out of the house.

49
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,510
Oh! Eggs!

50
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,710
Oh! Eggs!

51
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,590
My eggs!

52
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,540
Argh! Hot! Hot! Hot!

53
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,300
Almond, where are you?

54
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,020
Where are you now?

55
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,290
Hello, hello, tell me now.

56
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,550
Did you run out of the house?

57
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,040
It's all right, Mom.

58
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,490
It was just a fire drill at the condo.

59
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,190
I have to go now.

60
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:44,650
Finished.

61
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,080
I tried my best.

62
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,320
Our fried eggs didn't survive.

63
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,030
My eggs almost didn't survive this morning.

64
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,680
What should I do, Peak?

65
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,330
There's probably only one way.

66
00:04:24,282 --> 00:04:25,952
Don't tell me that you will...

67
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:35,610
I will order food.

68
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,740
Come on, let's eat together.

69
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,030
We are saved now.

70
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,260
This is not delicious at all.

71
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,380
Too salty.

72
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,130
I cannot die like this.

73
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,820
I miss you so much, Thanwa.

74
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,460
Just give me one more chance.

75
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,480
- No.
- No.

76
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:40,450
Never.

77
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,530
Thanwa!

78
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:01,610
Oh,

79
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,390
so where is my breakfast?

80
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,150
If you want to eat, pay for it.

81
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,110
So,

82
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,890
can I pay in another way?

83
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,920
No,

84
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:18,830
I said I am staying with you temporarily.

85
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,120
When I get my salary,

86
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:21,740
I will move out immediately.

87
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,760
In conclusion,

88
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,230
we are not getting back together, right?

89
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:35,150
I just couldn't find a new rental house,
so I moved out first.

90
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,370
Did you do that to show
Peak that you are not happy?

91
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,080
This is my business.

92
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,320
(Latte_Almond)
We are hungry.

93
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,170
Are you hungry?

94
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,140
Shall I cook for you?

95
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:15,530
It's all right, Mom.

96
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,810
I already bought my breakfast.

97
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,130
Is there any update?

98
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:43,780
Here.

99
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,180
The image from the security camera.

100
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,950
The culprit was fully dressed.

101
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,710
I can only see the mobile phone case.

102
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,210
Have you ever seen this?

103
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,960
This.

104
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,080
What I know is

105
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:58,332
it seems like a secret hidden camera gang,

106
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:59,900
doing it in a systematic way.

107
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,500
They put hidden cameras in the restrooms
of department stores,

108
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,270
universities, and various outdoor spots.

109
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,430
Did you ask Peak?

110
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,260
Not yet.

111
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,090
He has been so lifeless at home

112
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,670
since Thanwa moved out.

113
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:12,970
Shall I talk to him?

114
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,970
That would be nice, just try it.

115
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:18,800
Almond,

116
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,020
you want to help us

117
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:24,090
because you want to prove
that you are innocent, right?

118
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,870
Actually, yes.

119
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,010
But it's not as important as

120
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,390
you being my friend.

121
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,530
Friends have to help each other.

122
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,300
Thank you so much.

123
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,550
I am sorry, Almond.

124
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,710
And also, sorry, Latte.

125
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,320
I scolded both of you.

126
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,460
It's all right, Jumper.

127
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,920
I understand.

128
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,290
I understand too.

129
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,230
Thanks.

130
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,470
It's all right.

131
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,740
Wait.

132
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,320
Let's just say

133
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,700
we catch the culprit first

134
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,820
and then we'll sort things out.

135
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:16,940
Have you done your work?

136
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,370
Let's have some sausage.

137
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:20,310
It's wrinkled now.

138
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:51,060
(Thanwa: I want to eat it every day.
(It's so delicious!)

139
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:56,450
Why do you like crispy pork so much?

140
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,440
When I was a young, my mom sent me to stay
with Grandma during every school break.

141
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,720
Grandma would make crispy pork
with her special recipe for me.

142
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,190
A crispy skin, soft inside and not oily.

143
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,110
Since my grandma passed away,

144
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:12,500
I couldn't find a crispy pork shop
that is as delicious as Grandma's

145
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,680
until I found this place.

146
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:47,380
(Sis Hui)

147
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,230
Well,

148
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,830
are you reviewing food here?

149
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,700
No, I just want to eat, so I came here.

150
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,380
Why are you here?

151
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,070
Well,

152
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,270
I don't know what to eat,

153
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,480
so I was thinking about...

154
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,970
Did you two come together?

155
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:13,490
- No.
- No.

156
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,080
This table is available,
can you both sit together?

157
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,180
- Yes.
- Yes.

158
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:45,890
What are you having?

159
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:48,280
I want basil crispy pork rice
with special fried eggs.

160
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,100
I want the same.

161
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,780
Same dish, right?

162
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,260
Okay.

163
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,370
Here you go.

164
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:04,470
Thank you.

165
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,510
All right.

166
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:07,250
- Sis.
- Sis.

167
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:09,170
Yes?

168
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,520
- A glass of water, please.
- A glass of water, please.

169
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,420
Okay.

170
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,870
Let me help you.

171
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:25,670
Here you go.

172
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,750
Wait. Why are you in such a hurry?

173
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,480
Eat slowly.

174
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:55,490
Do what I have taught you.

175
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,720
Grass jelly.

176
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,140
Thank you.

177
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,520
Don't you want to have grass jelly too?

178
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,130
No,

179
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,840
it's okay for me.

180
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,080
Sis, check please.

181
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:50,330
Check, please.

182
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,590
Have you finished eating yet?
Why are you in such a hurry?

183
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,290
All right, I will be quick.

184
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,660
I will finish this bowl soon.

185
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,580
Do you want to pay separately,
or pay together?

186
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,070
- Together.
- Separately.

187
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,540
That's okay. Today, let me...

188
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,100
Hey, Peak.

189
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,810
Peak. Peak.

190
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,860
So, you will pay all, right?

191
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:18,060
Oh, right. May I scan for payment?

192
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,640
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

193
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,480
Peak.

194
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:37,300
Next time, don't eat too fast.

195
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,960
You might have died.

196
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,580
Thank you.

197
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,390
That's okay.

198
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,490
This meal is on me.

199
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,440
My friend.

200
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,640
A friend.

201
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,030
Okay, I have to go now.

202
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:07,930
Wait up.

203
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:10,830
What?

204
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,140
That is my bag.

205
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:21,610
Hey.

206
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,620
Don't forget to answer your line chat,
Latte and Almond are worried about you.

207
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,110
Hello, Shawn.

208
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:42,740
Do you wanna go to the fitness center
today? I have something to discuss with you.

209
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:43,780
Okay.

210
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:47,010
All right.

211
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:48,410
See you later.

212
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:05,960
That's about the clip.

213
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,270
Do we have any way to investigate?

214
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:11,670
Can we find out from

215
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:12,980
that IP address?

216
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,370
Actually,

217
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:21,740
only internet service companies
can access IP addresses.

218
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:24,330
And to get that information,

219
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,830
we must report it to the police
to issue the warrant to that company.

220
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,040
- But...
- But what?

221
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:39,150
Actually, there's a way to do it.

222
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,670
If luck is on our side.

223
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,470
Thanwa, come in.

224
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,660
Yes.

225
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,610
I will come in later.

226
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:51,600
- Okay.
- Thank you.

227
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,420
Hello, Kit.

228
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,960
Hello, Thanwa.

229
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,400
The food reviewer that I have chosen

230
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,520
for the screen test

231
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:04,670
just ditched the job today.

232
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,180
He did this too many times.

233
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,080
My boss ditched him already.

234
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,260
He is fired.

235
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,410
Now the position is vacant.

236
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,220
I actually don't have to call you,

237
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:18,120
because you probably have got a new job.

238
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,010
But I think this is a great opportunity,

239
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:24,490
and this job has a

240
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,040
three month probation period.

241
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,090
You need to sign a contract every 6 months.

242
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:29,870
Do you want to do it?

243
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,490
I am sorry to keep you waiting.

244
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,610
That's all right.

245
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,830
Okay. How is it going?
Do you think you can do it?

246
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:48,040
I was very excited at first.

247
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,280
I still feel not sure about it.

248
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,950
But actually,

249
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:54,340
I feel that you did
not study in this major.

250
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,760
But I want to see your effort.

251
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,980
So I want you to try it.

252
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,250
Actually, it's like what I have said.

253
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,780
The purchasing dept has to work...

254
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,940
But I think this is a great opportunity,

255
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,570
you need to do the screen test today.

256
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:12,410
Right now.

257
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,710
It must be today, right?

258
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,250
You have to decide today.

259
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,500
Thanwa.

260
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:26,880
Thanwa.

261
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,050
Do you understand what I just said?

262
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,500
Thanwa. Are you still listening?

263
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,530
Oh, yes.

264
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,160
So let's start work today.

265
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,000
- Yes.
- Okay.

266
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,600
That's all. I have to go now.

267
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,520
- Thank you.
- If you need anything, contact Oui.

268
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,920
- Yes.
- Okay. Thank you.

269
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,350
- Thank you.
- Bye.

270
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,630
- All right.
- Bye.

271
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,120
Is that him?

272
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,030
I am so annoyed.

273
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,610
That's all right. Let them be.

274
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:10,060
Peak is investigating
some information, right?

275
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,840
Yes.

276
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,930
But he said it was quite dark.

277
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,360
So he didn't tell me much.

278
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,550
Darn!

279
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,900
I don't think Peak has that side of him.

280
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,630
Unlike you,

281
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,100
who is completely dark.

282
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,990
That's right, the innocent boy.

283
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,300
Latte.

284
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,280
You started it first.

285
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,580
Come on.

286
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,140
You guys always fight with each other.

287
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,630
Almond and Latte.

288
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,040
It serves him right.

289
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,690
Instead of him talking to Peak,

290
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,130
Shawn had to talk to him.

291
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,670
Peak looks more like a zombie now,
who dares to talk to him?

292
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,500
(Peak is calling)

293
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,340
Speak of the devil.

294
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:45,780
He is calling now.

295
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,130
He must have known.

296
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:48,730
Hello, Peak.

297
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:50,750
All right.

298
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:51,970
See you.

299
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,020
What did he say?

300
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,020
He said we will meet him at the house.

301
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:58,790
I think he might have got some
important information from the culprit.

302
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:00,120
- Yes.
- All right.

303
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,240
We will know who he is very soon.

304
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:04,440
Darn. I am so excited.

305
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:06,580
"Knock Knock, Boys!"

306
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,720
(STUDIO 1)

307
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:12,110
Is the fire setting okay?

308
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,120
Let's start when ready.
What are you waiting for?

309
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,820
Please wait for my guy.

310
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:19,130
Wait.

311
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:20,430
He hasn't come in yet?

312
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,430
It's not time yet.

313
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,650
So, the whole production crew
needs to wait for him, right?

314
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,820
Yes, but it won't be long.

315
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,030
Look, Kit.

316
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:34,330
To be honest,

317
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,470
will your guy really come on time?

318
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,800
Yes, he will.

319
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,400
He is a fighter.

320
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,830
If he is not good...

321
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,980
He is very good, trust me.

322
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:49,210
He really wants this job.

323
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:51,270
But he is not here yet.

324
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:52,490
He will be here soon.

325
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,550
I will call him now.

326
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:03,480
Kit, is that your guy?

327
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:04,700
Hey, Thanwa.

328
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:06,860
Are you ready?

329
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,540
You are already ready, let's go.

330
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,450
Ready.

331
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,630
Here, here. Just stand here.

332
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,430
- Ready now.
- All right.

333
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,930
- Are you okay?
- I am okay.

334
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:16,770
I am ready.

335
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,450
Do your best.
I really want you to get this job.

336
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:19,290
All right.

337
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,860
If I get this job, I'll take you
to a luxurious shabu shop.

338
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,700
You said it.

339
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,860
- Hey, Kit.
- Yes.

340
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,150
- Get out of frame.
- Okay.

341
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,120
- Keep fighting.
- All right.

342
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,270
Ready?

343
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,250
Ready, everyone? Let's do it.

344
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,805
- Ready.
- Do you have any questions before we start?

345
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:29,670
No, sir.

346
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:31,746
Camera ready? Fire setting ready?

347
00:23:32,115 --> 00:23:32,955
Record now.

348
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:33,830
Go!

349
00:23:33,855 --> 00:23:35,825
Hello, everyone. I am Thanwa.

350
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,310
I will take you to taste

351
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:39,480
and review food in the same time.

352
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,330
Today, we have three dishes.

353
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:43,460
Spicy boiled pork sausage salad,
spaghetti and steak.

354
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,630
All three dishes

355
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,320
that we have carefully selected.

356
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,970
Besides, these three dishes

357
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,790
have a history of more than 40 years.

358
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,200
I want everyone to try it

359
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,300
and I can tell you that,

360
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,580
"Just one bite and you'll be hooked,
the second bite and you'll love it."

361
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,560
- Oh.
- He is doing great.

362
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,750
The price is affordable, not too expensive.

363
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:03,160
Please go out and taste it.

364
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,080
What do you think?

365
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,950
- Kit.
- How is my guy?

366
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,350
- Your guy, right?
- Yes.

367
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,700
He is so good.

368
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,540
Am I right?

369
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,170
- Kit, thank you very much.
- All right.

370
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:14,380
I found a diamond in the rough.

371
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,380
Really, did you find it?

372
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,100
Just let go of me.

373
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,440
This is great. Bravo.

374
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,120
You are awesome.

375
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,720
- Okay. That's great.
- Thank you so much.

376
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,320
So, prop-man, bring the spicy pork
sausage salad to the set.

377
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,470
So, he can see the picture.

378
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:28,320
- Yes.
- Let's roll, one more take.

379
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:39,280
Our first dish today is the
spicy pork sausage salad.

380
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,620
Please come in.

381
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,320
- This is unreal.
- This is awesome.

382
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,220
This was your first time

383
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,510
but you were so amazing.

384
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,900
Thanks so much.

385
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,100
This is unbelieveable.

386
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,020
Why do you want to be a food reviewer?

387
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,160
Well, I like food.

388
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,620
And it would be very good
if we could do what we like.

389
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:15,490
Besides,

390
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:18,060
if we say this dish is delicious,
and people want to taste it,

391
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,360
it would be very nice.

392
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:24,210
This is good.

393
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,660
- I love your mindset.
- This is very good.

394
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,700
Do you have any recommendations?

395
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,430
Recommended dishes?

396
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:33,540
Crispy pork at Sis Hui's shop.

397
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,090
Crispy pork at Sis Hui's shop.

398
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:37,460
It was reviewed on our page.

399
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,300
That's right.

400
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:41,390
Thanwa did that content.
It was also his first review.

401
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,270
Did you actually do that?

402
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,190
He is awesome.

403
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:47,590
So, what do you think?
Is he good or what?

404
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,960
How about we give him
three months probation period?

405
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,320
No.

406
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,760
I'll give him one year.

407
00:25:59,010 --> 00:25:59,850
What?

408
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:00,920
What?

409
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,670
Shall we sign the contract now?

410
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,780
He is so good, we can't sign him
for just three months.

411
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,000
We have to give him a one-year contract.

412
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,330
Oh, wow. I am happy for you.

413
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:08,590
- Okay?
- Okay.

414
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:09,590
Next week,

415
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,810
you come to sign the contract
so that we can start working.

416
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,090
That means I am hired, right?

417
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:15,040
That's right.

418
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,480
Or you want a probation period?

419
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,520
No, no. It's all right, Nick.

420
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,480
Okay, then.

421
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,430
- Deal?
- Deal, sir.

422
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:22,000
Excellent. Ouch!

423
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,840
I'll hit it.

424
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,820
- Don't hurt my bro!
- Darn it.

425
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,030
It's all right now, Nick.

426
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:28,430
- Take care of him for me. He is so good.
- Yes, sir.

427
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:30,280
- Thank you, Nick.
- That's all right. I am leaving now.

428
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,520
All right, I'll take it from here.

429
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,510
How abou that? You are awesome.

430
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,300
- Thanks so much.
- He is a very nice guy.

431
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,360
- Oh! Wait!
- What's going on?

432
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,030
- I forgot my ipad.
- Okay.

433
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,710
- All right, bro.
- I am off now.

434
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:45,060
- You can do it.
- Yes.

435
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:48,130
- That's my boy!
- Yeah!

436
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:50,400
I was so excited.

437
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:52,530
Congratulations.

438
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:54,430
I am so grateful to you.

439
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:55,460
If it weren't for you,

440
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,750
I wouldn't have gotten this job.

441
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,590
No problem.

442
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,600
Don't forget that luxury shabu.

443
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,030
Calm down, I haven't signed a contract yet.

444
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,710
You're already asking for
a debt of gratitude. Oh man!

445
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:05,100
You are ungrateful.

446
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,510
But really,

447
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,670
I thought you have accepted
that purchasing job.

448
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:10,810
I thought about it at first.

449
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,590
I won't ask you why
you changed your mind.

450
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:15,210
If you ask me again,

451
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,740
I will treat you to street food

452
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,770
instead of luxury shabu.

453
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:19,080
I am just kidding.

454
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:21,230
I am off to work now,

455
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,700
just update me via line chat.

456
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,810
- See you.
- Yes.

457
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,030
Hey, bro.

458
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,450
- Your office is here.
- Oh, really.

459
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:28,460
- You just want to go home.
- I want to go home soon.

460
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,420
I am going home for you then.

461
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,840
- I miss my kids.
- Come on.

462
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,430
- See you, Thanwa.
- See you.

463
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,640
(Peak)

464
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:51,590
Hi, guys.

465
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,660
Thanwa.

466
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,300
Hey, hey!

467
00:27:58,090 --> 00:27:59,460
I've got a job

468
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,860
as a food reviewer.
I'll sign a contract next week.

469
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,430
(Almond: Congrats)

470
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:05,930
You are awesome.

471
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,110
I miss you.

472
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:11,060
I want to eat the food cooked by Thanwa.

473
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,730
Let's meet for dinner.

474
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,980
Okay. Make an appointment.
I have to go.

475
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:28,880
Okay.

476
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:33,660
Hey, hurry up and make an appointment.
I want to see you.

477
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,390
Don't you read the line chat?

478
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,110
Look here.

479
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,360
There is a leaked clip again.

480
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,360
In a department store's
restroom near the university.

481
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,770
Darn it!

482
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,350
Hey, Jumper.

483
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,140
It's not from him.

484
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,900
Not from him, what?

485
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:56,410
Oh!

486
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:58,720
Why don't you tell me
you would come back?

487
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,740
Oh, why would I have to tell you?

488
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:03,820
I may ask you to order some food.

489
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,070
What do you want to eat?
My treat.

490
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:09,420
Wow,

491
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,170
you said that.

492
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,910
It means your first day at work
went well.

493
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:15,820
Yeah.

494
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,920
Do you want to go out
or order food to eat here?

495
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:22,820
Order food then.

496
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:24,940
I want to spend more time with you.

497
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:27,830
Okay.

498
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,750
Just order what you want to eat,
I will pay for it.

499
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,870
All right, just send it now.
Okay.

500
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:41,310
How is it going?

501
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,720
We have two types of information.

502
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,920
We got a phone number
and that account's email.

503
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:51,630
I will forward them to you.

504
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:52,910
All right.

505
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,000
What should we do with
this email and phone number?

506
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,700
Found it!

507
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,900
At topic number 2809.

508
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:06,430
Comments on the post mentioned
"condo rental".

509
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:08,260
It's not far away.

510
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:09,370
Look.

511
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,330
There's the room owner's phone number.

512
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,150
Do you want me to call now?

513
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:15,820
Okay.

514
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,240
I'll wash it myself.

515
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,150
You go clean up something else first.

516
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:33,130
What's wrong with you, Max?

517
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:36,490
Let's do it.

518
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,320
- I'm fully prepared.
- Max!

519
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:42,020
I told you that
I just wanted to share the house.

520
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,790
We sleep separately and nothing else.

521
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:46,930
We already set the rules.

522
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:48,870
But we're lovers.

523
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,220
We used to be.

524
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,770
Even if it's not,

525
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,910
we can find happiness together.

526
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,940
Because I know that
we have to make ourselves happy.

527
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,020
Let's do it, Thanwa.

528
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,280
- I can't resist anymore.
- Max!

529
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,700
I am leaving this place right now

530
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,500
if you keep doing this.

531
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:08,210
Come on, Thanwa.

532
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,330
You know, I'll do what I said.

533
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,160
When I said we broke up, I meant it.

534
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:20,120
Okay, okay.

535
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:22,770
It's up to you now.

536
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,100
I am sorry.

537
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:56,470
Are you sure it's here?

538
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:58,590
Yes,

539
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,910
the address says it's here.

540
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:02,340
Thanks to Shawn

541
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,480
who called to trick the room owner
so that we got the room number.

542
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,880
So how do we get to the condo?

543
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,280
Hello?

544
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,030
Yes, I am here.

545
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:15,610
Okay.

546
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:25,970
Hello, everyone.

547
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,850
- Hello.
- Hello.

548
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:29,850
Hi, bro.

549
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:31,080
How are you, Latte?
It's been a long time.

550
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,220
I am doing good.

551
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,690
Your arm has more muscle now.

552
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:35,110
- Just a bit.
- Fitness?

553
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,980
Oh, can we get in now?

554
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:39,130
Yes, you can.

555
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,740
Follow me.

556
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,710
Let's go, everyone.

557
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:43,720
Let's go then.

558
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:44,730
Come on.

559
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,670
I haven't seen you for a long time.

560
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:49,920
All right.

561
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,320
Is he Latte's senior?

562
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:52,710
Maybe.

563
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:56,820
Seniors, juniors,
friends all over the place.

564
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:09,380
Oh!

565
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,300
Why did you pack your things?

566
00:34:13,252 --> 00:34:15,092
I will move out today, anyway.

567
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:18,280
You said you'd move out
when you get your first salary.

568
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,100
Because of yesterday's incident, right?

569
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,620
So, thank you very much, Max.

570
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:28,050
Thank you.

571
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:32,890
Wait up.

572
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,230
You haven't paid for the room yet.

573
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,050
Don't worry.

574
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,880
Once I get my salary,
I will transfer the rent to you.

575
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,580
I don't mean money.

576
00:34:47,325 --> 00:34:48,265
What do you mean?

577
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,380
I think...

578
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,980
You know already

579
00:34:58,290 --> 00:34:59,310
what I mean.

580
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,940
I think I clearly said that to you,

581
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,900
I will not give that to you.

582
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:07,730
You can.

583
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,680
You can always give it to me.

584
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:15,030
Max, stop.

585
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:16,820
Stop now, Max. Stop.

586
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,990
Let go off me.

587
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,170
Damn you!

588
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,060
Don't make me hate you even more.

589
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:23,820
- If you hate me,
- Let go of me.

590
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,940
you wouldn't have
moved back to live with me.

591
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:46,980
Oh!

592
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,320
Why didn't you tell me
you would come back?

593
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,340
Oh, why would I have to tell you?

594
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:06,660
Thanwa.

595
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,590
What the heck are you doing
in my room?

596
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:19,070
Get out now, all of you.

597
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:20,490
If you don't go,

598
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:23,320
I'll call security to take you out.

599
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:28,390
Darn it!

600
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,020
Let's go, Thanwa.

601
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,230
Where are you going?

602
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:39,590
Thanwa, we're hunting down the culprit
who secretly filmed Jumper and Shawn.

603
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,490
So, the information that we got is

604
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,480
the culprit is in this room.

605
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,570
You tricked me once,

606
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,660
why did you come back to deceive me again?

607
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,260
Do you think I am such a fool?

608
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:02,010
Do you guys have any evidence?

609
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:02,950
Why did you blame me?

610
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,790
You still need the evidence, darn you!

611
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:11,930
- Do you need this?
- Jumper, wait for the police.

612
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:14,380
You are really bad. You ruined me.

613
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,630
Latte, call the security.

614
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,240
Okay.

615
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,060
Come quickly, we are waiting.

616
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:15,480
The police will come
and collect evidence in this room.

617
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,480
Shall we wait outside?

618
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,000
Just bring him out too.

619
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,410
Not only did you move in with him,

620
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,250
you also protected him.

621
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:12,900
Do you love him that much?

622
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:27,240
