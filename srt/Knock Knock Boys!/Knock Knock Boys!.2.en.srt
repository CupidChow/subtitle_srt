Nothing.

12
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,250
There's something.

13
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,150
I see you sitting there like
you're in a music video.

14
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,380
I am just thinking idly.

15
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,030
In a good way or bad way?

16
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:55,760
Why do you look at my lips?

17
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,650
Because they're kissable?

"Knock Knock, Boys!"
(Episode 2)

34
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,250
Why are you in a hurry
this morning?

35
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,480
Well...

36
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,730
There is some problem
with the customer's website.

37
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,030
This is our big customer.
My boss is in a panic.

38
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,050
He called for an emergency meeting.

39
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,360
Just do it slowly.

40
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,390
Yes, Mom.

41
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,640
I am okay.

42
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,770
I am quite excited,

43
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,090
this is my first day in university.

44
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:12,680
It's good that you are okay.

45
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,560
Why do I hear the alarm clock?

46
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,020
Just make it silent.

47
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:21,210
Is the wall so thin like that?

48
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,600
I have to complain
with the Housing Estate.

49
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,690
People these days do not know
how to be considerate.

50
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,930
That alarm clock was too loud.

51
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:33,530
Almond.

52
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,980
Almond, are you there?

53
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:36,990
Yes, I am.

54
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:39,840
What's that noise?

55
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,530
Does my mobile have a problem again?

56
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,190
I just bought this expensive thing.

57
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,860
It doesn't work again like this.

58
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,280
Oh.

59
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,580
I am watching cute dogs' clips.

60
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,200
They are just making some noise.

61
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,750
Is there anything else, Mom?

62
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,090
Last Saturday,

63
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,850
Aunt Rassami took me to meet
a fortuneteller.

64
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,860
This one is very popular.

65
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,160
Your aunt booked for me
one month in advance.

66
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,340
At first,

67
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,320
we were not sure
if we could be in the queue.

68
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,420
But I am blessed

69
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,760
so I could meet him.

70
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,370
That's right, Mom.

71
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,720
Hello.

72
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:31,980
What is it?

73
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,200
All right.

74
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,840
Okay, I will be there.

75
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,690
Yes, that's right.

76
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,720
So, I told this with you.

77
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,920
Thanks so much, Mom.

78
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,920
You are so kind for asking
the fortuneteller to predict my fortune.

79
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,020
So, what time you have to
go to university?

80
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,720
I have to go now.

81
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,030
Let's talk later, I love you, Mom.

82
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,570
Latte, let's take a shower.

83
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,870
- Quick.
- I want to eat.

84
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,580
(KNOCK KNOCK house)

85
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,950
Quick!

86
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,990
We are running late.

87
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,620
We will make it on time.

88
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,130
Hi. Hello.

89
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,530
Don't forget the house key.

90
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,490
- I forgot the key.
- Grab one for me.

91
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:15,590
Why didn't you warn me?

92
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,560
Well...

93
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:18,940
He always complains.

94
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,600
You can't upload files.

95
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,350
Did you clear all the caches?

96
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:26,860
All right.

97
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,620
If you find any problem,

98
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,640
you can call me anytime.

99
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,260
Thank you.

100
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,950
Is it done?

101
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,050
Not yet.

102
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,940
I have to go to my office.

103
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,670
My job is busier than I expected.

104
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,570
Okay, just eat these sausages.

105
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,540
It's wrinkled now.

106
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,340
Come on.

107
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:56,700
Do you need any sauce?

108
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,440
Yes.

109
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,250
Just eat and then work.

110
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,850
Just eat slowly.

111
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:37,810
What?

112
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,030
Well...

113
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,540
I wiped your mouth.

114
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,320
Um...

115
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:48,610
Thanks.

116
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,340
More sausages?

117
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,330
No.

118
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,980
We came on time.

119
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,080
I told you we would make it.

120
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,630
If I didn't rush you, we would be late.

121
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,890
I have to wake you up,
and drag you here.

122
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,920
Otherwise,
you have to reapply for this subject.

123
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,780
Yes.

124
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,230
You are a good guy.

125
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:35,000
I wish you get everything
for your good deeds.

126
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,290
There.

127
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,130
Sit here.

128
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:00,530
Hey, Mond.

129
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,690
Latte.

130
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,090
This is such a coincidence.

131
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,170
Do you take this class?

132
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:25,900
Yes.

133
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:29,490
I didn't know Jumper
is in this class too.

134
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,730
Ah, Jumper.

135
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,370
Your high school friend
that you told us, right?

136
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:38,710
I am Latte.

137
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,320
I am his housemate.

138
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,560
We just rent the same house.

139
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,840
- Alright.
- Yes.

140
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:51,980
Did you come alone?

141
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,790
Oh, at first my friend would come.

142
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,650
But he went to linguistic class.

143
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,840
So, you sit with us.

144
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,680
Okay.

145
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,290
How are you recently?

146
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,480
I am fine.

147
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,560
Good, I will sit with you then.

148
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:14,830
You also came late.

149
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,400
I have many things to do.

150
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,540
Lucky that
Professor is not here yet.

151
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,900
Right, bro?

152
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,040
Yep.

153
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,310
Welcome to

154
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,020
Human Relation Class.

155
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,830
This is the subject
that is true to the name.

156
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:38,710
I want every student

157
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,420
to get to know each other.

158
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:44,050
I will start at the front row here,

159
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,370
count one, two, then switch.

160
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:47,730
One.

161
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,110
Two.

162
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,040
One.

163
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,170
Two.

164
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,290
One.

165
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,240
Two.

166
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,540
One.

167
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:55,860
Two.

168
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:58,160
Who got number two?
Please show me your hands.

169
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:01,440
Okay, for those who got number two,

170
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,140
you will get to know the person
who got number one,

171
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:07,470
who is on...

172
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,300
your left side.

173
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,540
Come on, baby.

174
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,040
I want you all

175
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,120
to ask for general information.

176
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,280
You will ask 10 questions.

177
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,620
And write down the answers.

178
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,480
I will give you 10 minutes.

179
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,320
Start now.

180
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,300
Do you need to ask me anything?

181
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,350
What is your birthday date?

182
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,320
Tuesday, 20 April, 2547.

183
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,650
Time of birth, 6.33 a.m.

184
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,660
If you give such details,

185
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:50,960
tell me your zodiac now.

186
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,120
Aries.

187
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,900
Aries?

188
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,590
You have bad luck this year

189
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,090
in relationships.

190
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:01,000
Be careful of Aries men.

191
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,520
He has a mark underneath.

192
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,920
He also has high sex drive.

193
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,700
He will bring bad luck to you.

194
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,840
Yes.

195
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,270
You can remember, right?

196
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,550
Just repeat it for me.

197
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,190
I remember.

198
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,880
Aries guy.

199
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,120
He has a mark underneath.

200
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,720
He also has high sex drive.

201
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,670
What are you mumbling?

202
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,310
What the heck?

203
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,050
What?

204
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,380
What's wrong, Almond?

205
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,090
What's wrong?

206
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,710
Nothing.

207
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,480
Where are we?

208
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,780
Aries.

209
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,330
Really?

210
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,380
Yes, Aries.

211
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,680
Aries.

212
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:41,840
Okay.

213
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,270
What's wrong with you?

214
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:21,200
Will you sleep on this couch?

215
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,260
Thanwa.

216
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,390
Will you sleep on this couch?

217
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:33,430
Everyone sleeps on this couch.

218
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,780
Why?

219
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,520
Nothing.

220
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:47,170
I think this couch is comfortable.

221
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,770
I think you might never sleep on that.

222
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,640
Really?

223
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,760
I think

224
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,820
I will go to the office and then work out.

225
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,880
Will you have lunch here?

226
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,570
I will have lunch at the office
on KT Avenue.

227
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:10,530
I have a discount for employees
who work in that building.

228
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,190
This is good.
You are lucky to have a full-time job.

229
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,000
But at least,

230
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,310
you have free time to go
whatever you want to do.

231
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,000
If you get a job,

232
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,500
you may not have time to do that.

233
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:30,070
Yes, it has a good side.
But I have no income.

234
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,660
Everything has its pros and cons.

235
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,190
Bye then.

236
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:38,610
- Pete.
- Hm?

237
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,010
Your shorts look cool.

238
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,490
I'll get changed.

239
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,780
Where are my trousers?

240
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,540
Over there.

241
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,670
About the content today,

242
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,000
we'll end it for now.

243
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,080
Class dismissed.

244
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:13,850
Here, help me.

245
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,250
Where are you going next?

246
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,080
I will go have lunch.

247
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,650
I will meet my friend at the cafeteria.

248
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,400
Will you join us?

249
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,240
- Then we'll eat...
- Hey.

250
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,720
We have to meet our mentor.

251
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:33,070
Really?

252
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,250
At 12.30 p.m.

253
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,780
Never mind.

254
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,930
Let's take a rain check.

255
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,200
See you later.

256
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,260
See you.

257
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:42,100
Bye.

258
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,130
I have no chance again.

259
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,770
You will meet him next class.

260
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,270
Shall we go now?

261
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,560
Let's go.

262
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,510
Whose purse is it? Jumper's purse?

263
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,840
Gift voucher Onsen.

264
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,850
Jumper, you dropped your purse.

265
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,050
Latte.

266
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,060
Okay, I am sorry.

267
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,990
I booked the wrong date.

268
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,520
But I remembered the time.

269
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:40,210
I missed the chance to have lunch
with him because of you.

270
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:42,090
You are a jinx.

271
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,590
That's a bit too much.

272
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,320
If it weren't because of you,

273
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,420
why would I be here?

274
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,380
So, I am responsible for
your life now?

275
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,720
Stop, stop.

276
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,220
Almond,

277
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,860
stop being such a cry baby.

278
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,860
You are grown up.

279
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,290
Bla, bla, bla, bla, bla.

280
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,610
I won't listen.

281
00:15:58,610 --> 00:15:59,570
Latte.

282
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,640
Hi, Lukpeach.

283
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:04,040
Lukkaew said you changed
to Communication Arts.

284
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,710
I didn't think I'd see you here.

285
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,490
Yep, this is a coincidence.

286
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,720
Oh, this is Almond.

287
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,910
He studies in the same faculty.
This is Lukpeach.

288
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,770
- Are you two...
- Oh...

289
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,400
Latte is my sister's friend
before we changed faculties.

290
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,290
So, why are you here?

291
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:31,810
I applied at the club
in the next building.

292
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:34,360
After the class finished,
I came to apply, it was full quickly.

293
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,200
Are you in that
Human relationship class?

294
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,750
- Which period?
- Period 7.

295
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:41,050
You are at period 7,
we are at period 4.

296
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,510
Are you two studying together?

297
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,490
Everyone does that.

298
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:48,810
Why did you apply for the club?
It's a waste of time.

299
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,390
There are students
from different faculties,

300
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,700
you may like it.

301
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,160
Really?

302
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,700
Shall we go for lunch?

303
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,970
Jumper.

304
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,420
Hey, may I go with you?

305
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,690
Okay. Where to?

306
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:00,760
What about at

307
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:04,080
Liberal Arts?
Sticky rice with fried chicken.

308
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,760
This one is so good.

309
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,510
- Very yummy.
- Let's go.

310
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,700
I haven't seen you for a long time.

311
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:11,970
Yes.

312
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,250
That table first.

313
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:19,570
- Mom, table 1, crispy pork.
- Crispy pork.

314
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:20,780
Can you have that?

315
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,810
I'll order that.

316
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:26,410
- Mom, crispy pork, please.
- Two for that table.

317
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,720
We have free drinks, serve yourself.

318
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,500
Special crispy pork.

319
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:31,660
Run by order.

320
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,730
(Sis Hui)

321
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,170
Can I help you?

322
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,220
Crispy pork.

323
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,560
Mon, we need more.

324
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,540
Hurry up.

325
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,360
- Just wait.
- (Krit wants to brief work.)

326
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,850
The restroom is at the back.

327
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:44,140
Sit, please. We will take the order.

328
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:46,170
Table 3 is available.

329
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,680
This one, right?

330
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:55,900
Thank you.

331
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,120
Table 1, Chinese sausage.

332
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,460
Wait a minute.

333
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,640
Crispy Kraprao special.

334
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,180
- Crispy fried egg too.
- I need sweet black sauce.

335
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,140
Crispy fried egg, right?
Wait a second.

336
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,040
Kraprao and fried egg, special.

337
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,380
- He needs it crispy.
- Get the black sweet sauce for me.

338
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,440
Which table?

339
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,570
Over there.

340
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,120
- They have it.
- (Chat at the shop)

341
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,650
Are you at the shop?

342
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,120
(Continue chatting)

343
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,070
Yes, it's crowded.

344
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:19,490
Okay.

345
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,410
Get all the information.

346
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:24,010
Follow the brief, so we can review.

347
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:25,310
Okay.

348
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:27,370
The crispy pork looks yummy.

349
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,540
- Okay, eat and get the information.
- Can I help you?

350
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,100
- Alright then.
- Mom, table 2 too.

351
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,000
He needs soup.

352
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,010
- Table 5, go.
- Table 5.

353
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,800
Jumper.

354
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,360
I need a table for 2.

355
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,570
Please sit with table 3.

356
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,980
Here it is.

357
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,600
Okay.

358
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:05,850
This is for the guy at table 3.

359
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:06,900
What do you want to order?

360
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,800
Two crispy pork with rice.

361
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,660
Okay.

362
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,210
Mom, two crispy pork with rice,
table 3.

363
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,300
- Don't forget to serve it.
- Okay.

364
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,850
- Here is your kraprao and fried egg.
- Thanks.

365
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:21,100
- Mom, what's next?
- Crispy pork with rice.

366
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,120
(Oh, no, that's a lot.)

367
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:28,530
(It doesn't look yummy.)

368
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:30,680
(Just try it.)

369
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:03,180
(This is real crispy pork.)

370
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:08,330
(Meats are juicy.)

371
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,860
(Not too dry.)

372
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,630
(Pork skins are very crispy.)

373
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,290
(Not oily.)

374
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,030
(Kraprao tastes so good.)

375
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,000
(Not too salty,
cut with some sweetness.)

376
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,920
(With the right spiciness
and not too wet.)

377
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:28,040
(The crispy fired egg is correct.)

378
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,530
I thought I would go back for a nap.

379
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:38,220
I have no class this afternoon.

380
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:42,180
So, we'll see you
at the gym this evening.

381
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,290
Yes, right.

382
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,360
There is a new Mala opened.

383
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,310
How many new shops
replaced the old one now?

384
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:49,820
Quite many.

385
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,130
Bad Feng Shui maybe?

386
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,840
The shops there are all closed.

387
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,660
But KT Avenue

388
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,580
still got the pay rent.

389
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:02,560
KT Avenue.

390
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,970
It sounds familiar.

391
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,480
Register for the discount
for KT Avenue

392
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,920
is all done.

393
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,440
If you are interested in

394
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,730
Yoga class, pilates or special classes,

395
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:20,360
you can inform me.

396
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,110
Yes.

397
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:25,990
And where is the changing room?

398
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,270
This way, sir.

399
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,900
You just walk there,

400
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,130
all clothes and equipment
are at the counter.

401
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:34,130
The locker is on the right side.

402
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,170
- Okay.
- Yes.

403
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,440
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

404
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,350
Hi, here you are.

405
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,800
Help me, please, Krit.

406
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,440
Park here.

407
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,800
Do you want it?

408
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,700
I will send it to you by noon.

409
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,330
Alright, don't worry.

410
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,340
I took the photo
and wrote down the details.

411
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:58,450
I have to go now.

412
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,720
Thanks, Krit.

413
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:09,820
"Knock Knock, Boys!"

414
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,050
Please show your ID card.

415
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,330
I forgot to bring it
and I am in a hurry to get my stuff.

416
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:24,750
You can call your friend
to pick you up.

417
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,580
But everyone is working from home.

418
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,640
I need to get my stuff.

419
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,920
Please contact the front desk.

420
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,760
Thank you.

421
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:03,420
(Where did I see that?)

422
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,420
Am I... good enough?

423
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,660
Yes.

424
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,230
You look at my muscles.

425
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,740
I'm sorry for being rude.

426
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,510
It's alright.

427
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:21,960
No need to worry.

428
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,410
Are you new here?

429
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,570
I just moved in here.

430
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:30,410
So, I applied for
the gym membership here.

431
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,510
Will you work out with me?

432
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,810
You save me, I save you.

433
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:36,930
We take turns.

434
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:51,120
May I help you?

435
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,070
I want to go to Fitness Fire upstairs.

436
00:23:54,050 --> 00:24:00,390
Fitness Fire is on floor...

437
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:01,870
20th floor.

438
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:05,870
20th floor, right?

439
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,880
Yes.

440
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:12,250
Which company?

441
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,780
Oh, AOOP Company.

442
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,870
AEFG, HIJK.

443
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:21,730
AKND. AELOU.

444
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:24,260
This is so random.

445
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:40,410
What shall I do?

446
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,570
Ha!

447
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:49,080
You are doing good.

448
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:51,830
I safe you.

449
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,520
- Ha!
- Wait a minute.

450
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,130
Huh...

451
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,710
What's up?

452
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:06,620
Hello. What are you doing?

453
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,020
At the gym.

454
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:11,660
Really?

455
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:15,780
Can you go down to pick me up?

456
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:17,910
What are you doing exactly?

457
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,550
I am exercising.

458
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,410
Just go down and pick me.
It won't take long.

459
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,630
You have to wait until 7 p.m.

460
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:30,760
Just go down. It won't take long.

461
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,730
No, you just wait.

462
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,840
Okay, I will wait here.

463
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,540
What's wrong with him?

464
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,710
Well,

465
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,770
you are so mean to your boyfriend.

466
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,770
No, he is not.

467
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,210
Just a friend.

468
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:49,350
Come on.

469
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,260
Come on,

470
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,100
another set.

471
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:52,770
I save you.

472
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,630
Are you alright?

473
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:56,580
I am good.

474
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,170
- Ready?
- Ready and safe.

475
00:25:58,170 --> 00:25:59,910
- Three, two, one.
- Ha!

476
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:04,510
A little more.

477
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,300
Go up all the way.

478
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,230
What is it?

479
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,400
(Exit)

480
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:02,480
(Fitness Fire)

481
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,040
Where are you going?

482
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,500
Please.

483
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:19,720
What the heck?

484
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,190
What the heck?

485
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:40,810
I almost got in.

486
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,600
(Thanwa)

487
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,800
(Thanwa)

488
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,580
How are you feeling?

489
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,450
It's good.

490
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:12,310
Will you exercise
the back area tomorrow?

491
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,440
Okay, I will help you.

492
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,650
All right. See you after class.

493
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:16,060
- All right.
- See you Jumper, See you Shawn.

494
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,050
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

495
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:17,600
Bye.

496
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,360
Hey, Pete.

497
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,920
Is he your friend?

498
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,560
Well...

499
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,380
I met him at the gym.

500
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:32,410
What is his name?

501
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,580
What's wrong with you?

502
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,400
Jumper and Chon.

503
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,730
What did you talk to Jumper about?

504
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:40,450
Why did you ask so much?

505
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,850
Why did you wait for me here?

506
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,900
Seriously, you don't know
why I was here.

507
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:51,880
I am here for Jumper.

508
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:53,450
What?

509
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,750
Jumper, Almond likes him.

510
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,350
- Oh, that Jumper.
- Right.

511
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,430
That's why he looks familiar.

512
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:06,410
Did you get any info?

513
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:09,290
You came all the way here
just to ask me this?

514
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,270
That's right.

515
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,890
For 1 year free rental.

516
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,250
You are too serious, man.

517
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,560
Anyway, you come close to him now,

518
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,000
will you join forces with me?

519
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,000
That's alright.

520
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,080
Okay.

521
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,400
We need to find out what he likes.

522
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,400
What he likes, meaning...

523
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,960
He likes boys or girls.

524
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,280
What is his taste?

525
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,040
I agree with you.

526
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,040
What if he likes girls?

527
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,680
We will tell Almond to give up.

528
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,760
If he likes boys,
Almond will have a chance.

529
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,480
We have a deal now.

530
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,760
Deal.

531
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,440
Deal.

532
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,080
Deal.

533
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,360
Deal.

534
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,840
What's wrong?

535
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,400
Nothing.

536
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,800
There's something.

537
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,960
I see you sitting there like
you're in a music video.

538
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,600
I am thinking idly.

539
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,280
In a good way or bad way?

540
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,320
Hey, why do you look at my lips?

541
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,480
They're kissable.

542
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,960
I don't want to kiss you.

543
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,360
How can you be so sure?

544
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,800
You may not give me a light kiss,

545
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,920
but a deep kiss.

546
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,720
No way.

547
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,720
Oh, you hurt me.

548
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,640
Anyway,

549
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,640
your mouth is kissable.

550
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,840
Then kiss me.

551
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,520
I will seriously do it.

552
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,440
I am just kidding.

553
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,080
Just kidding.

554
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,040
But you said my mouth is kissable.

555
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,680
What kiss? Too many people are here.

556
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,280
Hey.

557
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,040
What are you guys talking about?

558
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,600
Come over there.

559
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,200
Quick.

560
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,200
I think we should summarize
this week's mission.

561
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:10,040
The Almond's cherry pop mission.

562
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,240
Interesting.

563
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,840
I want to know if anyone
is making progress.

564
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,480
Almond and Latte,

565
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,920
any updates on this?

566
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,200
You're both in the same subject
with Jumper, right?

567
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,840
Well...

568
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,840
Is this Jumper's Onsen card?

569
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,160
I will return it to him.

570
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,320
Why?

571
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,840
- There is no need.
- Why?

572
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,560
You just take this chance,

573
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,880
and do the mission.

574
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,160
What mission?

575
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,560
A cherry pop's mission.

576
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,960
Wow,

577
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,040
it sounds interesting.

578
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,600
Anything I can help with?

579
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,560
It's alright.

580
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,520
No need.

581
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,400
Because this mission

582
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,760
is NC18+.

583
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,480
Is that much?

584
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,240
Yes.

585
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,000
May I get wet with you?

586
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,800
Sure.

587
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,360
Your first time?

588
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,720
Yes.

589
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,200
So, is this okay

590
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,880
if I be your first?

591
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,640
Um...

592
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,160
So, are you okay?

593
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,000
I will prove it with a kiss

594
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,720
to see if

595
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,960
you are really okay.

596
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,840
There is not much progress.

597
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,280
There are a lot of group reports.

598
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,760
So we don't have much free time.

599
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,880
Latte, come on.

600
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,760
Oh,

601
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,360
don't worry.

602
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,080
I will help you.

603
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,560
You just prepare the money for me.

604
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,360
Hey, Latte.

605
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:40,160
This is the real group work,
not that kind of group work.

606
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,320
Oh, if this is a group work,

607
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,720
may I join too?

608
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,560
Your first time?

609
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,400
I have never done this before.

610
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:02,680
Is it okay?

611
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,680
You will let me be your first, right?

612
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,200
Um...

613
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,520
If it's Jumper, I won't let him.

614
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,320
Do you mind if I join too?

615
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,080
Oh, I am just kidding.

616
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,480
You don't want me to join
but you keep quiet.

617
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,080
Let's say, you need to make me
have some meals with Jumper.

618
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,760
Hit him some more, go on.

619
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,800
Okay, what about you guys?
Any info now?

620
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,360
Do you still go to the gym?

621
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,120
Oh...

622
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,120
Can I talk?

623
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,920
I feel disappointed.

624
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,520
I collect the points
and I can get in for free.

625
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,040
Can you ask for the new card
and get him to sign?

626
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,360
He has the info.

627
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,240
I used my student status for a discount.

628
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,760
So, all the points are in that card.

629
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,360
So, you went there often.

630
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,440
Almost every Saturday.

631
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,320
What time did you go there?

632
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,240
Around 7-8 p.m.

633
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,320
Interesting.

634
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,920
Will you go there next time?

635
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,720
I might go.

636
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,400
I want to clear the card.

637
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,560
Are you coming too?

638
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,680
Me?

639
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,680
I went to the gym with Jumper.

640
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,120
I had a little chit-chat.

641
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,160
Usually, he has his routine
and goes to the gym.

642
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,800
What about you Thanwa?
What did you get?

643
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,160
Me?

644
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,280
Well...

645
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,080
This Sat, tonight 8 pm.

646
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,880
Cute spa onsen and sauna Bangkok.

647
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,240
Is the info confirmed?

648
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,720
100%.

649
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,480
Okay.

650
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,680
I was just focus
on looking for a job.

651
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,720
Besides,

652
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,160
I am the only one in this group

653
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,000
who still doesn't have a chance
to meet Jumper.

654
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,040
Come on.

655
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,880
Don't be sad, bro.

656
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,680
If I win,

657
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,040
I will buy A5 wagyu beef
for you to cook.

658
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,720
I am the biggest disadvantage here.

659
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,240
Whatever.

660
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,000
At least, every piece of info

661
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,320
will make Almond

662
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,800
get closer to the guy he likes.

663
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,840
I have an idea,

664
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,480
we will celebrate

665
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,360
our progress on this mission.

666
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,320
Come on.

667
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,720
Cheers!

668
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,480
Hello, Mom.

669
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,240
I am fine.

670
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,800
I had breakfast already.

671
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,840
What kind of noise again?

672
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,280
Is this from my mobile or yours?

673
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,560
Condo has a fire drill.

674
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,400
What?

675
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,720
Do you have to do that too?

676
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,680
I do, it's almost done now.

677
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,680
Fire drills must be done often.

678
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,480
So, it's quite noisy.

679
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,760
Is the drill finished?

680
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,280
Yes, Mom.

681
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,120
Good.

682
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,960
Don't get involved with the person
that the fortuneteller warned you about.

683
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,840
You must remember.

684
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,720
I remember.

685
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,600
The Aries guy,

686
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,840
he has a mark underneath

687
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,560
and he has high sex drive.

688
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,680
You are good.

689
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,400
I have to go to uni.

690
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,280
Love you, Mom.

691
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,120
