we really doing this?

12
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,370
It's not bad, right?

13
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,380
Bad or not,

14
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,920
try asking that person first.

15
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,570

"Knock Knock, Boys!"
(Episode 3)

32
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,760
Hey, do you have anything to eat?

33
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,900
Shoot! Smells so good.

34
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,240
What is in there?

35
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,610
It's about to finish.
Let's have a look.

36
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:30,000
- Oh!
- Oh! Is there anything?

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,370
That! Go get milk for me.

38
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,810
Oh, okay.

39
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,220
Do you want a spoon?

40
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,850
Yes, I do.

41
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,900
What do you want?

42
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,280
Both of them.

43
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:57,670
Super.

44
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,720
Hello, mom.

45
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,460
I'm good.

46
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,950
Yes, I already ate.

47
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:09,950
Oh, what's the sound again, honey?

48
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,110
Is it your phone or mine this time?

49
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,840
There is a fire drill at the condo.

50
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,040
And do you have to do that with them?

51
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,920
Yes, I do. I'm almost done now.

52
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,820
They have doing it a lot recently.

53
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,770
So I'm a bit busy mom.

54
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,300
Should we tell him
about the alarm clock?

55
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,230
Almond will do that himself.

56
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,450
Is it finished, honey?

57
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:43,960
Yes, mom.

58
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,800
It's good.

59
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,660
The rest is to just not mess with the
people the fortune teller warned you about.

60
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,590
You have to remember exactly.

61
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,490
Yes, I do.

62
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,580
Aries men who have a
birthmark under their clothes

63
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,320
and have a high sexual drive.

64
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,380
Very good.

65
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,220
I've got to go to school.

66
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:00,090
I love you, mom.

67
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:00,930
Kiss, kiss.

68
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:58,550
Oh!

69
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,100
Wake up now!

70
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,350
You have to wake up now!

71
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,670
Why do I have to always wake you up?

72
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,100
How about the alarm clock?

73
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,870
What's wrong with you?

74
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,940
Why are you mad so early?

75
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,100
Hurry to take a shower.
You'll be late.

76
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,400
Go.

77
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:13,700
You're so smelly.

78
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,270
Your body.

79
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,090
What is he talking about?
I'm not smelly.

80
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,600
Oh.

81
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,430
It's good that birds poop on you.

82
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,290
They said it brought good luck.

83
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:04,870
What good luck?

84
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,210
I came early in the morning,

85
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,180
thinking I'd meet Jumper.

86
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,260
But then I came across
a bird that pooped on me.

87
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:13,720
And today,

88
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:17,350
Jumper is taking leave to go to
the athlete auditions at the university.

89
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,320
So I had to write
down the lecture for him.

90
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,900
Here it is.

91
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,680
It's a good thing,

92
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,280
so you can have a couple moment.

93
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,150
Like...

94
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,050
holding hands,

95
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:35,330
gazing into each other's eyes

96
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,120
and then

97
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,370
kiss.

98
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,240
Leave me alone.

99
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,750
I get bad luck when
I'm with you every time.

100
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,710
Oh, you blame me every time.

101
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,790
Did you clean it all?

102
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,800
Hi, Latte. Almond.

103
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,250
Hey, how can you be here, Peach?

104
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,110
You miss me?

105
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,810
You will see me this afternoon.

106
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,390
I've moved my section.

107
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,040
Hey, why?

108
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,440
I think it should be
fun to learn with you guys.

109
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,370
You moved alone?

110
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,350
Um, I'm not that serious.

111
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,500
I'm just moved to find my inspiration.

112
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,170
Inspiration?

113
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,530
Inspiration.

114
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,660
Um, it's good that you've moved here.

115
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,090
Right?

116
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,070
Right?

117
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,230
Right?

118
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,460
To find inspiration.

119
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,380
What?

120
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,100
I know why you moved here.

121
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,560
All right, let's continue the class.

122
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:54,820
Class dismissed.

123
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,280
So, you can go with me this afternoon?

124
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,920
Yes, we have an appointment.

125
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:08,970
Hey, thank you.

126
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,970
Where are you going this afternoon?

127
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:15,840
We're going shopping.

128
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,710
Ah, we're going shopping.

129
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,130
Can I go with you?

130
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,550
I want to buy a new shirt.

131
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,160
No, you don't have to go.

132
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:33,330
You should go home.

133
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,310
Why not?

134
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,310
Can't I go with you?

135
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:41,710
No, not like that, but we take a long
time. I'm being considerate for your sake.

136
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,270
I'm free this afternoon.

137
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,390
I can go.

138
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,000
It's Lookkaew's stuff.

139
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,640
It will take so much time.

140
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,370
You should go back to

141
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,280
the lecture for Jumper. So
you can have a moment together.

142
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,780
Fine.

143
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,250
I'm sorry, Mon.

144
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,500
It's quite urgent this time.

145
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,340
Maybe we can go next time.

146
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,400
Um.

147
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:08,910
Let's go.

148
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,390
"Chang, Chang, Chang..."

149
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:48,310
"Do you ever see the elephant?"

150
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:51,500
"The elephant is quite big."

151
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,380
"With the long nose called trunk."

152
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,860
"There are fangs under
the trunk called tusks."

153
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:03,720
"It has ears and eyes"

154
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,850
"and a long tail."

155
00:10:07,705 --> 00:10:10,805
"Chang, Chang, Chang..."

156
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,980
"Chang, Chang, Chang..."

157
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:18,150
Hey, why are you here?

158
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,610
At the office, my air
conditioner broke down.

159
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:22,980
So I ended up working from home.

160
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,620
And the office can work anywhere too.

161
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,890
And...

162
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,010
did you hear anything just now?

163
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:34,000
If I can't hear you,

164
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,780
I probably won't wear headphones.

165
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,280
Hey! Peet.

166
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,450
Why?

167
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,260
Is it that bad?

168
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,900
Or your ears are not good.

169
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:45,630
Or they're not good enough.

170
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,750
Oh, I didn't say anything yet.

171
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,950
You thought it by yourself?

172
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:51,070
What did I think by myself?
And what are you laughing at?

173
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,620
Let me go. I have to work.

174
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,260
Don't tell me...

175
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,780
You secretly listened to me sing.

176
00:10:56,795 --> 00:10:58,665
This is not called a secret.

177
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,020
Hey, Peet.

178
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,940
I'm asking for another chance.
Maybe try listening to me sing again.

179
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,410
I'll sing it to you in perfect rhythm.

180
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:06,760
"Chang, Chang, Chang..."

181
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,880
This is the beginning.

182
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,410
- "Chang, Chang, Chang..."
- Enough.

183
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,180
You go get dressed.

184
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,920
Please listen to me first.

185
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,200
- Turn off your computer first.
- No, no.

186
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,270
I'm sorry.

187
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,500
It's okay.

188
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,380
So...

189
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:41,700
I'll go get dress first.

190
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,090
This is outside.

191
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,830
Oh, this way.

192
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:05,380
(SEX SHOP)

193
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,820
Is it really okay?

194
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,740
If not, I can go in by myself.

195
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,820
No, I mean Almond.

196
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,220
If he were here,
he would be shocked to death.

197
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,460
He is your friend.

198
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,380
I know, that's why
I didn't invite him here.

199
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,340
Maybe he wants to come.

200
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,820
Um, next time I'll take him here.

201
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,300
Do you have a list of what you want?

202
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,460
I did.

203
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,220
Okay. Let's go.

204
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,620
Hello.

205
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,300
Please have a look.

206
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,660
There are both Japanese
and Chinese grades. We have them all.

207
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,020
Try to choose.

208
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,620
They both come to this
kind of shop. That means...

209
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,060
Shall we start?

210
00:13:00,052 --> 00:13:01,492
Which one should we start with?

211
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,460
This one?

212
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,340
Tete, you're crazy. I'm shy.

213
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,780
Or this one?

214
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,900
Or...

215
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,060
This one seems fun.

216
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,820
Let's start with the
light one first, shall we?

217
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:25,860
Okay.

218
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,020
This one is the newest

219
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,380
from Japan. The silicone
material will be like this.

220
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,620
Bouncy, bouncy.

221
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,820
(This is their private business.)

222
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,220
(I shouldn't have interfered, )

223
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,220
(but another part of
me wanted to know.)

224
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,460
(I better not, )

225
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,716
(but hey, I better ask.
Is it a good idea to ask?)

226
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,180
You can always change the new one.

227
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,620
(No, it's none of my business.)

228
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,540
(But I also want to know.)

229
00:13:58,980 --> 00:13:59,860
(Should I ask?)

230
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,020
(Yes, I should.)

231
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,820
(No, I shouldn't. Yes, I should)

232
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:07,060
(No, I should. I don't know!)

233
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,220
Did you hear anything?

234
00:14:15,492 --> 00:14:17,052
Um, I heard it too.

235
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,620
Come and learn
with me when I talk about

236
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,220
scanners, scanners,
and scanner systems.

237
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:28,340
And we have...

238
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,340
Big.

239
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,300
Big.

240
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,540
Big!

241
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,140
I'm gonna go. Bye.

242
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,060
Bye.

243
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,020
You're so late.

244
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,460
- You're just delaying.
- What are you going to complain about?

245
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,020
- Hello.
- Hello.

246
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,540
- See you.
- See you.

247
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,820
You're not singing today?

248
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,900
Do you want to hear it?

249
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,260
If you want to then do it.

250
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,180
Really?

251
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,820
It's your happiness.

252
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,140
Or do you want to hear mine?

253
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,180
Why? Do you want to sing for me?

254
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,260
No.

255
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,020
I'll open the writing
code lesson for you.

256
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,300
I've listened to it for 2 hours.

257
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,080
Never mind.

258
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,900
You shouldn't understand
my programming world.

259
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,320
Then you can tell me.

260
00:15:16,727 --> 00:15:18,167
I want to understand your world.

261
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,120
You go take a shower.

262
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,280
And if you want to sing, then sing.

263
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,080
Just don't come out naked, that's all.

264
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,080
Are you afraid that
you're going to like it?

265
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,280
Is this the rhythm of the Chang song?

266
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,120
"Chang, Chang, Chang."

267
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,840
"Chang, Chang, Chang."

268
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,640
"Chang, Chang, Chang."

269
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,760
Like that! Yes!

270
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,240
Oh, I'm dying.

271
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,480
I'm not playing anymore.

272
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,080
Sorry that I'm late.

273
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,640
I lost track of time when writing.

274
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,720
Writing work or what else?

275
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,640
Whatever.

276
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,440
Hey,

277
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,040
she is a good writer.

278
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,800
You can go read sometimes.

279
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,240
Ah,

280
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,840
writing a report paper?

281
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,120
Good, good.

282
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,400
In the report of my group,

283
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,840
I think we need your support.

284
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,320
Stop it, Latte!

285
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,960
You two seem very close.

286
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,200
What're you talking about?

287
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,800
Are you still mad at me?

288
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,440
That I didn't invite you that day.

289
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,240
No.

290
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,880
I'm not.

291
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,560
Or did you secretly follow us?

292
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,520
I don't know.

293
00:16:47,545 --> 00:16:49,265
I don't know a thing.
I didn't follow you.

294
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,920
Latte, stop teasing Mon.

295
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,320
Well, have you given
Jumper the paper yet?

296
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,520
Ah, I took pictures
and sent them to him via Line.

297
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,040
Sent him via Line?

298
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,840
What about the slow moment

299
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,320
like holding hands
and gazing into the eyes?

300
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,560
Are they gone?

301
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,720
All that was prepared is gone.

302
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,480
Do you like him that much?

303
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,120
This Saturday, we will find out

304
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,240
whether they will be able to
move their relationship forward or not.

305
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,080
Do you forget?

306
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,720
Oh! I'm not going.

307
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,480
Yes, you must go.

308
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,280
I'll accompany you.

309
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,840
Are you crazy? I'm not going!

310
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,840
Yes, and I will go with you.

311
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,040
What are you afraid of?

312
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,000
It seems like you guys
have a mission this Saturday?

313
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,720
A big mission.

314
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,720
I wish you success, Almond.

315
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,800
Well...

316
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,920
Let's go find something to eat.

317
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,960
Let's go.

318
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,880
I'm hungry now.

319
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,640
You sit here.

320
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,200
Otherwise, the seat will be taken.

321
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,880
Let's go.

322
00:18:04,152 --> 00:18:05,672
- The same restaurant?
- Um.

323
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,480
Please come
and have your lunch, Mr. Peet.

324
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,760
Hey,

325
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,120
the maid here is taking
good care. It's worth the price.

326
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,000
What price?

327
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,160
My price is expensive.
Can you afford it?

328
00:18:27,671 --> 00:18:29,471
It depends on what I have to pay.

329
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:37,880
Then...

330
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,480
you pay me the rent first.

331
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,600
Come on, come on.

332
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,720
I'll start first.

333
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,840
You're so slow.

334
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,400
What slow?

335
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,680
It's unusual when you eat.

336
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,640
Are you cursing me?

337
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,480
I'm not.

338
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,720
Maybe it's because I graduated
with a degree in food science, I guess.

339
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,080
Is this how food science is taught?

340
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,240
I'm joking.

341
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,800
Actually, it's my personal preference.

342
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,520
I'm a foodie,

343
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,080
and I want to know

344
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,880
what the taste and texture
of each food are like

345
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,920
so that it becomes a habit.

346
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,840
You're graduated with a degree in
food science. So, what do you want to do?

347
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,900
I want to be the food reviewer

348
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,020
because I like to taste food like this

349
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,580
ever since I can remember.

350
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,540
I've been practicing separating flavors
and touching like this over and over.

351
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,580
And I took this class

352
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,380
because I wanted to
understand food more.

353
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,100
It's not just about cooking something
with something that will be delicious.

354
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,780
But it also explains
the various reactions

355
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,020
when some substances meet

356
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,020
or some substances encounter
heat and change their condition,

357
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,780
and also includes food processing

358
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,060
and safety.

359
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,300
That I can apply this knowledge

360
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,420
to my food reviews.

361
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,180
So I kept training myself.

362
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,700
If one day the opportunity arises,

363
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,700
I will be ready to shine

364
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,140
as a national food reviewer.

365
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,220
Why?

366
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,420
Am I so nerdy?

367
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:44,900
Um.

368
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,820
Um. It might be strange to you.

369
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,140
Yes, it is.

370
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,060
But,

371
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,140
sir...

372
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,860
This is the new thing to me.

373
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,230
You're so cool that once you taste food,
you can tell which is what.

374
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,070
Once you taste food,
you can tell which is what.

375
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,170
If it were me, I would
taste everything the same.

376
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,630
Um, it's not like that.

377
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,540
Um.

378
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,780
Each of us is good at different things.

379
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:37,060
It's like you, a programmer

380
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,260
who writes code. Taking care
of the back-end system.

381
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,500
Actually,

382
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,700
things like this can be taught.

383
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,100
It's not like tasting food.

384
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,740
Why not? Tasting food
can be taught as well.

385
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:48,940
Do you want me to teach you?

386
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,190
Really?

387
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:51,710
Do you want to teach me?

388
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:53,160
Sure,

389
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,350
I actually have quite a bit of free time.

390
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,040
I have sent my resume
to every website.

391
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,530
But got nothing back.

392
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:01,050
I'll help you create a high-end resume,

393
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,110
but you have to teach
me to taste food, okay?

394
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,340
Okay.

395
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,300
Um.

396
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,380
Deal.

397
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,860
Eat it.

398
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,220
You have to eat a lot.

399
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,220
So you will have energy
when they call you for an interview.

400
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,100

I will buy it for you.

423
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,350
I don't think so.

424
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:05,750
I'll take care of myself.

425
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:07,790
I'll eat them all.

426
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:10,590
Ah, I mean

427
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,110
I'll have dinner before go home.

428
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,030
You don't have to wait for me.

429
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:15,030
Okay.

430
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,990
Roger that.

431
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,150
Yes.

432
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:24,910
Tonight, 8 pm.

433
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:28,950
Okay, see you.

434
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:36,830
Everything went according to plan.

435
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,870
Tonight is the night.

436
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:51,580
"Knock Knock, Boys!"

437
00:25:51,605 --> 00:25:54,116
(CAVE SPA: ONSEN & SAUNA BANGKOK)

438
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:56,770
It will really be okay, right?

439
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,480
We've reached this stage.

440
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,600
Okay, okay.

441
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,800
Hey, lovely.

442
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,400
Hello.

443
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,360
Hello.

444
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,720
Only for you two?

445
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,640
Correct.

446
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,760
How would you like to pay, please?

447
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,200
Scan, please.

448
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,720
How about you?

449
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,360
My friend just gave me

450
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,840
a voucher to use the
onsen service for free.

451
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,520
Wait a moment, please.

452
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,600
I'm very sorry.

453
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,440
This promotion

454
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,920
has expired since the 10th.

455
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,920
What day is it today?

456
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,440
Look at that.

457
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,440
(Thursday, the 11th.)

458
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,360
So, how're you going to pay?

459
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,680
Scan, please.

460
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,080
Please lend me some money.

461
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,680
Please help do the scan.

462
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,520
Oh!

463
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,680
- How much?
- 1,000 baht.

464
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,280
Here you are.

465
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,600
Here you go.

466
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,040
Thank you.

467
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,880
- Please come inside.
- Let's go.

468
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,320
Thank you.

469
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,320
Damn, I'm so unlucky.

470
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,680
Do bad things, and bad
things will happen to you.

471
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,360
Hey, what bad things?
This is called being smart.

472
00:27:31,847 --> 00:27:34,807
Good. You've deserved it.

473
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,640
Because you took other people's
things, so it has to be like this.

474
00:27:38,944 --> 00:27:41,240
Oh Almond! Latte!

475
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,880
Oh, what a...

476
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,520
coincidence.

477
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,480
Oh, we've just been here.

478
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,360
Have you been here for a long time?

479
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,680
I come here regularly.

480
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,440
I think this place is clean.

481
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,040
And it's divided into good proportions.

482
00:28:09,384 --> 00:28:11,544
Good proportions.

483
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,600
Um. Almond!

484
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,240
Almond!

485
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,600
Mon!

486
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,520
Will you guys want me to wait?

487
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,800
So, we can go soak
in the water together.

488
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,040
- Really?
- Um.

489
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,960
I got a stomach ache.
It was probably

490
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,320
the papaya salad this morning
that caused the problem.

491
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,480
I'll leave him to you first, okay?

492
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,360
I'll go to the restroom first.

493
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,800
I can't hold it anymore.

494
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:43,960
Um.

495
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,560
Take care of him, okay?

496
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,280
He seemed to be in a lot of pain.

497
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,760
Take off your shirt.

498
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,840
Are you shy?

499
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,720
Yes.

500
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,120
Well, I'm...

501
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,120
Ouch! I think that

502
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:10,200
papaya salad I ate with
Latte is having the same effect.

503
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,040
So...

504
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,000
you can go first.

505
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,280
- I'll follow you later.
- Um.

506
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,840
Hurry! You sound just
like him. It might be serious.

507
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,720
Latte!

508
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,720
Hey! Why did you come out?

509
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,280
I don't know what to do.

510
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,920
My heart is beating fast.

511
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,360
Touch it.

512
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,320
My heart is beating fast.

513
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,160
Your heart is on this side.

514
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,680
Um.

515
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,080
You need to take a deep breath.

516
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,840
Take a deep inhale,

517
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,440
exhale,

518
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,160
inhale,

519
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,760
exhale,

520
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,080
- Better?
- Oh!

521
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,680
I don't know what to do?

522
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,800
Okay.

523
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,520
Let's go in together.

524
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,080
Okay?

525
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,000
Be brave.

526
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,720
This is a golden opportunity.

527
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,960
If you get close to Jumper,

528
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,360
there might be some good stories.

529
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,040
Don't leave me, okay?

530
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,800
Don't leave me, okay?

531
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,640
Um, I won't.

532
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,120
Okay,

533
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:46,960
let's go.

534
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,400
Um, that's my boy.

535
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,080
Be brave.

536
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,640
I'm really sorry.

537
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,560
I was going to be on time,
but the taxi took me around.

538
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,720
It's okay.

539
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,720
I told Jumper to wait inside the onsen.

540
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,240
Okay.

541
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,600
Let's review the plan again.

542
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,440
Our plan is to get as much information

543
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,200
from him as possible
about his preferences, okay?

544
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,720
Okay then.

545
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,000
How are you gonna pay?

546
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:21,880
Damn, Peet!

547
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,440
Oh! Scan, please.

548
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,720
- Okay.
- Okay.

549
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,400
- For two people?
- How much is it?

550
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,560
- 1,000 baht.
- Okay.

551
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,440
Please, let me see the receipt.

552
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,820
- Thank you.
- Here it is.

553
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,070
Please pass the
key to your friend as well.

554
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,640
Okay, thank you.

555
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,820
You have to pay me my debt.

556
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,340
Well...

557
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,300
wait for my salary to come first.

558
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,620
You guys were

559
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,700
going to work in a group?

560
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,740
And how come you guys are here?

561
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,660
So, can't we all soak in the onsen?

562
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:10,980
Oh! Soak in the onsen?

563
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,220
What a coincidence.

564
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,420
Why do you keep a secret?

565
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,380
True.

566
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,940
Well...

567
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:20,540
You talk like you tell us everything.

568
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:24,740
Shall we go inside?

569
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:26,860
Fine,

570
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,260
we'll see

571
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,100
who gonna win in this game.

572
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,780
Let's go.

573
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,660
Game on.

574
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,900
What do you say now?
Hurry and pack your things.

575
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:48,130
Where is Jumper?

576
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,320
Latte,

577
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,400
let's go soak in the pool first.

578
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,720
Standing and staring

579
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,440
like this is bad manners.

580
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,440
Where could Jumper go?
He must be around here.

581
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,680
Please...

582
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,200
go down and soak in
the water in the pool first.

583
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,840
We'll meet him soon.

584
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,720
Um, fine.

585
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,680
Hi, what's up?

586
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,080
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.

587
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,880
Oh. This is my friend,

588
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:43,960
named Thanwa.

589
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,800
- Oh, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

590
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,400
Are you two going into the pool

591
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,640
or the sauna with me?

592
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,640
I think we'd better
go to the sauna first.

593
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,120
- Um.
- Okay?

594
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,560
Okay, let's go.

595
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,640
- Hey! Hurry!
- Where're we going?

596
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,840
The sauna room. Hurry!

597
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,080
- Please.
- After you.

598
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,720
It's okay.

599
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,560
(SAUNA ROOM)

600
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:25,180
Shoot! Damn!

601
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,260
What should we do, Latte?

602
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:28,780
What should we do?

603
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:31,780
We can go back to the pool first.

604
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,540
What was it like when you

605
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,380
signed up to be a football player?

606
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,980
I should know it next week.

607
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:48,820
Wait.

608
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:50,780
Is this Jumper an athlete?

609
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,540
Um. Hey!

610
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,380
This is a future
college football player.

611
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,340
Damn!

612
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,420
- Wow!
- Not really.

613
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,940
Like this, do you have a lot of
people coming to flirt with you?

614
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:00,980
Oh.

615
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:03,540
There are some, and
sometimes there are some extras.

616
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,100
- Hey!
- Hey!

617
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,020
And the person
who came to flirt with you.

618
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,500
How do they get in?

619
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,660
Oh.

620
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,460
I have it all.

621
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,100
Some IG, some Line,

622
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,380
- and sometimes SMS.
- Shoot.

623
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,620
Sometimes they
direct email to me as well.

624
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,140
Do you have
specifications that you like,

625
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,380
like what the person you
come to flirt with must be like?

626
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,460
Oh!

627
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,500
I never thought about it.

628
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:29,700
But do you two have any?

629
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,420
Specifics of the person you like.

630
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:35,300
If I don't care about appearance,

631
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,900
I like people who care about me.

632
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,300
Oh, you're correct.

633
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,140
Well,

634
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,780
as long as they
have good-looking bodies

635
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,300
but don't fit together.

636
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,300
I think that's the end of it all.

637
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,300
Damn, you speak very sharply.

638
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,500
Don't change the subject.

639
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:53,260
- How about you?
- Oh, me?

640
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,460
Um...

641
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,220
The person

642
00:35:58,980 --> 00:35:59,820
I hugged

643
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,540
and felt warm, I guess?

644
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:17,060
Today, I probably
won't be able to stay long.

645
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:17,900
Oh, really?

646
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,820
- Um, okay.
- Okay.

647
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,860
Let's come together again next time.

648
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,380
I think it's fun.

649
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,940
Next time, I'd like to come too.

650
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,500
What is it?

651
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,820
What's it?

652
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,300
I mean, I've thought for a long time

653
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,140
that the three of us

654
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,260
were talking too loudly.

655
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,060
It's too late.

656
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,740
I'm sorry.

657
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,140
I'm sorry to you all.

658
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,740
I'm sorry.

659
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,140
Hey! Per's coming out. Go!

660
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,660
Hurry!

661
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,460
Wait a sec, Latte.

662
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,380
I feel dizzy.

663
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,740
What's wrong with you? Are you okay?

664
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,100
Unfortunately,

665
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,500
Jumper is going back.

666
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,300
Oh, damn it.

667
00:37:22,587 --> 00:37:24,067
I'm sorry, bro.

668
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,020
Damn you!

669
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,660
Fine.

670
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,660
Next time, I will
definitely go all out on you.

671
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:35,020
Do it first, and then speak.
No one will say anything.

672
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:35,860
Right, Big?

673
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:36,700
Right.

674
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,500
God, damn.

675
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,620
You're such a crafty bastard.

676
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,020
Hey, it's not like that.

677
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,580
Free rent for one year.

678
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:47,220
One month, two months,

679
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,700
three months,

680
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,020
four months,

681
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,300
and five months.

682
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,100
Shoot!

683
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,300
- Shoot!
- Shoot!

684
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,940
- Shoot!
- Shoot!

685
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:15,660
Hey, Mon!

686
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,220
Mon!

687
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,100
Are you okay?

688
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,060
Mon! Mon!

689
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,580
Mon!

690
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,300
Mon!

691
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,420
- Are you okay?
- Mon!

692
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,660
And now, who will bring him back?

693
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,620
Whoever brought him here

694
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,020
will bring him back.

695
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,620
Oh, man,

696
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:41,900
he's not light.

697
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,460
Customer,

698
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:47,260
if next time you feel that you are sick

699
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,620
or do not get enough rest,

700
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:52,300
I don't recommend using the onsen

701
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,580
because it can make you dizzy.

702
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,820
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

703
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,980
We apologize for causing you trouble.

704
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,500
We're really sorry.

705
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,700
- Sorry.
- We're sorry.

706
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,420
We won't bother you anymore.

707
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,500
We'd better go back first.

708
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:12,860
I'm going to change clothes first.

709
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,740
The locker room staff have gone home.

710
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,340
Padon me?

711
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,460
The locker room staff have gone home.

712
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,420
Shoot!

713
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,380
It's okay, Big.

714
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,940
Then we go home like this.

715
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:32,980
Hey, go ahead.

716
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,660
Oh! Damn!

717
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,580
Let's go.

718
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,820
Hey!

719
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:50,980
Are...

720
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,060
we really doing this?

721
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,460
It's not bad, right?

722
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,220
Bad or not,

723
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,540
try asking that person first.

724
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:04,540
It's like going straight to hell.

725
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,820
How are you feeling, Mon?

726
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,540
Are you feeling better?

727
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,100
Um,

728
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,980
before you fainted, what happened?

729
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,820
Umm...

730
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,060
(Why did I come here?)

731
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:27,060
(Did I come to act
like a pig in a shabu pot?)

732
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,660
(If it weren't for the fact
that Latte was dragging me, )

733
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,860
(I wouldn't have come, )

734
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,300
(even if I would have met Jumper.)

735
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,860
Hey you, Per's out. Let's go.

736
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,260
Hurry!

737
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,180
Hey!

738
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:46,140
Just a moment, Latte, I feel dizzy.

739
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,260
What's wrong with you? Are you okay?

740
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:52,580
(So how is it? The mission failed.)

741
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:56,220
(Where did this go wrong?)

742
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:59,220
(Why is it so difficult)

743
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,380
(to be near someone I like?)

744
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:02,460
Next time, I will
definitely go all out on you.

745
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,660
(Or is it because of)

746
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,540
(Aries men)

747
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,340
(who have a birthmark
under their clothes)

748
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,580
(and are people
with a high sexual drive?)

749
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,820
(Come on, Mon!)

750
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:15,700
(Let's open it up and look
at his birthmark right here.)

751
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,620
Shoot!

752
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:27,460
(But in the end, I still don't know)

753
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:29,500
(if Latte has a birthmark or not.)

754
00:41:29,947 --> 00:41:31,667
(Shoot!)

755
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,820
Let's leave him like this.

756
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,900
But it failed.

757
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,100
Ah, you're so good at barging in.

758
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,340
So what information did you get?

759
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,060
You think I'm going to tell you?

760
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,020
Oh,

761
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,660
this house is
full of poisonous snakes.

762
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,420
Oh man,

763
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,620
he's not light-weight.

764
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,580
How are you?
Did you wait long for me?

765
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:08,460
Not long at all.

766
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:10,540
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

767
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,940
- Let's go.
- Okay.

768
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:33,490
Shoot!

769
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,160
The homeowner said
that the transformer had exploded.

770
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,560
So the power
went out in this entire zone.

771
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:46,100
Well,

772
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,460
now it's getting late.

773
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:51,460
Let's sleep for a while more,
and the power will soon be restored.

774
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:53,940
Ahh!

775
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,420
We came out of the hot onsen

776
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:57,180
and still have to
come live in a hot house.

777
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:02,220
Why is it this bad?

778
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,340
I'm so hot!

779
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:18,260
