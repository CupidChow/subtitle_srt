00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,420
Latte.

28
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,420
Hey, I am sorry.

29
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,620
I forgot

30
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:10,020
this week is college sports week.

31
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,550
So, I set my alarm clock.

32
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,800
I haven't said anything yet.

33
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,030
Actually,

34
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,700
I already intended to wake you up.

35
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,480
Today we have an appointment.

36
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,780
An appointment?

37
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,090
An appointment?

38
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,740
An appointment?

39
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,590
What appointment?

40
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,980
An appointment?

41
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,240
It probably doesn't matter to you,

42
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,100
that's why you forgot.

43
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,710
Wait.

44
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,480
Would you please go and pick
something from the closet for me?

45
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,840
Ouch!

46
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,100
Just watch your step.

47
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,330
You are so messy.

48
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,100
I didn't forget.

49
00:04:10,337 --> 00:04:12,187
I told you I would take you on a trip.

50
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,350
You think

51
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,600
I'm such a careless person?

52
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,770
But you just said you forgot.

53
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:22,200
When did I say that?

54
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,220
Quit imagining things.

55
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,480
What?

56
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,100
I always remember

57
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,990
what I care for.

58
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,270
And,

59
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,300
today I woke up by myself.

60
00:04:35,373 --> 00:04:36,803
You didn't have to wake me up.

61
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,660
You just got used to it

62
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,430
and woke up by yourself.

63
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,270
I really woke up by myself.

64
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,100
I just

65
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,190
want to spend more time with you.

66
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,440
Have you finished packing?

67
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,400
Okay. Just give me a minute.

68
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,240
I will take a shower.

69
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:15,100
If you are not leaving my room,

70
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,070
I'm going to bathe together with you.

71
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,380
You're crazy!

72
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:24,940
I am leaving now.

73
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,090
I have prepared breakfast.

74
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,960
Thanks.

75
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,290
Thanks a lot.

76
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,060
Oh!

77
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,900
Where are you going?
Don't you want to have breakfast?

78
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,590
No.

79
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,250
I have a job interview.

80
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,060
Good luck.

81
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:21,910
We are going to the trip.

82
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,560
Peak.

83
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,200
Peak.

84
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,580
- Peak.
- Peak.

85
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,100
So, the two of us

86
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,800
are going to the trip for a few days.

87
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,060
Peak, are you okay?

88
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:38,770
I am okay.

89
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,650
Almond, have a nice trip.

90
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,950
Don't think too much.

91
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,500
Yes.

92
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,240
See you in a few days.

93
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,440
Bye, Peak.

94
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,110
Let's go.

95
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,540
We are going to the trip.

96
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:07,930
Hey.

97
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,150
I am going back home.

98
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,470
Is it about my father?

99
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:14,530
Yes.

100
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,590
But don't worry,

101
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:20,130
I will handle him.

102
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,600
While you are here,

103
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,020
you should take care of your own problems.

104
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,790
Do you know Thanwa
is getting back with his ex-boyfriend?

105
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:30,570
Yeah.

106
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,420
Latte and Almond
talked about it last night.

107
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,110
Are you sad?

108
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,620
Look,

109
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,780
they are just friends again.

110
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,110
They haven't gotten back together yet.

111
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,880
But he was once his boyfriend.

112
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,460
Ex-boyfriend.

113
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,780
So,

114
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,630
if you like him, just tell him.

115
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,370
Haven't you ever heard
the classic line,

116
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,910
"If you don't compete, you'll lose"?

117
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,890
If you don't end up being
successful, at least you've tried.

118
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,770
So what's the use of trying?

119
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:05,870
If I'll lose in the end anyway.

120
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,310
It's true that you will lose him,

121
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,290
but you will win
because you conquered yourself.

122
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,700
Got it?

123
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,870
You said you didn't
want to regret it later,

124
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,140
so just do it!

125
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,450
About your father,

126
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,120
please make a decision quickly too.

127
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,260
Actually, I don't want to push you,

128
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:40,140
but I cannot prolong it
any more, the clock is ticking.

129
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,480
Understand?

130
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,120
Thanks a lot, Jane.

131
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:45,490
Thanks for what?

132
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,610
You helped me copy my math homework,
so I want to repay you.

133
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:50,750
All right.

134
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:54,450
Finish the meal. He made it for you.

135
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,590
I am leaving, call me if you need anything.

136
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,250
See you.

137
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,320
See you.

138
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,580
Oh.

139
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,060
Why are you sleeping here?

140
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,920
Has your boyfriend gone back yet?

141
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:39,490
Yeah.

142
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,360
Aren't you asleep?

143
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,430
Not yet.

144
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,600
I can't fall asleep.

145
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,890
Do you want me to sleep
in Latte's room instead?

146
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,660
Otherwise your boyfriend will feel bad.

147
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,310
It's okay.

148
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,920
You can sleep here.

149
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,140
There's nothing between us.

150
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,010
We are just friends.

151
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,320
And anyway,

152
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,930
Max hasn't become my boyfriend yet.

153
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,580
We just got back to be friends.

154
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,100
It's my decision whether
I will take the next step.

155
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,960
Anyway, I hope it's a good thing.

156
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,080
Well, what I choose is the best.

157
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,350
Thanwa.

158
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,070
Hm?

159
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,680
Nothing. Get some sleep then.

160
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,490
Lean on my shoulder.

161
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,800
Otherwise, when we arrive,

162
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,370
your neck will be in pain.

163
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:43,170

Finally, we are here!

175
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,870
- Beautiful.
- Let's go.

176
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,430
The sea is very beautiful.

177
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,430
So refreshing.

178
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,490
Refreshing.

179
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,710
The weather is good, right?

180
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,910
Thanwa Supreecha.

181
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,040
I've looked at your resume.

182
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,590
Why did you apply to work
in the purchasing department?

183
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,440
You majored in food science.

184
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,860
For me, I think purchasing work

185
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,540
requires planning and organizing skills.

186
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:29,920
When we purchase the materials,

187
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,050
I can apply my knowledge to this work.

188
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,090
I think this position suits me best.

189
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,730
Don't you feel like your knowledge is wasted?

190
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,960
Because if you work in the purchasing dept,

191
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,480
the main job focuses on calculation.

192
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,790
I looked at your previous work experiences,

193
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,840
mostly you reviewed things
and created content.

194
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,760
Quite a stretch from purchasing.

195
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,190
It's like I've been practicing my skills

196
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:57,080
in looking for ingredients for cooking.

197
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,380
I am a conscientious and oriented person.

198
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,660
If this company has dedicated employees
like me,

199
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,280
you won't be disappointed.

200
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,110
I understand now.

201
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,810
So, the next question.

202
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:08,650
Sure.

203
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,150
What is

204
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,030
your dream job?

205
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,730
I want to be a food reviewer.

206
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,340
But

207
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,920
sometimes we need to recognize the reality,

208
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,840
and do what we know we can do best.

209
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,480
About my dream,

210
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,460
I will keep it as my hobby.

211
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,080
If you have to choose

212
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,130
between what you love

213
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,680
and what you have to do,

214
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,470
and you can not regret it later,

215
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,560
what would you choose?

216
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,890
If I still have a chance to make decisions,

217
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:46,330
I still want to choose to do what I love.

218
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,000
But

219
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:52,850
do I still have a chance to choose?

220
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:12,940
(Good luck with your job interview today.)

221
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:14,900
(I miss you.)

222
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,210
What should I do?

223
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:27,160
Almond.

224
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,190
Let's take a dip in the pool.

225
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:30,590
Take off your glasses.

226
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,240
Now.

227
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:38,910
Come on.

228
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,230
It's cold.

229
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,690
Almond, come here.

230
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:53,560
What is it?

231
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:58,180
Are you gonna fight with me?

232
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,210
I give up.

233
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:02,220
I give up. I won't fight.

234
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:20,920
When I feel stressed, I
do something like this.

235
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,820
Screw you!

236
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:27,920
Hey.

237
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:29,870
Just try.

238
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:31,250
- What?
- Yeah.

239
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:39,880
Screw you.

240
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,450
Come on.

241
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,290
Say it louder, like

242
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:46,440
you will release it,
just let it off your chest.

243
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:47,990
One more time.

244
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:49,520
Just try it.

245
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,950
Screw you!

246
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,720
That's my boy.

247
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,610
How's that? Feeling better?

248
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,500
Let's go.

249
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,890
Ouch!

250
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:42,730
What?

251
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,660
The crab pinched me.

252
00:18:48,605 --> 00:18:49,475
It pinched me.

253
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,650
Ouch!

254
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:56,490
What?

255
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,610
The crap pinched me again.

256
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,250
It pinched me.

257
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,320
It pinched me.

258
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,510
Oh, it's not fun?

259
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,960
Here, the crab is crawling.

260
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,200
Not fun. It's not fun at all.

261
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,490
This bar plays very good songs.

262
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:24,662
Good vibes too.

263
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,220
Two beers, please.

264
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:29,180
All right.

265
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,810
Are you new here? I haven't seen you.

266
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:31,890
That's right.

267
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:33,370
Here you go.

268
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:34,210
Thank you.

269
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,610
Here's for you.

270
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:47,990
Just have some fun,

271
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,080
so you can be relaxed.

272
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,060
But I think,

273
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,890
beers cannot solve the problem.

274
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,970
I know it doesn't solve anything,

275
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,310
but at least,

276
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:00,540
it helps you to relax.

277
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,920
And today,

278
00:20:05,138 --> 00:20:06,678
I will teach you some skills.

279
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,330
What skills?

280
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,860
How to hunt prey.

281
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,360
Hello.

282
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,340
- Hello.
- May I sit with you?

283
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,530
Please sit.

284
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,720
Excuse me.

285
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,620
Yes.

286
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,730
You are so good at it.

287
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,080
That was basic, but the next technique

288
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,710
is called "Watch and melt the heart".

289
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,590
What?

290
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:26,730
What is it?

291
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,520
"Watch and melt the heart".

292
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,130
This technique is

293
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:41,700
don't let the prey avoid your eyes-contact.

294
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,140
Oh!

295
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,810
You try to talk with the guy over there.

296
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,810
I saw him look at you many times.

297
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,200
Just try it, it's not difficult.

298
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:18,870
Cheers.

299
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,360
There you go.

300
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:29,730
Try it.

301
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,930
Watch and melt his heart.

302
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:35,650
Watch and melt his heart.

303
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:43,530
Hello.

304
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,520
Hello.

305
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,920
- Hello.
- Yes.

306
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:54,410
Are you okay?

307
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,370
- Cheers.
- Yes, cheers.

308
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:05,840
- Cheers.
- Yes.

309
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:14,090
Cheers.

310
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:15,550
Cheers again?

311
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,990
I am Almond.

312
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:24,080
- Cheers.
- Yes.

313
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,440
I rarely drink beer,

314
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,130
but cheers.

315
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:34,550
All right.

316
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,510
The more I drink,
the more I feel it tastes good.

317
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,420
Cheers.

318
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,660
- Cheers again?
- Yes.

319
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,430
Cheers.

320
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:03,960
Do you still want to drink with me?

321
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:09,700
Cheers, bro.

322
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,340
This one is actually good.

323
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,430
It's good.

324
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:17,870
The taste is better than usual.

325
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:19,350
When you said that, it means...

326
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,490
Cheers.

327
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,000
Come on.

328
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,840
Almond.

329
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:27,920
Come back now.

330
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:29,550
What?

331
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:32,030
You are drunk, you should go back.
Let's go.

332
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,610
Why are you pulling me?

333
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:36,380
Can't I have some fun?

334
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,940
Just go back, you can't speak properly now.

335
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,490
Just go back.

336
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:42,320
- I am not going.
- You are drunk, just go back, Almond.

337
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:44,190
- Get back to the room.
- Cheers again.

338
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,070
Okay, that's enough.

339
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:45,930
What now?

340
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:47,730
Go back, Almomd. Get up.

341
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:49,290
You are drunk, just go back.

342
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,240
- I am sorry.
- That's alright.

343
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,390
Almond, just go back first.

344
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:57,220
- You are not well, you are drunk.
- I am not okay.

345
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,630
- You are drunk.
- Just cheers.

346
00:24:59,090 --> 00:24:59,930
Let's go back.

347
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,620
Oh!

348
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,640
Watch

349
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:04,700
- and melt his heart.
- Okay.

350
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,710
Alright, watch and melt his heart.

351
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:09,720
Just go back.

352
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:14,740
"Knock Knock, Boys!"

353
00:25:46,543 --> 00:25:47,833
How was your job interview today?

354
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,360
It's okay.

355
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,770
And then...

356
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:58,890
Then...

357
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,180
Then what?

358
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:04,860
So your job interview is okay, right?

359
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:07,150
You asked me just now.

360
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,620
Oh.

361
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,420
Thanwa.

362
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:24,970
I...

363
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:26,670
(Congratulations, Thanwa. You passed the
interview. Glad to have you on the team.)

364
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:27,640
I like...

365
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:29,930
I like...

366
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,140
Hey, you, I passed the job interview.

367
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:33,470
You know what?

368
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:35,300
I desperately want this job.

369
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,900
I was really under pressure today.

370
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:39,020
Read it.

371
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:44,140
I told you that you'd get it.

372
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,420
Your resume looked so good.

373
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,900
You'll say it's because of you then.

374
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,750
Don't you think so?

375
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,360
All right.

376
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,760
Is that right?

377
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:53,920
It's because of you?

378
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:11,920
Yes.

379
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,380
Oh, I am free now.

380
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:25,370
Pom is sick today. I asked you to write

381
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:27,270
the shop review for him.
Can you do it in time?

382
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,510
I can do it, and I'll
send it to you tonight.

383
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:33,620
Oh, Kit. I got a job.

384
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,680
Hey!

385
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,710
Congrats, bro.

386
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:38,510
So you can't do my work anymore.

387
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,460
Come on, bro.

388
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,450
How can I abandon
a good person like you?

389
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,090
I really love your work.

390
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:46,390
Come on, love my work?

391
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:49,110
But your income is too low
and you can't make a living.

392
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:50,430
Do you still want to do it?

393
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,410
I don't know,

394
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:54,470
but I still want to do it.

395
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,750
May I ask you something?

396
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,180
Between what we love

397
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,370
and what we should do,

398
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,860
what will you choose?

399
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:11,390
Eh?

400
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,420
Are you being philosophical today?

401
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,050
Just

402
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:17,890
choose whatever is right.

403
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,450
Do you think it's right?

404
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,100
What?

405
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,720
Are you going to quit doing my work?

406
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,820
Oh, no. Kit.

407
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,100
I have to go now.

408
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,080
I will do the review
and send it you tonight.

409
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,620
Oh, okay. Please do it.

410
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:31,910
Thank you.

411
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,660
Okay, Kit. Bye.

412
00:28:45,285 --> 00:28:48,275
I want to drink more, I am not going.

413
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,780
You are drunk, Almond.

414
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:53,450
I am not drunk.

415
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,380
You can just sleep.

416
00:29:00,995 --> 00:29:03,005
Don't act like my mother

417
00:29:04,567 --> 00:29:06,737
who tells me to do this and that.

418
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,210
You said it yourself

419
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:11,310
that you will let me see the world,

420
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,480
teach me how to get a guy,

421
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,580
why did you pull me out?

422
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:19,690
You're drunk, can we talk about it later?

423
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,150
This isn't what I want.

424
00:29:38,087 --> 00:29:39,347
You don't have to do this.

425
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:41,750
So what should I do?

426
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,287
Like this?

427
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,280
Almond, stop!

428
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:58,110
Stop! Almond. Stop!

429
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,400
Are you really sure?

430
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,720
Do you really want to do this?

431
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,230
I am sure.

432
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,970
I must do it tonight.

433
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,300
If that's what you really want,

434
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:29,940
then I'll do it properly.

435
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:18,900
I just wanted to feel needed.

436
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:24,220
There's nothing good about me,

437
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,750
and I am already hated by every student.

438
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,760
What should I do to make someone like me?

439
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,160
I don't know.

440
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:39,930
I don't know what to do.

441
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,530
It's okay.

442
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,030
There's no need to force it.

443
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,360
(I sent the review to you via email.)

444
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,920
How are you? Is it better?

445
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,970
I feel better.

446
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,670
I am not okay.

447
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:58,230
What's wrong?

448
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,200
I feel hot.

449
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:01,790
It's not hot at all.

450
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:04,220
Are you taking your shirt off?

451
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,310
But we are in the temple,

452
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:10,710
shall I get an electric fan?

453
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,160
No need, I am a sinful person.

454
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:16,040
When I do a good deed in the temple,

455
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,900
I feel hot and cold.

456
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,440
Let's go.

457
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,380
Wait.

458
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:32,630
Chi-Chi Sticks.

459
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:49,850
No. 2.

460
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:08,780
No. 2.

461
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,340
There are obstacles on the path.

462
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:14,610
Don't wait for luck,
you have to work hard yourself.

463
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:16,530
Is there nothing good at all?

464
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,350
Love is opened

465
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,070
like starlight

466
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:21,670
in the dark.

467
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:25,190
The stars will lead your heart
to find your soul mate.

468
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:30,530
It's not far away.
Just look and you'll find it.

469
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:38,940
Or...

470
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,210
Hey, Latte.

471
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:56,550
Win, bro.

472
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,890
It's been a long time.

473
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:02,550
How have you been?
Who are you with?

474
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,060
- Just a friend.
- Just a friend, really?

475
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:08,700
We were friends,

476
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:09,900
do you remember?

477
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:14,820
And then,

478
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,000
I have these.

479
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:18,210
Take these.

480
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:20,380
I have 2 SUP board coupons,

481
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:22,160
but you need to use them
within this month.

482
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,630
I will go back to Bangkok,
there is no use for me.

483
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:26,410
Just take your friend.

484
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,180
- Is it good? Just use it.
- All right.

485
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,480
Thanks a lot.

486
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:32,670
You must use these.

487
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,530
Bye.

488
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:35,030
- See you later.
- Bye.

489
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:47,430
Who is he?

490
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:49,990
A friend.

491
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:52,370
What friend?

492
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:54,380
An old friend.

493
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,510
For how long?

494
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,920
I've known him for a while,
but I haven't seen him in a long time.

495
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,660
This is a coincidence.

496
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:02,120
He gave us two coupons. Shall we go?

497
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:07,360
A friend gave us these.

498
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,190
Look at the eyes as you speak.

499
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,830
Will you go?

500
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:13,790
Yes, I'll go.

501
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:20,700
Hello, I'm Thanwa,
in Food Purchasing Department.

502
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,600
What is it?

503
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:34,320
Fighting! Food purchasing
is a good job.

504
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:35,910
You can do it.

505
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,210
You don't like it the most,

506
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,520
but I believe you can do it.

507
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:44,980
Go!

508
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,260
Have you finished breakfast?

509
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:56,900
Oh,

510
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,370
where is my cheese toast?

511
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:04,810
I didn't see it.

512
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,200
You look very good today.

513
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,760
Really?

514
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,960
I look good every day.

515
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,450
Oh, cheese toast...

516
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,420
Sorry.

517
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,760
Thanwa,

518
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,210
congratulations on the job.

519
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:34,900
Can I borrow this?

520
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,080
Thanwa.

521
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:48,060
Ah, hello, Max.

522
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,380
This evening?

523
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,050
What would you like to eat?

524
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:56,900
So you come to eat at our house.

525
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:58,710
Yes, all right.

526
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,760
Okay then.

527
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:23,960
Ready?

528
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:26,250
I think

529
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,820
you can play by yourself.

530
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:28,940
I will sit here and wait.

531
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:31,220
No way.

532
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,150
We came to play together.

533
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,720
It doesn't hurt
when you fall into water.

534
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,140
It just makes you feel embarrassed.

535
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,270
Oh,

536
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:39,660
the more you talk,

537
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,800
the more I don't want to play.

538
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:45,610
Come on,

539
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,870
it's okay, try playing it first.

540
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:49,460
I will take care of you.

541
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,180
Are you sure?

542
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,240
Yep.

543
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:54,460
Let's play.

544
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,720
♪ You probably don't know ♪

545
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:05,110
♪ The longer the song plays,
it makes me more shaken ♪

546
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,890
♪ This heart is trembling,
you probably don't know ♪

547
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:14,300
♪ That my heart is inside,
it was never given to anyone ♪

548
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,130
♪ I'll let it be just you ♪

549
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:19,070
♪ I give my heart to you only ♪

550
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:21,310
♪ Although I am not bored
I want to take a good look ♪

551
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,280
Is there something wrong?

552
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:33,010
About last night,

553
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,910
thanks a lot.

554
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,940
If I didn't hug and comfort you,

555
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:45,420
I would've listened
to your crying all night.

556
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:51,660
Also...

557
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:56,500
About what you said,

558
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,340
it was right.

559
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:00,900
About what?

560
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,570
I don't have to force

561
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,780
someone to love me.

562
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:13,730
Why would I do that?

563
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,730
I can't make everyone

564
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:18,390
love me anyway.

565
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,360
Is that right?

566
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:33,430
What's wrong?

567
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,680
If you have no one to talk to,

568
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:46,800
you can talk to me.

569
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:50,550
I am a good listener.

570
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,250
You helped me once,

571
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:56,380
so I have to repay you.

572
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,420
I don't believe in love.

573
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:11,280
Do you think you are a good mother?

574
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,260
Huh?

575
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,460
You always go out and play around.

576
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,600
Don't shift the blame on me.

577
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,500
When my parents took me to the sea
for the first time,

578
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:29,270
they had a big fight.

579
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:33,280
Then they broke up at the beach.

580
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:38,800
My mom was forced to raise me.

581
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:41,520
Afterwards,

582
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:44,310
she went to work overseas.

583
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:48,040
She remarried.

584
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,340
But...

585
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:55,620
But my mother sent me money every month.

586
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:02,800
I used to think,

587
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:05,870
if I lived a bad life

588
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,450
and kept repeating grades,

589
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:12,220
she might fly back and yell at me.

590
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:18,910
But no.

591
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:24,910
She just simply left me.

592
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:28,620
I was abandoned by her.

593
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,220
The sea...

594
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,610
It's never been good to me.

595
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:52,600
If you hate the sea,

596
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,010
why don't you tell me?

597
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,850
Because you wanted to come.

598
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:01,110
Why would I...

599
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:17,440
Thank you.

600
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:22,240
I am sorry too.

601
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:25,090
Hey,

602
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,650
I am fine now.

603
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:31,780
Are you sure?

604
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:33,440
Yes.

605
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:36,610
This is your healing trip,

606
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:38,080
not mine.

607
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:45,940
Whatever it is,

608
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:48,730
next time we won't go to the sea.

609
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:51,020
We can come.

610
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,230
Because you...

611
00:44:56,470 --> 00:44:58,620
You have made the sea
become my favorite place.

612
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:11,230
Hey, wait.

613
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:30,750
So I...

614
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:32,860
I also like the sea the most.

615
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:12,900
Thanwa.

616
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:25,430
Oh!

617
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:27,930
Why did you buy that much?

618
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:29,350
I have to make it good.

619
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:31,210
We have a guest coming to our house.

620
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:34,850
I am not really a guest.

621
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:36,220
Because the word "guest"

622
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:38,220
is for the people who aren't close.

623
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,390
But me and Thanwa,

624
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,590
we are more than that word.

625
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:47,090
Let's eat, I am hungry.

626
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:48,440
Okay. Let's eat.

627
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:50,220
Thank you.

628
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:52,410
Thank you.

629
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:12,850
How was your first day at work?

630
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:16,050
I haven't started to work yet.

631
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,800
He called me to take pictures
to make a profile.

632
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:22,110
I'll come pick you up
on the day you start work.

633
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:25,600
It's okay. I can go by myself.

634
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:28,220
Oh, that's right.

635
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:30,630
I remember you don't like
a ride to work.

636
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,380
You prefer me to wait at home
and have dinner together with you.

637
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,710
Would you like some fried vegetables?
I'll do it for you.

638
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:47,110
Your favorite dish, here you go.

639
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:48,870
I remember.

640
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:51,550
You need to eat more.

641
00:47:57,390 --> 00:47:58,870
The shower in the bathroom is broken.

642
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:00,720
- I'll buy a new one.
- I will fix it.

643
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:02,210
But

644
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:03,980
there is no need to fix it,

645
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:05,970
you will move out
and stay with me soon.

646
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:07,700
Shall we go now?

647
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:13,110
I will come back and fix it,

648
00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:14,170
it's all right.

649
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:35,570
What is it?

650
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:37,280
Oh,

651
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:38,170
it's nothing.

652
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,050
My friend sent me a line chat.

653
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,590
Can't I stay over?

654
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:00,220
No.

655
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:02,170
We've already talked
about this matter.

656
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:03,750
That I would start by talking first.

657
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:07,300
Okay.

658
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:13,290
What's on your face?

659
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:15,980
Here?

660
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,930
Can't I just ask for a kiss?

661
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:35,430
You should go.

662
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:38,990
Okay.

663
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:40,590
I am leaving now.

664
00:50:02,610 --> 00:50:04,420
Don't you feel embarrassed
for kissing at the front gate?

665
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,300
I...

666
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:12,830
If you want to do more than that,
just stay with Max.

667
00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:14,220
So you can do more than just kissing.

668
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,490
Do you want me to move back
with Max?

669
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,760
You do whatever you want to do,
you are a grown-up.

670
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:31,950
Fine.

671
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:34,150
Okay.

672
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,900
Come on, Peak.

673
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:53,120
I always believed that Peak was smart.

674
00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:55,380
But actually...

675
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:56,440
Hey,

676
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:57,680
are you saying I am stupid?

677
00:50:57,980 --> 00:50:59,890
No, I am saying you are not smart.

678
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,940
Can you make it clear?

679
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,050
Why is it so hard to understand?

680
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:07,310
When Thanwa asked,

681
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:11,280
"Do you want me to move back
with Max?"

682
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:14,130
He may wanted to know
how would you feel.

683
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,410
He might hesitate,

684
00:51:15,690 --> 00:51:17,520
and think this is
a good opportunity

685
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,160
for you to confess your feelings
or ask him to stay.

686
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:22,100
So, what did you tell him?

687
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:23,930
"You are a grown-up".

688
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:25,950
What the heck was that?

689
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:27,210
You wanted to act cool?

690
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:28,470
It was so complicated.

691
00:51:29,610 --> 00:51:30,690
So you know.

692
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:33,090
You feel good with him.

693
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:35,380
But you pushed him
to go back to his ex-boyfriend.

694
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,150
I didn't know what was wrong with me.

695
00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:39,250
I felt so annoyed and
wanted to chase him away.

696
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:41,040
Just say you are jealous.

697
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:43,300
Please explain it to Thanwa

698
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:44,980
before it becomes too late.

699
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:46,920
That's all now, I am hungry.

700
00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:51,560
So stupid.

701
00:51:58,460 --> 00:51:59,300
Let's check out.

702
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:05,310
We are leaving now. I don't want to.

703
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,100
What do you think you'll do next?

704
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:20,280
I will move on.

705
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:23,280
It was just

706
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,310
one of those unfortunate
things that happened.

707
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:29,510
You are so good, Almond.

708
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,290
Don't rub my hair.

709
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:33,670
I won't do that.

710
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:40,850
Then smile, smile.

711
00:52:41,110 --> 00:52:42,660
Smile, smile.

712
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:44,180
Smile.

713
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:48,010
You should smile a lot, good boy.

714
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:52,700
Let's go.

715
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:01,440
Hello.

716
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:03,680
Hello, Latte.
I have updates about the clip.

717
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,050
I have talked to Jumper and Shawn.

718
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:09,490
I think we will come together to help
find the truth about the leaked clip.

719
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:11,280
All right, I am ready.

720
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:13,950
Now Sean suggests
that there is someone

721
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:15,380
who can help us.

722
00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:16,630
Who?

723
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:29,760
Thanwa.

724
00:53:40,890 --> 00:53:42,580
I think I like you... No.

725
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:45,350
I feel like I like you.

726
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,340
It's not just a thought,

727
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:48,250
it is a feeling.

728
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:49,590
Peak, I...

729
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:51,460
I don't want you to leave this house.

730
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:53,360
I still want to wake up
and eat the fried eggs

731
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:54,670
that you cook for me every day.

732
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:56,030
You...

733
00:53:57,770 --> 00:53:59,190
Can you stay with me?

734
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:12,020
I think Peak should
practice making fried eggs.

735
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:13,910
Because today

736
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:15,830
Thanwa will move in with me.

737
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,590
Pack your stuff, Thanwa.

738
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:22,780
So we will go back to our room.

739
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:42,850
You have two hands,

740
00:54:43,370 --> 00:54:45,010
so you don't want to be
anyone's third wheel.

741
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:49,140
See you.

742
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:28,770
Thanwa.

743
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,340
You...

744
00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:36,500
Can you just not leave?

745
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:38,180
I'm begging you.

746
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:41,950
The time I spent with you in this house

747
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:44,590
is the best time of my life.

748
00:55:46,350 --> 00:55:48,420
But I can't stay here with you anymore.

749
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:26,060
No matter where you stay,

750
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:32,810
