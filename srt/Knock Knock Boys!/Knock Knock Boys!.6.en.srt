have you made the decision yet?

12
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,510
Whether you will come back to me?

13
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,030
Well...

14
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,790
Why do I have to give you an answer today?

15
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,190
It's something that sticks in my mind.

16
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,040
Come back to me.

17
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,530
We can give it a try.

18
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,620
Thank you, Thanwa.

"Knock Knock, Boys!"
(Episode 6)

35
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,770
Is something wrong?

36
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,180
Why does Almond look so sad?

37
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,250
So where did Almond go?

38
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,880
Over there. He hasn't had breakfast yet.

39
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,630
Oh, Almond, are you still angry?

40
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,070
Are those two people angry at each other?
What's going on this morning?

41
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,160
Almond, Almond.

42
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,730
We need to talk.

43
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:33,860
I don't want to talk.

44
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,490
I refuse to talk to people
who don't believe in me.

45
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,040
Hey, Almond.

46
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,570
I am sorry that

47
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,080
I blamed you for filming

48
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,190
Jumper and Shawn's clip.

49
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,470
Almond.

50
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,860
What the heck are you doing?

51
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,950
It's none of your business.

52
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,210
Did you really film me?

53
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,830
Jumper, I can explain.

54
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,380
The evidence is clear.

55
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,300
The clothes that I left at your house

56
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,570
were on the toilet.

57
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,210
Why did you do that?

58
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,710
It's not that. It was not me.

59
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,980
I did not film that clip.

60
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:05,320
Do you know

61
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,690
what you've done?

62
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,540
My family found out about the real me.

63
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,100
This is it, right?

64
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,210
Are you happy now?

65
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,150
Jumper, I can explain.

66
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,640
How do you want to explain?

67
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,760
I thought you were

68
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,650
my good friend.

69
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:26,560
But now you are not.

70
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,830
So, how do you know for sure

71
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,060
that Almond really filmed it?

72
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,560
The evidence is crystal clear.

73
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:35,320
Wouldn't you think this way too, Latte?

74
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,160
Hey, stop, stop.

75
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:44,900
Both of you stop.

76
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,440
Don't fight with each other, calm down.

77
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:52,530
Almond.

78
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,040
What the heck?

79
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,330
Hey, Almond.

80
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:57,730
Are you hurt?

81
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,190
Hey, Almond.

82
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,680
Peak.

83
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,050
What do you think of Almond?

84
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,280
He is not that kind of person.

85
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,380
Do you agree with me?

86
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,320
Yes, right.

87
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:23,600
But I can't figure out

88
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,550
who would dare to secretly film
students inside the university?

89
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,700
If you check the security cameras,
you could probably know the culprit.

90
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,440
That's true.

91
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,230
You are worthy of being a programmer.

92
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,640
You have knowledge.

93
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,810
Unlike when you taste food.

94
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,360
Oh, Peak.

95
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,890
Today, I will ask you to join me
at the new steam bun shop.

96
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,600
- This restaurant is very famous...
- Peak.

97
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,750
Can you go shopping with me?

98
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,320
What? Right now?

99
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,630
There aren't many people in the morning.

100
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,920
Let's go shopping together.

101
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,790
Wait...

102
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,820
I have to work. You just go by yourself.

103
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,280
I'll give you one more chance to answer.

104
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:19,800
I will do my work tomorrow.

105
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,370
I will be back soon.

106
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,060
Good boy.

107
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,150
- I will be back soon, Thanwa.
- Yeah.

108
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:28,160
Wait for me.

109
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,660
(Max: Would you come to meet me?)

110
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,780
I will drop you here.

111
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,200
I will park my car first
and come to meet you.

112
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:40,730
Thank you.

113
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:45,110
Cappucino

114
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,190
with one pump of syrup.

115
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,260
Sprinkle cocoa powder in the milk foam.

116
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:49,890
Just followed this recipe.

117
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,250
I was not going to order it.

118
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,030
So, I ordered it for you.

119
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,340
Because today,

120
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,090
we will have a long talk.

121
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,090
Initially I was afraid

122
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,360
that you wouldn't come to meet me.

123
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,850
I just came to see my senior,

124
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,480
and nothing else.

125
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,250
Please forgive me, Thanwa.

126
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,750
I promise

127
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,390
I will never lie to you again.

128
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,310
You said that last time, right?

129
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,880
In the end, you just couldn't do it.

130
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,070
But during the time we were apart,

131
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,020
it made me realize my mistake

132
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,490
and reconsider things about myself.

133
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,670
It made me realize that
you were so important to me.

134
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,550
Do you really feel guilty?

135
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,830
Yes.

136
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,160
But you still make the same mistake
over and over again.

137
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,510
You still use money to
gamble on football, right?

138
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,930
I've really quit it now.

139
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,450
Let's get back together like before.

140
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,390
Every night, I feel very lonely.

141
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,530
You only think about
that kind of thing, right?

142
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,870
Okay, okay, okay.

143
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,870
Maybe I sounded a bit ridiculous.

144
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:19,820
I am sorry.

145
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,790
But what I want to say is

146
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,920
Thanwa is important to me.

147
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,540
But I still insist that

148
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,340
you and I will not go back
to the way we were before.

149
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,020
Don't be so definitive.

150
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,940
I know that Thanwa is not
a narrow-minded person.

151
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,540
You are now looking for a job,

152
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,970
and I know that you have money issues.

153
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,280
I can help.

154
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,220
I just want you
to come back and be with me.

155
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,410
I don't mind if you want a chance.

156
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,620
But I don't like it that
you use money as an excuse.

157
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,120
I have to go now.

158
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,240
Thanwa.

159
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:05,000
Check, please.

160
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,310
- Hey.
- Yeah?

161
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,380
If I was not available,

162
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,810
who else would come with you?

163
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:18,410
You are free anyway.

164
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,230
Hey, you.

165
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:29,400
Is it really so scary

166
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,460
to go back and talk to your father?

167
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:39,800
Actually, you have always tried
to make your father proud.

168
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,130
And your father is very proud of you.

169
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,080
Just like you said,

170
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,390
it's difficult to say.

171
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:53,780
If I decide to do something
that makes him sad,

172
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,070
how disappointed will he be in me?

173
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,690
But that is something in the future

174
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,540
that we cannot foresee.

175
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,500
In the end, we ultimately have to choose.

176
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,250
Even if you deny the choice,

177
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,050
technically, that's still making a choice.

178
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,770
Don't you want to be a
person who actually makes it?

179
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,590
What if I make the wrong choice?

180
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,150
It might have consequences

181
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,210
that we can't solve at all.

182
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,360
But it's important that we choose.

183
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,550
Choose for yourself today

184
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,780
and for the future.

185
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,150
I understand.

186
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,350
But I don't know how to handle
my father's expectations.

187
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,440
There is no need to do anything.

188
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,350
Everyone has their own feelings.

189
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,160
Why do we have to bear them?

190
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,160
What they feel is not what we feel, right?

191
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,980
But actually,

192
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,120
deep down, you want to go back
and ask your father

193
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,720
to cancel our wedding, right?

194
00:11:51,438 --> 00:11:52,728
Because

195
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,910
you already have someone you like.

196
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:00,290
Well...

197
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:01,750
you...

198
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:03,890
Who are you referring to?

199
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:05,250
Oh!

200
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,050
I am not a silly person like you.

201
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,340
How about Thanwa?

202
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,610
You like him, right?

203
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:21,770
I don't know.

204
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,870
You don't know?

205
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:27,220
Then, if you don't like him that much,

206
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,330
you can come back with me, right?

207
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,860
See?

208
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:36,240
Just go back to clear up the problem.

209
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,060
Then whoever you like,

210
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,690
I will fully support you.

211
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,540
The basket is fully loaded!

212
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,610
Oh, that is destiny.

213
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,070
What?

214
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,700
Okay.

215
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:05,810
The timing is right.

216
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,100
Go and tell Thanwa about your feelings.

217
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,000
What feelings?

218
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,620
Whatever feelings you have,

219
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,550
just let him know.

220
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:17,330
You said you don't want to do regret it later.

221
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,400
It's easy to tell other people,
but it's hard to do it myself.

222
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,250
If you can't do it,
you shouldn't tell people what to do.

223
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,700
Just go.

224
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,020
Take a breath and go.

225
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,430
What is it?

226
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,750
Fighting, take a deep breath.

227
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:43,790
You like him, you like him.

228
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:44,630
Just go.

229
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:47,120
You are such a coward.
One, two.

230
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,380
Three. Go.

231
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:56,770
I'll see you later.

232
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,630
Go.

233
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:08,530
Having come this far, it cannot fail.

234
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:20,960
Oh, sorry.

235
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:23,130
That's all right.

236
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,610
You go to the left, I go to the right.

237
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:31,450
Yes.

238
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,870
Your right side is my left.

239
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:38,190
So, that is correct.

240
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,130
My left side is your right side.

241
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,920
I'm sorry.

242
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,060
Are you trying to annoy me?

243
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:49,900
No.

244
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,100
Please go.

245
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,390
Has Peak told him yet?

246
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,800
It should be on this shelf.

247
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,890
Sorry, it's an accident.

248
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,100
It's you again.

249
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,190
You are such a careless person.

250
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,230
I'm walking here.

251
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,830
I'm also strolling my cart on my path.

252
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:15,860
Right.

253
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:19,530
I'll go over there.

254
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:27,520
Come on, our golden minutes products.

255
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,620
50% off. Only nine pieces.

256
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,120
First come, first served.

257
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,830
If you want to buy it, come over.

258
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,780
No more products
once they are on sales.

259
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,780
Hurry up, pick the one you want.

260
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:41,030
Hurry up, pick the one you want.
One product for one purchase.

261
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,380
Pick it up, come on.

262
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,220
One product for one purchase.

263
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,480
So, are you not afraid to fail?

264
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,190
I am afraid.

265
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,010
If I love that thing enough,

266
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,380
it's worth taking a risk, right?

267
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,820
When you want something,
but you can't get it,

268
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,520
it will always stick in your mind.

269
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:06,650
That's true.

270
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:08,190
Having said that,

271
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,730
just don't do something

272
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:13,850
that you will regret later.

273
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,370
I have been looking for you. Here you are.

274
00:17:24,832 --> 00:17:26,552
Let's go. I'll give you a ride.

275
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,630
So, have you found him?

276
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,840
Oh...

277
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,040
Why do you look so tired?

278
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,320
Let's go and pay for these.

279
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:54,130
I'll carry it for you.

280
00:17:54,651 --> 00:17:55,491
All right.

281
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,480
Oh, I'll buy this pack too.

282
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,840
Let's go.

283
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,340
He is the one that
Jumper punched this morning.

284
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,700
Is he the one who filmed the clip?

285
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:16,360
He looks good but he is a psycho.

286
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:19,400
That's right.
How could he secretly film them?

287
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,560
The clip has gone viral.

288
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,280
Let's go.

289
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,240
I downloaded it on my phone too.

290
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,640
Almond.

291
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,100
What is wrong with you guys?

292
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,450
Everyone,

293
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:38,440
this whole story has not proven to be true.

294
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,350
Let's not judge yet, okay?

295
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:43,380
Let's wait for the truth to come out first
and then talk about it.

296
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,530
She is his friend, so she is on his side.

297
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,010
It's gone viral.

298
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,070
Yes, let's go.

299
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,430
Almond.

300
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,600
Almond.

301
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,990
Just get out, Latte.

302
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,250
I just want to be alone.

303
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:28,730
Almond.

304
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,930
I am sorry

305
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,180
for blaming you that
you filmed that clip.

306
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,330
It's not my intention.

307
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,780
Well, I was shocked about
Jumper and Shawn.

308
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,960
But I do believe that

309
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:49,880
you did not do such a thing.

310
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:57,960
You don't have to be worried

311
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:00,510
that there won't be anyone by your side.

312
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,660
You still have me,

313
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,880
Peak and Thanwa,

314
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,340
and also Lookpeach.

315
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,910
You are not alone at all.

316
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,540
We will try to find the way
to prove this together.

317
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,540
We will go through it together.

318
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:03,840
You can't get in. The bathroom is closed.

319
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,130
The toilet is clogged and overflowing.

320
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,050
Please go to another building.

321
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,950
You have already seen this.

322
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,090
Do you still think
that Almond filmed the clip?

323
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:23,870
For me, it's no big deal.

324
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,170
But for Jumper,

325
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:27,650
it means his whole world collapsed.

326
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,630
Because Jumper

327
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:32,530
was keeping his sexual orientation
from his family.

328
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:34,980
Oh,

329
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,890
I feel very bad for Jumper.

330
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,920
He must be feeling very bad, right?

331
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,650
Quite bad.

332
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,400
But I will try to talk to him

333
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:48,020
whether we can ask the university
to check the security cameras.

334
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:50,750
Because this happened in the university.

335
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,480
We can find out something.

336
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:54,650
True.

337
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,840
We should find something.

338
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,900
But really, for this incident,

339
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,410
the person who did the wrong thing
is the one who filmed it.

340
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:03,110
There is nothing to do
with the people in the clip.

341
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,440
This is normal human nature.

342
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:06,790
I don't understand

343
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:09,990
why society must make it
such a big deal like that.

344
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,170
But I do understand.

345
00:22:13,902 --> 00:22:15,552
The person who filmed the clip
had bad intentions.

346
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,100
The clip that went out

347
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,620
made people who watched it
think too much and was a bad look.

348
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:22,260
The person who filmed the clip
is a really bad person.

349
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:23,930
This is so ugly.

350
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,060
If I find him,

351
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:26,950
I will...

352
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,120
Beat him severely.

353
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,690
Oh, I must use the toilet.

354
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:38,690
Do not enter.

355
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,750
The pipe is clogged,
please go to another building.

356
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,190
I have an idea.

357
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,510
I think there is someone
who should be able to help us.

358
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,110
Who?

359
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,350
- Oh.
- Oh.

360
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:04,680
You two are thinking alike. Absolutely.

361
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,290
Maybe not.

362
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:14,140
You two bought the same things for sure.

363
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,850
He bought a lot.

364
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:33,570
Latte.

365
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,480
Are you still stressed?

366
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:36,860
Yes.

367
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,220
Do you want me to help with anything?

368
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,360
That's okay.

369
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,220
Peak can help.

370
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,440
Okay.

371
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:03,050
Since everyone is not in the mood today,

372
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:05,110
Chef Jane will cook for you.

373
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,580
Give it to me.

374
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,670
That's all right.

375
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,760
We'll help you.

376
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,500
Okay. Let's do it.

377
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:17,550
Let's go.

378
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:24,290
Thanwa, come on.

379
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:25,710
All right.

380
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:38,780
"Knock Knock, Boys!"

381
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,180
Thanwa.

382
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,510
May I ask you something?

383
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:09,970
Yes.

384
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:12,740
What do you think of Peak?

385
00:25:15,715 --> 00:25:18,265
Well, we are friends.

386
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:20,100
Just a friend?

387
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,900
But I think

388
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,440
Peak probably sees you differently.

389
00:25:27,457 --> 00:25:28,857
It seems like
there is more to it than that.

390
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:32,810
Really?

391
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,980
But we don't have other relationships.

392
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:38,320
You don't have to be worried.

393
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,030
I am not worried at all.

394
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:44,140
Actually,

395
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:46,570
I am not worried

396
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,420
but other people are.

397
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,330
The story about it is quite complicated.

398
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:55,020
He, who caused the problem,

399
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:56,870
seems not to know anything.

400
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,840
So,

401
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,170
is it really that bad?

402
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,280
Yes.

403
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,400
If it weren't so bad,

404
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:09,520
Peak wouldn't have run away and lived here,

405
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,290
and made me come to find him here.

406
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,790
I think I will make him
a pork curry wrap,

407
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,000
so he would miss his home.

408
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,470
And he would agree to go back with me.

409
00:26:28,251 --> 00:26:31,061
A pork curry wrap has a meaning, right?

410
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:33,510
Yes, it is so meaningful.

411
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,760
Peak loved eating it so much
when he was young.

412
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,780
I put a lot of effort in cooking it.

413
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,800
I want him to think it through,

414
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,740
but he ran away and lived here for so long.

415
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:49,540
I think it's about time for him
to go back and clear things up.

416
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:54,480
If you help me convince him,

417
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,910
it would be good.

418
00:27:09,504 --> 00:27:10,894
You only eat that dish.

419
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,660
Yeah.

420
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,140
Did I wrap it nicely?

421
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,290
Yes.

422
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,230
Do you know who did it?

423
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,360
Who?

424
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,050
Well,

425
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,830
I just gave her a hand.

426
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,040
Well, Almond,

427
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,960
you should try this.

428
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,420
She cooked so well and it looks tasty.

429
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,020
I am full now.

430
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:48,950
Almond, leave it there.

431
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:50,590
I'll clean it myself. You go get some rest.

432
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,680
Thank you, Jane.

433
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,160
Are you two full?

434
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,840
Yeah.

435
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:17,640
Yeah.

436
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,500
Do you want more rice, Jane?
I get it for you.

437
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,050
Actually, I want to eat more.

438
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,210
But I have changed my mind.

439
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:29,020
Please wash the dishes for me.

440
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:30,780
- Wait.
- Bye.

441
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,060
Let's go.

442
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,390
Almond.

443
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:11,210
Almond.

444
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,480
Almond.

445
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:15,890
Where to go?

446
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,510
No, I don't want to go anywhere.

447
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,530
Are you going to be sad
like an abandoned dog?

448
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,750
Yes.

449
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:26,220
Let me rot and die.

450
00:29:28,365 --> 00:29:30,805
I won't let you rot in my house,
it'll stink.

451
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:31,830
Let's go. Get up.

452
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,950
- What is it?
- Get up.

453
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,960
I won't go.

454
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,680
Where are you going to take me?

455
00:29:37,705 --> 00:29:39,795
I'm not taking you to the temple
and leaving you there. Come on.

456
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:41,780
I don't want to go.

457
00:29:42,226 --> 00:29:43,936
Ouch! You are so heavy.

458
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,380
You are so heavy.

459
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,410
Why are you so heavy like this?

460
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:56,880
Get in the car.

461
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,390
Let's go, bro. Get in.

462
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:01,790
Let's go now.

463
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,670
The gate is open.

464
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,390
Just get in.

465
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:30,140
Latte, why did you bring me here?

466
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,880
I am not in the mood to sing.

467
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,410
I've already paid for the room.

468
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:34,400
Hurry up.

469
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,240
You already paid, so you just sing alone.

470
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,400
I am not in the mood.

471
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,130
Don't make too much of a fuss, hurry up.

472
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,250
I told you, I'm in no mood to sing now.

473
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,490
- Let me go.
- Just sing with me.

474
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:46,060
- Let me go.
- Ouch!

475
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,420
Latte, are you injured?

476
00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:00,780
You are not in the mood.

477
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:02,900
But I am.

478
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,990
I am sorry. I did not mean to hurt you.

479
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:07,510
Please don't do it to me.

480
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,780
I am sorry.

481
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:12,830
No. No!

482
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:15,870
Latte, let me go.

483
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:19,170
I am scared. Let me go, I am scared.

484
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,680
I am scared.

485
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,230
I am scared. No, please.

486
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,490
What?

487
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:28,030
Do you think I'm going to kill you here?

488
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:32,510
One,

489
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:34,490
two,

490
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:35,860
three.

491
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:38,050
Ta-da!

492
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:38,890
Almond.

493
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,520
Lookpeach.

494
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:43,930
What is going on?

495
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,520
No one wants to see you sad.

496
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,160
Latte.

497
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:58,970
Lookpeach.

498
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,800
We will make you smile today.

499
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:17,840
Thank you.

500
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,990
So shall we sing now?

501
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,030
Let's sing.

502
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:28,070
Turn on the screen.

503
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,320
Which song are we going to sing?

504
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,590

Thank you.

524
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,820
Then, I have to go now.

525
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,860
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

526
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:55,830
Today was very fun, Latte.

527
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:57,170
Thank you very much.

528
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:59,010
No problem,

529
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,610
it's better than
letting you rot at home, right?

530
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:04,910
Oh!

531
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:09,940
I bought it for you.

532
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,420
What for?

533
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:15,170
When I saw it, I thought of you.

534
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:21,950
This one?

535
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:29,400
It's good to smile a lot.

536
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,890
Why are you so good to me?

537
00:34:34,365 --> 00:34:35,245
Then give it back to me.

538
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,280
You already gave me.

539
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:43,630
It's mine now.

540
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:45,310
Okay.

541
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:47,390
Let's go.

542
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,590
You woke up early, Jane.

543
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,200
I didn't want to, but I couldn't sleep.

544
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,790
Jane, where is Peak now?

545
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:22,720
He has a meeting with headquarters today,

546
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,210
so he had to leave very early.

547
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:25,850
Okay.

548
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,950
Didn't he tell you?

549
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,480
Nope.

550
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,300
Peak is always forgetful like this.

551
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,480
He's been forgetful since he was a kid.

552
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:42,930
Thanwa.

553
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,350
Do you agree with me?

554
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:46,710
Well,

555
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:50,123
Peak seems to be someone
who can live anywhere, and eat

556
00:35:50,147 --> 00:35:52,640
anything. But actually he
is a difficult one to please.

557
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:53,960
Really?

558
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:55,760
I don't think so.

559
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,720
About food,

560
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,990
he is very picky.

561
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,130
He's the kind of person

562
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,550
who likes to eat undercooked fried eggs.

563
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,030
But the edge must be crispy.

564
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,170
A kind of person who is very fussy.

565
00:36:13,062 --> 00:36:18,712
One more thing, what he hates the most
is sausage cheese.

566
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:23,610
Well, when we were kids,

567
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:26,220
someone gave us sausage cheese.

568
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,700
It was fresh from the microwave,

569
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,070
so it was very hot.

570
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:31,090
Peak was very hungry,

571
00:36:31,115 --> 00:36:32,535
and he ate the whole piece.

572
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:36,150
His mouth and tongue were swollen
and he screamed.

573
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,190
Ever since that day,

574
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:41,980
I have never seen him
eat sausage cheese again.

575
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:46,130
How is it?

576
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:48,550
Well-done fried eggs with crispy edge.

577
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:52,160
This is very crispy.

578
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,120
So delicious.

579
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:01,010
Peak, pay attention when you eat.

580
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:04,790
This is so delicious.

581
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:06,780
Are you happy now?

582
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,140
Yeah.

583
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:10,490
I won't cook for you next time.

584
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,870
There's nothing as good as
Thanwa's sausage cheese.

585
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:20,480
Latte, you are naughty.

586
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,470
I said the truth.

587
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,440
Wow, so delicious.

588
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:32,430
How is it? Delicious, right?

589
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,370
Yeah, it's all right.

590
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:45,820
That means Peak really
doesn't like sausage cheese.

591
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:47,960
As far as I know, yes.

592
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,960
But

593
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,830
if you need to know more,
you can always ask me.

594
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,920
So, may I ask you something?

595
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,890
I see you're extremely close to Peak,

596
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:02,660
have you known him since you were kids?

597
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,070
Oh,

598
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:05,450
so close that

599
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,030
we can become siblings.

600
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,010
- May I complain?
- Yes.

601
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,320
The reason that I had to come here

602
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,000
is because I had already
booked a wedding dress.

603
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:16,840
Having said that, I was so annoyed.

604
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:18,560
He didn't help me with anything.

605
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,980
And this.

606
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:23,850
Peak's father is calling non-stop.

607
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:26,990
Since Peak ran away,

608
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:29,600
his father has been very stressed,
so he kept calling me.

609
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,430
I don't know what to answer.

610
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:34,200
If Peak doesn't agree to go back with me,

611
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:36,490
his father would be very sad.

612
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,450
If he's sad,

613
00:38:38,678 --> 00:38:40,908
Peak will be the
one who will regret it.

614
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,160
You understand, right?

615
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,370
One moment, please.

616
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,500
Okay, just pick up the phone.

617
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:49,910
Hello, Uncle.

618
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,100
Yes, I had breakfast. What about you?

619
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:54,570
Yes, all right.

620
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,810
Don't worry about me.
I eat and sleep very well.

621
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:00,230
Have you had breakfast?

622
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,410
Oh,

623
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:06,270
you have to try to eat something. Don't worry.

624
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,750
(Give me a chance.)

625
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,520
I know about that stupid clip.

626
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,590
I think the best way
to solve this problem is

627
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:26,250
ask you to leave the team.

628
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,620
Do you understand?

629
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,370
Yes, I do.

630
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:31,410
Go and pack your stuff.

631
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:35,130
Yes. Thank you.

632
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,000
I won't be able to compete
in the university sports game next week.

633
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,720
Coach kicked me off the team.

634
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,310
This is unfair.

635
00:39:53,562 --> 00:39:54,572
All we did was just a kiss.

636
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,420
We didn't go so far.

637
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:57,910
The culprit who filmed the clip

638
00:39:57,910 --> 00:39:59,180
meant to have everyone misunderstand.

639
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,260
He kept only our kissing scene.

640
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,710
So people did not see the end

641
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:03,880
that we went somewhere else.

642
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:05,860
He wanted that from the beginning.

643
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:08,070
Why does something like
this happened in my life?

644
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,250
Hey, Jumper.

645
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:12,880
It's all right.

646
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:15,800
Let's go.

647
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:19,910
You are okay, right?

648
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:20,790
Yes.

649
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,760
So full.

650
00:40:37,975 --> 00:40:39,415
Peak doesn't even come back home.

651
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,380
Jane sneaked out with her friends. But why...

652
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:44,430
did you cook many dishes today?

653
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:47,190
Over there,

654
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,650
there's a lot of food.

655
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,180
If I don't cook them, they will be wasted.

656
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,190
Is anything bothering you?

657
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:58,270
Why's that?

658
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:00,060
Do I look so stressed?

659
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:04,140
Oh, you cooked too many dishes.

660
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,320
Like you wanted to release some stress.

661
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,670
You think too much, just eat.

662
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,150
Or you will have to try
my cooking next time.

663
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,940
If I eat what you cook,

664
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:19,610
I will definitely have diarrhea.

665
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,410
You look down on me so much.

666
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:24,960
I am a legendary chef.

667
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:26,810
I am an expert in making spicy salad.

668
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:28,630
Too hot to handle.

669
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:31,780
Too hot that will make
you beg for your life.

670
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,530
Latte.

671
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:34,840
That's enough.

672
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,900
I would never eat your spicy salad.

673
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,600
So, you will starve to death.

674
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,630
That's enough.

675
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,090
You both stop fighting now.

676
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:43,320
After finishing the meal,
take the dishes to the sink.

677
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,160
And help wash the dishes.

678
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,270
Okay. I will finish the meal soon.

679
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:57,210
Is that Peak?

680
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:59,230
I'm sure he forgot his key again.

681
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:03,050
I will open the door.

682
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,520
Surprise!

683
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,510
Max.

684
00:42:18,535 --> 00:42:19,945
I bought your favorite food.

685
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:24,240
How can you be sure it's still my favorite?

686
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:27,640
The things you like

687
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,700
cannot be easily changed.

688
00:42:33,930 --> 00:42:35,160
Won't you let me in?

689
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:36,980
Oh.

690
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,460
Please come in.

691
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,490
You can sit here.

692
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:52,330
Thanwa.

693
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,340
Thank you.

694
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:04,510
Who is this? Thanwa's friend?

695
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:06,990
I don't know,
it's the first time I've seen him.

696
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:24,020
The house looks good.

697
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:25,920
How many people live there?

698
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:27,250
Are there only men?

699
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:32,570
Finally, you made it here.

700
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:37,000
You do know what kind of person I am.

701
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:39,100
Well...

702
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:41,790
a type of person
that if I want, I will get.

703
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:47,220
I just don't want to lose
someone important in my life.

704
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,650
So have you decided yet?

705
00:43:55,930 --> 00:43:57,210
Will you go back and live with me?

706
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,520
Why do I have to answer you today?

707
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:03,150
Because I don't want to wait anymore.

708
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:06,320
Some things are unresolved.
Leaving it for too long is not good.

709
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:09,870
Come back to live with me.

710
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:22,900
Jane is...

711
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:24,640
I am Peak's fiance.

712
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:30,310
I want him to think it through, but he
ran away and stayed here for too long.

713
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:33,080
I think it's about time
to go back and clear things.

714
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:36,950
If you help me convince him,
it would be good.

715
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,520
If Peak doesn't come back with me,

716
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:46,840
his father will be very sad.

717
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,590
If he is sad,

718
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:51,250
Peak will be the one who will regret.

719
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:06,150
I can try.

720
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,410
But don't expect anything.

721
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:11,160
Let's start by just dating.

722
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:14,050
Thank you, Thanwa.

723
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,140
Peak, this is... uh...

724
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,080
I am Max.

725
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:36,250
I am Thanwa's ex-boyfriend.

726
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:37,780
We have just got back together.

727
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:47,800
Is that right?

728
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:52,970
Yes, make yourself at home.

729
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:54,870
Oh, Peak.

730
00:45:56,970 --> 00:45:58,200
Would you like to eat anything?

731
00:45:58,470 --> 00:45:59,900
I have some food inside.

732
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,950
I have already eaten.

733
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:05,580
I will go to bed now.

734
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,130
♪ On that day ♪

735
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:42,270
