00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:48,430
I would like to thank you everyone
who came to my wedding.

11
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,630
I want to...

12
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,480

"Knock Knock, Boys!"
(Episode 12)

29
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,750
I am sorry.

30
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,070
I am just overjoyed.

31
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,120
So, Peak won't have
to get married, right? Uncle?

32
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,640
- Yes.
- Who said that?

33
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,380
Peak must marry me!

34
00:02:30,992 --> 00:02:31,992
Darn it!

35
00:02:33,572 --> 00:02:35,932
I just went to clear things up
with the wedding venue.

36
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:39,802
According to the contract,
if we cancel now,

37
00:02:40,152 --> 00:02:42,502
we will have to forfeit
the deposit and pay a fine.

38
00:02:43,632 --> 00:02:45,992
So, I think that the wedding
must happen no matter what.

39
00:02:46,712 --> 00:02:47,782
I am so sorry.

40
00:02:47,932 --> 00:02:49,972
But why did you confirm it
in the first place?

41
00:02:50,242 --> 00:02:51,182
So, you blame me?

42
00:02:52,162 --> 00:02:53,342
How did I know?

43
00:02:54,012 --> 00:02:55,512
You just did absolutely nothing,

44
00:02:55,512 --> 00:02:57,422
and ultimately if you did not
talk to your dad,

45
00:02:57,422 --> 00:02:58,962
we would have to get married.

46
00:02:59,182 --> 00:03:01,022
In the end,
it should turn out better, right?

47
00:03:01,482 --> 00:03:03,362
I will cover all the expenses.

48
00:03:03,802 --> 00:03:04,642
- No, don't do that.
- No, don't do that.

49
00:03:06,532 --> 00:03:08,392
You guys, may I share my idea?

50
00:03:09,402 --> 00:03:12,452
Don't tell me you'll organize
my wedding with you instead.

51
00:03:14,482 --> 00:03:15,432
Darn Latte!

52
00:03:16,542 --> 00:03:17,422
I'm just kidding.

53
00:03:19,152 --> 00:03:20,942
So, I think...

54
00:03:28,252 --> 00:03:29,092
What is it?

55
00:03:30,472 --> 00:03:31,312
Well...

56
00:03:37,022 --> 00:03:37,862
Peak.

57
00:03:38,372 --> 00:03:39,212
Hey.

58
00:03:39,372 --> 00:03:40,942
We have already checked out from hotel.

59
00:03:41,492 --> 00:03:42,832
Let's go back home.

60
00:03:44,342 --> 00:03:45,182
Peak.

61
00:03:46,302 --> 00:03:47,822
Just drive my other car.

62
00:03:48,612 --> 00:03:49,952
The car parked there and
will have no charge left.

63
00:03:50,512 --> 00:03:52,102
It's okay, Dad.

64
00:03:52,702 --> 00:03:53,802
I can go back with everyone.

65
00:03:54,662 --> 00:03:55,912
Take it and let Thanwa sit with you.

66
00:03:59,702 --> 00:04:01,312
Let's go together
to save on gas.

67
00:04:01,972 --> 00:04:02,812
This is good, Dad.

68
00:04:03,212 --> 00:04:05,492
Almond and I will go back first.

69
00:04:06,092 --> 00:04:07,462
My mom has already lent us a car.

70
00:04:07,462 --> 00:04:09,652
Let's go together and save money.

71
00:04:09,952 --> 00:04:12,112
Let's go. Just go now.

72
00:04:12,302 --> 00:04:13,932
Goodbye.

73
00:04:13,932 --> 00:04:15,102
See you guys. See you at home.

74
00:04:15,102 --> 00:04:16,362
- Why can't we go together?
- Get in the car.

75
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:18,072
We can go back, just the two of us.

76
00:04:22,422 --> 00:04:23,282
Go now

77
00:04:23,572 --> 00:04:25,622
before it gets dark.

78
00:04:31,192 --> 00:04:32,032
Thank you.

79
00:04:39,342 --> 00:04:41,342
So, we are leaving now, Dad.

80
00:04:42,242 --> 00:04:43,082
Goodbye.

81
00:04:43,702 --> 00:04:44,572
Goodbye.

82
00:04:45,432 --> 00:04:46,272
Peak.

83
00:04:46,772 --> 00:04:47,612
Let's go.

84
00:04:54,632 --> 00:04:55,472
Hello, Mom.

85
00:04:55,482 --> 00:04:57,522
Almond, is the mission accomplished?

86
00:04:57,902 --> 00:04:59,082
Mission accomplished.

87
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,022
Everything is fine now.

88
00:05:01,222 --> 00:05:03,972
That's good. May I talk to Latte?

89
00:05:04,642 --> 00:05:05,482
Yes.

90
00:05:06,692 --> 00:05:07,732
Me?

91
00:05:07,732 --> 00:05:08,572
Yes.

92
00:05:12,232 --> 00:05:13,072
Hello, Mom.

93
00:05:13,082 --> 00:05:15,722
Latte, please help me look after Almond.

94
00:05:15,722 --> 00:05:18,382
Just do it as good as
I look after him. Okay?

95
00:05:18,562 --> 00:05:20,222
Yes, I promise.

96
00:05:20,792 --> 00:05:22,352
Thank you, my dear.

97
00:05:22,352 --> 00:05:24,092
Yes. Goodbye.

98
00:05:27,032 --> 00:05:27,872
Yes, Mom?

99
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:29,352
I have to go now.

100
00:05:29,352 --> 00:05:30,732
Love you.

101
00:05:31,302 --> 00:05:32,142
What did you promise?

102
00:05:32,952 --> 00:05:33,932
I won't tell you.

103
00:05:35,882 --> 00:05:36,932
Tell me, please.

104
00:05:37,292 --> 00:05:38,132
No.

105
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:39,822
Please.

106
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:41,222
No.

107
00:05:41,532 --> 00:05:43,672
Tell me, please. I'll do whatever you want.

108
00:05:45,022 --> 00:05:46,292
You said that.

109
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:48,652
Only if I can do it.

110
00:05:49,472 --> 00:05:51,522
Then I won't tell you.

111
00:05:51,962 --> 00:05:53,022
Whatever you want, I'll do it.

112
00:05:53,882 --> 00:05:55,272
Your mom told me that...

113
00:05:55,642 --> 00:05:56,482
What?

114
00:05:56,962 --> 00:05:58,382
You have to move into my room.

115
00:05:59,072 --> 00:05:59,982
Did she really say that?

116
00:06:03,152 --> 00:06:04,092
I said this myself.

117
00:06:08,492 --> 00:06:10,202
But what your mom told me is...

118
00:06:11,984 --> 00:06:13,482
She asked me to promise her that

119
00:06:14,842 --> 00:06:16,252
I will take very good care of you.

120
00:06:17,272 --> 00:06:18,492
Just like she takes care of you.

121
00:06:20,782 --> 00:06:22,132
So, I answered her that

122
00:06:23,242 --> 00:06:24,242
I promise I will.

123
00:06:31,282 --> 00:06:32,252
So, I already told you.

124
00:06:33,762 --> 00:06:35,512
You have to keep your word then.

125
00:06:36,832 --> 00:06:37,672
About what?

126
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,672
Well, move into my room.

127
00:07:14,472 --> 00:07:15,352
Let's take a break here.

128
00:07:17,262 --> 00:07:20,352
On the way, I asked you if you wanted
to stop and buy coffee first.

129
00:07:20,542 --> 00:07:22,462
But didn't you insist on driving
straight through without stopping?

130
00:07:23,102 --> 00:07:23,942
Are you worried?

131
00:07:25,002 --> 00:07:26,942
Yes, so you can hold on me.

132
00:07:28,362 --> 00:07:29,202
Really?

133
00:07:30,232 --> 00:07:31,122
Just order you coffee.

134
00:07:31,572 --> 00:07:32,412
I'll hold the table here.

135
00:07:32,742 --> 00:07:33,582
Come on.

136
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:03,922
What are you thinking?

137
00:08:07,482 --> 00:08:08,322
Hey, what are you thinking?

138
00:08:09,852 --> 00:08:11,942
I was thinking about
what you said to your dad.

139
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:14,842
I felt that you said it so well.

140
00:08:20,462 --> 00:08:21,732
I was just no longer afraid

141
00:08:23,632 --> 00:08:25,202
because I believed that
everyone was there to support me.

142
00:08:27,032 --> 00:08:27,872
See?

143
00:08:28,762 --> 00:08:31,012
Just have courage
and don't keep running away.

144
00:08:32,802 --> 00:08:33,642
That's right.

145
00:08:34,762 --> 00:08:35,982
I will not run away from it any longer.

146
00:08:38,582 --> 00:08:40,192
And we will continue to walk together.

147
00:08:57,152 --> 00:08:58,032
Don't you drink coffee?

148
00:08:59,562 --> 00:09:00,452
I will.

149
00:09:11,762 --> 00:09:12,602
Why don't you drink?

150
00:09:30,852 --> 00:09:32,712
Here. Like this.

151
00:09:33,972 --> 00:09:37,002
- You are so cute.
- Here is your orange juice, Latte.

152
00:09:37,002 --> 00:09:39,042
A glass of milk for you, Almond.

153
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:40,462
You just interrupted us.

154
00:09:41,182 --> 00:09:42,022
Come on.

155
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:46,942
Have you finished?

156
00:09:47,802 --> 00:09:49,422
Wait a second, almost done.

157
00:09:50,142 --> 00:09:50,982
Are you hungry?

158
00:09:51,192 --> 00:09:53,962
- So, it's not that. It's okay.
- Okay.

159
00:09:54,652 --> 00:09:55,492
Okay.

160
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:56,582
Thank you.

161
00:09:58,462 --> 00:09:59,412
Thank you.

162
00:10:01,632 --> 00:10:03,012
I'll do it. It's all right.

163
00:10:04,502 --> 00:10:05,822
Sit here. Sit down, please.

164
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:08,922
- You, sit down. You sit first.
- Okay.

165
00:10:10,322 --> 00:10:11,712
Peak, are you angry at me?

166
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:12,872
Here, your coffee.

167
00:10:13,562 --> 00:10:14,402
Thank you.

168
00:10:15,062 --> 00:10:16,252
Finally,

169
00:10:16,482 --> 00:10:20,082
a normal and peaceful morning again.

170
00:10:21,202 --> 00:10:22,822
What are you waiting for?
Give a round of applause.

171
00:10:23,902 --> 00:10:25,492
Great. Awesome.

172
00:10:26,702 --> 00:10:29,332
It's peaceful because you stopped
setting the alarm clock.

173
00:10:30,312 --> 00:10:31,152
That's true.

174
00:10:32,562 --> 00:10:34,522
So, how come he could wake up
on his own?

175
00:10:35,162 --> 00:10:36,562
Why wouldn't I?

176
00:10:37,412 --> 00:10:40,752
I drank milk and
slept with Almond from 9 p.m..

177
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,892
It wasn't even dawn when I woke up.

178
00:10:45,152 --> 00:10:46,002
Like an old person.

179
00:10:50,402 --> 00:10:52,362
You are just teasing me.

180
00:10:52,742 --> 00:10:53,582
You are so chatty.

181
00:10:54,402 --> 00:10:57,072
Let's finish breakfast
or we'll be late for class.

182
00:10:57,522 --> 00:10:59,982
Okay. Understood.

183
00:11:00,282 --> 00:11:01,652
I will finish my meal as fast as I can.

184
00:11:15,082 --> 00:11:15,922
Peak.

185
00:11:15,992 --> 00:11:16,832
What?

186
00:11:16,902 --> 00:11:18,782
I think next time I cook,

187
00:11:18,782 --> 00:11:20,472
I don't have to add sugar.

188
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:21,812
Why?

189
00:11:22,532 --> 00:11:23,992
Are you on a diet?

190
00:11:24,312 --> 00:11:25,462
It's not that.

191
00:11:25,712 --> 00:11:27,512
Look at how sweet they are.

192
00:11:28,032 --> 00:11:28,882
Wow!

193
00:11:29,842 --> 00:11:31,682
Thanwa, if you need some sweetness,

194
00:11:31,902 --> 00:11:33,172
I can make it happen for you.

195
00:11:33,642 --> 00:11:35,542
Here you go. So sweet.

196
00:11:39,382 --> 00:11:40,222
Enough.

197
00:11:40,572 --> 00:11:41,752
He is my man,

198
00:11:42,232 --> 00:11:43,202
I can look after him.

199
00:11:47,982 --> 00:11:49,182
So, here you go.

200
00:11:49,182 --> 00:11:51,252
Add all the sweetness by yourself.

201
00:11:53,442 --> 00:11:55,142
I still don't have bread.

202
00:11:55,732 --> 00:11:57,162
Yahoo!

203
00:12:00,282 --> 00:12:02,392
Choo choo! Yum!

204
00:12:05,582 --> 00:12:08,342
- Juice, orange juice.
- Water.

205
00:12:08,342 --> 00:12:09,182
Just a glass of water.

206
00:12:10,162 --> 00:12:12,222
Over there. It's over there.

207
00:12:14,262 --> 00:12:16,612
Glass, where is it? A glass.

208
00:12:17,352 --> 00:12:18,412
Here you go.

209
00:12:18,412 --> 00:12:19,972
- Is it washed yet?
- No, it's not.

210
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:22,652
Almond, come on.

211
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,412
Are you going to take it all here?

212
00:12:27,982 --> 00:12:28,972
Just in case

213
00:12:29,722 --> 00:12:31,602
when I want to read any subjects,
I have them all.

214
00:12:32,012 --> 00:12:33,392
This one, just put it in there.

215
00:12:33,392 --> 00:12:34,802
Okay.

216
00:12:35,512 --> 00:12:36,462
This one...

217
00:12:41,022 --> 00:12:42,462
Pack your bag neatly.

218
00:12:44,562 --> 00:12:46,532
Okay. I will carry it for you.

219
00:12:50,232 --> 00:12:51,072
Thanwa,

220
00:12:51,072 --> 00:12:52,652
we will go to university now.

221
00:12:52,882 --> 00:12:55,002
- See you.
- Goodbye.

222
00:12:57,112 --> 00:12:57,952
Bye-bye.

223
00:12:58,232 --> 00:12:59,072
See you.

224
00:13:05,822 --> 00:13:08,122
We're going early today.

225
00:13:09,342 --> 00:13:10,182
So cute.

226
00:13:11,642 --> 00:13:12,482
Thank you.

227
00:13:15,102 --> 00:13:16,262
Why aren't you dressed yet?

228
00:13:16,512 --> 00:13:17,382
We will go out together.

229
00:13:19,652 --> 00:13:20,492
Did I make an appointment with you?

230
00:13:21,732 --> 00:13:22,572
No.

231
00:13:23,482 --> 00:13:24,872
I just

232
00:13:25,932 --> 00:13:27,342
want to go out with

233
00:13:31,272 --> 00:13:32,112
my boyfriend.

234
00:13:39,162 --> 00:13:42,472
You... Say it again.

235
00:13:51,302 --> 00:13:52,302
Mr. Thanwa,

236
00:13:53,182 --> 00:13:54,022
could you please

237
00:13:55,222 --> 00:13:56,282
be my boyfriend?

238
00:13:57,992 --> 00:13:59,552
I can't live without you.

239
00:14:00,162 --> 00:14:02,052
Just like a programmer who
cannot live without a computer.

240
00:14:02,602 --> 00:14:03,572
If there are no computers,

241
00:14:04,142 --> 00:14:06,102
my life as a programmer
would be meaningless.

242
00:14:19,332 --> 00:14:20,172
Let's go to work.

243
00:14:20,822 --> 00:14:21,752
Wait a second.

244
00:14:23,022 --> 00:14:24,632
I want to change my outfit.

245
00:14:26,342 --> 00:14:27,322
Give me a moment.

246
00:14:27,502 --> 00:14:28,342
Let's go change it.

247
00:14:28,892 --> 00:14:31,282
I can't get dressed that way,
just wait a moment.

248
00:14:32,362 --> 00:14:33,202
Okay.

249
00:14:33,382 --> 00:14:35,902
We have 30 minutes, we will make it
on time. Let's go change the clothes.

250
00:14:36,682 --> 00:14:38,022
Peak!

251
00:14:50,062 --> 00:14:51,232
What's wrong with you, Latte?

252
00:14:51,982 --> 00:14:53,562
Just sit still, this is distracting.

253
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,282
There's a lot of content,

254
00:14:56,282 --> 00:14:57,412
who will remember all of these?

255
00:14:58,142 --> 00:15:00,312
But all the content here,

256
00:15:00,632 --> 00:15:02,042
our teacher has taught us in the class.

257
00:15:02,632 --> 00:15:03,472
See?

258
00:15:04,412 --> 00:15:05,892
Even Jumper who has to go
for sport training,

259
00:15:06,492 --> 00:15:07,702
he knows much more than you.

260
00:15:09,192 --> 00:15:10,912
But this is a first-year basic subject,

261
00:15:11,652 --> 00:15:12,492
besides,

262
00:15:12,772 --> 00:15:14,432
this is your second round
studying the first year.

263
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:20,812
I think my brain

264
00:15:21,022 --> 00:15:23,572
remembers only my boyfriend.

265
00:15:24,392 --> 00:15:25,962
I can't memorize the words on the page.

266
00:15:30,142 --> 00:15:31,412
I will remember this sentence

267
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:33,302
to use in my boylove fiction.

268
00:15:33,512 --> 00:15:36,222
How could you be so crazy
in love like this?

269
00:15:37,912 --> 00:15:39,142
- Be careful.
- What?

270
00:15:39,142 --> 00:15:41,022
- There are ants.
- Too many ants.

271
00:15:43,432 --> 00:15:44,632
This is so sweet.

272
00:15:44,922 --> 00:15:46,672
This is a honeymoon phase.

273
00:15:46,972 --> 00:15:48,212
We have been there before.

274
00:15:49,542 --> 00:15:50,942
What about it, Shawn?

275
00:15:51,232 --> 00:15:53,562
Are you saying that
our love is fading?

276
00:15:53,822 --> 00:15:54,772
Not at all.

277
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:57,392
- I still love you the same.
- Woo!

278
00:16:01,512 --> 00:16:02,942
- What is it?
- There are so many ants.

279
00:16:03,902 --> 00:16:04,952
So sweet!

280
00:16:04,952 --> 00:16:05,952
Be careful, you will get hurt.

281
00:16:06,342 --> 00:16:08,222
- Why?
- That is an Ant-Man.

282
00:16:12,092 --> 00:16:14,562
So, everyone, after the exams are over,

283
00:16:14,562 --> 00:16:17,612
I would like to invite everyone to
the launch party of our new boylove novel.

284
00:16:18,452 --> 00:16:19,392
Really?

285
00:16:19,392 --> 00:16:21,262
Just a small party.
I've only invited friends.

286
00:16:22,702 --> 00:16:23,542
That's good.

287
00:16:23,932 --> 00:16:25,342
I want to relieve stress after exams.

288
00:16:26,292 --> 00:16:27,472
Bring it on one set.

289
00:16:30,202 --> 00:16:31,042
Yes!

290
00:16:31,042 --> 00:16:32,962
(STUDIO 1)

291
00:16:35,142 --> 00:16:37,372
We should try the new pattern.

292
00:16:37,702 --> 00:16:39,132
- All right.
- We need to add something.

293
00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:41,082
So the client will like it more.

294
00:16:41,082 --> 00:16:42,952
Okay. I will make some change
and send it

295
00:16:42,952 --> 00:16:44,342
- to Thanwa and he will fix it.
- That's good.

296
00:16:44,342 --> 00:16:45,182
Okay.

297
00:16:47,552 --> 00:16:48,392
Thanwa.

298
00:16:49,352 --> 00:16:50,192
- Thanwa!
- What?

299
00:16:50,692 --> 00:16:51,532
Yes.

300
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:54,392
What kind of content
did we hire you to create again?

301
00:16:55,052 --> 00:16:57,722
You hire med for foodie content.

302
00:16:57,722 --> 00:16:59,752
You hired me yourself. Did you forget?

303
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:03,112
I'm sorry, I saw you smile
like you are in love.

304
00:17:03,112 --> 00:17:04,782
So, I think you are
making wedding content.

305
00:17:06,682 --> 00:17:07,522
Yes.

306
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:08,992
Are you in love?

307
00:17:10,382 --> 00:17:11,222
Well...

308
00:17:12,162 --> 00:17:13,952
Kind of like that.

309
00:17:15,512 --> 00:17:17,902
Let's just say, you're not single anymore.

310
00:17:17,902 --> 00:17:19,242
- Right, just like that.
- Yes.

311
00:17:19,242 --> 00:17:20,782
It's called being articulate.

312
00:17:20,782 --> 00:17:23,202
Speak with the confidence. Yes.

313
00:17:23,202 --> 00:17:24,962
- Just say it.
- Mr. Thanwa.

314
00:17:24,962 --> 00:17:28,152
Your boyfriend is waiting for you
at the front office.

315
00:17:28,962 --> 00:17:29,802
Yes, Aunty.

316
00:17:30,002 --> 00:17:30,842
That's fast.

317
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:32,862
He is good.

318
00:17:33,162 --> 00:17:34,642
He has a good skill.

319
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:36,832
He looked at his watch.

320
00:17:37,302 --> 00:17:38,652
Okay, I understand.

321
00:17:38,872 --> 00:17:40,212
Go ahead, don't worry about me.

322
00:17:40,212 --> 00:17:42,182
I know that this is the moment that...

323
00:17:42,182 --> 00:17:43,602
- It's typical for young people...
- Is that right?

324
00:17:43,602 --> 00:17:45,212
- We were there before.
- Thanwa always worries about people.

325
00:17:45,212 --> 00:17:47,132
- That's right.
- So, I'll tell you, don't worry about me.

326
00:17:48,072 --> 00:17:48,912
Thanwa!

327
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:50,042
He is already gone.

328
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:50,952
When did he leave?

329
00:17:51,062 --> 00:17:51,912
Right?

330
00:17:51,912 --> 00:17:52,872
But he is so passionate.

331
00:17:53,142 --> 00:17:54,112
He is good.

332
00:18:02,412 --> 00:18:04,782
- No, it's not that.
- I am just saying...

333
00:18:05,732 --> 00:18:06,832
Unless...?

334
00:18:12,912 --> 00:18:15,582
- I don't think it's about that.
- It's not that.

335
00:18:18,572 --> 00:18:19,412
Hey, Peak.

336
00:18:22,842 --> 00:18:23,732
What are you doing here?

337
00:18:28,092 --> 00:18:30,662
I'm here to apply for a job.

338
00:18:31,032 --> 00:18:31,872
What happened?

339
00:18:32,332 --> 00:18:33,702
Or are you fired?

340
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:39,832
I am...

341
00:18:41,282 --> 00:18:43,472
here to apply to be

342
00:18:44,812 --> 00:18:46,152
Mr. Thanwa's driver.

343
00:18:47,552 --> 00:18:49,732
Peak, I don't have the money
to pay your salary.

344
00:18:50,622 --> 00:18:51,652
Uh...

345
00:18:52,642 --> 00:18:55,012
I would like to request

346
00:18:57,432 --> 00:18:58,642
Mr. Thanwa's time instead.

347
00:18:59,632 --> 00:19:00,472
You can have it.

348
00:19:01,952 --> 00:19:03,832
So, today where is Mr. Driver taking me to?

349
00:19:09,272 --> 00:19:10,882
Do you know if I am not impressed,

350
00:19:11,332 --> 00:19:12,812
I can fire you?

351
00:19:22,742 --> 00:19:24,462
Please hurry, Mr. Driver.

352
00:19:27,242 --> 00:19:30,082
(STUDIO 1)

353
00:19:32,342 --> 00:19:33,612
Thank you.

354
00:19:37,232 --> 00:19:38,982
This is our menu, you can order now.

355
00:19:38,982 --> 00:19:40,392
- Yes.
- Thank you.

356
00:19:46,212 --> 00:19:47,602
This is a new restaurant.
Would it be delicious?

357
00:19:50,042 --> 00:19:52,122
Even if it's new,
don't look down on it.

358
00:19:52,782 --> 00:19:54,322
The food is so delicious.

359
00:19:55,982 --> 00:19:57,582
I believe the shop is good.

360
00:19:57,842 --> 00:19:59,392
But it's more like I don't believe you.

361
00:19:59,392 --> 00:20:01,352
Normally you just grab and eat.

362
00:20:01,662 --> 00:20:03,212
Do you know what is called delicious?

363
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:05,502
Mr. Thanwa.

364
00:20:06,782 --> 00:20:08,172
I am a changed man now.

365
00:20:10,022 --> 00:20:12,602
Since that time you taught me
to savor food,

366
00:20:13,072 --> 00:20:14,962
I have tasted more delicious food.

367
00:20:16,372 --> 00:20:17,372
You're exaggerating.

368
00:20:18,132 --> 00:20:19,212
This is true,

369
00:20:19,812 --> 00:20:22,132
and the more we get to work
with anonymous reviewers,

370
00:20:22,382 --> 00:20:23,222
seriously,

371
00:20:24,142 --> 00:20:26,222
it's really nice to eat good food.

372
00:20:28,432 --> 00:20:30,482
Hey, why are you laughing?

373
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:32,182
I'm not just saying this.

374
00:20:33,802 --> 00:20:35,902
Here. I have proof.

375
00:20:37,512 --> 00:20:38,922
Oh my god!

376
00:20:38,922 --> 00:20:42,172
(Big Belly Restaurant)

377
00:20:42,172 --> 00:20:43,012
How about that?

378
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,492
I set up the poll myself.

379
00:20:45,432 --> 00:20:46,382
Because honestly,

380
00:20:46,532 --> 00:20:48,192
I know that I may not be as good

381
00:20:48,192 --> 00:20:49,902
at knowing tastes like you.

382
00:20:50,562 --> 00:20:53,492
But it's about collecting statistics
and checking feedback from the customers.

383
00:20:54,332 --> 00:20:55,172
It's my thing.

384
00:20:55,612 --> 00:20:57,972
Is this poll for me?

385
00:21:02,132 --> 00:21:02,972
Well...

386
00:21:04,032 --> 00:21:05,482
Well, it's for me too.

387
00:21:05,902 --> 00:21:07,152
If it's not delicious,

388
00:21:07,822 --> 00:21:08,942
you can't just scold me.

389
00:21:09,572 --> 00:21:10,412
All right.

390
00:21:10,942 --> 00:21:11,962
So let's get it.

391
00:21:11,962 --> 00:21:14,152
So the statistics tell you
which dish is delicious.

392
00:21:14,152 --> 00:21:15,372
I'll decide for myself

393
00:21:15,652 --> 00:21:17,332
whether your statistics
can be trusted or not.

394
00:21:18,142 --> 00:21:18,982
Bring it on.

395
00:21:19,492 --> 00:21:20,332
Let's do it.

396
00:21:20,492 --> 00:21:21,332
You order it.

397
00:21:21,462 --> 00:21:22,922
We need to order here.

398
00:21:23,642 --> 00:21:24,482
Yes.

399
00:21:26,072 --> 00:21:28,782
I'lll have a seaweed soup,

400
00:21:28,782 --> 00:21:31,622
stir-fried crispy pork with holy basil,
spicy pork sausage salad and fried egg salad.

401
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:32,862
Please wait a moment.

402
00:21:32,862 --> 00:21:33,792
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

403
00:21:45,502 --> 00:21:46,342
Almond.

404
00:21:47,062 --> 00:21:47,902
I'll give this to you.

405
00:21:48,872 --> 00:21:49,712
What is it?

406
00:21:51,822 --> 00:21:53,692
Gift voucher at Love Banana Hostel,

407
00:21:54,612 --> 00:21:57,002
free for one night with breakfast.

408
00:21:57,572 --> 00:21:58,702
Why did you give it to me?

409
00:22:00,082 --> 00:22:01,402
How about using it to relieve stress

410
00:22:01,982 --> 00:22:03,342
after exams with Latte?

411
00:22:04,362 --> 00:22:05,202
Seriously?

412
00:22:05,352 --> 00:22:06,202
I am serious.

413
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:07,882
Don't forget to give a review.

414
00:22:13,002 --> 00:22:14,742
And take this too.

415
00:22:15,742 --> 00:22:17,682
Oh, enough already.

416
00:22:18,002 --> 00:22:19,262
How do you know my size?

417
00:22:20,592 --> 00:22:22,762
This one is right, just use it. Come on.

418
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:24,302
Are you serious?

419
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:25,142
Serious and sincere.

420
00:22:28,042 --> 00:22:29,402
Okay. I have to go now.

421
00:22:29,702 --> 00:22:30,542
Don't forget to give a review.

422
00:22:33,042 --> 00:22:34,182
Thank you, Jumper.

423
00:22:34,182 --> 00:22:35,082
All right, bye.

424
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:42,682
Size 52?

425
00:22:43,932 --> 00:22:46,152
It's too small. Mine is not in this size.

426
00:22:51,792 --> 00:22:52,732
Hello.

427
00:22:53,062 --> 00:22:54,522
Why did you come back so early?
Where is Latte?

428
00:23:00,122 --> 00:23:00,962
What's wrong with him?

429
00:23:15,322 --> 00:23:16,162
Peak.

430
00:23:17,742 --> 00:23:19,502
How should I prepare
to have sex for the first time?

431
00:23:23,682 --> 00:23:24,752
What did you just ask?

432
00:23:25,172 --> 00:23:27,642
How should I prepare
to have sex for the first time?

433
00:23:29,982 --> 00:23:31,282
All of the sudden, why did you ask?

434
00:23:35,743 --> 00:23:36,853
Come on, sit here.

435
00:23:39,312 --> 00:23:40,512
You can ask me.

436
00:23:41,492 --> 00:23:42,502
Actually,

437
00:23:43,692 --> 00:23:44,872
about sexual activities,

438
00:23:44,872 --> 00:23:45,852
it's nothing to be ashamed of.

439
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:48,732
At first, everyone is worried.

440
00:23:49,432 --> 00:23:51,542
I just want it to be the best
as it can be.

441
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:53,972
But I don't know what to do.

442
00:23:55,872 --> 00:23:57,112
I fully understand.

443
00:23:58,822 --> 00:23:59,672
But...

444
00:24:00,402 --> 00:24:03,312
The first time, it's not always perfect.

445
00:24:04,162 --> 00:24:05,472
Basically, it's about

446
00:24:05,762 --> 00:24:07,142
you and your partner

447
00:24:07,752 --> 00:24:08,652
understanding each other.

448
00:24:09,382 --> 00:24:10,682
And working at the same pace.

449
00:24:12,082 --> 00:24:14,082
One, two.

450
00:24:18,112 --> 00:24:19,132
It's really difficult.

451
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:22,642
My partner seems
to have more skills than me.

452
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,122
This is not what you have to be worried.

453
00:24:26,302 --> 00:24:28,512
Sex is about getting to know yourself.

454
00:24:28,752 --> 00:24:30,062
What you like and

455
00:24:30,322 --> 00:24:31,342
what you don't like.

456
00:24:31,822 --> 00:24:32,902
And the most important is

457
00:24:34,072 --> 00:24:35,482
we will have safe sex.

458
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:37,882
Yes, Peak.

459
00:24:39,542 --> 00:24:40,472
Do you have any more questions?

460
00:24:43,932 --> 00:24:46,432
Is there a source where I can study it?

461
00:24:46,642 --> 00:24:48,772
I read it on the internet and get confused

462
00:24:49,442 --> 00:24:50,452
and am afraid of doing it wrong.

463
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:57,022
Wow, Peak.

464
00:24:58,452 --> 00:25:00,592
- This one is too big...
- Shh...

465
00:25:08,972 --> 00:25:10,542
Oh my god!

466
00:25:12,032 --> 00:25:13,062
Oh, yes!

467
00:25:16,542 --> 00:25:17,872
This is so cool.

468
00:25:25,792 --> 00:25:27,802
I just talked to Peak.

469
00:25:28,292 --> 00:25:31,182
And he asked me to get your advice.

470
00:25:32,062 --> 00:25:33,582
"How should I prepare

471
00:25:33,607 --> 00:25:35,197
to have sex for the first time?"

472
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:40,022
Hello, Thanwa.

473
00:25:42,531 --> 00:25:43,502
You are so worried, right?

474
00:25:46,322 --> 00:25:47,672
For me,

475
00:25:51,942 --> 00:25:56,752
sex is a matter of consent
between two or more people.

476
00:25:57,122 --> 00:26:00,052
Every action must be something
that both parties have agreed to do.

477
00:26:02,542 --> 00:26:04,812
Both parties have agreed to do

478
00:26:04,942 --> 00:26:06,932
and consent to do this.

479
00:26:07,252 --> 00:26:08,852
Yes, both parties have agreed to do

480
00:26:08,852 --> 00:26:09,892
and consent to do this.

481
00:26:09,892 --> 00:26:11,232
What will they do

482
00:26:11,232 --> 00:26:12,472
and to what extent.

483
00:26:12,472 --> 00:26:15,052
What's important is you need to check
your partner

484
00:26:15,052 --> 00:26:16,722
if he is okay from time to time.

485
00:26:17,302 --> 00:26:18,722
What if

486
00:26:19,742 --> 00:26:21,672
I keep checking like this
from time to time...

487
00:26:22,532 --> 00:26:24,002
Would it really be okay?

488
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:25,422
It must be okay.

489
00:26:25,702 --> 00:26:27,052
Because even if in the beginning,

490
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:28,962
you give consent at first,

491
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:31,322
but when you get into action
and feel uncomfortable,

492
00:26:31,322 --> 00:26:32,742
you can ask to stop at any time.

493
00:26:35,077 --> 00:26:36,407
Thank you so much, Thanwa.

494
00:26:36,862 --> 00:26:37,702
I understand now.

495
00:26:38,672 --> 00:26:41,222
So, where are you now?

496
00:26:41,247 --> 00:26:42,987
Me? I am clearing my work.

497
00:26:44,292 --> 00:26:45,632
Keep fighting.

498
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:47,152
Please hurry back and cook

499
00:26:47,152 --> 00:26:48,192
delicious food for me.

500
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:50,152
All right. See you later.

501
00:26:50,152 --> 00:26:51,552
See you later, Thanwa.

502
00:26:51,552 --> 00:26:52,392
All right.

503
00:27:01,332 --> 00:27:02,532
Let's get ready.

504
00:27:09,282 --> 00:27:11,042
(Daily Hostel 001)

505
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:52,182
Come in.

506
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:05,982
Why is Mr. Latte

507
00:28:06,152 --> 00:28:09,222
dressed better than usual?

508
00:28:09,702 --> 00:28:13,412
Oh yeah? I went back
to take a bath at home.

509
00:28:15,242 --> 00:28:16,422
Why did you bathe at home?

510
00:28:18,742 --> 00:28:20,452
You can do it here.

511
00:28:21,762 --> 00:28:22,702
Really?

512
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:24,682
You told me to meet you here
once the exam is finished.

513
00:28:30,222 --> 00:28:31,062
Are you ready?

514
00:28:38,392 --> 00:28:39,232
Well...

515
00:28:41,272 --> 00:28:42,862
We will do it slowly.

516
00:28:43,542 --> 00:28:45,862
If you feel uncomfortable, just tell me.

517
00:28:47,342 --> 00:28:48,182
Okay.

518
00:29:10,462 --> 00:29:12,872
When those two kids aren't around,
it feels lonely.

519
00:29:14,612 --> 00:29:17,522
I wonder how Latte and Almond are doing.

520
00:29:18,542 --> 00:29:20,352
They probably have a lot to say
about reviewing the room.

521
00:29:23,242 --> 00:29:24,302
Seriously,

522
00:29:24,772 --> 00:29:26,612
that Jumper is really a voucher king.

523
00:29:27,372 --> 00:29:29,202
When he went to onsen,

524
00:29:29,202 --> 00:29:31,322
he went there quite often that
he got a free voucher.

525
00:29:31,832 --> 00:29:34,142
This time he went to a hotel
and he still got a free voucher.

526
00:29:35,542 --> 00:29:36,502
There are a lot of them.

527
00:29:36,792 --> 00:29:37,632
That's right.

528
00:29:37,882 --> 00:29:39,342
That's why there aren't any vouchers
to share with you.

529
00:29:40,602 --> 00:29:41,612
I'd better go ask for some of it.

530
00:29:44,132 --> 00:29:46,312
But now the house is empty.

531
00:29:55,622 --> 00:29:56,462
Then...

532
00:29:57,952 --> 00:29:58,822
Shall we start?

533
00:30:42,892 --> 00:30:44,252
This moment feels familiar.

534
00:30:49,692 --> 00:30:51,102
But I am not drunk like last time.

535
00:30:52,582 --> 00:30:54,132
I remember everything.

536
00:31:21,322 --> 00:31:25,922
"Knock Knock, Boys!"

537
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,740
Enough for now.

538
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:42,870
Thanwa might see us.

539
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,560
Peak.

540
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,060
Thanwa.

541
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,670
They are not at home.

542
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:00,970
We can do whatever we want to do now.

543
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,100
May I do what we did last night again?

544
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,300
What are you guys doing?

545
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,100
I suspect he didn't eat enough last night.

546
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,420
Come on.

547
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:40,800
He was with me.

548
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,830
I don't earn the name "Latte the tiger"
for nothing.

549
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,620
Almond.

550
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:48,240
Don't hide anymore.

551
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:51,010
Give us a "Latte the tiger" review,

552
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,220
so we will know if he is not just bragging.

553
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,050
Acctually, last night was...

554
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,280
I am sorry.

555
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,920
Move up a little.

556
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,730
Why your head is not on the pillow?

557
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:22,950
Move up a little.

558
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,330
It's uncomfortable.

559
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:29,810
- Is it all right now?
- Yes, it is.

560
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,180
Is this okay?

561
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,150
Okay.

562
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,910
Just spread the legs.

563
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:38,930
It's too tight.

564
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,520
This is normal.

565
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:55,340
- It hurts. You're pressing my arm.
- Hurts where?

566
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:02,470
Lay still now.

567
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:05,260
I am not comfortable like this.

568
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,470
Put some more pillows.

569
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:07,880
Is it okay now?

570
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,720
Okay.

571
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,340
My hair, it hurts.

572
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,520
Ouch!

573
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,840
It's hot. Aren't you feeling hot?

574
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:21,860
I feel hot too.

575
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,590
- Let's take off the shirt.
- Okay.

576
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,480
Lift your upper body.

577
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:42,430
Do you still wear strawberry underwear?

578
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,390
- What?
- My leg is cramped.

579
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,130
I'm having a cramp.

580
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:49,700
- Seriously.
- It is a cramp.

581
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,830
Ouch. It hurts.

582
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:52,920
Are you okay now?

583
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,390
And the foot too.

584
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:58,750
Come on.

585
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:01,670
- Do you want to take that off?
- Yes, just take it off.

586
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:03,890
Ouch! I'll take it off myself.

587
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,650
It's wrapped around my leg.

588
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:08,980
Let go of me.

589
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:11,660
Take it off now.

590
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:13,500
Let me help.

591
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:25,990
Hot, hot. It's hot.

592
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,830
No.

593
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:29,750
Wait a moment. Don't do it.
Get off me first.

594
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:32,260
I will turn up air conditioning.

595
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,120
Come on.

596
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,350
Okay. Let's do it.

597
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:43,090
Um... this way.

598
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:46,570
Easy, easy.

599
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:51,960
Let's do it.

600
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,620
Lay still.

601
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,940
- Just lay still.
- Okay.

602
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,990
Oh, I am cold.

603
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,170
- It's too cold.
- Yes.

604
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:16,310
I am cold. It's not you who is cold.

605
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:19,070
- It's better now.
- Do it now.

606
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:22,610
Wait a second.

607
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:25,270
- What's wrong?
- I am shy.

608
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:27,200
Can you turn off the light?

609
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,140
Just turn off one light.
Otherwise, I won't be able to see you.

610
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,380
And I can't find it.

611
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:38,490
It tickles a lot!

612
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:42,590
Not yet. I'm not doing anything yet.

613
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:47,560
Almond, I think

614
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,310
- you just come on top.
- Okay, I will be on top.

615
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,020
Almomd.

616
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,460
This is not how we do it.

617
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,580
So, can we go back to the last position?

618
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,450
Last position, then.

619
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:03,200
Which position?

620
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,300
- Same position. You will be on top of me.
- On top of you.

621
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,930
On top of me.

622
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:11,170
Oh, this is not the same.

623
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,400
Come on.

624
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,620
I'm tired.

625
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:18,850
Shall we stop now?

626
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,160
I think so.

627
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:22,300
I have to take a bath again for sure.

628
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:25,030
Come on.

629
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,320
Sleep properly.

630
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,380
I'll sleep on this side.

631
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,620
- Ouch.
- I am sorry. I didn't mean to.

632
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:37,620
- Just sleep.
- Sleep now.

633
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:40,750
Let's do it.

634
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,770
Latte.

635
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,470
It was good.

636
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,460
Sex is just like this.

637
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,350
You have to tune in and talk through it.

638
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,870
If you like or don't like something,
you have to tell each other.

639
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:09,900
Just like you guys tune
in every night, right?

640
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:12,610
You're really going for it now, Almond.

641
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:14,130
At first, you acted so timidly.

642
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,740
And like this, free rent for a year,

643
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:17,810
we're all disappointed.

644
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,840
Actually,

645
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,490
I deserve to have it.

646
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,230
Because I succeeded

647
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:28,920
in making you lose your virginity
to the person you like.

648
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:31,140
- Wow.
- Wait, young man.

649
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:32,490
This is not right.

650
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,360
This is against the rules.

651
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,470
Come on, Thanwa.

652
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,380
If you lose, don't bully me.

653
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,010
No, I am not a bully.

654
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:41,930
Just following the theory.

655
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:42,770
- Yes.
- True.

656
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,570
- No, it's not right.
- Almond.

657
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,060
Actually,

658
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:50,850
at that time I said it myself,

659
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:53,920
if I could be with someone I like,
you'd be the winner.

660
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:57,040
Latte is not someone I like.

661
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:00,200
But he is the one I love.

662
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:04,250
So, I am not paying the rent.

663
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:05,770
- Wow.
- Almond.

664
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:08,890
Did you see that?

665
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,520
I told you that Almond
is not the same anymore.

666
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:13,170
He is so...

667
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:14,830
- He acted so strage.
- Right. What's wrong?

668
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:16,940
Tiger would never be shy.

669
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:19,370
- No, no. You are shy.
- Yes, you are not shy at all.

670
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:21,040
Let's go. Come on.

671
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,200
- Just go.
- I am following him now.

672
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,380
Quick! That voucher's gone.

673
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,600
He left his bag here.

674
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,390
Shall we steal his vouchers?

675
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:34,500
- Let's do it.
- All right.

676
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:35,930
Deal.

677
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:37,610
His bag...

678
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,650
What is it inside?

679
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:45,690
(You Are My Caffeine)

680
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,650
(You Are My Caffeine)

681
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,590
This is so good.

682
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:30,590
- They look so good.
- So handsome.

683
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,820
Oh, he is adorable.

684
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:39,890
Why are you smiling?

685
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,100
It's just a smile.

686
00:40:43,501 --> 00:40:44,811
I am not interested in them.

687
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,210
Don't smile to them.

688
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,010
Don't think so much.

689
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:09,530
(You Are My Caffeine)

690
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,390
So, here you are.

691
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,710
What's the matter?

692
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,710
Let's have some cool drinks
and then we can talk.

693
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:40,020
Come on, are you still sulking?

694
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:44,870
I know that I should not be sulking.

695
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,340
But I was annoyed.

696
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:51,870
You never acted like this before.

697
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,500
That was before.

698
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:55,960
It was okay at that time.

699
00:41:58,450 --> 00:41:59,390
And now it's not okay, right?

700
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:02,950
Yes, it isn't.

701
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,540
We are in a relationship now.

702
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:10,270
Can you say that again?

703
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,420
We are in a relationship now.

704
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,220
So you know.

705
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:25,440
But you are pansexual.

706
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:28,950
I see you flirt with everyone.

707
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:30,980
You also smile to others.

708
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,640
I am jealous.

709
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,780
Wait a second.

710
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:40,230
I have already told you,

711
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:42,370
even though I am pansexual,

712
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,440
I am not having sex with anyone.

713
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:47,120
Even if I am bisexual

714
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:48,990
or am any other type
of sexual orientation,

715
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:50,840
it doesn't mean that

716
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,160
I can have sex with anyone.

717
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:01,350
I understand.

718
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:03,690
But I can't help being jealous.

719
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,460
I like you.

720
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:11,500
I like you as who you are.

721
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:12,910
You only need to remember that

722
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,810
my boyfriend is Almond.

723
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:17,380
You just keep that in mind.

724
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:18,940
No need to think about anything else.

725
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:34,840
I am sorry that

726
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:36,700
I misunderstood you.

727
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:39,930
Well, I am not...

728
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:51,900
So cute!

729
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,630
I have to tease you like this more often.

730
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:57,150
Don't tease me.

731
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:05,030
What should I do?

732
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:07,690
What should I do
so you can stop being upset?

733
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:09,830
Or...

734
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:12,680
We can try to do it outdoors.

735
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:13,740
What?

736
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:17,450
Are you crazy?

737
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,280
You don't agree?

738
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,310
No.

739
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:21,870
Crazy.

740
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:24,230
Latte.

741
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:28,930
You said you like me,

742
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:31,800
when will you tell me that you love me?

743
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:41,500
I...

744
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,460
Let's come inside.

745
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:50,910
Where is "I love you"?

746
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:52,710
- Where is "I love you"?
- Where is "I love you"?

747
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,780
Ouch! So sweet.

748
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:01,030
It's nothing, you guys.

749
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:03,380
I just found a quiet place
to talk to Latte.

750
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:04,470
Yes. That's right.

751
00:45:06,330 --> 00:45:07,980
Oh, really?

752
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:10,570
So, what kind of conversation is this?

753
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,210
- Hm?
- Right.

754
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:13,800
- Come on, guys.
- Hm?

755
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:15,480
Come on.

756
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:17,390
There are cameras around here.

757
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:18,470
Whatever you two did,

758
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:19,790
security saw everything.

759
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:24,570
You looked so shocked,
this was not a normal talk, right?

760
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,700
You are teasing me.

761
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:29,820
I am not talking with you anymore.

762
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:31,830
Almond.

763
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:35,210
I am not talking with you anymore.

764
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:36,920
You just copied him.

765
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:37,870
Latte.

766
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:39,740
He is playing hard to get.

767
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:45,150
Or should we go find the cameras
and check them out?

768
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:46,050
I think it's that one.

769
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:47,830
Okay. Let's go.

770
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:50,160
Okay. Go. Go.

771
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,210
I think it's a good clip.

772
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:54,690
Go and check it.

773
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:02,620
Here you go.

774
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:05,160
This is the moment
everyone has been waiting for.

775
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,580
- Bro.
- Please meet La Lailah,

776
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:10,220
the boylove novelist of the era.

777
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:15,770
(Meeting with La Lailah,
the boylove novelist of the era)

778
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:19,910
Hello. This is La Lailah.

779
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:29,290
Is Lookpeach this famous?

780
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:31,690
Unbelievable, right?

781
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:34,350
A novelist of the era.

782
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:37,150
Awesome.

783
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:39,110
I heard the fans say that

784
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:41,020
there is someone who wants to buy the novel

785
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,710
and make it into a series.

786
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,360
Really?

787
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:45,920
So, we have a famous friend, right?

788
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:51,120
Thank you, everyone,

789
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,130
for attending the launch of the new book,

790
00:46:53,870 --> 00:46:55,650
“You Are My Caffeine".

791
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:57,100
Because of the readers,

792
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:58,960
I came all the way to sit here.

793
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:01,090
“You Are My Caffeine"

794
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:03,340
is a love story from many perspectives,

795
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:05,900
telling the story of
good times and bad times.

796
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:08,880
But in the end,
no matter what the outcome may be,

797
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,360
they just can't live without each other.

798
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,890
Just like caffeine.

799
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:14,990
We have to drink coffee every morning.

800
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,340
That's true.

801
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:20,720
Actually, this story
was secretly inspired...

802
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:22,860
Eh, not secretly.

803
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,740
I got all the information
from people around me.

804
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:27,590
I want to convey their stories.

805
00:47:27,590 --> 00:47:31,520
I think their story is so cute.

806
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,930
I hope everyone smiles, laughs,

807
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:36,820
and cries with this story.

808
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:45,110
This is awesome.

809
00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:46,100
- Awesome.
- Bravo.

810
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,220
This is awesome.

811
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:48,470
- She is very good.
- Yes.

812
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:52,670
Whoever wants to ask for a signature,
feel free to do so.

813
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,390
Thank you.

814
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:09,770
I like this novel.

815
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:10,920
Thank you so much.

816
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:15,010
Hey, you guys. He is my senior.

817
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,460
- Hello.
- Hello.

818
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:18,590
- Is he really his senior?
- Are you sure?

819
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:19,630
My name is Got.

820
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:20,560
Thanwa.

821
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:21,710
Nice to meet you.

822
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:23,330
- This is Peak, Jumper.
- Nice to meet you all.

823
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:24,520
Peak and Shawn.

824
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:27,150
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

825
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,310
Almond is Latte's buddy.

826
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:30,460
He is my boyfriend.

827
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:34,240
Oh, excuse me. I have to go.

828
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,820
- See you later, Latte.
- See you later.

829
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:38,140
- See you.
- See you.

830
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,690
- He is so cool.
- What a cool guy.

831
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:43,300
- Hello.
- Hey.

832
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,230
- I am happy for you.
- Thank you.

833
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:51,110
I know that La Lailah
is really the most famous, actually

834
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,290
I just finished reading
your previous fiction.

835
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:57,170
"A Guy Like You
Will Never Win My Heart"

836
00:48:58,730 --> 00:48:59,740
and...

837
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:02,720
"Too Bad I Shouldn't Have Been Mean to You".

838
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:04,420
Wow!

839
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:05,330
Both are good to read.

840
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:09,340
I have to thank Latte and Almond

841
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:11,230
for being my fictional characters' models.

842
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,170
So I was able to develop
and finish writing the story.

843
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:15,560
It is a story that I'm most proud of.

844
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:19,300
I am happy that I can help Lookpeach.

845
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:21,990
Even though someone was willing

846
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,690
and unwilling from time to time.

847
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:27,540
Hey, I am a full supporter.

848
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:29,550
I took her to the sex toy shop

849
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:32,400
that almost made
my boyfriend misunderstand.

850
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:38,040
It's true that I write boylove fiction,

851
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:42,100
but I would like to push it
to be seen as a romantic comedy

852
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:43,890
with characters of the same gender.

853
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:45,710
So I think that

854
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:47,690
in the future I will try
to talk more about this matter.

855
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,200
How about this?

856
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,280
If I have free time,
I will create a website to promote it.

857
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:54,330
Thank you.

858
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:55,830
That's a very good idea.

859
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:57,290
If you need help,

860
00:49:57,290 --> 00:49:59,060
I and Shawn are ready to help.

861
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:00,510
- You can call us anytime.
- Okay.

862
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:04,590
I want to know something.

863
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,570
Is there copyright fee?

864
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:11,570
If yes, can you write about
me and Thanwa in your next fiction?

865
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:17,040
If there is a copyright fee,

866
00:50:17,570 --> 00:50:19,040
we need it too.

867
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:21,310
Okay.

868
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:46,940
You look handsome.

869
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:48,210
This is usual.

870
00:50:49,190 --> 00:50:51,000
Where are the groom and bride?

871
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,210
They are not here yet.

872
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:55,190
I will have a toast
with my future mother-in-law.

873
00:50:58,190 --> 00:50:59,090
Good luck.

874
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:01,800
This wedding is nice.

875
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,610
Mother.

876
00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:06,430
Yes, my baby.

877
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:08,550
- May I sit?
- Sit down here.

878
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:11,790
Come on. Cheers.

879
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:14,480
Mom.

880
00:51:15,370 --> 00:51:16,490
Yes!

881
00:51:18,670 --> 00:51:20,030
Excuse me.

882
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:22,420
Is it this one?

883
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:23,420
You look beautiful, Mom.

884
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:25,740
You are a nice boy.

885
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:27,580
- Oh, Uncle. Hello.
- Hello.

886
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:28,830
Please have a seat.

887
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,150
Can I have a drink with you?

888
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:41,700
I want to apologize.

889
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:44,310
I've spoken poorly to you before.

890
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:48,990
Never mind. We just misunderstood.

891
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:50,850
I don't hold any grudges.

892
00:51:52,770 --> 00:51:54,230
I also have to apologize to you.

893
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:55,860
Thank you.

894
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,270
So, we will toast and drink.

895
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:00,530
Come on. Cheers.

896
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:01,370
Bottoms up.

897
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,400
I am ready.

898
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:05,320
Mom, I will drink for you.

899
00:52:06,430 --> 00:52:07,460
I will finish it for you.

900
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:08,940
Help me then.

901
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:10,010
Okay.

902
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:12,300
Hey, wait a second.

903
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:13,670
I'll do it.

904
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:15,470
Thanks.

905
00:52:16,830 --> 00:52:18,070
I'd better drink from my glass.

906
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:20,450
So, let's toast.

907
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:22,800
Cheers.

908
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,110
Here you go.

909
00:52:29,570 --> 00:52:31,560
Hello everyone.

910
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,720
Thank you for honoring the wedding

911
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,150
of our friend's tonight.

912
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:36,920
To avoid wasting time,

913
00:52:37,210 --> 00:52:38,900
please give an applause to

914
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:40,750
our bride and groom.

915
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:02,730
The groom is handsome.

916
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:04,610
The bride is beautiful.

917
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:30,160
I would like to thank the honored guests
who attended the event.

918
00:53:35,270 --> 00:53:37,280
I would like to say...

919
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,120
Wait a minute!

920
00:53:59,450 --> 00:54:00,960
- Woo!
- Thanwa.

921
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:14,230
I knew there was something strange,

922
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:16,920
but I didn't think it would be this big.

923
00:54:18,890 --> 00:54:20,610
That's Uncle's plan.

924
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,550
I want to thank you

925
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,030
for coming to the event today.

926
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:28,390
As a father,

927
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:30,830
I made a mistake

928
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:33,280
that nearly hurt my son

929
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:34,850
and assumed that

930
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,270
love had only one form.

931
00:54:38,110 --> 00:54:39,030
But now,

932
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,070
I already understood.

933
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:46,880
Peak.

934
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:49,850
I hope you will be happy with
the choice you made.

935
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,590
I want to apologize to everyone

936
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:10,530
that I and Peak looked so good together.

937
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:13,640
I already rented the wedding dress.

938
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:15,580
So I have to use it anyway.

939
00:55:18,910 --> 00:55:21,810
This event might be a little strange,

940
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:23,880
but I want everyone

941
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,520
to have fun to the fullest.

942
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:28,840
Woo!

943
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:37,650
Wait a minute.

944
00:55:44,570 --> 00:55:47,260
I think something isn't right now.

945
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:55,730
Peak.

946
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:57,720
What happened?

947
00:55:59,510 --> 00:56:00,350
What?

948
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:15,180
Who is she?

949
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:18,180
Why? What are you doing?

950
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:23,630
Why didn't you tell me
that you would come?

951
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,580
So this is...

952
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:27,580
A surprise.

953
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:29,110
Come on.

954
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:31,390
Won't you introduce her to everyone?

955
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:35,310
Okay.

956
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:37,190
Everyone, this is Fahsai.

957
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:39,060
My friend since high school.

958
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:40,750
She is also Peak's friend.

959
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:44,290
And now Fahsai is

960
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:46,730
my girlfriend.

961
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:53,750
So cute.

962
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,170
So, we need to celebrate.

963
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:01,800
Are you ready?

964
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,120
- Yes.
- Yes.

965
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:04,690
Hip-hip.

966
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:06,030
Hooray!

967
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:06,940
Hip-hip.

968
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:07,840
Hooray!

969
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:08,880
Hip-hip. Hip-hip.

970
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,680
Hooray!

971
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:19,920
Kiss, kiss, kiss.

972
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:27,030
Kiss him. Kiss him. Kiss him.

973
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:34,240
Kiss, kiss, kiss. Kiss, kiss, kiss.

974
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:36,220
Kiss him now.

975
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:49,390
Kiss, kiss, kiss. Kiss, kiss, kiss.

So...

984
00:58:25,330 --> 00:58:27,420
Thank you for coming into my life.

985
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:33,230
You gave me courage to overcome my fear.

986
00:58:34,030 --> 00:58:35,630
I can be brave to embrace happiness now.

987
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:40,030
I am the one who should say thank you.

988
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:43,780
If you didn't come into my life,

989
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,640
I might not have courage
to go through many things in life.

990
00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:49,440
Oh, seriously.

991
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:53,000
If I hadn't run away
from my dad and met you guys,

992
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,980
I wouldn't have gotten together with you.

993
00:58:57,180 --> 00:58:58,020
That's true.

994
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:02,950
Hmm, so sweet. Both of the grooms.

995
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:05,160
You didn't even go take pictures
with the guests.

996
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:06,760
Oh, yes.

997
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:08,320
That's right. Let's go.

998
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:10,510
- Take a picture with us.
- Come here.

999
00:59:11,370 --> 00:59:13,090
Everyone come and take a picture.

1000
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:13,930
Come.

1001
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:17,070
Come.

1002
00:59:17,190 --> 00:59:18,370
- Come here.
- Three, two, one.

1003
00:59:18,370 --> 00:59:19,210
Cut!

1004
00:59:23,020 --> 00:59:24,280
Smile.

1005
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:26,410
One, two, three. Look at the camera.

1006
00:59:35,410 --> 00:59:38,670
(We never know when love will
come to knock at our front door.)

1007
00:59:39,070 --> 00:59:40,800
(And we never know)

1008
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:43,740
(whether the love at the door
will be good.)

1009
00:59:44,310 --> 00:59:47,260
(Even if we are afraid
or want to run away, )

1010
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:50,020
(we need to confront it anyway.)

1011
00:59:50,510 --> 00:59:52,830
(Whether it brings happiness or pain, )

1012
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:55,090
(this is the taste of life.)

1013
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:58,510
Hooray!

1014
01:00:04,910 --> 01:00:06,330
I really miss this vibe.

1015
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:07,560
That's true.

1016
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:10,780
It's hard to believe that
the four of us have made it to this day.

1017
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:11,620
That's true.

1018
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:15,200
So, who received the rent from Almond?

1019
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,320
It's me. Me.

1020
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:17,820
- I got the rent fee.
- Did you?

1021
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:18,820
A rent fee?

1022
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:20,000
I got a boyfriend.

1023
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:25,150
Come on.

1024
01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:26,750
And it's not just us.

1025
01:00:27,510 --> 01:00:28,500
The two of you are now a couple.

1026
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:32,450
Well, I didn't know
who kissed me on the sofa.

1027
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:33,880
But I got him as my boyfriend.

1028
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:34,990
No, it was not me.

1029
01:00:34,990 --> 01:00:37,210
That day, I slept on this sofa.

1030
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:39,100
You were the one who initiated the kiss.

1031
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:40,450
If you don't believe it, just ask Kookie.

1032
01:00:40,450 --> 01:00:41,540
Right, Kookie?

1033
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:42,540
Okay.

1034
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:44,750
He said okay.

1035
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:45,760
No way.

1036
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:46,910
Is that right, Kookie?

1037
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:48,070
No, it's not.

1038
01:00:48,550 --> 01:00:50,120
He is scared.

1039
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:52,560
Okay, we've come this far.

1040
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:54,770
Shall we reminisce of our past

1041
01:00:54,770 --> 01:00:57,030
and give our private details an update?

1042
01:00:57,530 --> 01:00:58,370
Let's go.

1043
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:00,650
All right, I'll spin first.

1044
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:03,380
Ooh!

1045
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:04,990
Go ahead.

1046
01:01:04,990 --> 01:01:06,280
Has anyone ever stayed in a hostel?

1047
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:08,250
Who?

1048
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:12,300
- Oops, I don't know.
- No.

1049
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:13,280
Drink now.

1050
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:16,100
I can drink now.

1051
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:17,060
I have never drunk before.

1052
01:01:21,810 --> 01:01:23,380
All right, it's my turn now.

1053
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:25,140
No, you don't have to.

1054
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:26,660
I'll just ask you directly.

1055
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:28,830
Okay!

1056
01:01:28,830 --> 01:01:30,540
Has anyone ever brought
a friend to sleep over

1057
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:32,350
while staying at a hotel out of town?

1058
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:37,390
- Wait.
- Who is it?

1059
01:01:37,390 --> 01:01:39,070
Why did "Latte the
tiger" not eat his meat?

1060
01:01:39,470 --> 01:01:41,990
Usually, it was not a hotel.

1061
01:01:43,650 --> 01:01:44,690
Too expensive.

1062
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:48,790
Right, you are stingy.

1063
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:50,850
I am the stingy one.

1064
01:01:50,850 --> 01:01:52,410
I will ask the next question.

1065
01:01:53,650 --> 01:01:56,300
Has anyone ever hooked up
with someone staying at the hostel?

1066
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:58,920
This is me. It must be me.

1067
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,650
It's definitely you.

1068
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:03,400
- Take one more shot.
- These two think alike.

1069
01:02:05,730 --> 01:02:06,880
Come on.

1070
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,230
Put the glass down.

1071
01:02:08,790 --> 01:02:09,910
Who will ask next? Anyone?

1072
01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:11,480
I have a question to ask.

1073
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:13,980
Has anyone ever hooked up

1074
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:16,180
with someone on the sofa?

1075
01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:20,410
Who? I really don't know.

1076
01:02:21,950 --> 01:02:24,070
You're keeping quiet.

1077
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:27,130
So sweet.

1078
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:29,940
Okay, now.

1079
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:31,140
Let's toast.

1080
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:33,390
Since we already know
so much about each other,

1081
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:34,580
there shouldn't be anything
left to know, right?

1082
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:35,880
There is no secret in the world.

1083
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:38,130
That's right. But what you have is love.

1084
01:02:39,970 --> 01:02:41,350
You are awesome.

1085
01:02:41,350 --> 01:02:44,250
Cheers.

1086
01:02:54,110 --> 01:02:57,530
Kiss him. Kiss him. Kiss him. Kiss him.

1087
01:02:57,530 --> 01:03:07,730
