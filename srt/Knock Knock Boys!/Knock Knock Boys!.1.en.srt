I want to... Help me, please.

Wait, wait, wait, wait.

39
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,380
Are you Latte?

40
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,980
Yes.

41
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,380
I thought you wouldn't come.

42
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,100
Uh...

43
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,340
Can I go in and take a look?

44
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,940
Yes, you can take a look.

45
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,060
Please come.

46
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,060
(KNOCK KNOCK)

47
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,900
It's just been renovated.

48
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,460
It's clean, spacious, and very convenient.

49
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,240
This room is the master room.

50
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,880
- This is very big.
- Master bedroom.

51
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,040
Have you decided
which room you like yet?

52
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,960
But the master bedroom

53
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,640
with a bathroom inside,
you can't use that one.

54
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,080
And one more thing,

55
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,760
if you rent one room,
you can only use one room.

56
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,960
Hmm...

57
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,280
I came alone.

58
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,920
How can I sleep in every room?

59
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,760
I have to say it first.

60
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,000
So what? Which room would you rent?

61
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,960
Uh, a small room is fine.

62
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,680
Actually, I am okay since I found out
that this house is near the university.

63
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,600
Any room will be all right, then.

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,040
- Let's sign a contract quickly.
- Yes.

65
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,440
It's done.

66
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,400
Ah, the key.
It's also a bottle opener.

67
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,560
Suitable for party lovers like us.

68
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,240
After a while, the new semester will begin.

69
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,200
Living alone is really lonely.

70
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,080
Oh, if that's the case, I'm not lonely.

71
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,360
- Cheers!
- Yay!

72
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,240
(Instagram)

73
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,000
Hi.

74
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,600
- Hello.
- Hi.

75
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,280
You're Tula, right?

76
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,760
- I am Thanwa.
- Oh.

77
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,160
Okay, sorry.

78
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,880
- Sorry for being late.
- All right.

79
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,160
Yes, we have an appointment
so early in the morning.

80
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,240
I'm sorry that I made an appointment
to come early in the morning.

81
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,240
Never mind.

82
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,600
I wouldn't be like that.

83
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,960
Ha?

84
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,400
This one is...
Have you cleaned it yet?

85
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,200
He drank too much last night.

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,960
He...

87
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,680
Oh, your housemate.

88
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,920
Has someone already lived here
before me?

89
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,640
Well, I've only been here for two days.

90
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,480
But when I called to reserve,

91
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,040
the owner of the house
didn't inform me at all.

92
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,440
Oh, maybe I forgot.

93
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,760
Because he needed it urgently.

94
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,800
But the master bedroom
is still available...

95
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,320
Of course.

96
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,280
That room belongs to Thanwa.

97
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,760
Latte!

98
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,120
Latte.

99
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,800
Wake up, wake up.
Why are you sleeping in this room?

100
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,600
What's going on this morning?

101
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,280
How can you sleep in this room?

102
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,520
Why don't you sleep in your own room?

103
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,200
This is someone else's room.

104
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,000
Is there anyone else?

105
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,680
This is Thanwa's room.

106
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,280
Get up. Get up. Get up.

107
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,680
Friends, wake up.

108
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,400
Hey, get up.

109
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,320
The bed is soft.

110
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,080
Cheers!

111
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,480
Latte.

112
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,680
Hey everyone, this is Thanwa.
He just moved in this morning.

113
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,520
Uh...

114
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,080
You guys,
it's better to go upstairs.

115
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,320
- Go, go, go.
- Let's go.

116
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,560
We can't disturb Thanwa.

117
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,800
You guys, help me pack things first.

118
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,680
Hey, alright.

119
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,600
Oh, that's okay.
You all go back first.

120
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,080
Oh!

121
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,720
Are you awake?

122
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,320
Uh, the porridge on the table is yours.

123
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,720
I bought it for you.

124
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,600
Let me help.

125
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,880
Why did you buy it for me?

126
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,640
Well, I want to apologize
for the mess I made last night.

127
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,040
Actually, I planned to come
for cleaning in the morning.

128
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,240
But when I came down

129
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,400
and saw the clean house, it was like...

130
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,800
It made me feel even more guilty.

131
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,360
So, this is what's left
for the cockroaches?

132
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,440
By doing this, do you think
I will forgive you?

133
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,840
Well...

134
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,920
The porridge is cold
and it doesn't taste good.

135
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,080
I'd better make it myself.
It'll be much more delicious.

136
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,960
Try it.

137
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,320
I don't know if you like it.

138
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,880
Delicious!

139
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,360
How can you make a simple dish
this delicious?

140
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,200
Are you a chef?

141
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,840
No.

142
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,160
I like to eat delicious things.

143
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,480
So I kept practicing.

144
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,760
So...

145
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,680
Do you want to be
a chef for this house?

146
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,560
Would you agree?

147
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,000
Please.

148
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,320
Please.

149
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,840
- Please...
- Okay.

150
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,560
OK, fine.

151
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,280
Deal.

152
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,720
Deal.

153
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,760
Do you want to eat?

154
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,040
Well, you don't let go of my hands.

155
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,160
Why don't you let go mine?

156
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,240
Ah, I'll let you go.

157
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,680
Ah, then eat with one hand.

158
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,000
You won't let me go.
I am seriously thinking now.

159
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,560
Oh, whatever. Let's eat.

160
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,720
Yes, chef.

161
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,800
Hello.

162
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,240
Have a seat.

163
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,160
Ton, this is

164
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,720
a new kid in our department.

165
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,480
So why didn't you tell me?

166
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,320
Come on.

167
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,680
Well, I'm telling you right here.

168
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,720
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

169
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,320
Uh, I haven't introduced myself yet.

170
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,240
My name is Peak.

171
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,360
Uh, if you have anything
for me to do, I can do it all.

172
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,160
Every new kid says this.

173
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,440
Anyway, I'll count on you, Ton.
Just take care of him.

174
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,840
It's me again.

175
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,880
I will work hard.

176
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,920
Here, give it to me.

177
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,420
(Jane)

178
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,290
So when will you be ready?

179
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,370
You just can't answer
and let it be like this, right?

180
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,410
Honestly, I don't understand at all.

181
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,530
Why do I have to be responsible
for this thing alone?

182
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:41,890
Hmm?

183
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:54,210
Jane.

184
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:55,570
What?

185
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,170
Okay.

186
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:01,170
What?

187
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,770
Tomorrow, we will tell everyone about it.

188
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,480
Really?

189
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,110
That's it.

190
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,400
Tomorrow I will come to pick you up.

191
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,240
Hello.

192
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,840
Hello, Mr. Phongsakorn, is that right?

193
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,200
I'm calling from ABZD Company.

194
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,120
I'm calling to inform you about
the results of the job interview.

195
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,800
We have accepted you to work.

196
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,880
When is it convenient for you
to start work?

197
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,960
Peak.

198
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,880
Peak.

199
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,240
Why don't you lock...

200
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,380
(Peak)

201
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,060
Peak.

202
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,620
Let me ask you.

203
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,180
You've been sleeping in the office
for three days now.

204
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,500
Is it because there is too much work
or you are avoiding your wife?

205
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,260
Not at all, sir.

206
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:45,940
In fact,

207
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:49,060
our office has a policy that allows
our department to work from home.

208
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,500
You don't have to go
to the office all the time.

209
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:52,900
Oh...

210
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,220
I... It's okay.

211
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,940
I like to work in the office.

212
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,700
It's a waste of office budget and time.

213
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,040
Oh.

214
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,520
All right.

215
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,680
Take my advice,

216
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,400
don't argue with your wife often.

217
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,280
It's going to be difficult
to work from home.

218
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,760
Uh, Ton.

219
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,560
Don't forget to call your wife too.

220
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,260
(Cheap house for rent)

221
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:05,960
Hello, hello.

222
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,480
This is a knock-off house, right?

223
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,880
Yes.

224
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,640
Uh well, I'd like to rent one room.

225
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,720
What day is convenient for you
to come see the house?

226
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,240
Oh, that's okay.

227
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,600
I looked at the picture and it was OK.

228
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,080
So I want to confirm the rental.

229
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,280
Okay.

230
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,030
- Hello.
- Sorry.

231
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,260
Excuse me.

232
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,820
Do you want to unload everything?

233
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,660
Yes.

234
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,060
Done.

235
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,300
Thank you very much.

236
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,340
Thank you.

237
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,820
Hello, goldfish.

238
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,060
Hey!

239
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,460
How did you get in?

240
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,140
The door isn't locked.

241
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,060
Oh!

242
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,980
Of course Latte won't lock it.

243
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:56,740
Bro, I want to ask you,
can you help me, please?

244
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,180
- Help...
- Ah.

245
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,620
This way.

246
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,620
Oh, yes.

247
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,060
Right there.

248
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,100
Wow!

249
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,180
Are these all yours?

250
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:13,780
Yes.

251
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:19,020
They belong to me
and there are various necessary items.

252
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:22,420
Don't tell me you took all these
from your house in the province.

253
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,820
Yes.

254
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:29,900
So don't order online delivery.
Let him gradually send them to you.

255
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,100
Yes!

256
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,180
I forgot about it.

257
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,100
Oh.

258
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,300
It's okay. Come on.

259
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,300
Let's get inside.

260
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:43,060
So, please help me carry things.

261
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,220
Okay.

262
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,340
Wait, how much?

263
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,100
Oh, it's okay. Just helping you out.

264
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,540
- Okay.
- Yes, go.

265
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,580
So I will excuse...

266
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,060
Please sit inside first. Thank you.

267
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,620
Unbelievable!

268
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,340
Bro, put it down right here.

269
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,340
Yes, definitely.

270
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,180
Yes.

271
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,340
It hurts.

272
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,380
Hey, it hurts.

273
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,540
I'm sorry.

274
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,020
Do you think he will be all right?

275
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,020
I'm not a butler.

276
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,020
So, you are not a butler.

277
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,980
I'm a housemate.

278
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,220
I'm really sorry.

279
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,500
You're not a butler.

280
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,980
Oh, is this the butler?

281
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,140
Oh.

282
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,700
Hello, butler.

283
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,820
Yes, hello.

284
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,340
I'm the butler of this house.

285
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,900
Hey! Are you going crazy?

286
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,260
Um, I'm not a butler.

287
00:18:56,450 --> 00:18:59,130
- Hello.
- Hello.

288
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:00,930
I'm Almond.

289
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,130
This cute little one?

290
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:05,090
He got the room with an ensuite bathroom.

291
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:05,930
Yes.

292
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,290
But, the lady who
takes care of this house is not here?

293
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:13,130
Oh, she's already gone.

294
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:14,250
Actually,

295
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,170
she is not the one taking care
or cleaning anything at all.

296
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,890
She just takes care
of the tenants of the house.

297
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:23,450
There is no butler here.

298
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:25,690
Yes, I understand now.

299
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,250
Anyway, please take care of me.

300
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:34,570
Oh,

301
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,410
this is a small souvenir from me

302
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,610
to everyone.

303
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,050
Thank you.

304
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,570
What?

305
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:45,050
This one is very expensive.

306
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,770
Oh Tee, you are really something.

307
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,650
Oh, thank you.

308
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,330
If you guys need any help,

309
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:54,530
you can tell me.

310
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:01,690
I am afraid, I don't want it. Help.

311
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:02,530
- I hate cockroaches.
- What's wrong?

312
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:03,570
- Almond, what's wrong?
- Almond, what's wrong?

313
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:06,930
Cockroach!

314
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:08,730
- Oh.
- This is bad.

315
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,090
What should I do?

316
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:12,090
Well, let's handle it.

317
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:13,170
I can't do it.

318
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,450
Almond can do it.

319
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:18,010
I won't hit it. No. Do it for me.

320
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,690
No, I won't do it.

321
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:22,290
- Almond, hit it. What are you afraid of?
- What?

322
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:27,770
With bare feet?

323
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,050
That's it.

324
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:34,330
Mercy on all animals that are suffering.

325
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:37,090
Born, old, sick and dead
all together.

326
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:39,930
What the heck?

327
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:48,730
Uh, my mom taught me
to not kill animals.

328
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:50,650
Otherwise it will be a sin.

329
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,090
I'm sorry.

330
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,860
(Laker)

331
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,010
All done.

332
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:07,850
I apologize to everyone.

333
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,850
I will do it better.

334
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,890
I will not cause any problems again.

335
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:14,490
It's all right.

336
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:16,210
You are the youngest.

337
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:18,490
Well, and then...

338
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:20,530
After all, we've come to live together.

339
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,170
We haven't had a chance
to get to know each other,

340
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:24,050
or sit and talk with each other.

341
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:26,650
So...

342
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:31,290
Shall we party tomorrow night?

343
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,450
Make it happen, bro.

344
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:34,410
- All right.
- Okay.

345
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:35,490
I've been waiting for this word
for a long time.

346
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:36,610
What about our new guy?

347
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:43,370
Yes.

348
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:44,250
That's great.

349
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:54,060
"Knock Knock, Boys!"

350
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,580
Cheers!

351
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,610
I think we're here to play a game.

352
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,890
"Never Have I Ever."

353
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,410
- Ah...
- Ah...

354
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,250
Never.

355
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:37,690
It's not like that.

356
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:40,090
A very basic game.

357
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,650
- Are you going to change the game?
- Hey.

358
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:44,690
Let's roll.

359
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,850
Me? It's my turn?

360
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:07,850
Give us the top one, Peak.

361
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:08,930
If you don't play it big,

362
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:11,130
I will do it myself.

363
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:17,330
Who has ever

364
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,490
done it with men?

365
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:23,210
Oh...

366
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:26,010
Come on.

367
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:29,370
- Me first.
- What?

368
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:30,250
Hey!

369
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:42,450
You are bad!

370
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:55,970
(Men)

371
00:23:58,090 --> 00:23:59,690
Hey, wow. Hey.

372
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:01,890
You want to pop a cherry?

373
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:03,970
Come on, go on.

374
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:13,610
Who has ever been with a woman?

375
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:15,250
Just a little.

376
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,490
Who has ever done it outdoors?

377
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:40,210
Wait a minute, bro.

378
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:42,250
Hey!

379
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,570
- Me too.
- Come on.

380
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:48,930
Are you feeling it?

381
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,300
This is so hot.

382
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,140
If you are this skilled,

383
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,780
I'm giving you the whole crate.

384
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,900
You said that.

385
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,180
Do you guys have a bottle opener?

386
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,580
Here it is.

387
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,540
I'll open it.

388
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,820
He was drunk in every situation.

389
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,100
I like it.

390
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,420
It opens the whole house
and also bottles.

391
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,660
- Awesome.
- Hey!

392
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,020
He wants to be asked the question
to prevent drinking.

393
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,540
You asked, then you drank.
What is it?

394
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,220
I am a doer, not a talker.

395
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,020
What?

396
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,980
Well, enough, let's continue.

397
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,180
Oh, come on.

398
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,700
Almond will be the one to ask now.

399
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,620
Has anyone ever worked in a group?

400
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,500
He is something.

401
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,180
He is quite good.

402
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,180
Again?

403
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,100
How many glasses now?

404
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,380
Keep going, hey!

405
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,220
- Why don't you continue?
- Come on, you are too slow.

406
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,060
He is on fire now.

407
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,540
Who has ever

408
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,980
got laid with a woman

409
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,460
who has her own snake?

410
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,340
Hey, don't bite me.
Don't bite. I'll do it.

411
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,620
Well, it's...

412
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,220
Again?

413
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,860
I did some of that.

414
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,580
I want to know. I want to try it.

415
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,540
Latte, you too.
Why are you such an expert on this?

416
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:37,150
Because I'm pan.

417
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:39,390
So I don't care much about gender.

418
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:42,310
What is pan?

419
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:44,310
Any gender is fine, any type is fine.

420
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,030
Any gender, any type is fine?

421
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:49,190
Yes, if I like someone,

422
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,670
I like their character.

423
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,670
I know that.

424
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:01,430
I just want to check
if I understand it correctly.

425
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:02,550
It's like that.

426
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,670
My type is coming.

427
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,630
Hey, bro.

428
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:17,950
Don't stare at me like that.

429
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,790
Even though I'm pansexual,
I don't do free sex.

430
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:24,430
So, you have some dirty idea,
right, Peak?

431
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:25,830
Hey! No, no, no, no.

432
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:26,910
I'm sorry.

433
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:30,310
Wow, you stared at me like that.

434
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:31,990
You must have feelings for me.

435
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,150
Not at all.

436
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:38,510
Today, I'm begging you.
Don't get drunk in the group.

437
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,990
We are welcoming the new guy.

438
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,750
- Right, Almond?
- Yes.

439
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:45,310
- Come on, cheers.
- Cheers.

440
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:01,750
Fill it up for you.

441
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:05,430
How did everyone rent this house?

442
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,710
In fact, you guys had been living together
not too long before I came.

443
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:10,590
Why do you seem very close?

444
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,630
So, who should we start with first?

445
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,070
- Yeah!
- Yes.

446
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:21,630
It's you, bro. You'll start first.

447
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:22,670
Me?

448
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,350
Well...

449
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,590
Hello, Jane.

450
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,870
Peak, where are you?

451
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:36,110
Are you going to run away like this?

452
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:38,590
I am sorry.

453
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:42,710
We were supposed to go together.

454
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:44,750
Why?

455
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:47,510
Sorry.

456
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:48,750
No.

457
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:51,230
I don't want to hear
an apology from you.

458
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:54,070
I don't want to hear that
Peak isn't ready, or Peak apologizes.

459
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:56,550
I want to know if you can handle this.

460
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:00,630
I don't know.

461
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,270
And you think I know, right?

462
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,990
You think I am ready?

463
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,070
Well, you'd better say this.

464
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:10,830
What do you want me to do?

465
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,670
I am not ready.

466
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,430
I am sorry.

467
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:20,190
I...

468
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,390
You are not responsible for this, right?

469
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:31,630
Well...

470
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:36,430
I'm disappointed in you.

471
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:04,590
I just got a new job in Bangkok.

472
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:05,590
So, I quickly moved here.

473
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,390
Then I searched the internet
and found this house.

474
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:08,430
So I walked in.

475
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,590
What is your job?

476
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:10,750
I am a programmer.

477
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:13,230
I look after the back door system
for ABZD Company.

478
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:17,390
That company has a sister firm
named EFG, right?

479
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:21,390
Then H, I, J, K...

480
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:24,030
L, M, N, O, P.

481
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:26,990
Q, R, S, T, U, V...

482
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:28,630
Enough already.

483
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:33,110
The company's name is AB...

484
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:37,030
ZD.

485
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,470
Latte, you're easy to get teased.

486
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:42,310
Oh...

487
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,430
What about you, Thanwa?

488
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,430
How come you live in this house?

489
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:48,590
Me?

490
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:58,040
(Cheap house for rent)

491
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,480
Hello. Is this the rental house?

492
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,960
That's right.

493
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,160
When is the earliest time that I can
move into that house?

494
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,040
You can move in today.

495
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,920
Ah, thank you.

496
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,920
Are you really leaving?

497
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,760
Thanwa.

498
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,000
Thanwa, I am sorry.

499
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,680
My lease at
the previous apartment ended.

500
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,560
So, I looked for the place
that'd be more convenient for me.

501
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,360
I found this house
and it's not bad at all.

502
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,920
It has separate rooms
and a shared kitchen.

503
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,640
That's true. Anyway,

504
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,040
what do you do for a living?

505
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,560
Me?

506
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,200
I just graduated, like you.

507
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,720
I sent my resume to every company.

508
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,960
Never heard any feedback.

509
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,760
I understand. Keep fighting.

510
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,440
Thanks, bro.

511
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,840
What about you, Latte?
How did you end up here?

512
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,840
Well...

513
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,840
Oh, no!

514
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,040
Let's go now.

515
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,080
Ran out of gas.

516
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,840
Such bad luck.

517
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,440
Hey, my helmet.

518
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,080
Pay me now.

519
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,200
Here, keep your change.

520
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,600
Come on.

521
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,400
Please help me.

522
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,280
My wetlook.

523
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,120
Hello.

524
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:15,640
Hello, Professor.

525
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,840
Professor.

526
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,840
Please help me.

527
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,560
I will not come late again.

528
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,720
I don't know.

529
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,360
If you come late again,

530
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,040
I will give you an F.

531
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,160
Please, Professor.

532
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,440
I was struck in the rain,
traffic, flood.

533
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,560
It's not like I want it to happen.

534
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,760
So, why everyone else can come on time?

535
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,520
You can either withdraw this subject,

536
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,200
or apply again next semester.

537
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,200
You should do less partying

538
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,480
and find a place near the university.

539
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,840
Yes.

540
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,960
My house was far away
from the university.

541
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,360
It took me 4 hours.

542
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,800
So, I moved in here.
It is closer to my university.

543
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,120
His alarm clock is so loud.

544
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,320
At least three rounds.

545
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,600
We all woke up except him.

546
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,200
I am a deep sleeper.

547
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,440
Um...

548
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,720
It takes you time to sleep too.

549
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,240
You always have meetings.

550
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,280
That means Latte and Thanwa moved in
at the same time.

551
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,360
Peak moved in later.

552
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,000
What is your first impression of them?

553
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:50,880
Well...

554
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:33,310
Are you awake?

555
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,590
You are the new guy, right?

556
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:39,590
Where did you party last night?

557
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:40,830
You look like a mess.

558
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,870
Let's have some breakfast.

559
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:54,070
I am Latte.

560
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:59,550
Oh, you smell like alcohol.

561
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:03,110
Oh, this is Thanwa.

562
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,190
It looks yummy. Right?

563
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,150
I can tell you that Thanwa

564
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,510
is very good at cooking.

565
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:09,830
But,

566
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:11,950
we all chip in for the food.

567
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,470
Let's eat.

568
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,350
Or it will be cold.

569
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:26,070
Oh, you looked like a mess.

570
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:28,710
Will I get to see you like that?

571
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:30,150
Enough.

572
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:33,030
What about you?
Why did you end up here?

573
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:36,310
Is this knock-knock house?

574
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:37,390
That's right.

575
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:39,390
I am Almond.

576
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:42,070
I sent you an email
regarding the move-in date.

577
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:43,710
Oh, right.

578
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,430
Are you coming this Saturday?

579
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,270
That's right.

580
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:48,870
May I move in earlier?

581
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:51,230
I checked with the owner,

582
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:53,550
he said you could come 2 weeks earlier.

583
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:55,710
You need to pay extra money.

584
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,230
Money is not a problem.

585
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:01,230
I will transfer
and send you a bank slip.

586
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,390
Thank you very much.

587
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:18,510
What?

588
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,470
Why don't you tell me
you will move out today?

589
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:22,070
I will ask the driver to take you there.

590
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:24,790
It's all right, Mom.

591
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:27,750
I arranged the pick-up car.

592
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:30,950
I didn't want to interrupt you.

593
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,670
You must tell me.

594
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:34,830
Why do you need to pay more?

595
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:38,870
At the condo, it has

596
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:41,230
pick-up service for free.

597
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,590
It's complimentary.

598
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:44,150
You don't have to worry about me.

599
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,350
Okay.

600
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:47,230
I will see you in Bangkok.

601
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:48,750
No!

602
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:51,350
What? What are you saying?

603
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,590
There is a security system at the condo

604
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,350
to scan the eyes.

605
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,590
If you're coming, you tell me first.

606
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,230
Hmm...

607
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:08,430
Fabulous! I like it.

608
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,990
Then you should go practice Dhamma
with Aunt Nid.

609
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,950
If I get home, I'll call you.

610
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:16,030
Okay, bye, love you.

611
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,470
A close call.

612
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:02,830
Oh.

613
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,630
I ate almost the entire restaurant.

614
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:07,030
Your glass is still full.

615
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:11,110
We play the game "Never Have I Ever",
which means you've never done anything at all.

616
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:13,390
Is it true?

617
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:16,710
Bow down to him.

618
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,190
Actually, I used to do it.

619
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:24,150
But the story isn't worth talking about.

620
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:25,390
Oh.

621
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:27,430
Do we still have secrets in this group?

622
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:28,470
Huh.

623
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:30,230
Tell us, everything will stay
in this group, don't worry.

624
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:31,950
Say it.

625
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:36,630
Well,

626
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:40,950
I once had a very passionate night
with a senior.

627
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:49,070
That senior had a dragon tattoo
on his right arm.

628
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:53,150
It was hotter than the sun tattoo
he had on the middle of his chest.

629
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:56,630
And that senior

630
00:40:57,430 --> 00:40:58,830
whispered in my ear.

631
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:01,950
He said...

632
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:04,630
My dragon

633
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,030
isn't just on my arm.

634
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:10,110
And he pressed your head down
to do it, right?

635
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:12,630
Are you in the same room as him?

636
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:16,870
I've seen this clip on Doo Ponds.

637
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:18,670
It's on Trend.

638
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:21,110
This scene received a score of 3.58.

639
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:22,870
What is Trend's ranking?

640
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:24,430
Ranked No. 1.

641
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:30,190
Oh wow, it's all gone.

642
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:32,390
Oh my god!

643
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:34,110
Hey, Peak. No.

644
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:41,590
That's right.

645
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:43,910
I've never done it yet.

646
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:45,070
That's it.

647
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:46,710
I said so.

648
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:50,190
I haven't experienced this
with anyone yet.

649
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:52,790
Other friends

650
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:53,990
already have this experience,

651
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:55,870
but I

652
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:58,470
haven't even kissed anyone yet.

653
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:01,750
Calm down, why so serious?

654
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:03,830
I have made up my mind

655
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:07,590
that I really want to try it for the first time
with someone I really like.

656
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:13,870
And I don't know how to start.

657
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:18,710
Well...

658
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:22,950
So do you have someone you like?

659
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:24,070
Have you found someone you like?

660
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:25,830
You can tell us.

661
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:30,510
Who is it, a friend from college?

662
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,080
Do you have his photo or Instagram?

663
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,240
Yes.

664
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:36,760
No, I don't want it.

665
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,000
Are you afraid of me flirting with him?

666
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:42,920
Which Instagram?

667
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,240
Hurry up.

668
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,080
Wow!

669
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,880
Let me have a look.

670
00:42:58,720 --> 00:42:59,560
(Jumper's Instagram)

671
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,800
Jumper!

672
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,360
Did you meet him
for the first time at university?

673
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,120
In fact, we've known each other

674
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,320
since high school.

675
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,480
And now we study in the same faculty.

676
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:14,720
Wow!

677
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,440
This is one-sided first love.

678
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:19,720
I don't know if it's one-sided or not,
but have you ever asked him?

679
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:26,600
Peak. Oh.

680
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,480
Could you please stop him?

681
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,200
- I'm afraid...
- Almond, Almond, please stop.

682
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,240
He will vomit.

683
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,720
That's enough.

684
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:39,720
It's okay.

685
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:41,760
Do you know?

686
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,280
My life

687
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,040
has always been around my mother.

688
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,320
I never had time

689
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,800
or went out to gain any experience.

690
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,200
And I'm here

691
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,680
because I lied to my mother.

692
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:56,720
That's good.

693
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,000
Why is it good?

694
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,240
I feel terrible.

695
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,920
I told my mother

696
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,280
that I would move into a nice condo
near the university.

697
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,440
But I chose to be here.

698
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,400
Because I want to live the life
that I want to try.

699
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,760
Well, this is it.

700
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:18,080
Stay here with us, live life to the fullest,
do whatever you want.

701
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,280
Well, I don't know how to start.

702
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,560
I'm single.

703
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,800
Come on.

704
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,480
Even if you're single,
it doesn't matter.

705
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,840
No.

706
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:36,840
I want to.

707
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,840
Everyone must help me.

708
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:39,680
Hah?

709
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,960
Huh? Huh? Huh?

710
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,360
You want us to help you?

711
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,280
Oh, Almond.

712
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,360
I've told you that even though
I'm pansexual,

713
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,200
and I did it,

714
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,560
I don't do free sex.

715
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:58,440
You can't ask the three of us
to have sex with you right now.

716
00:44:58,680 --> 00:44:59,840
It's not like that.

717
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,480
I don't want anyone to break my cherry.

718
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:05,440
So what?

719
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,440
I just don't want to be
a virgin anymore.

720
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:12,440
Because I want to have sex
with the person I really like.

721
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:16,280
So what can I do to help?

722
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,800
You start by flirting with him first.

723
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,440
If there is someone in this house

724
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:38,440
who could make me get someone I like,

725
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,480
I'm willing to pay for his room
for one month.

726
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,160
Is there anything left in that crate?

727
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,920
- I'll look at it for you.
- I'll go to the bathroom.

728
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:48,880
There's nothing left.

729
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:49,800
Open it.

730
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,360
- Wait a minute.
- I'll open it for you.

731
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,960
Where's the bottle opener?

732
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:54,840
For one year.

733
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:57,520
Deal!

734
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:07,680
Deal!

735
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:10,680
It's very good.

736
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,120
Then let's make an oath.

737
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:18,480
The mission for Almond came true.

738
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:20,520
Let Almond end up with
