Peak.

11
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:25,210
What are we going to do now?

12
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:30,530
Maybe

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:32,730
we have to try to reconcile with him.

(Start)

18
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:49,970
Yes, Kit.

(Lose)

20
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,160
I am available. Please go ahead.

21
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,460
Bad timing.

22
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:58,890
Your turn now.

23
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,680
Okay.

29

It's fine.

30
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,300
If you're going to be angry,
be angry all the way.

31
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,890
I won't give in.

32
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,290
All right.

33
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,950

34
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,040

"Knock Knock, Boys!"
(Episode 9)

51
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,560
You have never understood me at all.

52
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,070
Thanwa.

53
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,810
Oh, there are dead people now.

54
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,040
You just went in there.

55
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,520
Peak, you can do it.

56
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,650
Today, you woke up late.

57
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,500
You are really the one who shouldn't tease
anyone for waking up late.

58
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:23,320
Yes, the morning guy.

59
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,240
Because you have to talk to your mother.

60
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,980
Hello, Mom. I love you, Mom.

61
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:28,880
Kiss.

62
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,840
Latte.

63
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,630
At that time,
I was suddenly dragged on a trip.

64
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,670
My mom thought someone had kidnapped me.

65
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,380
I believe you.

66
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:38,740
If you didn't pick up
the call from your mom,

67
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,150
she would report it to the police.

68
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:42,710
That was possible.

69
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,860
Do you need more sauce?

70
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,940
I am okay.

71
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,060
Do you want to share with me, Peak?

72
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,470
I can grab some from Latte's plate.

73
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:11,370
Yes,

74
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,790
I'm not very hungry today.

75
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:13,660
Is it not delicious?

76
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,420
Seems like Latte and Almond
do not really want to eat.

77
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,220
It's delicious.

78
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,100
I miss Chef Thanwa's cooking.

79
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,800
That's true.

80
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,680
Then, let's eat.

81
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:27,730
No...

82
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,260
need...

83
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,030
to share with someone.

84
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,440
- Yes.
- Yes.

85
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,800
Oh.

86
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,320
Today, what time
do you have to go to the office?

87
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:10,970
It's 10 a.m.

88
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,930
Oh, that's right.
It's your first day on the job.

89
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,850
Keep fighting.

90
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,600
Thank you.

91
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,100
When it's payday, don't
forget to treat us to a hotpot.

92
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,340
Sure thing, how many do you want to eat?

93
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,200
- You've said it.
- All right.

94
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,060
Let's go.

95
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,270
Bye, Thanwa.

96
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,210
Bye.

97
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,050
Bye, Peak.

98
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,540
Those two being together,
would it be okay?

99
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,120
It's fine, they have to clear things up.

100
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,260
What if the two of them
can't make things right...

101
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,190
Thanwa.

102
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,550
What are you doing to me?

103
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:15,850
I am starving.

104
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,920
You don't have the right to call me Thanwa.

105
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,240
Are we that close?

106
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,910
I am sorry.

107
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,440
Mr. Thanwa.

108
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,620
Are you hungry?

109
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,740
And now,

110
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,100
do you know what you did wrong?

111
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,080
I don't know.

112
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,320
If you don't know,

113
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,330
you will be hungry like this from now on.

114
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,460
Let me go, Mr. Thanwa.

115
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,340
Do you want some?

116
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,170
Mr. Thanwa. No.

117
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,400
I am truly sorry. I did now know.

118
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,680
Mr. Thanwa. Mr. Thanwa.
Mr. Thanwa. Mr. Thanwa.

119
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,930
What is it, Latte?

120
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,080
You are thinking too much.

121
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,450
Can't you see Thanwa is that angry at Peak?

122
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,380
He doesn't even go
as far as killing each other.

123
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,600
Who knows? People these days

124
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,840
get upset over little things
and end up hating each other to death.

125
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,070
Just getting with each other
doesn't lead to death.

126
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:19,280
Latte, you are so naughty.

127
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,440
Let's go now.

128
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,010
They just get each other,
there is no death.

129
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,240
This is embarrassing, keep your voice low.

130
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:40,850
Back off.

131
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,090
What's up with you?

132
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:48,860
These are shoes.

133
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,290
For you to wear it to your work.

134
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,160
What?

135
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,630
Don't you wear this pair of shoes?

136
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:01,780
It's Latte's shoes.

137
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,180
Oh.

138
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,390
I'll put the shoes on for you.

139
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,920
What's wrong with you?

140
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,930
I help you put on the shoes.

141
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,100
I'll do it myself.

142
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,500
So, I...

143
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:38,370
Almond.

144
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,320
Almond.

145
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:41,810
What's wrong?

146
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,640
Are they going to be okay?

147
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,430
If they are angry at each other
for a long time, and our home falls apart?

148
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,900
It's not difficult,
I have a way to solve it.

149
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,310
How?

150
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,600
Just do the same like
when we went to the beach.

151
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,520
The beach is great.

152
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,640
Latte!

153
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,470
What?

154
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,130
You are worried about
Peak and Thanwa just now.

155
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,840
Or...

156
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:55,490
you still think about that birthmark.

157
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,220
I already told you that I have none.

158
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,610
If you don't believe me,

159
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,660
I will take you

160
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,690
to prove it.

161
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,040
Focus on studying, we'll do it later.

162
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,480
Today, before we end this class,

163
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,580
the student committee
has news to inform you.

164
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,170
Please wait for a moment.

165
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,200
Please get on stage.

166
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,240
Hello everyone.

167
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,960
I am a representative
from the student committee.

168
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,290
I have news to inform you.

169
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:57,400
In the case where there was a clip
secretly taken at our university,

170
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,880
by an ill-intentioned person.

171
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:02,140
The police are now handling the case.

172
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,380
The real culprit is

173
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,020
the group who

174
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,270
secretly film the clips
and post them online.

175
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,630
If there is anyone

176
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:11,000
who got badly affected

177
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,620
or was a victim because of this group.

178
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,760
We have created an online complaint channel

179
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,870
on the Student Committee Facebook page.

180
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,160
I also need to emphasize,

181
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,150
secretly filming without consent
and using it online for personal gain.

182
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,080
This is so wrong.

183
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,200
I hope that everyone

184
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,950
in this room will understand

185
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:34,370
and see the importance of these issues.

186
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,520
Please help warn your friends
about these things.

187
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:39,590
Today, one of our friends

188
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,370
wants to say something.

189
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:42,930
Please join me.

190
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,520
Hello everyone.

191
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,510
I am Lookpeach.

192
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,570
I am Almond and Jumper's friend.

193
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,880
I want to speak about the leaked clips

194
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,330
at University Sports Center.

195
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,750
Both of my friends

196
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,720
are the victims.

197
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,900
One of them

198
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,360
was secretly filmed without his consent.

199
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:17,420
Another person was mistaken for a culprit.

200
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,310
I want to tell everyone that

201
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:22,170
society these days
judges people very easily.

202
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,230
It's so easy to forget that
we are only human.

203
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,630
Everyone just saw one clip,

204
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:29,240
or listened to just one sentence.

205
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,210
You have already judged them.

206
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:34,480
I hope that something like this
will never happen to anyone again.

207
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,800
I agree with Lookpeach.

208
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,510
But sometimes the clip we see

209
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,120
misleads us in some way.

210
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,890
It's quite difficult

211
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:47,100
for us to not misunderstand.

212
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,580
I understand that

213
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,520
something like that can be misunderstood.

214
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,260
But to spread the rumor or tease them,

215
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,560
make fun of them

216
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,270
when you did not know the whole truth.

217
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,990
That kind of behavior

218
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,570
came out a bit mean to me.

219
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:03,200
If those two think of doing something bad

220
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,250
like committing suicide,

221
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,040
what would you do?

222
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,020
Judging people in just a moment.

223
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,840
Taking pleasure in momentarily
insulting someone.

224
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,570
It can leave a scar
in someone's heart for their entire life.

225
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,280
If it's the case,

226
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,850
we will be more careful about this.

227
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,050
And I want to apologize

228
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,200
to both Almond and Jumper.

229
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,610
Thank you everyone.

230
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,780
It's good.

231
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,040
Sorry

232
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,330
I am sorry, Almond.

233
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,070
I am sorry, Almond, Jumper.

234
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,550
Sorry.

235
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,780
(Studio 1)

236
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,690
The first half of the year was tough,

237
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,860
the second half of the year
will definitely be tough.

238
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:55,450
We just closed the deal
with our 10 big clients.

239
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,920
- Wow.
- That means at the end of this year

240
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,880
we will have money to take everyone
to travel to Japan, right?

241
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,900
- That's right.
- Cool.

242
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,900
But... on the condition
that the customer pays on time.

243
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:07,060
All right.

244
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,150
So, we will review each project now.

245
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,170
Starting with the first project.

246
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,640
Here you are.

247
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,240
"How is your first day at work?"

248
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,350
So let's take a look at each project,
shall we?

249
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,300
(How is your first day at work?)

250
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:24,960
Read but don't answer.

251
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,560
What should I do?

252
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:33,730
We need to finish it as soon as possible.

253
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,240
Because this is a big client.

254
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,720
- All right?
- Yes, we can do it.

255
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,740
Remember this one is important.

256
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:40,350
I remember it.

257
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:42,580
"Don't overdo it and forget to eat."

258
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:43,920
Let me see it.

259
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,830
This one.

260
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:47,390
No, it's this one.

261
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,020
This one is here.

262
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,540
(Don't overdo it and forget to eat.)

263
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:03,330
If we can't do it, we will use outsourcing.

264
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,000
"Fighting, you can tell me anything."

265
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,410
"I am working right now."

266
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:14,420
"Stop sending your message."

267
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,840
We need a hundred extras.

268
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,570
Are you having a problem
with your boyfriend?

269
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,600
I am so sorry.

270
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,780
No need to apologize.

271
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:31,990
I understand.

272
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:33,150
A young love

273
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,780
always full of emotion.

274
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,430
But our client has more emotion,
all in red.

275
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,390
Kit.

276
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,740
How can you say that?

277
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,730
Although our client is tough,

278
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,010
but they pay us on time.

279
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,680
- Yes, they pay us on time.
- Yes.

280
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,580
So we have money.

281
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,460
Yes.

282
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,610
We will have a bonus this year, okay?

283
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:49,870
- Okay.
- Is that right?

284
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,310
- Yes, sir.
- We need to prioritize

285
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,800
our client relationship.

286
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,160
- What does client mean?
- A god.

287
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,890
That's right, Kit. You are good.

288
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:57,720
What can I do now?

289
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,540
Whatever I did is wrong.

290
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,090
You are so lame, Peak.

291
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,840
Where are you going, Latte?

292
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,680
Come on.

293
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,800
Just look at it with your eyes.

294
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,500
Are you serious, Latte?

295
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:15,500
Yes, so you can rest this case.

296
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,760
I will take it off now.

297
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,670
- I'll do it now.
- Wait a second.

298
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,830
I will take it off now.

299
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:30,170
Wait a second.

300
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,180
Huh!

301
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:34,870
Ready?

302
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,410
Okay.

303
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,560
Okay.

304
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,270
What?

305
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,060
Why is it pointing at me?

306
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,750
I can't help it,

307
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:00,400
I am with you now.

308
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,100
Move to the left.

309
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,800
Left, what left?

310
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:14,980
Go to my left.

311
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,370
Move to the right.

312
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:20,830
To the right too?

313
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,450
Yes, go to the right.

314
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,520
Move up a bit.

315
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,400
- Move up?
- Yes.

316
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,380
Go lower.

317
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,800
Low, lower?

318
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:34,650
Yes.

319
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:38,770
Turn it.

320
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:39,610
Turn?

321
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:40,980
Yes, turn.

322
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:42,880
Like, spin it?

323
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,720
Yes.

324
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,010
Is it finished?

325
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,780
Wait a second.

326
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,560
- Is it finished?
- It's all right now.

327
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,250
So, you can close the case now.

328
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,230
Yes.

329
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,050
I feel much better.

330
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,130
Oh, there you are.

331
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,560
Where have you been?

332
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:24,940
What's wrong, Latte?

333
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,010
Why are you holding your bag like that?

334
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,230
I have a stomachache.

335
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,730
You didn't have
a spcicy papaya salad, right?

336
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,190
Yes, yes.

337
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,670
I had it, so I got a stomachache.

338
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:35,510
Oh,

339
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,450
and why is Almond's face so red?

340
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:39,740
Where did you go to soak in the sun?

341
00:19:49,245 --> 00:19:50,370
The weather is hot.

342
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,120
- Oh!
- Yes, the weather is hot.

343
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,080
Yes, it's hot.

344
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:59,130
So, Lookpeach.
Thank you very much for today.

345
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,590
You spoke for us in front of everyone.

346
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,040
It's nothing.

347
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:05,010
I can only hope that something like this
won't happen to anyone else.

348
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,190
How about you, Jumper?

349
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:09,300
What did your parents say about this?

350
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,160
We talked about it.

351
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:15,880
Apparently,

352
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,180
my Pa and Ma apologized to me.

353
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:22,110
What they did caused me to be unhappy

354
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,130
and I hid the truth from them.

355
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,220
They also said that

356
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,680
whoever I become,

357
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,080
I am still their son.

358
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,070
Oh!

359
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,460
I don't know why it came down to this.

360
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,760
But I feel so good.

361
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,200
Oh,

362
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,270
or it's because of the birthmark?

363
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:45,490
A birthmark?

364
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:46,620
Yes, a birthmark.

365
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:49,410
Well,

366
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,580
I have a birthmark on my inner thigh.

367
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,020
My mom even took me to
fortuneteller.

368
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,060
But he said it was for protection.

369
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,660
So, I keep it.

370
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,150
He also said

371
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,800
if I encounter bad situations,

372
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,770
they will eventually resolve
in a positive way.

373
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,060
Really?

374
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,280
What is your zodiac sign, Jumper?

375
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:07,540
Aries.

376
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,840
My birthday is close to Latte.

377
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,950
- Really?
- Yes.

378
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,090
So, this is Jumper.

379
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,080
Society these days

380
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,960
judges people very easily.

381
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,980
By the time the truth is revealed,

382
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,870
those involved

383
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:28,550
have already suffered
and endured so much pain.

384
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,060
Ouch!

385
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,400
You did it so many times today.

386
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,570
You also did this so many times.

387
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:38,660
Why do you like violence?

388
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,490
Causing harm at the slightest provocation.

389
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:41,900
Huh?

390
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,910
Let go of me.

391
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,150
I won't let you go.

392
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,600
Let go of me.

393
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,640
No way.

394
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,470
Let go of me.

395
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:49,840
I won't let you go.

396
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:50,710
Get off me.

397
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,090
You're annoying.

398
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,130
Am I annoying you?

399
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:01,970
Yes!

400
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,470
So annoying.

401
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:05,060
Just go away from me.

402
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,440
Do you really want to
go away from you, don't you?

403
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,280
Yes.

404
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,890
Just go wherever you want to go.

405
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,050
I don't care.

406
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,730
Well...

407
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:43,750
I'm sorry that

408
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,860
I'm such a nuisance to you.

409
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,110
Follow him now, Almond.

410
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,120
- Just go.
- Go now.

411
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,390
Follow him now.

412
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,380
Do it now.

413
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:57,470
Latte.

414
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:03,720
Where are you going, Latte?

415
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,280
Latte.

416
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,530
What's wrong with you, Latte?

417
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:10,630
I'm afraid you'll be annoyed.

418
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:13,200
No, I didn't mean to say that.

419
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,140
Don't force yourself,
I won't bother you again.

420
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,000
Latte, wait for me.

421
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,870
Hello. What's up?

422
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:36,580
Are you free? I need your advice.

423
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:38,160
Not really but we can talk.

424
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,160
Do you have any way
I can reconcile with Thanwa?

425
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,000
Did I speak too harshly at that time?

426
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:43,580
I think Thanwa is thinking too much.

427
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:46,030
Is he really that angry with me?

428
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,240
So, is that case?

429
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:48,610
Right now I'm not in the mood.

430
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:58,790
Hello.

431
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,120
Are you free, Almond?

432
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,200
I need your advice.

433
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:03,280
Not really but we can talk.

434
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,450
Did you see this morning
when Thanwa was sulking with me?

435
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,340
How can I reconcile with him?

436
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:09,850
I don't know.

437
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,370
If you find the way, please tell me too.

438
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:12,750
How to deal with someone angry?

439
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:14,200
I have to go.

440
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,780
What's wrong with him?

441
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,380
What happened to them?

442
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,820
(Jane)

443
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:35,730
Go ahead.

444
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:37,350
Well,

445
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:38,960
the voice is very unwelcome.

446
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,720
Is something wrong?

447
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:43,870
There's only one thing.

448
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,660
When will you come back
to resolve the issues at home?

449
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:47,750
I can't hold it any longer.

450
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:49,100
Sorry, Jane.

451
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:51,560
There is some problem here
that I have to deal with.

452
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,680
Can we talk later?

453
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:56,810
Wow!

454
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:59,950
I guess the problems in Bangkok
are bigger than the problems at home.

455
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,080
Please give me a little more time, Jane.

456
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:05,100
Peak, the wedding is in a few weeks.

457
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:07,530
It won't happen if the groom is still here.

458
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:08,370
Peak.

459
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,670
What? Hello?

460
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:32,460
(Very Happy Studio)

461
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:40,860
Here you are.

462
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:43,660
(Studio 1)

463
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:56,140
"Knock Knock, Boys!"

464
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,390
Oh, Thanwa.

465
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:03,200
Someone just dropped off some snacks.
Come with coffee.

466
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,140
For me?

467
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,240
Um, yes.

468
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,470
Hey, the egg tarts at this shop
are really delicious.

469
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:11,030
But there's a big queue.

470
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:12,760
I'm too lazy to stand and wait.

471
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,380
The shop that on
other two blocks away, right?

472
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,820
Um, yes.

473
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,990
There is a long queue, waiting for hours.

474
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,380
And what you are eating is...

475
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,940
Oh... your boxes are here.

476
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,920
But the guy who bought it said

477
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,580
it's for the whole office.

478
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,290
Oh...

479
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,770
And the coffee is in the refrigerator.

480
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,850
Yes, thank you.

481
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:42,380
Next time, tell your boyfriend that

482
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,760
he didn't have to stand
awkwardly in front of the studio.

483
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,060
Just walk in.

484
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,660
Standing in the sun, it's hot.

485
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,900
- Well, that's...
- Oh...

486
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:52,390
I will share the tarts with the staff now.

487
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:53,740
Okay.

488
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:55,130
Thank you very much, Aunty.

489
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:55,970
Yes.

490
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,000
(Eat well)

491
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,920
Eat well.

492
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,090
- It might be...
- Everyone.

493
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:11,840
someone bought egg tarts for you all.

494
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,920
Hurry, let's share. Very delicious.

495
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,760
From who?

496
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,870
Well, let's eat first. Come on.

497
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:19,130
- Ah, that's fine.
- Egg tarts...

498
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:24,130
It's delicious.

499
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:29,590
- Delicious.
- Yes.

500
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:30,940
- Very sweet.
- Is what you ate delicious?

501
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,490
- Hmm, very delicious.
- Well, try eating it.

502
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,960
- Hey, um.
- It's delicious.

503
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,420
It's still hot.

504
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,050
Hey, is it good?

505
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,820
Hello.

506
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,090
I was wondering who bought the tarts.

507
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:47,930
Who?

508
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:48,960
It's you, right?

509
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,500
No, Sir.

510
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:51,970
No?

511
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,870
Does that mean these came from
your boyfriend?

512
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,870
That's it, I said it.

513
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,890
Reconcile with each other.
It's also good to reconcile with egg tarts.

514
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,850
I think my brother is a hot guy.

515
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:05,500
Whoever wins his heart
would love him very much.

516
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,010
Is that right?

517
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:09,440
His boyfriend is very handsome too.

518
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,260
- That's right.
- That's it.

519
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,790
You get a good one.

520
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,610
Let's eat, go ahead.

521
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,890
You really know how to reconcile with me.

522
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:51,760
I won't post a story
because you would think you won.

523
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:54,990
Who are you talking to?

524
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:57,450
Uh...

525
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,020
Uh... with...

526
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:00,860
Do you have it?

527
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:02,020
Have...

528
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:02,880
Do you have any left for me?

529
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:05,780
- Oh.
- I'm sorry, I just wanted to eat more.

530
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,510
Oh, it's all gone.

531
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:12,020
Oh, that's good. You're growing up.
I understand. Got it.

532
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,720
Hey, there are some frictions.

533
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,210
- Ah, Bro.
- Come on... eat it.

534
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,580
- Hey.
- Don't believe me.

535
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:25,230
Peak.

536
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:26,870
What should we do?

537
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:28,910
We must give in.

538
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,300
So, you go ahead.

539
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,170
I will observe it as a guideline.

540
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:40,850
Okay.

541
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:41,770
Watch and learn.

542
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:55,360
Yes, Kit.

543
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,230
I'm free. You can talk.

544
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,410
What happened?

545
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:05,230
The timing is not good.

546
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,660
It's your turn.

547
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,390
Okay.

548
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,360
La...

549
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,280
Yes...

550
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,400
If you're going to be angry,
stay angry all the time.

551
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:44,870
I won't give in anymore.

552
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:50,980
Yes.

553
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,160
The voice is too low.

554
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,140
Anyway, I look at all the details.
You can do it first.

555
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,710
Anyway, I'm done collecting.
I'll tell you again.

556
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,440
Yes, thank you very much.

557
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,520
Bye, Kit.

558
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,020
I am very busy now.

559
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:16,710
Starting to work a new job
will always be like this.

560
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,110
Right.

561
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:23,820
Have a glass of water,
it will make you feel fresh.

562
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,520
If you think you will reconcile with water

563
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,520
or food and it will help me
stop being angry with you,

564
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:32,940
You are wrong.

565
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:44,570
Whatever.

566
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:46,590
At least Thanwa is talking to me, finally.

567
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,000
(Human Relation)

568
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,490
Everyone, see you tomorrow at 1 p.m.

569
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:57,640
Okay, see you.

570
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,370
Yes.

571
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,410
- Okay.
- Okay.

572
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:05,140
We agree.

573
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,800
(Human Relationships)

574
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:16,440
(Latte unsent a message)

575
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,990
- A script?
- Yes.

576
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,280
- Look.
- Hey, hey.

577
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,220
How is it?

578
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:36,270
Hello, Almond.

579
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:51,390
Here.

580
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,220
Latte.

581
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,690
Wow!

582
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,280
Just like this.

583
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,890
This is awesome, Lookpeach.

584
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:12,620
Are you writing a BL fiction novel?

585
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,460
Um...

586
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,060
Hey... does everyone know about this?

587
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,500
- Jumper.
- Huh?

588
00:33:24,810 --> 00:33:25,700
How long have you known?

589
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:27,020
Oh, we...

590
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,980
I found out a few days ago.

591
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:31,980
Me too.

592
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,140
Oh, that is... uh...

593
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:35,830
that we invited everyone today

594
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:38,890
because I want you
to read my new novel.

595
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:40,220
All right.

596
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:41,600
Are we the first group here?

597
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,200
Yes.

598
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,190
But it's not just reading.

599
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:46,700
I'd like to read it out loud as well.

600
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:47,830
Read it out loud?

601
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:51,600
Well... it's like... the previous novel,

602
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,320
the dialogue was not very smooth.

603
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:56,660
I want you to read out loud,
so I can adjust some things.

604
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,440
Hey, this is a really good idea.

605
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,760
So where do you need us to read?

606
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:04,780
I have prepared 2 chapters, so...

607
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,300
let's try the first chapter.

608
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,540
So who are the characters?

609
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,020
I will have Latte and Almond

610
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,660
as the main characters of this story.

611
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:18,520
As for me,

612
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,190
I will read the narration.

613
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,700
So let's get started, shall we?

614
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:26,750
Come on.

615
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,620
Almond, come on.

616
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:40,050
Well, you are just like that.

617
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:42,750
It's... that bad?

618
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:45,750
I'm tired.

619
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,080
We've known each other for a long time.

620
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,130
I know that you are not good
at reading people.

621
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,680
But I didn't think that
my friend wouldn't be this smart.

622
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:53,820
Wow!

623
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,530
You can call me stupid.

624
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,670
Oh, okay, you idiot.

625
00:34:58,330 --> 00:34:59,170
Jane.

626
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:00,110
Just kidding.

627
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,320
Well, listen and think about it.

628
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,220
When people get angry,

629
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,630
there has to be something
to be angry about, right?

630
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,100
That's right.

631
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,230
If he is so angry,

632
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:11,690
that means it must be a serious matter.
Is that right?

633
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:12,870
That's right.

634
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:14,550
Okay.

635
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:15,600
So, let's think about it.

636
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,860
Have you ever said something
so harshly to Thanwa?

637
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,110
Crazy, no.

638
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:23,230
What do you think? I mean emotionally.

639
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:30,020
I am not smart at all.

640
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,420
Yes, you are.

641
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,900
But now Uncle is coming.

642
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,570
I have to go now. Having said that

643
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:39,070
you need to clear and reconcile
with him as soon as possible.

644
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,110
Then come back and fix
the problems at home.

645
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,620
That's all for now, bye.

646
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:54,270
In the lobby of the same hotel,

647
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:56,390
he sat nervously on the sofa.

648
00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:00,190
He tried to look up.
When will the Young Master come down?

649
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:02,480
He clasped his hands together tightly.

650
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:04,910
He was sweating and blaming himself,

651
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:07,680
that he should not speak harshly
to his Young Master.

652
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:08,860
Suddenly,

653
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,540
the Young Master appeared.

654
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,430
He got up and went towards
him without holding back.

655
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:14,970
Young Master,

656
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:17,260
Why are you here?

657
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:19,740
I've come to see you, Young Master.

658
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:22,780
Do I still matter to you?

659
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,770
The Young Master tried to walk away.

660
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:27,490
But then he tried to follow.

661
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:37,470
Please, Young Master.
Listen to me first.

662
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:40,510
Is there anything I need to hear from you?

663
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,420
I'm sorry.

664
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,730
I was wrong.

665
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,730
You don't have to apologize
to a worthless person like me.

666
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,400
No.

667
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:52,100
It's my fault.

668
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,400
I shouldn't have said something like that.

669
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:56,930
Why do you care about me?

670
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:59,180
I'm not important to you anymore.

671
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,110
Young Master is
the most important person to me.

672
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,650
I will not let you go.

673
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:06,590
You've let me go.

674
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,550
Since you said those words.

675
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,380
No.

676
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,320
I know.

677
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:16,800
I know that I haven't lost you.

678
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:18,190
That's enough.

679
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:19,720
I don't want to listen.

680
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,000
Whatever!

681
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:25,260
If you don't want to listen,
you don't have to.

682
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,440
I'm tired of giving in to you.

683
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:30,550
Why don't you know what I am upset about?

684
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:31,760
So why don't you say it?

685
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,980
What should I apologize for?

686
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,110
- Who will start first?
- Who will start first?

687
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,740
Hey, cut, cut, cut. Take it easy.

688
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:36,580
Take it easy.

689
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:39,020
So, let's take a break for 5 minutes.
Then we'll resume this chapter.

690
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,280
Okay.

691
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,740
Calm down.

692
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,440
Okay.

693
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,480
I don't think it works, Lookpeach.

694
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,140
What should I do?

695
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,590
Another chapter is like this too.

696
00:37:55,756 --> 00:37:57,346
- Exactly the same.
- Exactly.

697
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:01,270
So, is there any chapter

698
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,310
about a heart-to-heart confession?

699
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,930
I do have it...

700
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,660
but...

701
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:22,290
Thanwa.

702
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,870
Don't tell me
you fought with your boyfriend again?

703
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,430
He is not my boyfriend.

704
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:30,730
But he might be
the one in the future, right?

705
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,780
It shows that he has
a great influence on you.

706
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,920
Since you keep thinking about him.

707
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,220
You just think about it...

708
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,530
He doesn't even know what he did wrong.

709
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:43,340
Really, Bro. If he just...

710
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,000
Thanwa, the most

711
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,140
important part of any relationship

712
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,830
is communication.

713
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,340
If he really doesn't know
what do you want?

714
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,370
So, he just keeps guessing.

715
00:38:58,010 --> 00:38:58,950
What's the point?

716
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,620
You just honestly tell him.

717
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:04,570
I want him to reconcile with me.

718
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:06,400
But I don't want to tell him everything.

719
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:08,170
And in the end, does he reconcile with you?

720
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,900
He does.

721
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:12,990
If you...

722
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,660
think that he is so important
that you can't lose him.

723
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:18,010
Sometimes you have to give some answers.

724
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,500
Just give in sometimes.

725
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,600
Love

726
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:24,990
is not about winning or losing.

727
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,740
It's about how we hold on to each other.

728
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:30,980
To make both of them as comfortable
as possible, physically and mentally.

729
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:32,790
Very sharp.

730
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:36,560
Yes, this is very sharp. The photo.

731
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,080
- Are you free here?
- It's 4K Picture.

732
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,160
Are you free?

733
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,100
- I'm not free, Sir.
- I'm not free.

734
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,590
Please help fix the presentation first.

735
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:43,500
This evening,

736
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,500
we have to send it to the customer
as soon as possible.

737
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,770
Tomorrow there will be a meeting,
so it will be smooth.

738
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:46,900
Yes, sir.

739
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:47,760
- Understand?
- Yes.

740
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:48,880
(Sex Education)

741
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,260
This is the chapter that we just chose.

742
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:54,090
I want Latte and Almond.

743
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:55,860
Can you please keep improvising?

744
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:58,260
I may get some good dialogue

745
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,500
for my writing.

746
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:01,940
Okay.

747
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,320
If you're ready, let's start.

748
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:09,250
Okay.

749
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,110
So, let's roll.

750
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,420
Okay, ready.

751
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:25,960
3 2 1 Action.

752
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:29,720
Young Master, do you really hate me?

753
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,880
You're the one who hates me.

754
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,150
Never.

755
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,300
I have never hated you.

756
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,480
But your words don't show that at all.

757
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:45,410
I'm sorry.

758
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,070
Don't apologize to a
disgusting person like me.

759
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:54,580
I always make you suffer.

760
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:57,300
Never.

761
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,510
I have never disgusted you.

762
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,770
Just don't talk like that.

763
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:06,700
It makes me suffer.

764
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:11,250
I have to sit here thinking about
someone who never thinks about me at all.

765
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,390
No.

766
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:18,060
I miss you, Young Master.

767
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,850
Every time,

768
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,260
every second that I don't see your face.

769
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:27,580
I miss your hug every time.

770
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:28,920
When I close my eyes.

771
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:33,420
I...

772
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,270
I love you, Young Master.

773
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:44,960
You...

774
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:01,800
I love you too.

775
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,140
Okay.

776
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:18,610
Awesome!

777
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:20,260
What a performance!

778
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:22,630
I am really into it.

779
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:25,520
Lookpeach will get a lot of resources
for your writing.

780
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:27,390
Yes.

781
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,360
I just went with the flow.

782
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:33,430
Your fiction helped too.

783
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,550
Good.

784
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,510
You did well.

785
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:38,610
I love writing novels.

786
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:47,720
I chose the right pair.

787
00:42:48,053 --> 00:42:49,013
What is it, Lookpeach?

788
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,300
No, nothing.

789
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:52,910
So, today...

790
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:55,090
I will treat everyone to a meal.

791
00:42:57,650 --> 00:42:58,640
- A treat?
- Yes.

792
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,600
Where will you go? I want to eat.

793
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,470
Whatever you want to eat, just choose it.

794
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:05,340
Ask Latte then...

795
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:09,480
Latte, what do you want to eat?

796
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:11,020
Well, it depends on the Almond.

797
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,290
I'm sorry.

798
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:26,230
Are you still in character
or this is real life now?

799
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:36,450
There's a pier around here.

800
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,140
Let's go see the sunset.

801
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:39,550
It should be beautiful.

802
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,380
I need to get some fresh air.

803
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:44,460
- Okay.
- I'll be right back.

804
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,340
Walking alone can be lonely.

805
00:43:58,250 --> 00:43:59,100
He is so fast.

806
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:01,330
There is something about these two.

807
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:06,920
Come on.

808
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,130
- Hello.
- Hello.

809
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:11,100
So...

810
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:13,330
Where are Latte and Almond?

811
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:14,750
Well...

812
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:31,420
When I acted like an idiot.

813
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:32,880
I'm sorry.

814
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:41,350
Not at all.

815
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:43,070
I am the one who needs to apologize.

816
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,420
I spoke harshly without thinking.

817
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:51,930
Actually,

818
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:54,340
there was a brief moment

819
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,340
when you chased me out.

820
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,290
I realized something.

821
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,000
What was that?

822
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,400
I'm afraid.

823
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:11,190
Afraid that

824
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:13,630
if one day you want to be with me,

825
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,120
then you leave me,

826
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:21,270
I wouldn't know what to do anymore.

827
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,480
I didn't think of anything like that.

828
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:30,090
I don't want to leave anyone behind.

829
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:33,510
And I don't want to be left behind
by anyone again.

830
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:50,070
Can I expect that...

831
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:54,000
you will be the love that I can believe.

832
00:45:58,260 --> 00:45:59,160
From now on,

833
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:01,420
no matter what happens,

834
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:05,940
we'll be next to each other like this.

835
00:46:24,830 --> 00:46:25,800
I promise.

836
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:29,830
We will be together for a long time, Latte.

837
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:00,330
Thank you.

838
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:03,240
Thank you, Latte.

839
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:09,290
I'm sorry.

840
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:13,660
Why are you crying?

841
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:20,620
I just felt guilty.

842
00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:23,180
That I made you angry.

843
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:25,800
Nevermind.

844
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,540
- Very tasty.
- So, did I really make a grave mistake?

845
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:05,290
If it was me,

846
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,030
I wouldn't say something like that.

847
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:09,220
So, you really don't understand?

848
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:12,700
That would make anyone angry.

849
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:16,700
Brother, please think about it carefully.

850
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:25,480
Both actions

851
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,400
and words were so harsh, right?

852
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:31,990
But that was not my intention.

853
00:48:31,990 --> 00:48:33,950
I did want to make
it looked so harsh like that.

854
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:35,920
Not at all. It was nothing like that.

855
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,300
Did I make a mistake?

856
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,050
That was really bad, right?

857
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:40,460
Yes, Bro.

858
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:41,790
That was too harsh.

859
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:42,980
No, it's you who is too harsh.

860
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:45,290
Calm down, Bro. Calm down.

861
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:48,480
Breathe. Breathe.

862
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:50,830
Calm down, Bro. Calm down.

863
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,760
(Jane)

864
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,590
Thanwa must be very
angry at you. Darn it!

865
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:02,120
Just apologize to him.

866
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,090
Apologize to him

867
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:06,110
from your heart.

868
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:10,040
From your heart.

869
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:14,600
You should apologize
and then reconcile with him.

870
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,230
But if you don't start by apologizing

871
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,590
you will never reconcile with him.

872
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:20,980
It's true.

873
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,210
From your heart.

874
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:23,060
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

875
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:23,960
Hey, Peak.

876
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,040
Hello.

877
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:29,780
How are you?

878
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:31,610
Is the sunset beautiful?

879
00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:34,490
Hmm... I don't know.

880
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:37,030
I didn't watch it at all.

881
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:39,840
You didn't see the sun at all.

882
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:40,730
The sun...

883
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:41,900
I guess you didn't see the sun at all.

884
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:46,450
Hey, here comes the food.

885
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:48,000
So... let's eat together, shall we?

886
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,610
- Oh, come on.
- Come, let's eat.

887
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,580
You may lose to my friend.

888
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:05,840
So?

889
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:08,940
Since when?

890
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:10,780
When the sun sets.

891
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,660
The sun... just now.

892
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:15,460
Hey, this looks delicious with rice.

893
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:16,300
Yes.

894
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:17,980
What do you want to eat, Latte?

895
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:19,420
Rice, please.

896
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,440
I'll scoop it up for you.

897
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:22,460
Hey, I can scoop it myself.

898
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:24,440
Please scoop it for Almond first.

899
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,120
Okay.

900
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,930
Almond will have it first.

901
00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:30,380
I am full now.

902
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:31,770
What are you full?

903
00:50:31,930 --> 00:50:33,160
Full with satisfaction.

904
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:37,310
He is satisfied.

905
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:39,070
I shall eat now.

906
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:50,680
Hello...

907
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:22,560
(Jane)

908
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:32,750
I'm sorry, Thanwa.

909
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:41,440
I'm sorry that day
I spoke to you harshly.

910
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:44,690
I hurt you so badly.

911
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:47,900
I don't have any excuses.

912
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:51,180
Please don't run away again.

913
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,250
That's enough.

914
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:03,930
Have you stopped being angry at me?

915
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:07,700
I've lost my anger
since you apologized to me.

916
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,300
I'm sorry for you too.

917
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:30,100
When I decided to move out.

918
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:33,400
It's because of me, right?

919
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:36,420
At that time, I hesitated.

920
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:39,500
Besides, I didn't want to do
anything with Max.

921
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:43,572
But I don't want to endure
something that isn't clear.

922
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:47,370
So what should I do to make it clear?

923
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:51,080
I'll have to ask you again.

924
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:53,220
