Almond.

16
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,330
You all live in the same house, huh?

17
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,250
What a coincidence.

18
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:47,050
What's up?

19
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,730
Are you drunk?

20
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:54,560

(Episode 4)

37
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,180
I am leaving now, Thanwa.

38
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,860
- See you later.
- Hey, Almond.

39
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:45,870
Thank you for this Tumber glass.

40
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,630
You bought one for everyone.

41
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,500
(How and where the liquor is)

42
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,100
It's cute, isn't it?

43
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,880
I handpicked it and
ordered it to make it myself.

44
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:54,950
As a thank you for everyone

45
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,190
who has taken care of me.

46
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,700
My pleasure.

47
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,020
I actually didn't want
to order it for you.

48
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,820
But I bought one and got one free.

49
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,730
So I am just a plus one, right?

50
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,000
Well...

51
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,100
I am leaving now, Peak.

52
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,510
I am leaving now, Thanwa.

53
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,880
What's wrong with you?

54
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,730
Hey, what are you doing?

55
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:38,630
It's the mobile phone.

56
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,200
You sat on it.

57
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,760
Why? Did you think
I was gonna kiss you?

58
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,340
No, I would not think like that.

59
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:49,950
Or...

60
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,650
Did you think I would...

61
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,020
Not like that, you just go.

62
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:57,870
Just go now.

63
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,950
Latte.

64
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,490
Give me the house key.

65
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,200
It's me again.

66
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,110
Come on.

67
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,340
All right, here it is.

68
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,250
What are you thinking about?

69
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,310
Oh...

70
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,040
I am thinking about last night.

71
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,000
When I slept on the sofa,
did you see anyone?

72
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,890
On the sofa...

73
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,240
I don't think I saw anyone.

74
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,500
But I think someone might have seen it.

75
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,180
Who?

76
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,380
It's Mr. Gooky.

77
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,050
Our big boss in this house.

78
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:01,130
Mr. Gooky watches over
the living room all the time.

79
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:02,930
That's funny.

80
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,560
Hey, you...

81
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,200
Can you just move away?
I don't like it.

82
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,260
Umm...

83
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,470
Hey!

84
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,720
And...

85
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,670
Can I eat?

86
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,680
W... what?

87
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,990
I am hungry. Aren't you hungry?

88
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,100
I'm asking you to go eat
at Sis Hui's restaurant.

89
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,300
Crispy Pork, wanna go?

90
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,460
All right, I'll go.

91
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,270
- What's wrong with you?
- You are so obedient, Peak.

92
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:50,210
Let's go.

93
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,510
If you are slow,
I will not wait for you.

94
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:56,940
Quick!

95
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:08,580
(Sis Hui)

96
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,630
This restaurant is the best.

97
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,010
Peak.

98
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,800
Sis, one crispy pork...

99
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,070
Ouch!

100
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:21,680
Are you hurt?

101
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,800
Do you even know what to order?

102
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,850
Well, it's crispy pork
with rice, right?

103
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,250
You really don't
understand the art of eating.

104
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:30,330
So, what to order?

105
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,620
I'll have crispy pork rice,
special soft boiled eggs, 2 servings.

106
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,170
Please separate the sauce
for the crispy pork.

107
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,430
Seperate the sauce. Okay.

108
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,270
Thank you.

109
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,250
What the heck!

110
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,480
The art of eating...

111
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,320
Is that right?

112
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,630
You're hard to please.

113
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,580
There is a thin line, too.

114
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:51,540
I told you that I would take you
to taste the food.

115
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,250
Also, this restaurant has been

116
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,490
open for more than 80 years,
people said they

117
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:58,120
did not wash a casserole
with crispy pork sauce

118
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,810
in order to maintain the essence
of the gravy from their ancestors.

119
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,700
But these pots
have material coatings on them.

120
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,120
If they have been used
for too long, it may harm us!

121
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,480
Shh! Be quiet, please.

122
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,230
Two plates of crispy pork rice,
special soft boiled eggs.

123
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,400
The sauce will be served later.

124
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,420
For the sauce, if you are so afraid
of dying, then don't eat it.

125
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,880
When you taste it,
you may not be afraid to die at all.

126
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,030
There you go.

127
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,660
Why do you like crispy pork so much?

128
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:42,730
When I was a kid, during breaks,
my mom would send me to live with Grandma.

129
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,890
Grandma would make special
crispy pork for me.

130
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,660
The skin was crispy, the meat inside
was soft and not greasy to eat.

131
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,690
After my grandma passed away,

132
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,540
I couldn't find a crispy pork shop
that's as delicious as Grandma's.

133
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,140
Until I found this one.

134
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,220
Yes.

135
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:54,750
Yes, sir.

136
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,880
Yes.

137
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,740
I'll come immediately.

138
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,040
What is it?

139
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,100
I probably won't be able to eat
the way you teach me.

140
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:02,940
The office called me urgently.

141
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:16,030
I'll go now.

142
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,950
Hey, Peak!

143
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:24,980
It's all right.

144
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,300
Peerawat.

145
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:34,370
Can you answer?

146
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,840
You can sit down now.

147
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,650
Next time, you'd better read
the textbooks in advance.

148
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,260
Otherwise, I will ask you
to do more reports.

149
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,470
Yes, Professor.

150
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,760
Look,

151
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,590
I've been scolded
since the beginning of class.

152
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,400
Plus Jumper is not nice today.

153
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:03,910
You, bad luck!

154
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,680
It's you who has bad luck.

155
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,170
I got bad luck
just by sitting close to you.

156
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,290
Professor called me many times.

157
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,114
I thought I would take a nap.

158
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,500
Good thing that I'm good at dodging.

159
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,930
Bad luck!

160
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,880
You're the bad luck!

161
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,180
- You, bad luck!
- Come on.

162
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,870
Latte and Almond

163
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,570
are arguing just like in gay novels.

164
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:23,680
Always fighting with each other,

165
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,970
but you would get together in the end.

166
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,530
If that's the case,

167
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,080
I would rather remain celibate
until I die.

168
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,080
Wow!

169
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,310
Peerawat, Phattharawit, Nalinrat!

170
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,060
Yes.

171
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:37,910
What is the purpose
of studying human relations?

172
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,060
So that we are aware of the importance

173
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,100
of human relations
to ourselves and others.

174
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,340
And the three of you, what are your purpose
to study

175
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,410
this subject?

176
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,390
To make friends,
I rarely have friends.

177
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,570
Okay.

178
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,390
Then, please stand up.

179
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,720
All three of you.

180
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,170
Stand up now.

181
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,080
Yes.

182
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,880
You will stand there

183
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,570
until the end of the class.

184
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:15,040
So that all of your friends
will remember your faces.

185
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,970
Then, you will make a lots of friends.

186
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,870
Just as you wish.

187
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,720
You guys are jinxes!

188
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,030
Come on!

189
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,230
How many hours are left?

190
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,220
Come on, massage me.

191
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:42,420
We both stood together.

192
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,920
Why would I massage your legs?

193
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:47,170
Hey, stop complaining.
That was because of you.

194
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,920
That's why we all got punished.

195
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,050
Who exactly?

196
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,450
I got cramps.

197
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:53,970
You, bad luck.

198
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,630
Oh, Latte, you have bad luck.

199
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,650
It's you who has bad luck.

200
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,100
You, bad luck.

201
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,790
You, bad luck.

202
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,120
- You, bad luck, bad luck, bad luck.
- You, bad luck, bad luck, bad luck.

203
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,850
Enough already, both of you.

204
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,580
The one having bad luck is me

205
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:10,100
and my legs.

206
00:12:11,342 --> 00:12:13,162
- I am so sorry.
- I am sorry.

207
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,170
Just massage me.

208
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:18,650
Oh...

209
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,080
So, how was the mission
last Saturday, Almond?

210
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:23,130
Was it successful?

211
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,020
Or was there anything cool about it?

212
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:36,730
What?

213
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,120
So, what was cool about it?

214
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,750
- It was nothing.
- It was nothing.

215
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,490
Nothing at all. Nothing.

216
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,810
Really?

217
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,850
Yes, it's true. Is that true?

218
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,730
- Yes, it's true.
- There was nothing.

219
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,070
Are you sure?

220
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,370
- Sure.
- Absolutely, surely.

221
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,560
Okay.

222
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,140
I will go to the class now.

223
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:15,870
- See you.
- Bye.

224
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,640
Peak.

225
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,110
Do you want me to help you?

226
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,110
Hey, wow.

227
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,050
That's good.

228
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,330
I've been thinking about
where you'd gone. Come on.

229
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,600
I went for an interview
for college football players.

230
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,740
- Really?
- Yes.

231
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,970
So I had to practice
and live in the camp.

232
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:46,810
- Hub.
- One...

233
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,030
How is the result?

234
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,450
Well...

235
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:56,570
It's okay.

236
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:57,770
We can fail.

237
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,540
Keep fighting.

238
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,620
- I got 1st place.
- Oh!

239
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,650
I was also elected as team captain.

240
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:05,070
Awesome.

241
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:08,140
Will there be time for you
to go to gym?

242
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,180
I'll probably come less often,

243
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,390
but I'll try to come.

244
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,750
Let me treat you to a meal.

245
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,370
Sure.

246
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:17,450
Here you go.

247
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,720
Peak.

248
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,400
- Put it down, Peak.
- Ouch!

249
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,240
Place it gently.

250
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,850
What the heck!

251
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,610
Ouch! Are you free this Saturday?

252
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,690
On Saturdays,
I usually go to the onsen.

253
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:50,810
Do you have anything?

254
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,920
Oh, that's great.

255
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:55,270
Look,

256
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:57,930
- this Saturday,
- Yes.

257
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,900
at my house, there will be
a party with my housemates.

258
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,740
So I'd like to invite you
to come as well.

259
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,120
I consider it a celebration
of you becoming a team captain

260
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:08,260
and a thank you for always helping me.

261
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,540
Is it okay?

262
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,870
I'm afraid I'll be shy.

263
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,840
No, everyone else is
the same age as you.

264
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:21,300
So can I take my friend with me?

265
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,680
All right. The more, the merrier.

266
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,840
House warming.

267
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,760
Okay then, just give me a second.

268
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,760
Okay.

269
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,660
- Hey, Shawn.
- Hmm?

270
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,460
There is a party on Saturday.
Would you like to join?

271
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,090
All right.

272
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:41,450
Peak.

273
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,330
Yes?

274
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,800
See you on Saturday.

275
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,300
Latte, Almond.

276
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,340
Did you also order the fried-egg?

277
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:06,810
Would you share it with me?

278
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,140
No.

279
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:10,900
So stingy.

280
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,130
The weather is extremely hot today.

281
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:19,730
Too hot.

282
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:22,710
- Hey!
- Hey!

283
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,490
Lookpeach!

284
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:26,940
You aren't supposed to hold that.

285
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,740
No, it's not that one.

286
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,220
I was about to pick the fan.

287
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:33,520
You startled me.

288
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:34,550
Well.

289
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,710
Both of them look roughly the same.

290
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,210
So, who knows?

291
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:39,410
Latte,

292
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,250
you look like you haven't seen
this kind of thing.

293
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,330
I have already seen it.

294
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,510
Just don't hold it like this.

295
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,260
Seriously, if it weren't for you,

296
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,150
I probably won't get
to use this thing.

297
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,020
Thank you for teaching me.

298
00:16:54,798 --> 00:16:56,290
Why are you coughing?

299
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,310
Haven't you seen it?

300
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,200
It's nothing.

301
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,630
I don't get anything.

302
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,310
Anyway, you have to be careful.

303
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,840
Don't pick it up
to show off like this.

304
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:06,930
But right now,

305
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,180
the person who's showing it off is you.

306
00:17:11,087 --> 00:17:12,587
Everyone in the cafeteria
is looking at you.

307
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,620
What are you looking at?
This is a massage tool.

308
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,950
Instead of putting it away,
you're still showing it off.

309
00:17:33,394 --> 00:17:34,234
Still?

310
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:37,630
Look at him.

311
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,540
Seriously,

312
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:45,640
sex toys shouldn't be embarrassing.

313
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:47,380
It is for basic human happiness.

314
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,140
True!

315
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,670
When I talk about it,
people said I am obssessed.

316
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:51,990
That is crazy.

317
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,140
Let's eat, I have to get prepared.

318
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,800
Oh, that's right.

319
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,290
Where are the two of you going?

320
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,980
I have to pick up this call.

321
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,070
Let's eat now.

322
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:12,960
Hello, bro.

323
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:16,880
Oh, it's all right.

324
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:19,250
That's awesome.

325
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,390
You look timid
but you are fast in action.

326
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,370
Lookpeach, please.

327
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,200
Tell me where you're going
this afternoon.

328
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,180
I am lonely, I want to go with you.

329
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:31,840
What else do you want to eat?
Are you full?

330
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,100
I'll buy you snacks. Are you thirsty?
I'll buy you a drink.

331
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,130
Come on. Please. Please.

332
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:38,610
Shall I tell you... or not?

333
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:39,500
Please, please, please.

334
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,520
If I tell you,

335
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,210
will there be anything to exchange?

336
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,190
I will do the next report for you

337
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,520
in Human Relationship subject.

338
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,310
Well...

339
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,930
Two assignments.

340
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,340
Even if I don't tell you,

341
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,770
you will probably
follow me anyway, right?

342
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:55,880
What?

343
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,060
What is it?

344
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,560
I know it.

345
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,510
I won't follow...

346
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,790
Almond likes Latte, is that right?

347
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:02,670
Are you crazy?

348
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,600
Not at all.

349
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,020
Don't you ever tell Latte

350
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:10,340
about me following you two.

351
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:11,230
Why?

352
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,150
Promise me first.

353
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,880
OK.

354
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,200
Can you tell me
where we're going this afternoon?

355
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:17,290
The same place?

356
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,940
No, I just made

357
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,890
Latte to help...

358
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,550
Help what? About what?

359
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,700
- Ah...
- What are you guys talking about?

360
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,150
- Nothing.
- You look serious.

361
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,680
Nothing.

362
00:19:30,316 --> 00:19:31,236
This meal is delicious.

363
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,340
(Deal. Two, right?)

364
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,120
Don't forget,

365
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:52,720
two pieces.

366
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,020
Two pieces of what?

367
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,890
Two pieces of snacks.

368
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:58,930
Fighting too.

369
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:01,050
For snacks.

370
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:01,890
Do you want to eat?

371
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,280
This is delicious.

372
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,240
What's up with you two?

373
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:10,930
Hello, Kit.

374
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,880
Hello.

375
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:12,940
You order first.

376
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,770
One hot americano.

377
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:18,280
Kit, thank you very much
for giving me that job.

378
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,180
The work you did was very good.

379
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,010
My boss gave a compliment
that your review was thorough.

380
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,680
Once the information is solid,

381
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,520
it's easy to forward
to influencers to make clips.

382
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,740
I feel fulfilled now.

383
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:32,190
I was stressed out at first.
I was afraid you didn't like my work.

384
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,770
You've been good at it
since you were in school.

385
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,370
Not at all, bro.

386
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,210
Because you gave me the advice.

387
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:39,380
Thank you so much.

388
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:41,460
So, how are you?

389
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:44,240
How about applying for a job?
Anything I can help?

390
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,420
It's okay.

391
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,720
Right now, my housemates
are helping me for the resume.

392
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,310
So, I don't need to worry.

393
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,120
About the percentage tube
that shows your ability,

394
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,220
I don't think it works.

395
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,300
When I went for a job interview,

396
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,130
HR said they couldn't read it.

397
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,380
Well...

398
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,570
I thought it looks beautiful,
so I added it.

399
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:09,620
It's not beautiful at all

400
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,000
and it's not functioning.

401
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,680
And over here.

402
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,190
Move it up.

403
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:20,250
Here.

404
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,890
If you don't know what to write,

405
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,190
you can write

406
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,800
the activities that you used to do
when you were in university.

407
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,640
It's not okay to leave it empty.

408
00:21:30,181 --> 00:21:33,061
What about I write down
the volunteer activities?

409
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,310
Of course.

410
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:38,220
So, they'll know about
your personality,

411
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,540
what you like,

412
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,990
whether you are
suitable for the position.

413
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:42,820
All right.

414
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,390
Is there anything else
that I should fix?

415
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,140
Umm... just a second.

416
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:51,430
Oh.

417
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:52,860
I think...

418
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,420
Let's do this first.

419
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,290
When you're done fixing it,
bring it to me to check.

420
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:58,210
All right.

421
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,090
Thank you so much.

422
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:03,188
When it's time to eat,
you look rough.

423
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,450
But when you do what you're good at,

424
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,000
you're so gentle.

425
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,140
That's all right.

426
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,300
To whatever I like,

427
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,540
I'm always gentle.

428
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,450
But your hand that puts pressure
on me right now,

429
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,490
it's not gentle at all.

430
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,270
Oh.

431
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:47,290
Well...

432
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:49,700
I will go to bed now.

433
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,160
Yes.

434
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,520
Hey, Peak.

435
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:55,550
Thank you very much.

436
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,610
Yes, bro?

437
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:42,500
Why are you smiling?

438
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:44,630
A big smile like this,

439
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,420
I don't think it's just a housemate.

440
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:47,990
It's true.

441
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,430
You know what I just went through.

442
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:51,810
I won't look for more trouble.

443
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:52,650
Yes, it's true.

444
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:53,890
Oh...

445
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:58,230
If you have spare time, you could try applying
to be an anonymous reviewer.

446
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,810
What is it?

447
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,140
Here.

448
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,900
(Application: Food Reviewer)

449
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,040
The company will send you the location

450
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:09,160
of the restaurant
that you need to review.

451
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:12,090
Then you must go and taste
the dishes that they specify.

452
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:15,200
It's like the way you hire me
to taste things at restaurants.

453
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:17,590
But this one is different,

454
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:20,330
you need to review as per
the criteria of the restaurant.

455
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,630
You need to review

456
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,920
different restaurants
and they must not know who you are.

457
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,060
Do you know why?

458
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:28,860
Because the company wants
to check their branches,

459
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,690
whether they follow the standards.

460
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:32,210
Is it only for free food?

461
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:33,060
Do I get money too?

462
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,750
Oh, you are hot on it.

463
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,660
You mean coffee?

464
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:38,180
I mean money.

465
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,230
Oh... yes.

466
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:41,730
I need money for my living expenses.

467
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,200
You will get money for sure.
Travel expense,

468
00:24:44,225 --> 00:24:45,455
and other compensation.

469
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,250
- Hmm.
- But you need to research first.

470
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,360
Yes, I will do that.
Thanks so much, Kit.

471
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,160
It's all right.
Just find more information.

472
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,000
Okay.

473
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,780
Let's make an appointment
to send work again next time.

474
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,490
This time, I'll let my boss handle
the payment cheque for you.

475
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,710
Thank you, bro.

476
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:03,010
I'll go back to the office first.
Pay for me.

477
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,520
- Okay?
- Oh!

478
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:06,760
It's all right. Bye, Kit.

479
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,460
(Sex Education Club)

480
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,350
Hello everyone.

481
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,170
- Hello.
- Hello, Lookpeach.

482
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,350
As the club has previously announced,

483
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,870
today there will be some knowledge

484
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:25,320
about sexual pleasure devices.

485
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,410
Your choice of words are so cheesy.

486
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,730
All right,

487
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:30,110
they're sex toys.

488
00:25:30,305 --> 00:25:32,105
But before we begin,

489
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:35,060
I would like to introduce
our special guest, he is...

490
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,930
Latte.

491
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,590
Today, I will talk about...

492
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:58,620
Well...

493
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,190
Oh, I invited Latte today because

494
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:04,950
he said he's pansexual.

495
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,340
What does that mean?

496
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:10,580
You are not male, neither female,
or you are asexual.

497
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,070
This is totally another gender.

498
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,230
Asexual is defined

499
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,160
as someone
who is not interested in sex.

500
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,540
But pansexual is
someone who does not specify

501
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,390
or has sexual limitations.

502
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,400
We can say that

503
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,200
we can love any gender.

504
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:26,180
All right, you mean free-sex, right?

505
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,300
You still misunderstand.

506
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:30,870
Because everyone here

507
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,350
has their own sex preference.

508
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,760
Even though I am pansexual,

509
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,790
I can have sex with anyone.

510
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,070
But it's doesn't mean I don't choose.

511
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:44,080
And no matter what
our sexual preferences are,

512
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,060
protecting ourselves
from infectious diseases

513
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:50,140
is the most important.

514
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:52,150
Don't ever forget it.

515
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:58,420
Today we have prepared
different types of sex toys

516
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,780
for you to take a look.

517
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,790
You all can come over and have a look.

518
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:07,730
I know many of you may be
embarrassed to buy or ask other people.

519
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,400
I want you guys to share
the experience,

520
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,150
share some opinions.

521
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:14,570
Because there is
nothing wrong about it.

522
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:16,940
We must understand about it
in the right way.

523
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:37,700
"Knock Knock, Boys!"

524
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:51,850
Today, thank you very much
for coming to help.

525
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,480
It's cool.

526
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,200
Here.

527
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,470
As a token of my appreciation.

528
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:58,500
So, you can use it
with someone you are close with.

529
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,090
You naughty girl…

530
00:28:05,122 --> 00:28:06,422
Hey, you. Take this.

531
00:28:07,873 --> 00:28:08,713
What for?

532
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,530
For emergency use.

533
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:12,110
Look at the size,

534
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,030
it will fit you.

535
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:17,638
How do you know my size?

536
00:28:18,709 --> 00:28:19,779
Just guessing.

537
00:28:25,231 --> 00:28:27,211
When you lied down
and showed me at the onsen.

538
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,330
Come on, I'll leave you behind
if you walk slow.

539
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,620
Wait for me.

540
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,000
Latte, wait for me.

541
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:05,590
Why do you keep me
away from Lookpeach?

542
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,500
You don't want me to be
a third wheel, right?

543
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:10,790
Not at all.

544
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,380
I was just a bit embarrassed.

545
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,270
For I did that kind of thing
in front of you.

546
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,800
It's cool, anyway.

547
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:20,620
I have never thought that

548
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,820
you would care about things like this.

549
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:26,280
It ruins my image.

550
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,870
I was the one who said

551
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:31,200
the club's activities are boring.

552
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:35,310
But I think it was so cool.

553
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,440
Next time, bring me too.

554
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,760
Or,

555
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:52,990
I am

556
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:55,880
the third wheel between you
and Lookpeach.

557
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:02,220
I have once told you that

558
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,050
although I am pansexual,

559
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,400
I choose the one I really like.

560
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,500
But you asked if you are a third wheel
between me and Lookpeach,

561
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:13,650
I'd say "No, you are not."

562
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:21,290
But I don't know what
will happen in the future.

563
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:43,750
But if you are free next time,

564
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:46,510
I would love to have you with me.

565
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,080
Don't be upset.

566
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:04,310
Hey, are you still upset?

567
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:13,870
♪ You probably don't know ♪

568
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:18,640
♪ The longer the song plays,
it makes me more shaken ♪

569
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:23,230
♪ This heart is trembling.
You probably don't know ♪

570
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:27,260
♪ That my heart is inside,
it was never given to anyone ♪

571
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,270
- Spoons.
- Ouch!

572
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,020
- Forks.
- Dipping sauce.

573
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,510
We've got everthing.

574
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,420
All done.

575
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,070
They are coming.

576
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:40,930
It could be Jumper.

577
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,420
Do I look good?

578
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,960
Do I look okay?

579
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:45,950
You look okay.

580
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:47,360
Don't get too excited.

581
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,630
This is the first time
Jumper comes to the house.

582
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,910
I will answer the door.

583
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:52,750
All right.

584
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,360
You already look handsome.

585
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:01,670
Hi.

586
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,260
Come on in.

587
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,180
Oh.

588
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:18,210
Hi.

589
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:20,790
Lookpeach, sit here.
We're still arranging the table.

590
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:23,780
You are...

591
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:25,670
Lookpeach.

592
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,460
- Lookpeach.
- Okay.

593
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:30,590
Just enjoy today.

594
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:32,910
Almond, please get me a tumbler, ice

595
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:33,800
and a can-opener.

596
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:35,030
Just go.

597
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,430
- Here you are.
- Have you got it?

598
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,150
He looks sad.

599
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:42,000
He's walking so lifelessly.

600
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,060
Come on.

601
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,390
Peak, please answer the door.

602
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,550
Hi.

603
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,390
Hello, bro.

604
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:53,810
- Hello.
- Hello.

605
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:56,170
This is my friend, Shawn.
I have told you about him.

606
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:57,210
Hello.

607
00:32:57,210 --> 00:32:58,550
Come on in. Let's get inside.

608
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:05,010
I am here.

609
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,650
- Hello.
- Hello.

610
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,760
Hi, sit down. Have a seat.

611
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,650
- Okay.
- Sit down.

612
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,500
Come on. This one.

613
00:33:14,934 --> 00:33:15,884
Almond, have a seat now.

614
00:33:16,971 --> 00:33:17,811
Come here.

615
00:33:19,651 --> 00:33:20,651
Let me help.

616
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,580
- All right.
- This is for Thanwa.

617
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,690
- This one is for Peak.
- Thank you.

618
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:27,730
Okay.

619
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,240
Peak.

620
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,490
Almond, Latte, Lookpeach are...

621
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:33,560
Oh, that's great.

622
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,720
You guys know each other,
no need to introduce.

623
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:38,940
And this is Shawn, my close friend.

624
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,090
- Hello.
- Hello.

625
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:42,460
May I join you guys today?

626
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,800
So everyone is here.

627
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,190
- Let's party.
- Woo!

628
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,710
I am so hungry.

629
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:53,250
Almond, can you serve your friend?

630
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:55,570
Put it into the dipping sauce and feed him.

631
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:57,640
Yum!

632
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,280
- You feed him too.
- Yes.

633
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,930
Pull it, pull it, pull it.

634
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:05,820
What year?

635
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,840
- No, nothing, the year of...
- Next year, right?

636
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,250
Next year,
you will have your good luck.

637
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:10,450
We just went to a fortune teller.

638
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:11,480
- He will get rich.
- Right.

639
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:12,330
So, cheers

640
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:13,360
to next year.

641
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,400
So, cheers. Cheers.

642
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,020
Cheers!

643
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,070
- Cheers!
- Woo!

644
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:36,340
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

645
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:43,770
Peak.

646
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:45,180
Thanwa.

647
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,130
Latte.

648
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,200
And...

649
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:54,220
Al...

650
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:56,730
Almond.

651
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:03,280
You all live in the same house.

652
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:05,940
What a coincidence.

653
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:10,630
What's wrong with you?

654
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,340
Are you drunk?

655
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,060
Your face is very red.

656
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,940
It's okay.

657
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,010
So, you guys,

658
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:34,950
cheers. Let's cheers.

659
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:37,970
- Let's cheers.
- Cheers.

660
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,740
I've invited Jumper
to the party on Saturday at our house.

661
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,120
What?

662
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,240
Are you serious?

663
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:57,180
Yes. We need to create
the moment for Almond and Jumper.

664
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:58,780
Okay. See you then.

665
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,910
I need to pick up this call.

666
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:07,450
Hello, bro.

667
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:09,000
Oh, definitely.

668
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,180
If you want it to run smoothly,

669
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:11,780
you need to invite one more person.

670
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,740
Okay. See you then.

671
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,500
All right, everyone.

672
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,790
Now it's time for
tonight's party fun.

673
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:27,740
This game is called

674
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:30,450
"Seven Minutes in Heaven".

675
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,640
The rule is simple.

676
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:37,570
I will spin this bottle twice.

677
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,690
So that I will get two players.

678
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,800
They both

679
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,180
have to go into the closet

680
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,110
for seven minutes.

681
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,570
They can do whatever they want,

682
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:49,360
but they need to
completely finish it

683
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,290
within just seven minutes.

684
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:52,130
- Okay?
- Oh!

685
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,660
Let's do it!

686
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,780
Full seven minutes.

687
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,920
The next person now.

688
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:13,060
- Ready?
- Are you ready?

689
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,650
Let's see. Come on.

690
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,700
Oh!

691
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,540
Oh, cockroach! Cockroach!

692
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,190
- Oh, that's Almond.
- Almond.

693
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:29,460
- Almond, it's Almond.
- That's right, it's Almond.

694
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,220
Just drink to set the mood.

695
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,270
I will take you to the seven-minute heaven.

696
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,780
I am sorry, I am drunk.

697
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,970
- It's all right. It's okay.
- I am drunk.

698
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:58,420
It's all right. It's okay.

699
00:37:58,490 --> 00:37:59,350
Just a bit dirty.

700
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:01,940
I'll take Jumper to wash up first.

701
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:04,240
- Yes, yes.
- Alright, good. Just take him.

702
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,030
Just go, only you two should go.

703
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:07,430
Take care of your friend, Almond.

704
00:38:07,834 --> 00:38:09,864
Escort him nicely, be careful.

705
00:38:10,438 --> 00:38:11,738
Easy, that's it.

706
00:38:12,019 --> 00:38:12,919
Don't worry too much.

707
00:38:13,531 --> 00:38:14,371
It will be dry soon.

708
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,890
You just sit here
and play a game with us.

709
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:26,510
Let them go.

710
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:27,500
Hey, you guys.

711
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,040
Let's continue to play.

712
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,170
- You spin it, Shawn.
- Okay, come on.

713
00:38:31,328 --> 00:38:32,488
I will spin it now.

714
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:43,020
It's Thanwa!

715
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:44,750
Who's next?

716
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:45,660
What?

717
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,550
It's Peak!

718
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:54,390
Peak.

719
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,380
Come on now.

720
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,070
All right, come on.

721
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:04,700
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

722
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:07,960
Let's count the time.

723
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:09,500
Set the timer.

724
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,000
All done.

725
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,360
You sit here.

726
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,420
- Here?
- No, you sit on the bed.

727
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:37,430
Now, you should wash up yourself.

728
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:40,570
- Okay.
- Let... let me take off your clothes.

729
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,280
Now...

730
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,230
I will bring you
some clean clothes to change.

731
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:03,270
Almond.

732
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:06,120
Help me, help me.

733
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,670
Help you with what?

734
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:09,180
- Take off what?
- I want to poop.

735
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:10,800
What?

736
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,640
I want to poop.

737
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,430
Help me, help me take this off.

738
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,760
- Almond, quick.
- Okay.

739
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:17,690
- Take it off now?
- Yes.

740
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,500
Okay, okay.

741
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:23,000
- Help me, help me now.
- Okay.

742
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:25,690
Pull it harder.

743
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,340
Jumper, push your butt.

744
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,600
Harder.

745
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:31,830
- Oh.
- Harder.

746
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,580
- Harder.
- Oh!

747
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:35,130
- Oh!
- Oh!

748
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:36,890
- Oh!
- Oh!

749
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:38,360
- Oh!
- Harder.

750
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,970
- Harder.
- I can't take it off.

751
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:42,080
What are they doing?

752
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:46,640
Oh!

753
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:49,230
It's stuck!

754
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:50,750
Almond!

755
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:53,910
What the heck are you doing?

756
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:59,040
It's not what you think, I...

757
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,470
You both were screaming too loud.

758
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:02,360
Help, help.

759
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,550
Jumper, push your butt.

760
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:09,350
Help, help him.

761
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:10,800
Push your butt.

762
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:15,470
Lift him up.

763
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,350
Oh no! I don't like "sandwiches"!

764
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,180
Get up.

765
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:26,310
Okay, okay now.

766
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,850
Support him. Oh!

767
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:33,750
- Help!
- Get off me.

768
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:35,780
- I am trying.
- Oh, no.

769
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:38,060
Wait, wait, wait.

770
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:41,700
- What?
- What?

771
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,540
It's coming.

772
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,300
What... what is coming?

773
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,520
Quick, come on.

774
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:07,460
No!

775
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,040
Almond!

776
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,280
What?

777
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,590
His poop...

778
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:25,570
Hello, Mom. I will go home now.

779
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:28,230
All right, see you at home.

780
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,320
So, you...

781
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:36,070
I have to go home now.

782
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:37,450
My mom called.

783
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:39,860
All right.

784
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,930
I will grab a taxi too.

785
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:44,430
Latte.

786
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,330
Please look after Jumper.

787
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:49,000
I will take his clothes

788
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,780
to wash and dry.

789
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:51,830
Is that okay?

790
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:52,690
Okay.

791
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,680
I will go to the bathroom,
this is so smelly.

792
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,710
Jumper, put on your clothes.

793
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,280
Let me help.

794
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,960
- Easy.
- Yes, it's easy.

795
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,140
You fool, I think I have to help.

796
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:18,830
I think it's weird.

797
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:20,960
Put on the shirt, not trousers.

798
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:23,720
That's why it doesn't fit.

799
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:29,640
Oh, be careful, man.

800
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,650
I may trip, careful.

801
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:53,350
All right everyone,
I have to go home now.

802
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,860
I'll go now.

803
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:57,400
Take care of yourself.

804
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,030
My ride is coming too.

805
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:09,080
I will go home now.

806
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:10,670
Jumper.

807
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,220
Let's go home.

808
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,640
Come on.

809
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:15,230
Let's go.

810
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:18,610
Are you going home now?

811
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,400
Can you just wait? Almond will bring
the clothes for you.

812
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,220
That's all right.

813
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,320
The car cannot park for too long.

814
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:29,930
I am going now.

815
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,240
Go home safely.

816
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:35,540
Will they be okay?

817
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,360
Who is holding who anyway?

818
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,660
Jumper.

819
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,310
I blow-dried your shirt and trousers.
You can wear them now.

820
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:49,030
Jumper.

821
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,960
What? Where have they all gone?

822
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:54,020
They went home already.

823
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:56,260
And you let Jumper go like that?

824
00:44:58,130 --> 00:44:59,850
I stopped him.

825
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:02,270
You, bad luck!

826
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:05,590
You, bad luck! Bad luck!
Bad luck! Bad luck!

827
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:11,280
Bad luck! Bad luck! Bad luck!
Bad luck! Bad luck!

828
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,190
You, bad luck!

829
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:19,630
Bad luck! Bad luck! Bad luck!
Bad luck! Bad luck!

830
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:37,550
Why did you do that? Tell me.

831
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:50,750
You...

832
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,080
Do you think...

833
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:56,020
it's already been seven minutes?

834
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:06,410
That day

835
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:10,180
on the sofa,

836
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,200
was that you?

837
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:18,620
Did you ask Gooky?

838
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:22,710
That was really you, right?

839
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:27,770
If yes,

840
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:29,960
what does it mean?

841
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,990
You do know what I mean.

842
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:39,520
Would you like to try kissing me?

843
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:00,550
I am sorry

844
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,750
that I kissed you that night
without asking.

845
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:08,740
That was all right.

846
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:11,840
Actually, I was happy

847
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,490
that you apologized to me
for this matter.

848
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:21,540
Let's say whatever
happened that night,

849
00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:22,900
you don't have to think too much.

850
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:28,290
And this time,
can I kiss you one more time?

851
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:35,060
Yes.

852
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:35,640
