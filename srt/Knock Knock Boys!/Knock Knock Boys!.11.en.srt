Peak and Jane, being like this,
is already good.

"Knock Knock, Boys!"
(Episode 11)

28
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:09,990
I am so starving.

29
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,970
What do you want to eat, Thanwa?

30
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,420
Nothing, you just
go and buy anything.

31
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,850
Sticky rice with pork.

32
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:28,910
Sis,

33
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,830
may I have six orders of grilled pork,

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,480
and four sticky rice?

35
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,080
But may I have
one grilled pork now?

36
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,380
I am so hungry.

37
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:36,690
Thank you.

38
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,120
Is it delicious?

39
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:48,330
What if

40
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,290
my mom doesn't
support our relationship?

41
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,250
Would you fight for me?

42
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,390
Just like Thanwa fought for Peak.

43
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:57,770
No.

44
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,880
I was just saying,

45
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,550
no need to sulk.

46
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,390
You just said "no".

47
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:15,680
When I said "no",

48
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:16,920
it means...

49
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,330
I won't let you go back
with your mom alone.

50
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,090
If that happens,

51
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,730
I'll follow along
on the hood of the car.

52
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,300
Crazy! What kind of crazy person does that?

53
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,640
Whether I am crazy or not, right now

54
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,330
the crazy person isn't me.

55
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,930
I feel sorry for Thanwa.

56
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,090
Here you go.

57
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,190
Is it done?

58
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:56,630
No.

59
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,710
Won't you eat?

60
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,700
- Just get in the car.
- Let's go then.

61
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,760
Peak.

62
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,330
Tomorrrow, you have an appointment
to try on the ring with Jane.

63
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:16,500
Don't be late.

64
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,360
I have chosen the design.

65
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,200
Yes.

66
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,190
Hello.

67
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,230
Hello, sir.

68
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,960
- I have reserved two rooms.
- Yes.

69
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,190
Under what name did you reserve?

70
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,280
Mrs. Kesinee.

71
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,750
- Mrs. Kesinee.
- Please wait a second.

72
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,590
All right.

73
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,180
Actually, thanks to Almond's mother

74
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,440
for sponsoring both
car and accommodation.

75
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:57,430
Otherwise, we probably
wouldn't have arrived here at all.

76
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,030
That's all right.

77
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,700
That's my mom.
It won't take long for her to organize.

78
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,230
She is like the Mafia.

79
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,590
What will we do next?

80
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,040
If we talk to Peak at his house,

81
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,260
I think it would be difficult.

82
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,490
Because Uncle Dilok is there.

83
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,130
We might try to talk to him here.

84
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,690
Speaking of which,

85
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:18,730
Peak still hasn't replied to my message.

86
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,600
Don't tell me

87
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,760
that he will leave us.

88
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,130
Actually,

89
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,670
there is someone who can help us.

90
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,660
Hi.

91
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:36,350
How is it going?

92
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,250
We just arrived, Jane.

93
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,140
- Here is your room key.
- Thank you.

94
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,260
Are you guys staying at this hotel?

95
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,330
Almond's mother sponsored us.

96
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,190
Shall we sit and talk?

97
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,820
- Let's go.
- I am cramped.

98
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,220
The thing is

99
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,350
when my family was in serious trouble,

100
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,510
Peak's father was the only person
who lent us money.

101
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,440
Our family got better in the
financial status because of him.

102
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,560
Is that right?

103
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,610
Is he that generous?

104
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,680
Even though he looks tough,

105
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,840
he is very generous.

106
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,800
He likes to help others.

107
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:19,850
It's unbelievable.

108
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,600
Just believe it.

109
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:24,010
Without his help,

110
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,870
I probably wouldn't be sitting here.

111
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:27,610
I didn't even graduate.

112
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,290
Your parents

113
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,120
agreed to let you marry Peak

114
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,320
to repay his gratitude, right?

115
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,240
Because of his gratitude,

116
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,880
I can't deny anything.

117
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,010
Is there any way that
we can help Peak?

118
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:44,750
There is no way.

119
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,090
Peak doesn't dare to tell his father

120
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,410
that he doesn't like me.

121
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,760
Because his father will
know his sexual preference.

122
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,430
So there is only one way now.

123
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,170
But

124
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,410
none of us can contact Peak now.

125
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,120
He didn't reply to our calls or messages.

126
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,640
We are already here
but we can't do anything.

127
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:11,740
Right.

128
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,620
He has been like this since childhood.

129
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,640
Peak always avoids problems

130
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,190
because he doesn't like to confront them.

131
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,760
Even though we liked
to tease each other,

132
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,800
it was a playful tease.

133
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,780
Just for fun.

134
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,260
Peak, behave yourself now.

135
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:42,450
Hi, Dad.

136
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,620
One day his father came
to pick him up from school.

137
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,680
That was the first time

138
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,650
that I saw that kind of
expression on his face.

139
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,350
I didn't understand
what happened at that time.

140
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,030
Later, I knew that

141
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:08,460
Peak's mother died from an accident.

142
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,720
She died at the scene.

143
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:15,570
Her son and husband did not
have a chance to say goodbye to her.

144
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:22,260
Since then. Peak became an introvert.
He doesn't have many friends.

145
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:26,070
I am the only one he still talks to.

146
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,050
It took a long time
for him to be lively again.

147
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,340
What's wrong?

148
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:39,840
What happened to your studies?

149
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,720
When I came to study at his house,

150
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,460
I always saw him get scolded by
his father for his academic results.

151
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,090
Uncle Dilok often compared
my academic grades with Peak's.

152
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,060
Peak really studied hard.

153
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,390
He tried so hard
to make his father happy.

154
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,260
Peak was afraid that
his father would be very sad.

155
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,450
So, he chose to keep his suffering.

156
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,100
Is that him?

157
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,840
I remember during high school,

158
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,990
Peak secretly looked at a boy
who was in the next class so often.

159
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,700
Until the Valentine's Day,

160
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,520
Peak came to consult
what should he bought for that boy.

161
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,910
So, I took him to buy chocolate together.

162
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,060
But in the end, he did not
have courage to give it to that boy.

163
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:29,610
Because he did not know

164
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,020
whether his father would accept it or not.

165
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,670
- I feel bad for him.
- Is it delicious?

166
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:41,770
You feel bad, right?

167
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,100
It's delicious.

168
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,400
So, you don't mind him at all?

169
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:50,670
I'd like to say that.

170
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,860
But it was a situation
where I couldn't do anything.

171
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:58,280
Luckily, my boyfriend
has known Peak since school.

172
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,520
So he understands.

173
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,240
Otherwise we'd definitely break up.

174
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,350
And why did you have to get married?

175
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,860
It seems like
you have been friends all this time.

176
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,740
After finishing the
university entrance exam,

177
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:17,000
suddenly Uncle Dilok asked
my parents to join us for dinner.

178
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,660
They talked about something.

179
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,690
When we got back home,

180
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,590
he told both of us that

181
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,880
after graduation, we would get married.

182
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,780
I almost rejected at that time,

183
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,720
but it hit me
when I saw Peak went quiet.

184
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,380
He didn't want to make his father sad.

185
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:41,270
Because of that,

186
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,700
he and I made a secret pact.

187
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:48,110
That after graduation,
we will find a way to cancel the wedding.

188
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,860
That will be the best solution.

189
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,810
If it were me,

190
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,490
I probably wouldn't have
the courage like Peak did.

191
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,390
Peak's father is calling.

192
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,940
Wait a second.

193
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,000
Hello, Uncle.

194
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,490
Yes, I am about to go there.

195
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,620
I have to go now.

196
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:19,130
Yes, all right. No, it won't be long.

197
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:25,360
The more I listened,
the more I feel sorry for Peak and Jane.

198
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,960
What should we do?

(TOGETHER WEDDING & STUDIO)

200
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,500
Peak.

201
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,100
Come and talk to me.

202
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,110
Have you seen the picture
of the ring that I sent you?

203
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:54,890
Yes.

204
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,890
I think it looks good on you.

205
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:02,250
Have you seen
the diamonds set for the bride?

206
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:03,450
The whole set.

207
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,190
It looks good.

208
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,660
Peak.

209
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:13,320
I want your wedding day to be

210
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,100
your most memorable day.

211
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,530
When your mom sees it from heaven,

212
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,590
she would be so proud.

213
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,080
Yes.

214
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:34,330
I have to go now. Bye.

00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,880
Please take time to choose it.

217
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,720
Thank you.

218
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,210
Give me your hand.

219
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,470
What?

220
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,310
Give me your hand now.

221
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,780
Hm...

222
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,240
Too loose, right?

223
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,100
Okay.

224
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,050
So now what?

225
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,960
You came to choose the ring, for what?

226
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:25,920
Have you made up your mind
for the wedding?

227
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,360
Just choose whatever you like.

228
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,080
I am okay with everything.

229
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:32,650
You are defiant.

230
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,220
Hey,

231
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,040
do you know that
your housemates are here?

232
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,120
Really?

233
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,800
I didn't know.

234
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,290
It's not a surprise.

235
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,160
Come on.

236
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,180
They came all the way to help you.

237
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,250
Just call them

238
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,860
or go to meet them.

239
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:57,960
I will think about it.

240
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,180
Think about what?

241
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,450
You are so dumb.

242
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:04,960
Look.

243
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,180
Today I have to

244
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,950
choose the ring first.

245
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,460
I am afraid your father might ask.

246
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,400
I'll choose for you, okay?

247
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:18,450
Excuse me.

248
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,750
Did you choose the ring?

249
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:24,570
I'll take this one and that one.

250
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,580
- Please resize them too.
- Okay.

251
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,050
I will do that for you.

252
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,640
Thank you.

253
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,330
Hello. So, Mr. Dilok did not come today.

254
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:39,110
He had something to do,
so I came with Jane.

255
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,390
Okay.

256
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,910
So, you still haven't chosen
the groom's attire.

257
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:45,470
Do you have any style in mind?

258
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,340
We don't have one.

259
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,940
Okay, please come this way.

260
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,880
Don't sulk like that.

261
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,790
- Please take time to choose.
- Yes.

262
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,720
Okay.

263
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,560
How about the black suit?

264
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,880
I don't know.

265
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,770
Just choose it.
Choose the one that looks good on you.

266
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,900
If I had make a decision sooner,

267
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,420
you wouldn't have to waste your time.

268
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,220
I am already here.

269
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,500
But it's all right.

270
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,950
If it's worth the time, it's okay.

271
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:34,950
Seriously,

272
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,570
you should wear the wedding gown
with the one you love.

273
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,190
Not with me.

274
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,290
So emotional.

275
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,440
You are my friend, right?

276
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,050
We have been through so much together.

277
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:52,310
Listen,

278
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,640
I am here

279
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,560
because I have already chosen.

280
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,160
I want to stay by your side

281
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,980
until you are ready
to tell your father the truth.

282
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,190
Why do you have to be so good to me?

283
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,550
If I like girls,

284
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,680
I probably...

285
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,060
Really?

286
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,840
What if you like girls?

287
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:24,550
Actually, you are a good-looking guy.

288
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,370
Actually,

289
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,800
us being like this is already good.

290
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,660
You are the only person
who knows that I like the same sex.

291
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:44,490
You are the one that
I feel comfortable to be with.

292
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:48,040
I am sorry

293
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,200
that I never rejected the wedding.

294
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,200
Because I care for your feelings.

295
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:57,030
I want you to be ready to tell your father
that you like the same sex.

296
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:00,380
I think it'd be better
if you tell him yourself.

297
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,960
Thanks.

298
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,290
Don't act like you are cool.

299
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,090
You are a little silly.

300
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,190
I'd better not accept that.

301
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:16,000
You are not romantic at all.

302
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,570
I have to do that.

303
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,300
I already have a boyfriend.

304
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:20,880
Yes, I know.

305
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,950
Will Jane tell Peak
that we're here to see him?

306
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,930
I think she will.

307
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,250
But whether Peak will come or not
is another matter.

308
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,330
We can only wait for this, right?

309
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:43,730
Or...

310
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,010
We can kidnap Peak.

311
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,040
Who are you?

312
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,380
- Let go of me.
- Take him.

313
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:11,500
- Freeze. Stop fighting.
- Don't fight.

314
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:14,700
- I am hurt.
- Let me make you unconscious.

315
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,580
Darn it! Is he dead?

316
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,380
Okay, cover him.

317
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,930
One, two, three.

318
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,400
No way.

319
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,360
I don't think it works.

320
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,220
If we do that,
everything will be back to the same loop.

321
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:41,880
It won't help solve the problem.

322
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,210
It will be difficult for Peak and Jane.

323
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,520
Or will we secretly wait to see him?

324
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,780
I'll take a shower now.

325
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,330
You just clean all the dishes.

326
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,730
They came to help you out.

327
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:26,690
Call them.

328
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,710
It's better if you go to meet them.

329
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:38,060
(You are not alone.)

330
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,380
(Elizabeth Hotel)

331
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,550
You two go back to the room first.

332
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,110
I want some fresh air here.

333
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:06,010
Are you going to kidnap Peak?

334
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,020
Or will you secretly wait to see him?

335
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:12,400
I don't know. I want to think thoroughly
before doing something.

336
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,850
Up to you then.

337
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,750
So, we will get some sleep first.

338
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,670
- All right, see you.
- See you.

339
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,240
Let's go.

340
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,680
Thanwa.

341
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,460
Peak.

342
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:16,140
"Knock Knock, Boys!"

343
00:21:37,191 --> 00:21:39,121
You take care of your skin so well.

344
00:21:39,801 --> 00:21:40,641
No wonder

345
00:21:40,976 --> 00:21:42,906
your cheeks are so soft.

346
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:56,210
Why did you kiss my cheeks?

347
00:21:56,985 --> 00:21:57,825
Oh?

348
00:21:58,522 --> 00:22:00,132
Your cheeks came close to me.

349
00:22:02,003 --> 00:22:04,543
I just wanted you
to apply your skin care to me.

350
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,870
So my skin will be as smooth as yours.

351
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,250
You wanted to take advantage of me.

352
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:14,450
So, it's even.

353
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,600
You kissed me first.

354
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,950
Okay, apply your skin care to me now.

355
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:24,910
Come on.

356
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,000
I'll do it now.

357
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,890
Thank you so much.

358
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,920
If you didn't wake me up every morning,

359
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,110
I'd still be

360
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:15,510
a reckless person

361
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:18,510
who doesn't want to get up
and go to class.

362
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:23,380
And I would've dropped out again.

363
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,800
Oh,

364
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,150
you told me you have transferred.

365
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:28,960
Never mind.

366
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,040
Whatever it is,

367
00:23:32,648 --> 00:23:34,348
I can turn over a new leaf
because of you.

368
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,990
Just thanks to the alarm clock

369
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:48,740
that is louder than fire alarm.

370
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,240
Do you know?

371
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:57,980
Since I met you,

372
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,360
I've been very happy.

373
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:05,150
You make me want to get up
and go to class every morning.

374
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,340
I want to take care of you.

375
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,460
I want to protect you.

376
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,200
And I want to be
the one who teaches you,

377
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,780
and grows old with you.

378
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,160
Every time I think about my mother,

379
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,650
I feel lonely or I have no one,

380
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,810
I look up to the sky.

381
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,390
The moon represents
the longing I have for my mother.

382
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,830
I always come to see my mom,

383
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,560
whenever I feel bad.

384
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,770
When it's a full moon,

385
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,150
I feel that

386
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:49,380
I get all the love my mom would give me.

387
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,420
But whenever

388
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,480
the sky is dark,

389
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,250
and clouds cover the moon,

390
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:08,350
I would embrace myself
and try to find comfort.

391
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,340
You have such vivid imagination.

392
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,160
Mom.

393
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,380
This is Thanwa.

394
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,870
Thanwa, I want to introduce my mom to you.

395
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:30,710
I promise that I will try my best
to take care of Peak.

396
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,990
I won't let anything

397
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:39,600
happen to him.

398
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:41,210
You are crazy just like me.

399
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:43,530
Come on.

400
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,540
I am scared.

401
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,060
No need to feel scared.

402
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,320
Whatever happens,

403
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,250
I will always be by your side.

404
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:09,090
It's a moment of truth for you.

405
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,580
Don't you run away from me.

406
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,300
Can you take me to my room?

407
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:31,230
All right.

408
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:53,290
Here is my room.

409
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,920
Thanks a lot for taking me to my room.

410
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,710
You should go home now.

411
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,240
I don't want to.

412
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,790
You have to.

413
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,140
Just go home.

414
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:07,450
Sweet dreams.

415
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:17,450
If I want to have sweet dreams,

416
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,460
I need you by my side.

417
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,030
Just like what I have said,

418
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:59,670
I will have sweet dreams

419
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,600
if you are by my side.

420
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,470
And you need to stay close.

421
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,100
Thanks a lot.

422
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:21,970
About what?

423
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,910
The message you sent to me

424
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,290
made me feel that I was not alone.

425
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,160
Actually,

426
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:35,120
I feel really bad

427
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:36,720
for causing everyone trouble.

428
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:39,480
Because you all wait for me to be ready.

429
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,600
But I also feel good

430
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:47,530
that I have many friends who understand me.

431
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,040
They all support me.

432
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,440
You're slow to find it out.

433
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,080
Why did everyone have to do this to me?

434
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,850
Before I just ran away,

435
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,030
I was scared.

436
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,430
I have always tried to escape.

437
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:14,930
But instead, everyone understood me

438
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,430
and tried to stand by me.

439
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,440
I was so terrible, right?

440
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:24,690
Not at all.

441
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:27,980
You did it out of love, right?

442
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,800
But my love hurts everyone

443
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,000
and causes them trouble.

444
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,040
Latte,

445
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:40,910
Almond,

446
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:43,650
Jane,

447
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,800
and you.

448
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:49,200
Don't you think I am selfish?

449
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:52,680
Yes.

450
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,650
Maybe you're selfish,

451
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:58,620
but that's because you love
your father very much, right?

452
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,410
You are afraid that he will be sad.

453
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,800
But it doesn't matter at all.

454
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:07,060
You haven't tried talking it out yet.

455
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,460
How do you know what he thinks about this?

456
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,980
I shouldn't have let it get to this point.

457
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,910
Is it too late to say it?

458
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,320
No.

459
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,270
And you don't have to be afraid.

460
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,320
I will be by your side.

461
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,680
Not just me,

462
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,680
everyone will be by your side, Peak.

463
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:48,630
When you turn around,
you will see me stand by you.

464
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,760
Thanks.

465
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,100
Don't run away again.

466
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:07,900
Never.

467
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,380
From now on,

468
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,270
I won't run away again.

469
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,720
Can I sleep with you tonight?

470
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,110
Father Dilok will complain.

471
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:49,510
We'll worry about that tomorrow.

472
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,560
Today I will not escape my feelings.

473
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,640
I want to be here

474
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,440
with you.

475
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:00,580
(Dad is calling)

476
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,210
Thanwa.

477
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:08,520
Open the door.

478
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,360
- Just a second.
- Thanwa.

479
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,350
What's the matter?

480
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:12,520
Thanwa.

481
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:17,170
- About Peak...
- I am here!

482
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:19,640
Peak, your dad is very angry.

483
00:34:19,890 --> 00:34:21,890
He kept asking where are you,
he couldn't contact you.

484
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,860
But here you are.

485
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,210
Just a second.

486
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,600
Darn it!

487
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,390
My phone died last night.

488
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:36,850
So, come on.

489
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:38,710
Go back to your dad.

490
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,240
Oh, okay.

491
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,400
- You...
- What?

492
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,560
Shall we go together?

493
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,480
Go. Let's go now.

494
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,300
Peak.

495
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:16,420
You all wait in the car.

496
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,950
It's my problem,
I have to take care of it myself.

497
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,290
All right then.

498
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:21,830
Fighting!

499
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,340
Fighting, Peak.

500
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,600
Thanwa.

501
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,240
Will he get scolded by his father?

502
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:17,950
It's kind of like...

503
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,950
"I don't accept you".

504
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,310
"You are not my son".

505
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:23,580
It will be like a drama.

506
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:25,610
"What did you just say?"

507
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,630
"My heart is hurting".

508
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:28,730
"Call the ambulance now".

509
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,550
Does Uncle have any congenital disease?

510
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:33,450
Calm down, baby.

511
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:38,080
This matter is not that serious.

512
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:41,200
That's right.

513
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,080
He just canceled the wedding.

514
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,200
No.

515
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:47,610
It's not "just".

516
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,770
What did I just say?

517
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:52,590
Thanwa, I am sorry.

518
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:55,130
That I said about canceling the wedding.

519
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,420
- Hold on.
- Wait, Thanwa.

520
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:59,470
We have to let Peak and his father
discuss about this matter.

521
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:03,660
Thanwa, I am sorry.

522
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:05,260
I didn't mean to.

523
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:06,630
- Calm down.
- Yes.

524
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,370
Hey, Thanwa.

525
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,000
I can let it go.

526
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,710
But you have to let me go
to the restroom.

527
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,580
Please go.

528
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,640
Speaking of which,

529
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,200
I want to go to the restroom too.

530
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,240
You too?

531
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:43,940
Did you sleep over with your friend?

532
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,200
Yes.

533
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:47,770
I am sorry.

534
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,000
My phone died
so I didn't answer the calls.

535
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,040
Are you sure he is just a friend?

536
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,310
If he is not a friend,

537
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,700
what would you say?

538
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:06,860
Peak, you...

539
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:12,120
What will you do with the wedding?

540
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:13,920
It's already set up.

541
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:16,410
I am sorry

542
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:18,730
that it took me so long
to confess.

543
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,380
I know that I let everything
go with the flow to this point.

544
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:27,530
Jane is my best friend.

545
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:30,370
But she is not the person
who I love and want to marry.

546
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:38,620
I want to cancel the wedding.

547
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,100
Why are you saying this now?

548
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:49,260
Because I was afraid
if I said this in a wrong way,

549
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,760
it would make you unhappy.

550
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:01,040
We only have each other.

551
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:06,250
If I ever loose you,

552
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:10,820
I can't find happiness
in my life anymore.

553
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,500
Do you know?

554
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:24,560
I once told your mom

555
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,320
that it made me happy

556
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,290
when I saw your bright smile.

557
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,840
Do you know what did she say?

558
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,270
She said

559
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:37,610
we need to remember
the time that our child is happy.

560
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,470
Because when you grow up,

561
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,550
you will face many obstacles in life.

562
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:46,110
And that day,

563
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:47,670
me and your mom,

564
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:50,540
we probably won't live to that day
to see your happiness again.

565
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,150
When your mom said that,

566
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:57,180
her smile was the most beautiful.

567
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:58,910
But I didn't think

568
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,270
that was the last time I saw her smile.

569
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:03,610
Your smile is the only thing

570
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:06,690
that I don't want to lose again.

571
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:12,850
Peak.

572
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:17,090
I would do whatever takes

573
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:20,280
to make you happy.

574
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,610
If we opened up and talked,

575
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:29,120
maybe things wouldn't
have gotten worse like this.

576
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:33,670
I had my happy family,

577
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:38,920
me, your mom and you.

578
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,110
That was the best time in my life.

579
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:47,250
I want you to feel that happiness.

580
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:56,920
That's all right.

581
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:00,080
You already did your best.

582
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:02,940
For me,

583
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,680
the perfect family

584
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:08,820
doesn't need to consist
father, mother and child.

585
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,630
Even though, there are only two of us,

586
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:15,470
for me,

587
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:17,680
my family

588
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,180
is still perfect.

589
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,930
Although I'll have a family
with another man in the future,

590
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,850
it's still a perfect family.

591
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:54,990
I am sorry, son.

592
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,360
When will he come out?

593
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:17,530
He is coming.

594
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:21,090
Hello.

595
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:31,750
Where is Thanwa?

596
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:35,480
Hello, Dad.

597
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,220
I am sorry, Dad.

598
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:01,220
I thought I would quietly go out at first,

599
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:03,200
but it might kill the vibe.

600
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,650
So I hid myself over there.

601
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:06,480
Just like a house spirit.

602
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,450
So, he doesn't have to get married, right?

603
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:15,190
Yeah! Latte. Yeah!

604
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:24,390
I am sorry. I am overjoyed.

605
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:27,870
But Peak won't get married, right, Uncle?

606
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,030
Who said that?

607
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:32,330
Jane.

608
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:34,240
He has to marry me.

609
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:36,450
