1
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,750
Yeon-seo.

2
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:34,730
This is a dream, isn't it?

3
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,150
Yes.

4
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,060
Then in this dream,

5
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,670
let's take pictures until we grow old.

6
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,710
Look forward.

7
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:52,590
Take it.

8
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,950
Goodness.

9
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,800
Let's sleep just a little longer.

10
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:33,560
I can sleep.

11
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:35,930
Continue.

12
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,009
Continue. Please continue.

13
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,289
Continue.

14
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,780
I should have slept just a minute longer.

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,330
Goodness, what's with me?

16
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,539
Yeon-seo, you must be insane.

17
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,720
I had some leftovers,
so I made you one too.

18
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:10,780
I shouldn't waste food.

19
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,140
He'll figure it out, won't he?

20
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,130
You're here. Let's eat breakfast.

21
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,840
It's better than yesterday.

22
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,290
Did you go out this early to run?

23
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,050
-Do you want water?
-Young Lady.

24
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,600
I have something to tell you.

25
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,930
It's really important.

26
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,300
-What is it?
-I

27
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,860
want to quit my job.

28
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:52,890
I want to

29
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,820
move out.

30
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:56,940
What?

31
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:00,100
What are you talking about?

32
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,730
Thank you for everything.

33
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,550
Why?

34
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:18,410
You must have a reason.
Why are you suddenly doing this?

35
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,560
-I'm sorry.
-This is absurd.

36
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,700
What did you say to me?

37
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,640
You said I wouldn't be alone
despite what I do.

38
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,310
You said you hated to see me suffer.

39
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,540
Were those all lies?

40
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,340
Did you change your mind in a day?

41
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,470
Why are you running away?

42
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,400
What are you afraid of?

43
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:38,470
(My feelings.)

44
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,890
(Your feelings.)

45
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,630
You aren't alone.

46
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,010
You have Ms. Jung and Director Ji too.

47
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,520
-You'll be fine without me.
-I heard you.

48
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,290
You said you like me.

49
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,190
You said, "How can I not like you?"

50
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,520
I

51
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,210
cannot like you.

52
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,380
And I

53
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,060
can't stay by your side forever.

54
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,300
That really

55
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,500
breaks my heart.

56
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,880
Yeon-seo.

57
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:14,950
How can I

58
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,380
not like you?

59
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,070
Why can't you like me?

60
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,480
I'm not that big of a deal.

61
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,900
You're a human, and I'm just a human too.

62
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,590
I thought you would

63
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:56,310
muster up your courage.

64
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,460
I told myself not to whine
or be impatient.

65
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,180
Even if you say you don't like me,

66
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,220
people's actions always speak louder
than their words.

67
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,890
But you always...

68
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,800
(You're the prettiest when you dance.)

69
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,500
(You did this.)

70
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,640
(Great job.)

71
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,170
You were so warm to me.

72
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,190
Weren't you?

73
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,780
Do I like you?

74
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,950
Yes, I do have feelings for you.

75
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:36,130
But to me, that's a deviation.

76
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,890
It's like getting some air.

77
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,950
Do you know how long forever is?

78
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,030
This was just a month
or two compared to that.

79
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,070
It's not even worth mentioning.

80
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,450
Then why did you say it is tough for you?

81
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:50,380
You said it is tough
because you can't like me,

82
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,700
-but you do.
-Forget it.

83
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,890
It was the alcohol talking.

84
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,840
What I said when I was drunk
doesn't have any meaning.

85
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,230
-What?
-My job was to help you move,

86
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,590
but you can walk well,

87
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,950
and you can even dance now.

88
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,320
You don't

89
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,490
need me anymore.

90
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,580
Are you

91
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,600
finished?

92
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:15,950
Yes.

93
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,330
Good morning...

94
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,140
You're right.

95
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:23,820
You have always been useless.

96
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,710
I must have been delusional.

97
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,960
Fine, you can quit.

98
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,280
While we're on the topic,

99
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,920
you can pack up your things
and leave right now!

100
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,490
What's going on, Young Lady?

101
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,000
Take his resignation
and let him go immediately.

102
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,770
Calculate the number of hours he worked
and give him every penny,

103
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,659
including his overtime and all.

104
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,290
Make sure we don't owe him anything,

105
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,490
so I won't have to see him again!

106
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,310
What's going on between you two?

107
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:13,890
You two aren't even dating,

108
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,400
but you two play games periodically.

109
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,560
It's the second time in this room.

110
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,360
I won't be coming back.

111
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,220
Even if you quit,

112
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,670
you have to hand over your duties.

113
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,610
Your contract says you must give us

114
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,510
a one-month notice and that you hand over
your duties to your replacement.

115
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,450
Young Lady told me to leave immediately.

116
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,510
Goodness.

117
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,630
Since when did you listen to
what she says?

118
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,780
Just go.

119
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,610
Hey.

120
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,470
You and Yeon-seo
belong in two different worlds.

121
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:37,799
I know that more than anyone.

122
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,380
I bet you can't lie.

123
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,660
(Secretary Kim Dan)

124
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,970
Where are you? Let's meet up.

125
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,350
(Director Ji, it's Ms. Jung.)

126
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,800
Why did you pick up?

127
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,870
Is Kim Dan not there?

128
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,450
Well

129
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,570
Kim Dan resigned.

130
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,280
(He returned his phone, pager,)

131
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,000
(and everything we gave him.)

132
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,890
Today? Just like that?

133
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,210
They'd squabbled

134
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,280
and talked about firing and returning,

135
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,730
(but I guess this time it's real.)

136
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,770
He left in a hurry without
handing over his responsibilities,

137
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,530
(as if he was being chased.)

138
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,860
(I don't know what happened between them.)

139
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,850
He talked about happiness

140
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,760
and acted like he'd be around forever.

141
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:35,660
But he quit?

142
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,900
It's said that a fire will burn the forest

143
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:20,500
and become a blaze
that swallows the mountain.

144
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,190
You must take refuge
until the fire burns out.

145
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,990
Hello, brother.

146
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:42,760
You're back.

147
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:49,100
You come at night and also in the morning.

148
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,120
You must be very devout.

149
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:55,170
Or is it that you're full of worries?

150
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:59,610
A priest shouldn't talk
like a fortune-teller.

151
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:03,620
I'm looking for someone.
Kim Dan. Where is he?

152
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,260
I don't know.

153
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,000
Wait. Brother.

154
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,960
Why do you not believe me?

155
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:34,640
Dan's not here.

156
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,540
When you're consumed by doubt,

157
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,530
you wouldn't believe me if I said
soybean paste is made with soybeans.

158
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,140
A man who has a lot of doubt
can only be unhappy.

159
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,790
Yes. Doubting and guessing.

160
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,820
It's exhausting.

161
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,240
I like things to be clear.

162
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:57,380
Then I pray that you recover
your faith soon.

163
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,170
Yes. That's why I plan to

164
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,510
be strong and check.

165
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,610
I will accept this gift from you.

166
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:31,440
I was right.
I knew you weren't an average priest.

167
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,300
At the store, church, here and there.

168
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,630
You were busy looking out
for your junior angel.

169
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,120
What are you doing to Lee Yeon-seo?

170
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:44,420
It's not something
a mere human can handle.

171
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,940
You guys must think you're special.

172
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:51,420
You manipulate struggle humans
with the snap of your fingers,

173
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,040
so you feel omniscient and omnipotent.

174
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:54,800
You feel like you've become a deity,
right?

175
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,740
You're mistaken.

176
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,490
Why are you not surprised?

177
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,780
When facing an otherworldly being,

178
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,360
humans tremble in fear

179
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:07,040
and cannot make eye contact.

180
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,720
But instead of trembling in fear,

181
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,040
you are angry.

182
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:12,710
Why is that?

183
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,580
Ask your petty deity why I'm like this.

184
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,530
And whether it's Yeon-seo or Kim Dan,

185
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,000
if He wants to ruin my plans again,

186
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,990
tell Him to wake up as well.

187
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,740
He's not just any rib.

188
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:50,420
What are you thinking?

189
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,120
(Can Dan really deal with this?)

190
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,340
Can I say "at last"?

191
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:25,930
We get to stand side by side
and see Fantasia.

192
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:26,980
At last.

193
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,740
Yes.

194
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:32,260
I thought the day would never come.

195
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,300
Congratulations on your return,
officially.

196
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,690
Thank you, officially.

197
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,000
Isn't it just for show?

198
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,980
The director will judge our auditions.

199
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:51,320
Yes. I think we quit protesting too soon.

200
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,080
-Right?
-Right.

201
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,840
What? Do you have something to say?

202
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:04,340
You have a private changing room.

203
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,940
I won't use that.

204
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,300
We still have to audition.

205
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,900
I don't expect special treatment.

206
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:20,840
She barges in and expects
one of us to empty our lockers.

207
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,060
Not mine. I've used it for over two years.

208
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,620
Me too. I even put stickers on my locker.

209
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:47,940
I'll use this one.

210
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,670
Thank you all for coming.

211
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,470
I hope we get along.

212
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,610
Good morning.

213
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,720
-Hello.
-Hello.

214
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:25,120
Warm up properly,
and we'll start on the barre.

215
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,160
Why are you here?
We'll begin practice soon.

216
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:46,200
Before you start practicing for "Giselle,"

217
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:50,330
I came to see our spineless dancers.

218
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,180
Did you enjoy your break?

219
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,510
But then, you did nothing wrong.

220
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:01,030
I'm on your side.
You know that, don't you?

221
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:02,790
For that reason,

222
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:05,650
our associate director
will make an important announcement.

223
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,490
For your sake.

224
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,670
The audition to pick
the lead for "Giselle"

225
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,869
will take place in two weeks
in the grand theater.

226
00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:15,990
The artistic staff
such as the general director

227
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,660
and associate director will judge you.

228
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,290
And

229
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,700
artistic director
Ji Kang-woo will be off the panel.

230
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,590
What are you saying?

231
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:33,980
I can't pick the lead
of the performance I'm directing?

232
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,740
As you know,

233
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,880
you are incapable of being impartial.

234
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,190
You wanted an equal and fair audition.

235
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,790
Do you object, Yeon-seo?

236
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,430
Very well. I won't be on the panel.

237
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,580
But then,

238
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,910
you should also step down.

239
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:03,240
You also are incapable of being impartial.

240
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:07,200
How about we let
the dancers judge each other?

241
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:16,270
In what kind of audition
do you let dancers

242
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,160
judge each other?

243
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,300
Why can't we?

244
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:22,250
It's transparent and fair.
We can let everyone vote.

245
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:23,970
You said you're on their side.

246
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:38,710
All right, then.

247
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,700
This audition will be quite interesting.

248
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,350
And I'm sure this will go down
in the history of Fantasia.

249
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:58,290
You can't announce something like that
without discussing it with me first.

250
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:01,450
It's you who's plotting against me
with Yeon-seo

251
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:02,990
behind my back.

252
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,550
Fantasia isn't some corner shop
you can find at a market.

253
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:09,150
It was her who suggested having
an audition without discussing it with me.

254
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,220
She persuaded the troupe

255
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,760
in the most reasonable way.

256
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:16,410
Is there a problem?
Or do you want there to be a problem?

257
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,910
Please watch your language.

258
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:20,460
Because you didn't listen to us,

259
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:24,820
the press conference and Fantasia's Night
were totally ruined. Have you forgotten?

260
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,690
General Director Choi had to jump through
hoops in order to clean up the mess.

261
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:31,770
Associate Director Geum, that's enough.

262
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,000
I'm not sure about that.

263
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,940
Actually, I only remember her
making things worse

264
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:37,580
and driving Yeon-seo into a corner.

265
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,560
But I'll trust you a bit more.

266
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:43,520
That she and I have the same goal.

267
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,230
Look forward to the show.

268
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,860
Why did you get him all riled up?
What's your plan?

269
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:55,930
No matter how distinguished he is,

270
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,080
he's just an artistic director.

271
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:01,340
I can't put up
with his treatment toward us.

272
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,910
All right. We'll start "Giselle."

273
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:54,140
Act One.

274
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:57,440
We'll start from the coincidental meeting

275
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,720
between the country girl, Giselle,
and Duke Albrecht.

276
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,560
I know you're standing right there.

277
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,750
(They recognize each other,)

278
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,240
(they fell in love.)

279
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,580
(It was like that from the start.)

280
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,790
(The feeling was so intense
that they wanted to call it)

281
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,280
(destiny.)

282
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,930
(However,)

283
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,660
(when Giselle found out
the man's true identity,)

284
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:33,120
(she feels so betrayed)

285
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:34,840
(that she dies from a heart attack)

286
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,160
(However,)

287
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,630
(they couldn't forget
each other even in death.)

288
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,290
(And they met again.)

289
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,010
(Like destiny.)

290
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,370
Lee Yeon-seo.

291
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,340
What did I just say?

292
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:04,890
I've never heard of "Giselle"

293
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,300
where she had a tragic end.

294
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,410
She's known as the symbol of forgiveness.

295
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:10,700
The highlight of the story
is that she saves Albrecht

296
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,750
even in death.

297
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,300
I wouldn't have started this
if it was going to be predictable.

298
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,960
Why would she forgive the man
who deceived her and caused her to die?

299
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,630
That story is too outdated.

300
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,430
In Act Two of our "Giselle,"

301
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:25,130
the spirit of Giselle
is going to kill the man

302
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,150
who drove her into death.

303
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:32,480
As two of them dance together
in the world of eternal death,

304
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,240
the show ends.

305
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:41,190
That's nice.

306
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:45,320
The man deceived her,
but Giselle acted like a fool to the end.

307
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:46,950
I didn't like that part.

308
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,720
I like that ending.

309
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,660
We'll start from the grave scene
in Act Two.

310
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,620
Hey!

311
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,810
Hey, no!

312
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,560
What's taking him so long?

313
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,150
(General Manager Park Gwangil)

314
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:44,110
Mr. Park.

315
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:47,720
Mr. Park?

316
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:49,780
Mr. Park.

317
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:53,390
Mr. Park! Mr. Park!

318
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,110
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

319
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,090
Mr. Park.

320
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,020
Hey.

321
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:03,420
So you're telling me that someone
snatched the bag with all the evidence

322
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,830
you've gathered so far?

323
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,940
Do you expect me to believe that?

324
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,440
I'm really sorry.

325
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,540
What about a backup?

326
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:11,740
I'm sure you must have saved
the originals somewhere.

327
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,190
I'm sure someone is watching me.

328
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,690
They won't leave me alone.

329
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,790
Mr. Park!

330
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:17,770
Pull yourself together.

331
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,790
If you don't gather up your courage,

332
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,830
you'll have to live in
a nightmare forever.

333
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:24,280
I'm sorry.

334
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,260
-I'm sorry, Ms. Jung.
-Mr. Park.

335
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,810
Mr. Park!

336
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,500
(Statement)

337
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,380
I doubt that he'll try anything now.
(Park Gwang-il)

338
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,220
I'll keep watching him.

339
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,600
When there is an earthquake
and the ground is shaking,

340
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:51,520
covering your head and hiding under a desk
is the right thing to do.

341
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:56,310
My gosh. He should've stayed silent.

342
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,980
Then he could avoid getting hurt.

343
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,130
Good job.

344
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,220
(I got you.)

345
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,420
(Nursing Home)

346
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,710
I didn't think you'd come back.

347
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,360
I wanted to see her one last time.

348
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,840
I might end up going somewhere far.

349
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,290
That's so nice of you.

350
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,360
I was going to call you anyway.

351
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,810
It was hectic that day.

352
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,440
I didn't get to thank you properly.

353
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,160
If it hadn't been for you,
it would've been awful.

354
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:49,070
And you know the old man, Kim Soo?

355
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,920
I think he might have lost his footing,

356
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,340
but we couldn't find his body
or any traces.

357
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,010
Did you see anything that day?

358
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,420
He might have gone somewhere far.

359
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,960
You think so?

360
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:05,350
He did come back
a year ago out of the blue too.

361
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,250
A year ago?

362
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:09,970
Not 30 years?

363
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,740
My gosh, you must've done this a lot.

364
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:13,790
You're a pro.

365
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,260
When I see Miok eating good food

366
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:18,770
and chewing it with that small mouth,

367
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:21,100
I'm the happiest.

368
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,710
I can't imagine that.

369
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,600
Loving someone during your entire life.

370
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:29,500
You don't need to spend a long time
for it to be true love.

371
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,690
If you can give her

372
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,590
1,000 years' worth of love, that's all.

373
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:37,330
No. Let me go get the doctor.

374
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,430
Hey.

375
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,330
Ma'am.

376
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,260
I'm here. Can you hear my voice?

377
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,140
-Let me take a look.
-Okay.

378
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,160
(No, ma'am.)

379
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:06,020
You can do just fine even if you're blind.

380
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,740
I'll help you.

381
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:31,320
I think I'm lost.

382
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,010
It's as if I'm

383
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,690
at a complete dead end.

384
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,160
Wherever I go, I see her.

385
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:46,060
Where

386
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,320
should I go?

387
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,050
Don't go anywhere.

388
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,990
Just stay here.

389
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:05,860
Hey.

390
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,190
What is he...

391
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:14,840
Hey, Dan. It's really nice here.

392
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,430
You can volunteer here for a few days--

393
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,940
Don't talk to me.
I don't want to talk to you.

394
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:22,890
How dare you?

395
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,910
How dare you come here?

396
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:30,240
"Judgment without mercy will be shown"

397
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:32,130
"to anyone who has not been merciful."

398
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,290
You might even punch me.

399
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:36,220
If that was a threat,
it was very effective.

400
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:38,860
I got scared and ran away like a coward.

401
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,310
You did the right thing.

402
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,830
It's the best thing you did
since you got your mission.

403
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,780
You are the biggest hindrance to it.

404
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,420
You said you'd work on
your backlogged reports.

405
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,670
How great is it? This is the time.

406
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,650
Look forward to this report.

407
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:56,420
I'll mention
your cruelty and violence in detail.

408
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,620
Work will be fun for once.

409
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:07,200
Stay away from
Noisy Gong and lie low for a while.

410
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:08,870
Oh, and also,

411
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,810
stay away from Ji Kang-woo.

412
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:13,710
I won't, so stop nagging and go away.

413
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,870
If you say any more,

414
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:18,770
I might really want to retaliate.

415
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:54,850
What are you doing, Mom?

416
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:59,210
Oh. Where's the tape measure?

417
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:00,970
I want to measure something.

418
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,790
-Here you go.
-Okay.

419
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,080
Thank you.

420
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,690
Ru-na.

421
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,330
Let's have a drink. Come on out.

422
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,570
(Statement)

423
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:59,400
You always did everything on your own
since you were a kid.

424
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,770
I'm so grateful for that.

425
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,530
Between Ni-na studying ballet

426
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,660
and managing Fantasia, I didn't get to
spend a lot of time with you.

427
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,590
I've never had any complaints.

428
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:11,670
I liked how grand you looked at your job.

429
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:14,050
You never brought any friends home,

430
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,870
and you always braided
Ni-na's hair for fun.

431
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,630
You took care of her in my place.

432
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:21,270
I didn't care for the other kids.

433
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:25,050
Ni-na was so pretty,
and it was fun dressing her up.

434
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,640
Is something the matter?

435
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:30,110
Why are you talking about that?

436
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,520
Was it you?

437
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:34,640
Did you try to kill Yeon-seo?

438
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,540
Mom?

439
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,350
What?

440
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:41,900
Never mind.

441
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,800
You seem to be on edge these days.

442
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:46,740
Ru-na.

443
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,510
I want you to see good things

444
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,760
and go to nice places.

445
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,600
I'll do everything else.

446
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:59,150
You know that I hate getting dirty.

447
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,560
(No!)

448
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:03,150
We can't hurt someone
to achieve our dreams!

449
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,920
What are you talking about?

450
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:09,140
That day on the boat,
you had Mr. Park drug her.

451
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,240
Be quiet.

452
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,820
Mr. Park spilled the drink,

453
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:13,400
and she didn't get to drink it.

454
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:16,260
Then what about Mr. Jo?
Mr. Park told me everything.

455
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:19,390
Mr. Jo's car that crashed.
The brake line was cut.

456
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,070
Then,

457
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,890
someone caused the accident on purpose?

458
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,870
To kill Mr. Jo and Yeon-seo?

459
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,680
It wasn't you?

460
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,410
Shall I peel another apple?

461
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,690
(Kim Hyung-min)

462
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,490
(Hanguk University,
Business Administration)

463
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:11,350
He's just not good enough.

464
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,200
Ms. Jung.

465
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:17,420
Are you done? How's the atmosphere?

466
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:20,900
I'm so curious,
but you won't let me into the room.

467
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:24,290
It's fine. Everyone's nice to me.

468
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:25,430
What a lie.

469
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:30,540
Humans are so strange. Why do you lie?

470
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,740
What's wrong with me?

471
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,510
Young Lady. Do you feel sick?

472
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,210
Ms. Jung.

473
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,540
You can go home first.

474
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,870
-What?
-I have to go somewhere.

475
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:49,540
You can go home.

476
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:50,950
Wait, where are you going?

477
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,140
Young Lady.

478
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:57,820
Where is she going when all she knows
is this place and home?

479
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:24,659
My gosh.

480
00:34:24,739 --> 00:34:27,820
That idiot keeps leading people here.

481
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,850
You asked for the head priest?

482
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,239
Do you know Kim Dan?

483
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,350
Dear Father.

484
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,400
He worked at my place.

485
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:46,480
This was the address he put on his resume.

486
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:49,600
How could he give a church's address?

487
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:50,880
What's wrong with that?

488
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:53,170
He was born and raised here.

489
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:55,810
He said he had a father who threw him out.

490
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,360
You know what we mean
when we say "Father."

491
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,240
How could this be?

492
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:09,320
How can I not know anything about him?

493
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:12,000
Where he was born, who his parents are,

494
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:15,210
how did he grow up,
and what did he dreamed of becoming?

495
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,840
Don't look for him.

496
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:20,140
It's just that the time has come.

497
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,790
Humans do not know the beginning
or the end.

498
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:28,060
Only when it is over do they realize

499
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:30,960
that their time is up and that it's over.

500
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:51,560
Where are you? Seriously.

501
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:06,600
-Director Ji.
-Are you looking for Kim Dan?

502
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,770
Let's go.

503
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:12,190
Where to?

504
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,570
To get over him.

505
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,600
Don't drink.

506
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,330
You have until today

507
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:44,970
to have regrets and look back.

508
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,700
Don't jump to conclusions.

509
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:49,410
No one's having regrets.

510
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,930
I could tell you were distracted
throughout today's practice.

511
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,350
When someone close leaves suddenly,

512
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,510
it's shocking.

513
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:00,630
I get that, but remember one thing.

514
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,870
Kim Dan

515
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:04,730
may not be the person
that you think he is.

516
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,790
What do you mean? What do I think of him?

517
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:10,970
What is he like?

518
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,820
I'm saying there's more
than meets the eye.

519
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:16,430
Perhaps he might be deceiving you.

520
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,030
So forget about him and get over it.

521
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:22,110
Why are you badmouthing him after he left?

522
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:24,390
Yes, I don't know anything about him.

523
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,910
I realized that even more after he left.
But I know this for sure.

524
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:30,640
Kim Dan isn't a sly guy
who deceives people.

525
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:33,280
I've never seen someone who was

526
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:36,100
as transparent as he was.

527
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,370
You must be worried that
I won't do well on "Giselle."

528
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:41,600
Don't worry.

529
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,290
and I received a standing ovation for it.

530
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,350
What did you expect?

531
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:24,150
Did you think he'd be sitting here
like the first day we met?

532
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,090
Kim Dan.

533
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:33,170
Where are you?

534
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:34,930
Where?

535
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:39,550
Wherever I go, I always see you.

536
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:41,790
I saw you at the bar,

537
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,640
and I can't even go home.

538
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,410
Now that you're gone,

539
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,710
everything is a mess.

540
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:51,780
Kim Dan.

541
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:54,900
I need you.

542
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:57,760
I need you.

543
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,730
Get a grip, Yeon-seo.

544
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,270
Is it

545
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:20,470
really you?

546
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,850
Kim Dan,

547
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,700
is it really you?

548
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:27,020
You were right.

549
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,690
It was my mistake.

550
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,070
I shouldn't have been nice to you.

551
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,590
I was a tiny bit nice to you,
and you're so smitten.

552
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:37,320
I didn't know that
it'd be this easy to win you over.

553
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,830
Can't you understand?

554
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,100
I was focused on my work,

555
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,420
and for a brief moment--

556
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:45,020
I just got carried away
for a brief moment.

557
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:47,920
Because you were such a spoiled ice queen,

558
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,640
I was just doing you a favor.

559
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,910
Don't get hung up on someone like me.

560
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,150
Find someone who's on your side.

561
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:58,310
Find someone who will stay
with you to the end.

562
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,370
Got that?

563
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:06,670
Stop.

564
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:08,600
Let go.

565
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:12,520
I'll go first.

566
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:17,140
I won't see you

567
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,650
leave ever again.

568
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,890
At home and at the park.

569
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:24,530
It was always you who ran away first.

570
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:27,960
Not this time.

571
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,360
Remember this.

572
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:34,390
I'm

573
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:36,760
leaving you.

574
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:39,750
It's you who will be

575
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,350
left alone.

576
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,610
He didn't exist.

577
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,610
He never existed.

578
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,070
Although he existed,

579
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:13,500
pretend that he never existed.

580
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:15,830
That's what I'll do.

581
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,340
I can do this.

582
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:21,950
I can do this. I can do it.

583
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:26,830
Say something to me.

584
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:32,110
What do you want me to do?

585
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,710
Is that me? You're awful at drawing.

586
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,380
It's not you.

587
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,660
Stop dreaming, human.

588
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:28,260
Stop having useless dreams.

589
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,690
Ma'am.

590
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:48,720
Ma'am!

591
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:53,730
Call my old man.

592
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:58,350
Call my old man.

593
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:01,520
Call my old man!

594
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:04,120
Why isn't this working?

595
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:06,710
Gosh, why isn't this working?

596
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,540
Ma'am.

597
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:13,050
Is that you?

598
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,400
My gosh, this is incredible.

599
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:19,430
It wasn't working before.

600
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,940
This thing really called you here.

601
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:24,970
Wait...

602
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:29,680
I'm...

603
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:31,000
In my dream,

604
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:35,000
I went to a beautiful field of reeds.

605
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,610
I was holding hands with you

606
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:39,930
as we walked together.

607
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,910
It was beautiful.

608
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:45,700
Can you take me there?

609
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:48,200
Pardon? To where?

610
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:49,610
There.

611
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:55,020
To that field of reeds.

612
00:43:57,530 --> 00:43:59,120
Do you remember

613
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:02,240
the day we met for the first time?

614
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:04,400
How was it?

615
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,400
(You lied to me.)

616
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:19,360
Is that you?

617
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,670
You're wearing the white suit

618
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,000
that you had on for our wedding.

619
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,720
What am I going to do?

620
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,030
I've aged too much.

621
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:39,110
Don't I look ugly?

622
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,100
You look beautiful

623
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,350
just like that day.

624
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,290
(Thank you)

625
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:56,540
for lying to me.

626
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:00,800
I was happy

627
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:03,270
every single day.

628
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:06,390
I was truly happy

629
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:10,260
that I could do that.

630
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,250
Are you all right?
Let's go to the hospital right now.

631
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:20,380
Thank you, young man

632
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:24,650
for what you did that day and today.

633
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:27,600
Do you know who I am?

634
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:29,840
Is your memory back?

635
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:33,450
It would've been nice
if it had all been a dream.

636
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,530
I thought I braced myself for it.

637
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,230
During the 70 years of my life,

638
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,000
we've said goodbye so many times.

639
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:45,070
Saying goodbye

640
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:48,240
is hard every time, you know.

641
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:55,190
It was here. This was the spot, right?

642
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:03,500
He only left behind

643
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,450
this handkerchief with a feather on it.

644
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,000
This is the only thing he left behind.

645
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:17,010
His body disappeared
as if he was never here.

646
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:21,540
How futile this is.

647
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:27,700
Please come to this world
as a human in your next life.

648
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:31,360
I will be your guardian angel.

649
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:33,780
Did you know

650
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:35,800
that he was an angel?

651
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:39,450
Weren't you scared?

652
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,560
He's not a human.

653
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:43,540
He's like a spirit or a monster.

654
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:47,110
What kind of monster
is as kind-hearted as he was?

655
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,440
When I said

656
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:53,310
that he was my husband
who passed away 30 years ago,

657
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:56,440
he played along and said that he was.

658
00:46:57,450 --> 00:47:00,000
Every day for a year,

659
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:03,390
he lied to me with a kind heart.

660
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:06,470
(You don't need to spend a long time
for it to be true love.)

661
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,650
If you can give her

662
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:10,690
1,000 years' worth of love, that's all.

663
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:13,020
How

664
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:15,790
could you do that?

665
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:17,860
I

666
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:20,770
ran away.

667
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:23,270
I was scared.

668
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,780
Of vanishing?

669
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:27,810
No.

670
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:32,290
I was afraid I would hold onto her.

671
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:37,220
When I'm with her, I want to hold her hand

672
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:39,330
and give her a hug.

673
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:42,940
But if I do that,

674
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:47,520
I thought it would make Yeon-seo sad.

675
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:52,400
I thought she might become unhappy.

676
00:47:58,030 --> 00:47:59,050
I

677
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:01,910
do not regret anything.

678
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:07,930
I'm sad.

679
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:12,730
I'm heartbroken.

680
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,470
But that's my fate.

681
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,600
It was me.

682
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:27,730
I'm the one he came across.

683
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:29,670
I'm grateful.

684
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,280
I do not resent him.

685
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,380
You know what, young man?

686
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:44,450
When two people meet one another,
it's never meaningless.

687
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:48,550
I believe in fate.

688
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,630
That it is

689
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,370
what led us

690
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:59,280
to meet each other.

691
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:04,030
Ma'am.

692
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:06,760
Ma'am? Ma'am!

693
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,050
Oh, no.

694
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,540
You can't pass away like this!

695
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:19,650
You can't!

696
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:46,710
(4. Other notes: A request for a leave)

697
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,610
(You said we are a part of His big plans)

698
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:50,590
(and providence, didn't you?)

699
00:49:52,610 --> 00:49:53,970
(Then was it a part of his plan)

700
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:56,920
(to take away the last hope from someone)

701
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:59,080
(who is poor and lonely?)

702
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:03,870
(What is the providence for the one
who refuses)

703
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:05,460
(to blame Him to the very end?)

704
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:08,670
(Does He have)

705
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:13,290
(a plan that He made for me
at the beginning of time?)

706
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,680
(I want to identify)

707
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:19,450
(the root of these feelings.)

708
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:35,110
Let us begin the maiden scene.

709
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:39,070
Please show your individual
depiction of "Giselle."

710
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:49,630
(Why was it Yeon-seo?)

711
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:53,950
(Why did you send me to her
of all people?)

712
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:55,790
(Yes.)

713
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:58,610
(I did save her on a rainy day.)

714
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:03,630
(But then again,)

715
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,790
(she recognized me first.)

716
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:08,860
Why?

717
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:14,670
I want to stay by her side.

718
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:17,000
Now that I left her side,

719
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:19,690
I want to do so even more.

720
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:23,820
If there is even
one reason for me to stay,

721
00:51:24,570 --> 00:51:25,800
then please,

722
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:28,220
help me find it.

723
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,600
(I don't care where that road leads me.)

724
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:32,180
(I will gladly)

725
00:51:33,370 --> 00:51:34,470
(go down that road.)

726
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:37,420
Next.

727
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,630
You want me to cover my eyes?

728
00:51:58,710 --> 00:51:59,810
Isn't it a tragedy?

729
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:01,790
You need to become the woman

730
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:03,250
who went blind from betrayal.

731
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,850
That's how you can run toward

732
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:09,100
the finale of revenge
that your director wants.

733
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:22,430
It was a great attempt,

734
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:25,730
but are you going to do this on stage?

735
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:28,460
Mimicking the emotion
by using this blindfold

736
00:52:28,810 --> 00:52:29,950
isn't genuine.

737
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:31,930
Next.

738
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,010
Lee Yeon-seo. Are you ready?

739
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:42,360
Stop!

740
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,660
Why?

741
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:47,420
What are you doing?

742
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:50,940
Why are you showing me
"Giselle" from 200 years ago? You told me

743
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:53,360
that you liked the new "Giselle."

744
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:56,090
I did that before, but I changed my mind.

745
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:57,100
I don't think it's good.

746
00:52:57,190 --> 00:52:58,240
Right now,

747
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:01,540
Giselle was betrayed.

748
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:04,760
He seduced her, so she dated him
to find out he was cheating on her.

749
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:07,260
How can you be so heartbroken?

750
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:08,360
Because she's sad.

751
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:12,190
I didn't know

752
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:16,280
you would depict Giselle
as such a passive character.

753
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,260
If you hate and curse someone,
you don't go crazy.

754
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:24,160
You have to be completely sane
if you wish to hate someone.

755
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,270
Do you know why she went crazy?

756
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:28,600
Because she's sad.

757
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:30,450
She was too sad.

758
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,260
She loved him that much.

759
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:34,940
That's the classic
and old-fashioned Giselle!

760
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:36,660
It's because you're being superficial.

761
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:39,650
If you go into the core,
her heart will make the audience cry.

762
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,390
I'll show you. Watch this.

763
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:12,910
(I'm sad.)

764
00:54:13,790 --> 00:54:14,850
(I'm sad.)

765
00:54:18,850 --> 00:54:20,830
(I'm not done with my feelings,)

766
00:54:22,110 --> 00:54:23,870
(but my love must come to an end.)

767
00:54:24,350 --> 00:54:27,260
You were right. It was my mistake.

768
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:28,880
I shouldn't have been nice to you.

769
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:35,130
(Why...)

770
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,080
(Why can't you be mine?)

771
00:54:39,970 --> 00:54:41,910
(Why must everything disappear?)

772
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:45,030
You have always been useless.

773
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:47,140
I must have been delusional.

774
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:48,600
While we're on the topic,

775
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:50,970
you can pack up your things
and leave right now!

776
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:26,220
(I miss you.)

777
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:29,120
(I miss you.)

778
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:26,060
(Kim Dan)

779
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:31,380
(Kim Dan)

780
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:38,380
-What?
-Gosh, you and your temper.

781
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:40,310
-Stop it.
-Hello.

782
00:56:41,850 --> 00:56:43,660
Are you here on a trip?

783
00:56:43,830 --> 00:56:45,940
Do you need a room?

784
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:48,800
No, I'm looking for something.

785
00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:51,800
Is there a rumor that
this is a treasure island?

786
00:56:54,790 --> 00:56:57,780
Ma'am, have you lived on
this island for a long time?

787
00:56:58,130 --> 00:57:01,170
Not very long. Just all my life.

788
00:57:01,650 --> 00:57:05,000
Then do you know
the house with the blue gate?

789
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:06,760
A long time ago,

790
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:09,530
a boy who is this tall used to live there.

791
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:15,070
(The house with the blue gate
on the hill over there?)

792
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:18,940
(A little boy
and his drunk father used to live there,)

793
00:57:19,210 --> 00:57:21,230
(but one day, they suddenly disappeared.)

794
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:50,750
Gosh.

795
00:58:01,490 --> 00:58:02,990
(You little punk!)

796
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:08,130
(That little jerk.)

797
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:09,590
Get back here.

798
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,890
You little jerk.

799
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:15,090
Where are you hiding?

800
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:19,050
I'm so sick and tired of this rain

801
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:20,940
that I'm about to go insane.

802
00:58:37,390 --> 00:58:38,890
Come here! Come out!

803
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:39,950
(No!)

804
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:12,810
Hey!

805
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:14,220
Hey!

806
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:18,140
Are you really going to be like this?

807
00:59:18,530 --> 00:59:20,210
I'm leaving tomorrow.

808
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:23,150
I won't even be going to Seoul.
I'm going to Russia!

809
00:59:23,770 --> 00:59:26,190
I'm getting on a plane and going far away.

810
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:33,230
I know you're there.

811
00:59:38,510 --> 00:59:39,520
Forget it.

812
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:41,810
I don't want to be your friend anymore!

813
00:59:54,610 --> 00:59:55,760
It wasn't a dream.

814
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:58,180
It

815
00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:00,730
definitely happened.

816
01:00:32,810 --> 01:00:34,570
(I was beaten up whenever it rained.)

817
01:00:35,710 --> 01:00:36,720
(So)

818
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:40,330
(I never went out after it rained.)

819
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:43,100
(That's why I had never
seen a rainbow before.)

820
01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:47,280
(The girl who showed me a rainbow
for the first time.)

821
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,330
(I wanted to be a grown-up for her.)

822
01:00:57,310 --> 01:00:58,720
(I didn't want to die.)

823
01:00:59,870 --> 01:01:01,320
(I'm Yeon-seo.)

824
01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:02,460
(Lee Yeon-seo.)

825
01:01:02,770 --> 01:01:03,780
(What about you?)

826
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:05,630
I'm...

827
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:07,130
(I'm...)

828
01:01:08,050 --> 01:01:09,060
(My name is...)

829
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:31,940
(Lee Yeon-seo, Yoo Seong-woo)
(My name is)

830
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:32,690
(Lee Yeon-seo, Yoo Seong-woo)

831
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:34,270
-Seong-woo.
(-It's Seong-woo.)
