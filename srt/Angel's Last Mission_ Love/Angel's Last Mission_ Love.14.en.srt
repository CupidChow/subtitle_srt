1
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,120
(Death should've taken the life already.)

2
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,890
(It just got postponed a little.)

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,450
(No matter how much you try
to escape from it,)

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,730
(a prophecy will come to pass.)

5
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:24,730
(One's destiny will be fulfilled.)

6
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:28,550
Let's do it.

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,200
Marry...

8
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:39,980
me.

9
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,020
Yeon-seo.

10
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,800
Should we do it tomorrow?

11
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,430
That soon?

12
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,910
We have no time. Ten days later...

13
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:28,300
"Giselle" will start soon.

14
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,140
I want to get married before then.

15
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,310
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

16
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:34,410
What?

17
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,880
You said no up until when
I had my rehearsal.

18
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,090
So why did you suddenly change your mind?

19
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:40,759
It's not sudden.

20
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,120
I've always wanted to do it.

21
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,090
I thought your mind changed

22
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,729
because you had turned into a human.

23
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,229
Hey, how could you say that?

24
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,720
I should've acted coyly.

25
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,380
I was too easy.

26
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,590
I proposed and bought the ring

27
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,970
when I was rejected for days on end.

28
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,590
It hurts my pride.

29
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,120
It's not too late to take back your words.

30
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,730
-Are you serious?
-Yes. I'm not scared.

31
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,050
How could you say that?

32
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,630
If you take it back, I can propose to you.

33
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,090
I can do it hundreds of times.

34
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,320
I'll make it formal.

35
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,360
What's with you?

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Lee Yeon-seo.

37
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,980
You're my first for everything.

38
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,720
When I was a human,

39
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,829
an angel,

40
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,370
and even now,

41
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,520
all I have is you.

42
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,520
I wanted to live because of you.

43
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,120
I wanted to become a human so badly

44
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,450
because of you.

45
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,880
I'm a fool who's hesitant, makes you wait,

46
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,440
and even makes you cry.

47
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,329
If you're okay with that,

48
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,840
then will you marry me?

49
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,240
I hate you.

50
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,010
You said everything that I wanted to say.

51
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,500
I'll make you happy.

52
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,000
I promise.

53
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,730
Let's live together
for thousands of years.

54
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:27,750
Okay.

55
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:43,020
Her fate was to be killed by the wicked.

56
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,490
Some people are born that way.

57
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,270
It was just postponed, that's all.

58
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,990
No matter how much you try
to escape from it,

59
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,160
a prophecy will come to pass.

60
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:59,170
One's destiny will be fulfilled.

61
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:04,050
(Report)

62
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,380
(Report)

63
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:20,430
I thought this was destiny.

64
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,300
I believed I met her,

65
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,450
thought of her,

66
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,180
and loved her

67
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,530
because those were
what you wanted me to do.

68
00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:35,730
I'm not scared

69
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:37,770
of vanishing...

70
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,450
or dying.

71
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,270
However, I'm most afraid...

72
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,450
of Yeonseo's being in pain

73
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,780
because of me.

74
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,590
However,

75
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,450
this isn't right.

76
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,020
Is it her destiny to die?

77
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,600
No, I cannot

78
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,210
accept that.

79
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,290
Even if it's a prophecy that'll come true,

80
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,350
I'll change it.

81
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,710
I won't let you have your way.

82
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,270
I'll do it my way.

83
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,700
Are you sleeping?

84
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:40,470
No.

85
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:41,780
I'm coming in.

86
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,700
Did you go somewhere?

87
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,690
I forgot

88
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,700
to say something.

89
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,830
What is it?

90
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:06,680
Yeon-seo.

91
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,960
I...

92
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,660
What are you trying to say
with such a serious face?

93
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,540
I haven't become a human yet.

94
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,320
And I don't think I can.

95
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,840
I thought it was possible.

96
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,170
I thought he had answered my prayer.

97
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,970
But I was wrong.

98
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,920
I thought he had allowed me
to become happy with you.

99
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,840
But I was wrong.

100
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,550
So what?

101
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:04,860
I don't care
if you're an angel or a human.

102
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,790
You might witness

103
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,340
such incidents again.

104
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,410
Then I can hold onto you again.

105
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,980
Do you remember what you said?

106
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,050
You said you'd propose to me over and over

107
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,380
even if I took it back.

108
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:27,110
I feel the same way. You see.

109
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,680
I can hold onto you hundreds of times.

110
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:34,770
I won't ever give up.

111
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,080
I could disappear

112
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,620
from your eyes.

113
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,120
Aren't you afraid of that?

114
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:46,880
I'm afraid...

115
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:52,409
that I won't be there when it happens.

116
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,280
I'm scared

117
00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:00,290
that you'll die all alone once again.

118
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:04,740
I won't

119
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,290
let you be alone.

120
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,490
So Kim Dan,

121
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,970
let's stay together.

122
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,820
Okay?

123
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,430
Let's only cry until today.

124
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:23,960
From tomorrow on,

125
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,610
let's smile every day

126
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,910
as if this moment will last forever.

127
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,890
Deal?

128
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,520
What is it?

129
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:59,700
Why did you tell me to sit down?

130
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,540
Ma'am, I wish to marry Young Lady.

131
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,910
Please give me her hand.

132
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,890
-What is this?
-I am nowhere good enough,

133
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:11,270
but if you'd bless us,

134
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,900
I can promise you that
I'll make her happy forever.

135
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,680
I don't know where he saw this from,

136
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,520
but he really wanted to try it.

137
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,410
Please just play along with it.

138
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:23,090
Well, I need to know
how far this role-playing is going

139
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,820
for me to play along with it.

140
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,300
Are you two seriously wanting
to get married?

141
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,230
How did your relationship develop this far

142
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,240
in a blink of an eye?

143
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,560
Please give me your blessing.

144
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,330
Well...

145
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,260
My gosh.

146
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:43,600
Who am I to give you my blessing?

147
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,090
I really want the blessing,

148
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,950
but you're the oldest one in this house.

149
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,330
Please play along with it.

150
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,620
Goodness.

151
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,330
Dream on, young man.

152
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,080
I raised her since she was a baby

153
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,970
with all that I could give.

154
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,160
Her looks? Her intelligence?

155
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,930
Her character... Okay, not that.

156
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,720
Anyway, she's a precious lady.

157
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,880
All you've got is that handsome face.

158
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,000
How dare you covet her?

159
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:21,050
What can you offer to her? Anything?

160
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,320
How could you let this happen?

161
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,590
How dare you love your boss?

162
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,050
You must've forgotten your place!

163
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:28,570
Never!
You can marry her over my dead body...

164
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,660
Ms. Jung!

165
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,350
How could you be so harsh?

166
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,380
There's nothing wrong with Kim Dan.

167
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,150
There's no one like him in this world.

168
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,150
It's not like we're living
in the Middle Ages.

169
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,160
How could you say
such brutal things to him?

170
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,330
I'm truly disappointed in you.

171
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,660
Wait, you said to play along.

172
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,150
I don't care what anyone says.

173
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,740
I'll marry Kim Dan
even if the universe is against it.

174
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:54,580
The wedding will be in the garden
a week from now.

175
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,870
So plan my wedding accordingly.

176
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,840
Hey, hey.

177
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,640
I'm sorry, Ms. Jung.
It's all because of me.

178
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,420
What am I supposed to do then?

179
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,720
You're very good at acting.

180
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,270
I was in the drama club at my school.

181
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,690
I'm sorry. I got carried away.

182
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,510
He won't leave now?

183
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,620
Young Lady, I like Kim Dan.

184
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:00,700
He's cute, handsome, and kind.

185
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,440
But to me, he's not important.

186
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,950
You are the most important thing to me,
Young Lady.

187
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:08,280
I meant some of what I said.

188
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,880
Love? It's nice for now.

189
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:15,450
But you know,
love changes whenever it wants to.

190
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:19,230
I can't ever see you getting

191
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,200
abandoned again.

192
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,000
Don't be like that. That doesn't suit you.

193
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,980
We've been indifferent toward one another
until now.

194
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,420
Of course.

195
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,060
Our indifferent relationship will last
a long time.

196
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,520
A very long time.

197
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:43,650
Don't worry.

198
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,530
I can be alone again.

199
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,340
The happiness I feel now

200
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,270
will be enough for me to live my life.

201
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:57,200
(Letter of Resignation)

202
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,160
And yet,
I gave my all to make you acknowledge me.

203
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,530
I regret it.

204
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,110
But you must still dance.

205
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,270
When your mother kicked me out

206
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,680
without giving me anything,

207
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:29,540
I knew that
she would be the cause of her collapse.

208
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,660
Ni-na, let me tell you about art.

209
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,200
Even when your house is burning down,

210
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,520
or when your parents are dying,

211
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,020
art always continues.

212
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,620
You told me

213
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,340
to be her understudy because of this.

214
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,230
What else do you have left?

215
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,300
Ji Kang-woo? Your family?

216
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:56,240
You only have ballet left.

217
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,850
What is this?

218
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:09,050
Thank you for your lessons.

219
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,710
What are you doing?

220
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,880
I've learned a lot thanks to you.

221
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,050
However,
I won't stoop so low just like my family.

222
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,430
Even if I become Giselle
by harming Yeon-seo,

223
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:29,590
I wouldn't have earned it.

224
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,320
Let go of her hand.

225
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,260
So it was you.

226
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,850
I knew she had someone coaching her.

227
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,300
Director Ji, how did you...?

228
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,920
I asked Yi-geon.

229
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,120
I stopped by a few places
where you would be.

230
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,420
Don't mind her.

231
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,900
What is it that you want to gain

232
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,190
by spying on me
and driving Ni-na into a corner?

233
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,200
What are you doing to Ni-na?

234
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,160
I've done her a favor unlike you.

235
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,780
I helped her break out of her shell.

236
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,050
If her dance ruins herself,

237
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,870
it'll crumble away eventually.

238
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,040
But that's the Giselle you wanted.

239
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,600
Both of you, stop!

240
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:12,100
It's all over. This is all pointless.

241
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,450
Here. Don't resign.

242
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,390
How could I ever dance again?

243
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,320
I want to die dozens of times
every single day.

244
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:32,300
I feel responsible,

245
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,880
and this will be resolved if I'm gone.

246
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:34,900
It's driving me crazy.

247
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,700
What's the point of dancing
when this is how I feel?

248
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:42,020
Give me a chance.
A chance to use you, Ni-na.

249
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:44,660
I'll put on
an excellent version of "Giselle"

250
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,380
no matter what.

251
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,700
For...

252
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:50,910
Yeon-seo?

253
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,410
For Yeon-seo.

254
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,990
For you. For the troupe.

255
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,410
And for me.

256
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,170
That has been my goal.

257
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,510
Liar.

258
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:09,910
Your goal was getting Yeon-seo.

259
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,600
Goodbye.

260
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:33,330
("It was the ballerina's family
that tried to take her life.")

261
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,380
("The Depraved Act revealed
on their 20th anniversary.")

262
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,700
They will question Chairman Geum

263
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,800
and General Director Choi.

264
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,870
They haven't subpoenaed
Associate Director Geum yet.

265
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,920
Why haven't they arrested her yet?

266
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,200
I went to the police and said

267
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,520
it was all her doing.

268
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,880
Ki Joon-soo.

269
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,950
He's the connection,
but they haven't found him yet.

270
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,160
It's because they can't prove it.

271
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,120
Are you all ready?

272
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,510
Yes.

273
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,250
Should we get going?

274
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:04,920
I don't know what to do.

275
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,960
I'm so nervous.

276
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,730
Let's see.

277
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:16,890
Which one do you like?

278
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,109
-This one.
-This one.

279
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:20,660
Which one would you like?

280
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,890
-That one.
-That one.

281
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,160
You're not on the same page

282
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,339
even from the get-go.

283
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:29,020
I guess you two aren't a very good match.

284
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,390
No, that's not true.

285
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:32,280
We'll take both.

286
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,730
This one.

287
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,310
And that one.

288
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:45,880
And this too.

289
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:48,880
This...

290
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,630
Let's skip this one.

291
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,220
Why? It's nice.

292
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,020
You didn't even think before buying it.

293
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,830
Do you know how much you spent today?

294
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:56,880
I wanted to buy good ones

295
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,810
because we'll use them
for the rest of our lives.

296
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,520
All I need is you.

297
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,130
Let's just use the ones we have at home.

298
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,820
-Please?
-The honeymoon phase won't last.

299
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:08,710
If you don't go all out,
it's not going to work out.

300
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,390
What did you say?

301
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,350
We'll take this one.

302
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,940
Let's go.

303
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,270
You should watch your language!

304
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,590
No, let's take this one.

305
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:27,110
I like this one.

306
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,180
What about you?

307
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,590
I like everything.

308
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,980
You should pick what you like too.

309
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,950
We're going to share it.

310
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,520
Just pick the one you like.
I'm fine with anything.

311
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,370
Come on, take a look.

312
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:42,730
I'm fine.

313
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:45,550
Usually,
the grooms think of shopping as a hassle.

314
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,220
They say they're good with anything

315
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,940
just to get it over with.

316
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,020
Is that what it is?

317
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,690
No!

318
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,450
And people break off engagements.

319
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:57,690
You can't get married
if you don't see eye to eye now.

320
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,070
Wait...

321
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,990
Stop playing house.

322
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,700
This is taking a toll on me, punk.

323
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,280
Yeon-seo, keep looking.

324
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:15,990
Let me just use the restroom.

325
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,700
How petty.
How can an angel try to create a rift?

326
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,200
Well, an angel I know is
trying to marry a human.

327
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,350
What I did wasn't so bad.

328
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:40,720
Leave before Yeon-seo comes out.

329
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,090
I won't change my mind.

330
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,980
Please. Dan!

331
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,620
Don't try to jump into the fiery pit.

332
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,350
You give me no choice.

333
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:52,020
Since the angel won't come to his senses,

334
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,010
I must persuade the human.

335
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,510
Don't do it.

336
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:30,480
I'm not asking for much.
Just leave me alone!

337
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:33,030
I... I cannot let you dissipate.

338
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,740
I don't want that to happen.

339
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,470
I told you already.

340
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,980
That human will die soon.

341
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,990
Why can't you just give up?

342
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,800
Why do you waste your time

343
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,550
with a human who will be gone soon, Dan?

344
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,410
If there is no end,

345
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,910
does it mean I'm not wasting time?

346
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:54,730
It's the opposite, Hu.

347
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:56,920
You have no idea
how every single day shines

348
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,480
because there is an end.

349
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,010
We wish to promise to be forever

350
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,600
because it cannot last forever.

351
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,500
Do you understand?

352
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:08,800
What's going on?

353
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,180
Hey.

354
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,910
Why do you address me like that?

355
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,320
You're Dan's senior, not mine.

356
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,390
If you're his senior,

357
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,110
you should support him like a good senior.

358
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,060
Do not hit him.

359
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,600
I will not let it slide.

360
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,060
I didn't hit him.

361
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,550
I started the fight.

362
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,280
He can send me to Africa
with a flick of his finger,

363
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,830
but he dealt with me.

364
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,950
I'm glad you know.

365
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,900
Ms. Lee Yeon-seo.

366
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,070
Gosh, you surprised me.

367
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,880
Okay. All right.

368
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,880
Yeon-seo, a marriage is...

369
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,340
Would you officiate at our wedding?

370
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,290
What? Me?

371
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,300
That might put you in a tight spot.

372
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,760
Then why don't you come by that day

373
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,040
and give us a blessing?

374
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:17,270
Hey, Noisy Gong.

375
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,980
I'm not too thrilled about that.

376
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,880
What did the deity do for us?

377
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,680
What did He do for Dan?

378
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:26,110
-Yeon-seo.
-But you are

379
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,700
Kim Dan's only family on this land.

380
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,020
I...

381
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,400
I ask of you.

382
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,840
That wedding will not happen.

383
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:51,230
You will not receive anyone's blessing.

384
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:54,270
-Hu.
-I'm done with this.

385
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:55,770
You can try to live with this idiot

386
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:57,170
who absolutely never listens.

387
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,170
Don't mind what he said.

388
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,200
I don't need anyone's blessing.

389
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,940
All I need is you.

390
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,450
But there is something
that's bothering me.

391
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:57,270
-What is it?
-That you absolutely never listen.

392
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,730
I wanted to have a laugh.
We said we'll do that.

393
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:13,700
Look.

394
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,050
What's this?

395
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,410
Our wedding invitation.

396
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,770
We don't have anyone to give it to,

397
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,610
but I wanted to make one for ourselves.

398
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,610
Be honest.

399
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,500
You've dated before, haven't you?

400
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,250
Does this mean I'm good?

401
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,700
Let me see.

402
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,030
You two can't evade your charges.

403
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,480
Give it a good thought.

404
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,340
Don't do that.

405
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,580
It's not like you did this.

406
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,980
Why do you want to take the blame?

407
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,840
You didn't do this either.

408
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,550
It's my crime.

409
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,580
It's my crime for sitting on my hands.

410
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:05,530
I was at ease thinking,
"This is probably okay."

411
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,900
I'm just trying to save our kid...

412
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,320
I need to be punished for the crime.

413
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:18,800
I will be punished!

414
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,250
If you wait for me there,

415
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,800
I'll plant onions once I'm released.

416
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,820
I can plant green onions,

417
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,360
water parsley, carrots, whatever.

418
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,790
I will plant and raise them.
So dear, I'll...

419
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,380
It's too late.

420
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,270
We cannot live

421
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,350
with our hearts at ease
for the rest of our lives.

422
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,860
Why are you hiding in the office

423
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,800
at night like a stray cat?

424
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,020
This is good.

425
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:27,000
I had a question for you anyway.

426
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,120
Take a seat.

427
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:30,570
You need to stop here.

428
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,650
This is your last chance.

429
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,410
What did I do?

430
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,120
You would know

431
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,590
your crime the best.

432
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,420
Do you have supernatural powers
of some sort?

433
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:46,730
I thought it was weird

434
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,660
how a girl who fell off a tall building

435
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,980
was completely fine,

436
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:55,830
how someone was hanging on the roof
in one second.

437
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,910
It's not something that
a normal person can do.

438
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,880
Tell me.

439
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,910
I like this sort of thing.

440
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:07,360
It's fun.

441
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:10,350
A person's life is at stake,

442
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,770
and it's just fun for you?

443
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,130
Because

444
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,000
I love someone who is strong

445
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:19,050
and competent.

446
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:23,860
It'll be great
to do something fun together.

447
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,480
You are utterly rotten to your roots.

448
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,220
No matter what your evil plan is,

449
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,800
it won't come to pass.

450
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,780
If you cause a car accident,
I'll save her.

451
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,080
If you throw her off of a building,
I'll catch her.

452
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:46,030
So quit your useless plans and stop here.

453
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,550
Good and evil

454
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:55,880
aren't so black and white.

455
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:00,030
But winning and losing are
already determined.

456
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,580
You'll end up losing.

457
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:05,700
Do you know why?

458
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:10,540
Because I would have killed me
if I were you.

459
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,340
The good side is always slow.

460
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,500
That's why they lose.

461
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,450
You're a human too.

462
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,200
A human can make mistakes, regret them,

463
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,390
then ask for forgiveness.

464
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,770
I was hoping you would understand.

465
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,800
Please stop here.

466
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:39,620
If you do anything rash, I might end up...

467
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,630
killing you.

468
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:00,880
All of them canceled?

469
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,940
-Yes, they're calling to cancel.
-Okay.

470
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,170
Can you reconsider?

471
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,970
-Hey, how many tickets?
-I'm not sure.

472
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,340
How many tickets are refunded?

473
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:09,630
I'm checking once again in the system.

474
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:11,780
We've never had this situation
a week before the show.

475
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,890
We're trying to find a countermeasure.

476
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:18,210
Can you call the reporters? Right now.

477
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,390
Do you really have nothing to say
about this incident?

478
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,820
I will do an exclusive interview
once everything is settled.

479
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:25,910
Please do understand.

480
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:28,550
There was a violent act,
and now people want refunds.

481
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,570
How will you overcome this crisis?

482
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,510
I believe this is an opportunity,
not a crisis.

483
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:35,770
It's a chance to watch
Lee Yeon-seo's "Giselle."

484
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,700
Can you call it Fantasia's "Giselle,"

485
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,730
not Lee Yeon-seo's?

486
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,980
Every single one of our dancers is
an excellent artist.

487
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,440
Everyone is important.

488
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,900
There are many rumors and scandals
about our ballet theater.

489
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,840
We will show you an excellent performance

490
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,380
that will calm down the speculations.

491
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:53,100
But there is no use
if the seats are empty.

492
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:55,660
We plan on inviting special guests.

493
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,160
People who have never seen
a ballet performance.

494
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:01,160
We will present beauty to them.

495
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:08,770
It was a great idea.

496
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,120
Both having an interview

497
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,900
and offering to show ballet to new people.

498
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,020
Why are you avoiding me?

499
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,620
You don't pick up my calls.

500
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,860
Why do you avoid me after dropping a bomb?

501
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,270
Because that was

502
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,390
all I can do.

503
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:35,560
What's this?

504
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,050
We're getting married.

505
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:43,740
(We wish to be
each other's guardian angels)

506
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,300
(and promise eternal love.)

507
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:48,490
Do you have to invite him?

508
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,220
I don't like that guy.

509
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:54,740
I thought it could be an answer.

510
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,920
We are going to live happily.

511
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:00,690
Every single day.

512
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:03,670
That's my answer to your bomb.

513
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,590
Yeon-seo, you are...

514
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,590
completely insane. You're getting married?

515
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:12,470
Kim Dan will disappear soon.

516
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,660
It'll be over.

517
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,690
Do you think

518
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:17,750
I told you that out of excitement?

519
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,820
I knew you would be shocked and hurt,

520
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:21,230
but I had no choice.

521
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,000
I wanted to protect you.

522
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,300
That's funny.

523
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,480
You told me that to stop me,

524
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,600
but I wanted to marry him
after I heard what you said.

525
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,980
I see.

526
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:39,760
I'm sure you two are more passionate
than ever

527
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,830
as if this is "Romeo and Juliet."

528
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:43,100
But you know what?

529
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:46,450
That story happened over five days.

530
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,950
It's only momentary. It will pass.

531
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:51,280
Do not invest so much into this.

532
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,800
Right, five days.

533
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:59,650
Some people can live their whole life
with just those five days.

534
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,080
Don't you know what that feels like?

535
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,960
Let me ask you one last time.

536
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,180
Is there really no way...

537
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:14,910
for Kim Dan to become a human?

538
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,480
Tell me anything.

539
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,590
I wish there was something that I can do.

540
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,570
I will gladly do anything

541
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,500
to let him live longer...

542
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,610
Enough.

543
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,360
Stop it.

544
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:29,820
That's exactly why Seol-hee died.

545
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,200
Do not bet anything
and do not throw away anything.

546
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,880
If you do not exist in this world,

547
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:35,590
do you think he would want to live?

548
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:37,620
That's not a reward. It's a punishment.

549
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,090
I have to go.

550
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,720
Yeon-seo.

551
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:02,560
Was her name Seol-hee?

552
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:05,080
I'm sure

553
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,020
she's heartbroken even in her afterlife.

554
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,380
She risked her life to save someone,

555
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:16,110
and he calls his life

556
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,840
a punishment,
thinking that it's tormenting.

557
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,700
I...

558
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,430
We won't be like that.

559
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:30,860
I'll make sure that doesn't happen.

560
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:49,380
No. That's all made up. It's a lie.

561
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,700
If I do that on a sunny day,

562
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,020
this body will be destroyed.

563
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,910
You can always be regenerated.

564
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,230
Let's give it a try.

565
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,550
That's not it.

566
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:58,700
Then what is it? Do you know the way?

567
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,330
Do you have to die?

568
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,920
Is that the only way?

569
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,200
Of course.

570
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,540
Act Two will only begin
after Giselle dies.

571
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:11,380
That's the only way for her
to save Albrecht.

572
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:14,600
No. I'm sure he didn't wish for that.

573
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,610
Don't become too immersed in it.

574
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:18,070
It's not like I'm actually dying.

575
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,159
My gosh.

576
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:31,270
Now you just barge in like this?

577
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,520
Our boundary has completely fallen.
All fallen.

578
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:38,340
What can I do? What can I do to save Dan?

579
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:41,380
If I give up dancing, my eyes,
or even my life,

580
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:44,340
can he live?

581
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,659
Tell me. If that's true,

582
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:49,620
I think I might really be thankful
for the deity.

583
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:56,260
People usually wish to live.

584
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,280
They do not risk their lives so easily.

585
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,580
What would you know?

586
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,080
I'll do anything.

587
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,260
I'll give up everything!

588
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,370
You said

589
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:07,380
you wanted to live on that day.

590
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:11,840
Please help me. Please.

591
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,960
I want to live.

592
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:18,880
I always wanted to die,

593
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,020
but I want to live now.

594
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:23,750
It's a sin

595
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,230
for him to save a woman
who begged for her life.

596
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,550
Of course, that angel

597
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,410
should be dissipated
as punishment for that sin.

598
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,340
He has to die

599
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,980
because he saved me?

600
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,440
I wanted to save him too.

601
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:43,830
I wanted to send him back up to paradise.

602
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,270
But we cannot change an ending
that is already decided.

603
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,030
No, I will change it.

604
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,680
I will

605
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:02,790
save Dan.

606
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:04,800
Wait and see.

607
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:20,700
Why were you waiting?

608
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,750
Let's go. Ni-na is waiting for us at home.

609
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,070
She came back?

610
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:36,620
I'm sorry for everything, Ni-na.

611
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:39,090
So just forgive me and...

612
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:40,370
It's my fault.

613
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,380
I was a coward.

614
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,120
I realized that
I've been acting like an angel,

615
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:48,330
hiding behind Mom, Dad, and Ru-na.

616
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:49,810
It was all my fault.

617
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,900
Then will you come home?

618
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,630
No, Ru-na. I am going to live by myself.

619
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,120
As of today, I do not have any family.

620
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:02,940
I called you here to tell you that.

621
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:08,960
Goodbye.

622
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,870
Ru-na, what's with you?

623
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:19,160
What's wrong with you?

624
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,710
Stop adding fuel to the fire
and stay still.

625
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,410
You're going to cut us off

626
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,110
for you to feel at ease?

627
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:28,680
Since when did you have any thoughts?

628
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,330
What did I mean

629
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,480
to you?

630
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,480
I love you.

631
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:41,260
I loved you in my own way.

632
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:43,370
And the way you love is wrong.

633
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,520
I don't want your love anymore.

634
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,330
-Geum Ni-na.
-Ru-na.

635
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:50,150
I liked you a lot.

636
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,380
You were always on my side.

637
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:53,230
You were so cool and dependable.

638
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,520
Do not say hi to me even if
we run into each other.

639
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,540
I will not let this slide.

640
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:23,320
-Look.
-What's this?

641
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:25,120
We have to write our marriage vows,

642
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:26,270
so I prepared these.

643
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,360
Right now?

644
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,590
Yes.

645
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,180
Here.

646
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,050
Take a pen.

647
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,440
(Marriage Vow)

648
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,200
Right here.

649
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,870
You can write on my back.

650
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:43,550
Stay still.

651
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:03,540
(Marriage Vow: I love you. I love you.)

652
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,590
Just so you know,

653
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:27,460
I want to postpone having a kid
while I do ballet.

654
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,430
That's not good.

655
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,380
If we want ten kids, we need to get busy.

656
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,340
Dream on.

657
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,830
I'm going to have a daughter
who looks like you

658
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:45,200
and a son who looks like me.

659
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:54,970
But what if our son has your personality?

660
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:57,090
For his future...

661
00:39:58,010 --> 00:39:59,020
Hey.

662
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:01,220
Why do you always hit me?

663
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,880
What's wrong with my personality?

664
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,960
Think about it. I'm right.

665
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,800
If our son has your personality...

666
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:18,020
Mom. Dad.

667
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:20,450
(Lee Jin-woong, Na Hee-soo, Jo Seung-hwan)

668
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,680
Mr. Jo.

669
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,250
Say hi.

670
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,620
This is my fiancÃ©.

671
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:35,660
Hello, I'm Kim Dan.

672
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:37,780
It's nice to meet you all.

673
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:39,670
(Lee Jin-woong, Na Hee-soo, Jo Seung-hwan)

674
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:44,120
Thank you for sending him to me.

675
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:47,760
When we meet up there,

676
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,100
I'll introduce him to you again.

677
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,130
When I first came here,

678
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,550
I told her

679
00:40:57,010 --> 00:40:59,160
that I existed just for her

680
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:02,150
and that she was my goal in life.

681
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,860
I'll make sure I keep my words.

682
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:09,030
I may not be a human,

683
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,090
but I'll do my best

684
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,480
to make her single day
feel like 1,000 years.

685
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:21,430
I'm sorry.

686
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,610
Why?

687
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,800
I want to stay by her side
for a very long time,

688
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,750
but I know I can't.

689
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:31,820
I'm sorry.

690
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,270
But then again,

691
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:37,190
even after I'm gone,

692
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:42,630
please take care of her
so that she'll remain

693
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,590
as a strong and happy Noisy Gong.

694
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,490
Yeon-seo.

695
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:01,860
We're getting a divorce.

696
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,130
We're not married yet.

697
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:04,820
We promised not to say that.

698
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:06,710
We promised to live forever

699
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:09,960
and have ten kids. We promised.

700
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,320
Yeon-seo, listen to me.

701
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,340
I'll probably disappear
like dust in the wind.

702
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,120
I'll probably vanish

703
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:26,890
into thin air.

704
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:31,910
No, don't say that. It won't happen.

705
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:33,490
Even when I'm gone,

706
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:36,410
you need to stay strong and beautiful.

707
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:38,830
Okay?

708
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:41,950
Can you promise me?

709
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,160
Please, Yeon-seo.

710
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,670
If you become completely broken
after I'm gone,

711
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:59,630
I won't be able to marry you. Okay?

712
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:02,900
Then make the same promise.

713
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:06,630
Who knows?

714
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,570
You could vanish
or I could die before you do.

715
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:11,640
No one knows.

716
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:17,230
That will never happen to you.

717
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,050
Good. Then promise me.

718
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:22,200
Let's promise that
whoever gets left behind

719
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:23,800
will live

720
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:26,000
a good, happy life.

721
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:30,880
Go on.

722
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,220
What is it all of a sudden?

723
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:03,440
Thank you for your work.
Keep up the good effort.

724
00:44:56,590 --> 00:44:59,620
So what do they want?

725
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:01,550
They didn't say.

726
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:04,540
They've just been handing him money
every single time.

727
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:07,410
-We should report this.
-We have no solid proof.

728
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:10,760
For now, please keep meeting her.

729
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:12,420
Can I do that?

730
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:16,520
And please report back to him.

731
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:20,430
You may go now. Be careful.

732
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:22,230
Okay.

733
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:28,800
Why are you so confident?

734
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:31,040
What if he tells Ru-na about us?

735
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,800
I hope he does. Only then will she stop.

736
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,440
She will never change.

737
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,980
She'll either change her men
or her method.

738
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:39,840
I know.

739
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:43,350
That's why he's in your hands.

740
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,800
As for Ru-na, I'll take care of her.

741
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:53,300
What do you mean by that?

742
00:45:57,090 --> 00:46:00,120
-Don't worry about it.
-It can't be. No, right?

743
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,290
Angels must not intervene in human life.

744
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:05,000
And they shouldn't fall in love either.

745
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:08,090
I'm already a degenerate angel.

746
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:09,370
I'm not afraid.

747
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:12,570
Remember when you said

748
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:16,840
that you could kill anyone for Yeon-seo?

749
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:21,950
You shouldn't do that.

750
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,050
Live on.

751
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:25,160
Do that...

752
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:28,450
and stay by her side.

753
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:30,520
What are you trying to say?

754
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:32,280
Ballet.

755
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:36,850
Do that with her.

756
00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:40,020
Make her shine

757
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:42,530
as brightly as possible.

758
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:47,380
Please.

759
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:58,200
People usually wish to live.

760
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,140
They do not risk their lives so easily.

761
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,410
Hi.

762
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:14,530
Warm up first.

763
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:17,480
I handed in my letter of resignation.

764
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,160
I can't continue doing ballet with shame.

765
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:22,700
Did you even hear what I told you?

766
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:28,390
Punish yourself by seeing me every day.

767
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:32,560
-Why are you doing this?
-You need to practice.

768
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:35,470
If you don't, who will be Giselle?

769
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:38,280
Hey.

770
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,300
Did something happen?

771
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:42,910
I'm taking precautions.

772
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:44,350
That's what understudies are for.

773
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,420
You need to be well-prepared

774
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,050
for me to be carefree on stage.

775
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:53,340
I want it...

776
00:47:55,350 --> 00:47:56,630
to be you.

777
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:00,550
Go change.

778
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:33,260
Did you drink?

779
00:49:35,330 --> 00:49:37,090
I'm sorry for making you come home alone.

780
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,780
I should apologize
for practicing even the night

781
00:49:42,010 --> 00:49:43,200
before the wedding.

782
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:44,910
Are you all done?

783
00:49:48,090 --> 00:49:49,350
I really wanted

784
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:52,340
to see your show.

785
00:49:53,310 --> 00:49:55,420
I really wanted to see you

786
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,200
dance on the stage.

787
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:03,710
You can.

788
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:06,340
Okay.

789
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:08,890
Yes, I can do that.

790
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:24,820
That's good.

791
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:26,710
Move it to this side just a bit.

792
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,200
Yes, great, great.

793
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:30,590
Hey, you!
You need to level it with this side.

794
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:32,340
This way. Good.

795
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:33,450
No, turn it around.

796
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:36,050
Hey, stop! Stop! Yes, put it there. Good.

797
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:37,490
Hold on.

798
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:38,690
Turn it around.

799
00:50:38,770 --> 00:50:40,350
Just like this. Turn it around.

800
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:43,380
Yes. That's good. Good.

801
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:51,270
No, I'm not nervous.

802
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,080
Is it that obvious?

803
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:00,100
Come on.

804
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:04,160
Gu-reum.

805
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:07,010
You must live a long life.

806
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:11,810
Take good care of Yeon-seo for me.

807
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:18,500
Hey.

808
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,290
What is it? We didn't order a cake.

809
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:23,700
Hold on a second.

810
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:25,180
It says

811
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,750
Archangel Hu sent this.

812
00:51:33,410 --> 00:51:34,650
Surprise.

813
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:53,120
I know that you're working hard, Hu.

814
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:54,940
But you should play hooky today.

815
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,300
It's a nice day.

816
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:01,570
Look.

817
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:04,340
The sky is clear. And it's sunny.

818
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:05,930
I can't give you my blessing.

819
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:11,160
I've already committed
several sins because of you.

820
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:13,020
If I give you my blessing,

821
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:15,210
I think I'll get struck by lightning.

822
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:24,320
My gosh, I don't know anymore.

823
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:27,620
I really can't understand

824
00:52:28,290 --> 00:52:29,730
this foolish decision of yours.

825
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:31,980
But then again,

826
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:36,200
give it a go.

827
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,720
Okay? Go as far as you can go.

828
00:52:43,690 --> 00:52:46,450
I guess today will be the last day.

829
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:50,230
Thank you for coming.

830
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:53,760
You, punk.

831
00:52:54,810 --> 00:52:55,910
You look dashing.

832
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:57,720
Square your shoulders.

833
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:46,620
Now, it's time for you to recite
your marriage vows.

834
00:54:57,350 --> 00:54:58,550
Here's my marriage vow.

835
00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:01,190
A day will be an eternity.

836
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:02,810
The two of us will become one.

837
00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:05,540
I will love you with a happy heart.

838
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:08,390
We were each other's first

839
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:10,340
and will be each other's last.

840
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:14,160
We rescued one another

841
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:15,790
and were rescued.

842
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:17,950
We believe in destiny.

843
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:21,380
No, we don't believe in it.

844
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:25,910
-We believe in ourselves.
-We believe in ourselves.

845
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:44,560
(Marriage Vow: We believe in ourselves.)

846
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:03,350
Gu-reum, look over there.

847
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:40,480
Are you going somewhere?

848
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:43,030
You're up.

849
00:56:46,830 --> 00:56:49,380
You were looking at me even at dawn too.

850
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:52,630
Right back at you.

851
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:54,880
You were looking at me
when I was sleeping.

852
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:27,210
Good morning.

853
00:57:29,890 --> 00:57:31,270
Come back home safely.

854
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:36,330
Okay.

855
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:39,880
I'll be back.

856
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:49,530
Bye.

857
00:58:51,830 --> 00:58:52,880
Kim Dan.

858
00:59:10,270 --> 00:59:12,150
Yes, call her right now.

859
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,470
Tell her to be there.

860
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:38,870
Hello, I'm Lee Yeon-seo.

861
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:41,760
You know me, don't you?

862
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:43,970
Of course, you do.

863
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:47,170
You sure do after everything
you did to me.

864
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:49,990
You made me an orphan at 17,

865
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:51,410
made me blind so I couldn't dance,

866
00:59:52,330 --> 00:59:54,050
and you took away my one and only Mr. Jo.

867
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,730
And all of my relatives

868
00:59:57,830 --> 01:00:00,240
are dying to kill me.

869
01:00:02,190 --> 01:00:03,580
Don't you think that's too much?

870
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:05,620
But I didn't come

871
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:07,910
to complain about that.

872
01:00:08,610 --> 01:00:11,340
I'm all right now because you sent
Kim Dan to me.

873
01:00:12,350 --> 01:00:13,850
I'm all right.

874
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,070
But you can't do that to Kim Dan.

875
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:20,050
I'm angry enough

876
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:21,770
that he died a horrible death
as Seong-woo.

877
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:24,090
What did he do wrong?

878
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:25,800
His mission was to make me love.

879
01:00:26,070 --> 01:00:27,300
And I love Kim Dan.

880
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:30,570
I don't know
what kind of love you wanted to see,

881
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:33,770
but I am in love with Kim Dan.

882
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:36,230
So...

883
01:00:37,470 --> 01:00:39,270
So why does he have to dissipate?

884
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:43,270
If you have any conscience,
you cannot do this.

885
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,380
You can't do this!

886
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:11,090
You like fairness, don't you?

887
01:01:13,110 --> 01:01:14,470
You take one thing

888
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:16,890
and give another.

889
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:20,410
Right?

890
01:01:53,490 --> 01:01:56,230
I'm shocked. You had a plan.

891
01:01:57,450 --> 01:01:58,770
I told you

892
01:01:59,050 --> 01:02:02,040
that I will stop you myself
if you try to do

893
01:02:02,730 --> 01:02:04,050
anything foolish again.

894
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:14,220
I am not curious about

895
01:02:15,050 --> 01:02:16,110
the providence...

896
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,020
or the plan.

897
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:33,310
If I must kill someone

898
01:02:34,810 --> 01:02:36,450
for the sake of the one I wish to save,

899
01:02:38,810 --> 01:02:40,010
then I will...

900
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:43,620
commit that sin.

901
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:49,990
Take everything from me.

902
01:02:51,130 --> 01:02:52,230
Anything.

903
01:02:55,450 --> 01:02:56,990
I can give it to you gladly.

904
01:02:58,050 --> 01:02:59,370
-To...
-To...

905
01:03:00,030 --> 01:03:01,610
-save him.
-save her.
