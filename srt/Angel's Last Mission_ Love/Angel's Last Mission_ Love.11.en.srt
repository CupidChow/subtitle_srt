1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:03,060
Do you like me that much?

2
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:11,730
(It's funny.)

3
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,370
(How a tragedy turns into a comedy.)

4
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,150
(And how what seemed like a comedy)

5
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,430
(turns into a tragedy.)

6
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:31,880
(Lady Yeon-seo)

7
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:32,900
(Yeon-seo.)

8
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,520
(It would have been great
if you were still blind.)

9
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,080
(You received corneas
and got your vision back.)

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,100
(But that luck of yours)

11
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,520
(will actually be your tragedy.)

12
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,180
(If you remained as a pretty doll,)

13
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,420
(who lived as if she was dead,)

14
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,900
(you wouldn't have had to die so soon.)

15
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:08,580
(I love you.)

16
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,380
Yeon-seo.

17
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:11,750
What do you want to see?

18
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,990
The river, sea, trees, fields,
tell me anything you want.

19
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,220
I'll take you there. Okay?

20
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,420
(I have to see)

21
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,539
(the river, sea,)

22
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,870
(trees, and fields.)

23
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,680
(I wanted to see those things with you.)

24
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,020
(Kim Dan.)

25
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,590
Are you okay?

26
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:54,780
Look at me, Yeon-seo.

27
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,900
It's me.

28
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:01,070
Kim Dan.

29
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,250
Yes, it's me.

30
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,419
So,

31
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,360
relax.

32
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,170
Everything...

33
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,770
It's all right.

34
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,320
Is this...

35
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,530
really you?

36
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,329
And these wings.

37
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,960
You flew in

38
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,600
from over there?

39
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,410
What...

40
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,400
What...

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,920
What are...

42
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,530
What are you?

43
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,530
You called in a report, right?

44
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,930
Where are you?

45
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,910
I do not see anyone who fell down.

46
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,650
I'm sorry, it must be the rain.

47
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,410
I think I saw something wrong.

48
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,360
It was a wrong call.

49
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,650
No one fell down. Let's go.

50
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,720
-Let's go.
-Get moving.

51
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,029
(I feel too burdened,
and I do not feel confident.)

52
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,950
(I think this is my limit.)

53
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,230
Where are you now?

54
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:35,950
We need to meet.

55
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:20,650
I'm sorry...

56
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,260
for being too late.

57
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:27,300
For making you find out like this.

58
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,000
Mom?

59
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,760
Dad?

60
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:38,909
Where are you?

61
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:40,590
Kim Dan.

62
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,190
Are you done?

63
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,450
Well, I did push her off,

64
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,430
but she wasn't there.

65
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:13,450
What do you mean?

66
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,510
(I didn't see her there)

67
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,010
(or any traces of someone moving her.)

68
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,120
Exactly. What kind of nonsense is this?

69
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,980
I'm not sure what's going on either.

70
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:23,180
Come here immediately. Come and tell me.

71
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,510
No, I'll take care of this
before I go there.

72
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,570
He pushed her off,

73
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,960
but she disappeared?

74
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,690
(Come to that place this instant.)

75
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:21,200
You really came. Sit down.

76
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:22,960
Would you like a drink?

77
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,460
Did you make a toast?

78
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,400
-What?
-I thought you cared

79
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:28,940
about your sister.

80
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,130
You look very relaxed.

81
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:34,220
Or did something
extraordinarily good happen?

82
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,090
Director Ji.

83
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:42,140
Didn't Ni-na do so well today?

84
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,170
Imagine how heartbroken she must be

85
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:46,410
when she gave it her all.

86
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,960
That's why I'm drinking.

87
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,290
Was it wrong of me to do so?

88
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,250
What is this?

89
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,100
Yeon-seo...

90
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,250
Did she really send this?

91
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:09,070
Where is she? Why are you here?

92
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,960
It must've been
General Director Choi's order.

93
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,810
She's always despised Yeon-seo.

94
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,850
And despite all the bribing,
Yeon-seo won the audition.

95
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:19,320
So did she try to get rid of her
once and for all? Is that it?

96
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,170
Director Ji, what are you...

97
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:25,000
Your family's the only one
with a good enough reason

98
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,670
to do something like this.

99
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,190
Did you...

100
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,790
just smile?

101
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:38,900
Director Ji.

102
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,330
This world isn't that simple.

103
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:46,560
It's not run
by just resentment and sugarcoating.

104
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,590
There are even some humans
who commit murder

105
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,970
just because they didn't like the way

106
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,820
how they were looked at.

107
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,270
Is Yeon-seo alive?

108
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:00,990
Is she badly injured?

109
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,010
You're checking if she's alive or not.

110
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,520
I didn't even tell you what happened.

111
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,000
You showed me the text.

112
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,470
She felt too pressured,
so she wanted to end it.

113
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:17,450
This is my last warning.

114
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,940
Don't you ever

115
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,020
touch her again.

116
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:35,090
She's alive?

117
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:46,930
What was your plan?

118
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,690
Were you going to let
the entire world know?

119
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,150
We've been disguising all the incidents
as accidents.

120
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,220
But if you turn this into murder,

121
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,240
both of us will go down.

122
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,710
I'm sorry. I just wanted to wrap it up--

123
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:00,430
Enough with your excuses.
Lie low for the time being.

124
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,630
Don't try anything rash.

125
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:06,590
Don't be foolish. Do you understand?

126
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,010
Yes, ma'am.

127
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,990
Why are you so cruel?

128
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:39,680
(Please)

129
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,590
(pity them.)

130
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,400
Are you awake?

131
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,120
How do you feel?

132
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,150
Can you get up?

133
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,660
Have you been here all night?

134
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:23,860
Because of what happened yesterday?

135
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,270
Yeon-seo.

136
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,560
Listen carefully. Yesterday, you...

137
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,450
What happened?

138
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,700
I can't remember.

139
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,940
The last thing I remember is

140
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,480
going to the park with you.

141
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:51,930
Did I faint?

142
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,680
Do you really not remember anything?

143
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,350
You don't remember anything at all?

144
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,760
My body feels sore.

145
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,590
But it's always been sore every morning.

146
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,800
Tell me. What happened?

147
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:17,670
Young Lady!

148
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,140
Oh, the appointment with Ms. Jung.

149
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,420
Did you tell her?

150
00:14:22,510 --> 00:14:23,520
What?

151
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,540
Yes.

152
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,830
Wait for me outside.
I'll wash up and come out.

153
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,950
Don't treat me like a kid
just because I fainted once.

154
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,560
I'll wait outside.

155
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,460
He must be very worried.

156
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,800
Please stay close to her.

157
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,690
Especially when she's
at the ballet theater.

158
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:24,500
-And about her room...
-What's going on?

159
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,800
I've decided to strengthen our security.

160
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,430
24 hours a day in three shifts.

161
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:33,570
I told you.
I don't want to be watched 24 hours a day.

162
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,200
I have no choice.

163
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,560
You left me waiting in the rain

164
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,010
and didn't even pick up your phone.

165
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,650
Kim Dan told me he called you.

166
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,940
He did. Extremely late.

167
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,370
And the first thing he said was
to strengthen the security.

168
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,110
I knew it was you.

169
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,400
He's overreacting. Don't listen to him.

170
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,950
Still, it's better safe than sorry.

171
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,840
What's so wrong about being careful?

172
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,700
Let's do this for now.
Just one week, please?

173
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,180
I remembered everything.

174
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,040
I know what happened yesterday.

175
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:21,040
Let's go inside and talk.

176
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:22,050
The red balloon.

177
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:23,950
Yeon-seo!

178
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,070
(You were holding it across the street.)

179
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:32,260
(That's when I fainted, right?)

180
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:38,330
I only remember up until that part.

181
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,870
I fainted at that moment.

182
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,710
(Is she remembering something
that didn't even occur?)

183
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,250
It can't be.

184
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:48,320
You don't have to be too worried

185
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:49,640
just because I fainted once.

186
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,870
You see...

187
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,170
All I need is you.

188
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,810
You can do the sweet talk with him
when you're alone.

189
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,710
There's only one Dan.
If you want him next to you,

190
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,599
we need more people to watch the house.

191
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:10,099
The security team will start
their patrol today.

192
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,150
Where's Ni-na?

193
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,410
She left to practice at dawn.

194
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,610
She must've cried all night.

195
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:32,410
And you let her go?

196
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,140
It's not over yet. She needs to practice.

197
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,910
Did you even do your job?

198
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,320
Why were we missing two votes

199
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:40,730
when you've acquired 13 of them?

200
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,970
I told you that it couldn't be guaranteed.

201
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,300
Are you saying we'll have to give up

202
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,630
the foundation
and the position of the prima ballerina?

203
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,490
No. I won't allow that.

204
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,950
It's the same for Ni-na.

205
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,930
A dancer who has tasted the spotlight

206
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,990
can never return to being nothing
but a shadow.

207
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,770
She will make it.
She will perform for "Giselle."

208
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,670
How?

209
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,430
I'll have

210
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:05,540
to look for a way.

211
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,730
But for today,
let's get ready to meet our new Giselle.

212
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:25,430
What are you doing?

213
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,810
No.

214
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:30,970
-I said I'm fine.
-You fainted. You need to rest.

215
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,660
How could the prima ballerina miss out
on her first practice after the audition?

216
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,730
You have your reasons. Don't go there.

217
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:37,930
-Give it to me.
-No, listen to me.

218
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:45,540
Are you that worried about me?

219
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:50,470
It's killing me.

220
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,580
(Ji Kang-woo)

221
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:08,020
-This is Kim Dan.
-Put Yeon-seo on the phone.

222
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,010
You can talk to me. I'm her secretary.

223
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,080
How are you still her secretary?

224
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,500
Did you show her your wings
and threaten her?

225
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,680
Stop talking nonsense.
If that's all, I'm hanging up.

226
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,770
Director Ji, this is Lee Yeon-seo.

227
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,400
Why didn't you call me directly?

228
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,130
I called you to tell you
to take a day off today.

229
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:30,500
Why? Was the practice canceled?

230
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,960
I'm sure you were shocked.

231
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,760
I'll see you after you rest up.

232
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:36,840
I'll be looking into
what happened yesterday.

233
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,760
What will you be looking into?

234
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,010
Why is everyone making a fuss?
I'm all right.

235
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,960
-But yesterday, you--
-I just fainted. That's all.

236
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:49,120
My secretary must have told you
what had happened.

237
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,700
Please forget what he told you.

238
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,020
Fainted?

239
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,320
-Yeon-seo.
-I must've dropped

240
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,900
my phone at the park. Let's go back.

241
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,760
-Let's just buy a new one.
-No, I have to find it.

242
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,360
Why?

243
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,460
Forget it. I'll go by myself.

244
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,740
You were following me around like a puppy
this morning.

245
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,200
Why won't you follow me this time?

246
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,800
I'll go to the park.

247
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,480
I'll find it.

248
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,760
Stay here until I come back.
Don't go anywhere.

249
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,220
Promise me.

250
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,120
Okay.

251
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,190
I promise.

252
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,250
I'm glad that you both are here.

253
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,410
What is this about?

254
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,820
I wanted to ask something.

255
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,080
"Director Ji, I'm sorry."

256
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:31,280
"I feel too burdened,
and I do not feel confident."

257
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:32,740
"I think this is my limit."

258
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,980
"I will end everything
in the ballet theater"

259
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:37,090
"that I loved."

260
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,980
What is that?

261
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,800
Please don't tell me
that text is from Ni-na.

262
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,530
What do you think you're doing?

263
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,210
It's a text message from Lee Yeon-seo.

264
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,800
No, to be accurate,

265
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:51,000
it's a text message from a kidnapper

266
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,540
who took her yesterday.

267
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:59,660
Ru-na. This is horrendous.
What on earth happened?

268
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,150
I thought we were done talking yesterday.

269
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:07,060
Accusing us with a text message is enough

270
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,640
for a defamation charge.

271
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,940
Did something happen to Yeon-seo?

272
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,000
No.

273
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:14,670
How do you know that?

274
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,740
Director Ji, you wouldn't be here

275
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:18,320
if there was an accident.

276
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:23,550
Are you saying Yeon-seo was kidnapped,

277
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:26,060
and that we're behind that?

278
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,870
Bring us the evidence.

279
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:29,930
No. If you do find evidence,

280
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,390
go to the police station right away.

281
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:32,970
Don't bother me. It's exhausting.

282
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,950
I plan to do that,

283
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,750
but I'm here to warn you in advance.

284
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,090
Listen, Director Ji.

285
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,860
We're not behind the kidnapping.
Why would you warn us?

286
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:45,770
I thought about why you two must want

287
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,530
to go such lengths.

288
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:50,970
Come in.

289
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:01,220
Why are you here?

290
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,290
Director Ji asked me to come in.

291
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,130
He said he had to tell me something.

292
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:08,210
There's something you must know, Ni-na.

293
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,500
Look, Director Ji.

294
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:13,710
What is it?

295
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,350
You've never contacted me personally.

296
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:18,380
What is this about?

297
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,570
You were great.

298
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,120
Your performance yesterday was excellent.

299
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,590
You were the Giselle I dreamed of.

300
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,350
You were impressive, Ni-na.

301
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,850
You two

302
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,970
would do anything for Ni-na.

303
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,420
That's how much you love her.

304
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:42,010
That's why

305
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:44,210
I wanted to say this
in front of you two as well.

306
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,750
Well done.

307
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,110
Bye.

308
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,430
(Kim Dan)

309
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,060
She's adorable.

310
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,600
(Director Ji, I'm sorry.
I feel too burdened)

311
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:30,320
"Director Ji, I'm sorry."

312
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:32,870
"I feel too burdened,
and I do not feel confident."

313
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,380
"I will end everything
in the ballet theater"

314
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:36,610
"that I loved."

315
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,420
What's your plan?

316
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,450
They tried...

317
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,790
to hurt a person.

318
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,290
They are her family.

319
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,230
They are her only family left.

320
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:24,440
Her family did that.

321
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:27,650
So are you going to hurt people
just like them?

322
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,640
How long do you think
He will put up with you?

323
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:32,530
"The day of the Lord will come
like a thief."

324
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,540
Behave yourself.

325
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,870
You knew, didn't you?

326
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,500
Were you just staring at her?

327
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:43,840
Or were you the one
who got rid of Yeon-seo's memory?

328
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:08,080
Why did you erase her memory?

329
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,760
You told me not to do anything to humans!

330
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:11,780
Why did you spread your wings
in front of a human?

331
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,010
This is all your fault.

332
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,040
I was going to tell her.

333
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,710
I was going to tell her the truth anyway.

334
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,520
Whether she accepts me or not,

335
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,060
that's up to Yeon-seo.

336
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,340
Why did you erase her memory?

337
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:24,540
Instead of trembling in fear
with that awful memory,

338
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:25,950
it's better not to know anything.

339
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:28,100
The moment she knows that you're an angel,

340
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,170
you and Noisy Gong won't be able
to stay together.

341
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,700
That's cowardly of you.

342
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,320
I didn't know...

343
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,620
an angel could be such a coward.

344
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,950
Angels are only meant to be bystanders.

345
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,800
So if...

346
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,930
it is her fate to be murdered by someone,

347
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,210
you must accept it.

348
00:26:57,630 --> 00:26:58,640
That makes no sense.

349
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,840
If I can save her, I should.

350
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,780
That's a good deed.

351
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:04,580
And that's our job.

352
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,550
No.

353
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,060
Bringing confusion
into this world is considered evil.

354
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,150
Someone will be a sacrifice
of another's criminal act.

355
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:19,190
And someone will die
at the peak of their life.

356
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:21,210
And some people will live
until 100 years old.

357
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:23,240
But some people die
as soon as they are born.

358
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,480
That's just fate humans have to face!

359
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,330
I can't understand this.

360
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:34,060
I was told
every single person was important.

361
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,730
He loves them.

362
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,900
Then, no one should face
such an unfair death.

363
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,620
So how can He

364
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,900
and angels like us...

365
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,740
not take responsibility
and just watch it happen?

366
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,250
If you think we're being irresponsible,

367
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,550
that means you're being selfish.

368
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,490
Look into your heart.

369
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,290
You don't want to save

370
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,790
all the wrongful deaths.

371
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,600
You only want to save just one person,
Lee Yeon-seo.

372
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,690
Don't try to reveal who you are
to Noisy Gong.

373
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:11,640
You don't have time to be greedy.

374
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,830
Yeon-seo, are you up?

375
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,110
Let's eat breakfast.

376
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,010
(I'm going to practice.)

377
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:11,520
(I'm going to practice.)

378
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:11,120
(I'm going to practice.)
(I'm going to practice.)

379
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,580
Congratulations, Yeon-seo.

380
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,390
Yes, congratulations.

381
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,460
That was an excellent Giselle.

382
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,300
Thank you.

383
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:39,590
Right.

384
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,850
Are you looking after the health
of our troupe?

385
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:45,050
Include physical therapy
and massages in their schedule.

386
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:46,850
-I'm still managing the theater...
-Of course.

387
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,010
Let me know if you want anything.
I'll make it happen.

388
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,920
I look forward to working with you.

389
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:57,280
Me too, Associate Director Geum.

390
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,570
Goodness, did you get hurt?

391
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:04,410
I heard you took a sick leave yesterday
and skipped practice.

392
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:05,590
Did something happen

393
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,270
on the day of the audition?

394
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:11,180
No, nothing happened.

395
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,410
I'll go inside.

396
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,440
Be there on time.

397
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:21,430
Maybe Director Ji lied.

398
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,110
She looks so indifferent

399
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:25,350
when she was supposedly abducted.

400
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,640
He probably got something wrong.

401
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:29,090
Don't let it get to you.

402
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,670
We can just ignore this,

403
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,710
but Ni-na is too weak-hearted.

404
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,010
Where are you?

405
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:45,550
(Why haven't I heard from you
in two days?)

406
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,170
You told me to go off the grid.

407
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:49,070
What are you talking about? When?

408
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,400
-On that night--
(-Are you ill?)

409
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:52,720
Are you seeing things?

410
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:54,430
Yeon-seo is fine.

411
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,330
She fell from a ten-story building,

412
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:58,000
but she walked in with all of her limbs.

413
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:00,460
(You said you'd take care of this.
What did you do?)

414
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:01,780
I'm sorry.

415
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,370
Tell me.

416
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,170
Did she

417
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:07,060
see your face?

418
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,520
Okay, I'm hanging up.

419
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:29,720
I can't believe this.

420
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,130
(Yeon-seo is fine.)

421
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,800
She fell from a ten-story building,

422
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:34,520
but she walked in with all of her limbs.

423
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:36,590
(You said you'd take care of this.
What did you do?)

424
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:38,170
No.

425
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,150
No.

426
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:41,780
No!

427
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,270
No.

428
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:45,080
No.

429
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,130
Hello.

430
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,110
(Information)

431
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,070
Excuse me.

432
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,730
You dropped your cigarettes.

433
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,440
This ballet theater is
a smoke-free building.

434
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:41,790
Yes, right. I'm sorry.

435
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:49,050
I'm your fan.

436
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,420
Keep up your good work.

437
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:58,200
What was that?

438
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:00,710
That was odd.

439
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:01,940
Yeon-seo!

440
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:06,260
Why did you run over?

441
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,620
Why won't you listen to me?

442
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,910
I thought my heart was going to stop!

443
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,580
I just came to work.

444
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:13,300
Why would that make your heart stop?

445
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,790
I asked you. I pleaded with you.

446
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,900
I told you to take a few days off.
Why did you...

447
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:20,030
You should have told me
if you were going to leave.

448
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,260
Why did you come here alone?

449
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,490
Because you're like this.

450
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,960
I knew you wouldn't let me go,
so how could I?

451
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,630
I was going to call you.

452
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,080
But I didn't have a phone, so...

453
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,460
Right, did you find my phone?

454
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,470
I did.

455
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:39,830
But it's all broken.
You should just get a new one.

456
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,070
And?

457
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:44,180
You threw it out?

458
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:45,810
On your call?

459
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:48,060
No, I didn't.

460
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,770
You're unbelievable.

461
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:52,810
How come you're doing things as you want?

462
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,170
Even if we're...

463
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:57,430
in such a relationship,

464
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,160
I'm not yours.
You have no right to do that.

465
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:01,340
I know. I do know.

466
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:02,800
You're really weird.

467
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,700
You've been treating me
like a three-year-old baby

468
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:08,429
who is trying to walk on a tightrope.

469
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,230
And you're being angry at me.

470
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:14,150
You should go.

471
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,480
Hey, Kim Dan.

472
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:18,460
What's wrong?

473
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:21,449
Did I do something wrong?

474
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:28,710
It's not you.

475
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,560
I'm not angry at you.

476
00:34:30,909 --> 00:34:32,100
I'm angry at myself.

477
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,170
Come here after work. I'll wait for you.

478
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:40,060
Don't go home alone.

479
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:41,739
I'll meet you here.

480
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:43,139
Okay?

481
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:55,199
What was that?

482
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,480
It was you people, wasn't it?

483
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,860
What did you do to Yeon-seo?

484
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,910
She just thinks she collapsed that day.

485
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:13,680
You messed with her memory?

486
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:15,750
It already happened,
and it was horrendous.

487
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:16,980
So...

488
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,880
you should be careful too.

489
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,130
This is why I hate it.

490
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:24,060
Something awful always happens

491
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:25,950
when you get involved with an angel.

492
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,470
-Watch your mouth.
-You should have left when I told you.

493
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:35,720
That senior or deity of yours is
messing with things

494
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:37,610
because you've been lurking around her.

495
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,730
Why do you despise angels so much?

496
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:41,130
What did you go through?

497
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,430
Fantasia is like

498
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:50,150
a lion's den to Yeon-seo.

499
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:52,620
So please look after her

500
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,550
when I'm not around.

501
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,050
Who are you to ask me that?

502
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,240
I'll take care of it myself.

503
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:28,650
I'm not putting this on.

504
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:33,270
I'm not playing Myrtha.

505
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:35,120
No, I can't.

506
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,170
Soo-ji is Bathilde. Jung-eun is Mom.

507
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,280
Woo-jin is Hilarion. Yi-geon is Albrecht.

508
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:43,350
Ni-na is Myrtha.

509
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,150
Didn't you see the cast announcement?

510
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,570
I don't want to play another role.

511
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,350
-What do you mean?
-I want to do Giselle's dance.

512
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:53,070
So I will not take on any other roles.

513
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:54,570
I will practice the same dance

514
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,430
that Yeon-seo dances as her understudy.

515
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,120
Myrtha will perform on stage.

516
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,050
But if you choose to be
Giselle's understudy,

517
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,420
you may not end up performing.

518
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:08,520
And you're okay with that?

519
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,410
Yes.

520
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,360
There can be only one Giselle
for the 2019 performance

521
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:14,990
for Fantasia.

522
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:27,530
Ni-na.

523
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:31,930
What are you thinking?

524
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,910
It's exactly what I just said.

525
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:40,640
During the audition, I truly...

526
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:43,370
I truly felt like I was Giselle.

527
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:45,350
I've never felt that way before.

528
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,150
It was as if I came out of my shell.

529
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,450
Yet, you still won't choose me

530
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:53,000
even though I was
the Giselle you dreamed of.

531
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:55,110
I'm still not good enough.

532
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:59,510
I'm going to accept that.

533
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,140
Even if you're not Giselle,

534
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:04,570
there are many people
who are waiting to watch your dance.

535
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,200
You should be Myrtha.

536
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:07,650
(Don't be fooled.)

537
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,990
I bet he'll offer a different role.

538
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,450
But you should not accept it.

539
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:15,880
If I don't,
I won't be able to dance on stage.

540
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:18,830
You never know who'll be on stage
even during the final rehearsals.

541
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,080
Insist on Giselle no matter what.

542
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,270
Okay?

543
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:27,010
No. I want to appear on stage

544
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,120
as Giselle.

545
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,200
If you saw someone,
you should greet them first.

546
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:06,740
Only when they deserve it.

547
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,470
I'll show you respect

548
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,890
only if you start acting
like a human being.

549
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:13,870
What are you saying?

550
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,400
Are you saying that I'm not a human being?

551
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,840
Hey! Where are you going?

552
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:41,680
Ru-na, what are you trying to do?

553
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,910
(It's him. I need to catch him.)

554
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,940
What's wrong with you?

555
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:28,720
It's you, right?
Don't you know Lee Yeon-seo?

556
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:30,920
What are you talking about? She is...

557
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:32,980
She's a ballerina here.

558
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:34,000
Don't feign ignorance.

559
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,890
Both on that ship and during the audition,

560
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,160
you were targeting her.

561
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,230
Who sent you? Who gave you the orders?

562
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,040
Seriously, what's wrong with you?

563
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:44,200
My gosh. What's going on?

564
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,400
Joon-soo... Joon-soo, is that you?

565
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:47,550
Sir.

566
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,260
Get off me.

567
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:53,580
What's going on?

568
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:58,990
Goodness.

569
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,890
So you're saying, he attacked you

570
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,780
because he thought you were a bad guy?

571
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:05,680
He started following me all of a sudden.

572
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,740
I got scared.

573
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:09,640
That's why I ran.

574
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,530
Where were you
from 4:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m.

575
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,800
on the day of the audition?

576
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:16,630
He was working with me.

577
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,270
He wanted to switch shifts with us.

578
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,580
Joon-soo is an angel.

579
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:26,930
Hey, dig in.

580
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:28,470
Are you happy now?

581
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,310
I'm sorry.

582
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,250
It's okay. I understand.

583
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:39,200
I do hope you catch the bad guy though.

584
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,430
I'm really sorry.

585
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:44,890
Have you gone insane? Why are you here?

586
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:46,960
Yeon-seo is practicing right now.

587
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:49,160
I know. That's why I'm here.

588
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,750
I'll have to show myself to her

589
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:53,120
to find out if she's pretending
or not pretending

590
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:54,970
to remember me.

591
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,380
What if you get caught?

592
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:57,480
Then I'll tell them

593
00:42:57,610 --> 00:42:59,190
that I did everything single-handedly.

594
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,250
Joon-soo.

595
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:03,150
I won't let you end up
behind bars ever again.

596
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:09,450
Anyway, since we know for sure now

597
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:11,510
that Yeon-seo doesn't recognize you,

598
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:14,730
don't act rashly. Act normally.

599
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:15,910
Yes, ma'am.

600
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,680
Hello, I'm on my way.
It'll take 30 minutes.

601
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,710
I'm only going to look for props.

602
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:40,330
Okay, I'll see you later.

603
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:03,430
What are you doing?

604
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,660
Since when?

605
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:10,910
Since when were you scheming
to harm Yeon-seo?

606
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:13,330
What are you talking about?

607
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:17,120
Yeon-seo is dancing
in the practice room right now.

608
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:19,410
So you'll feign innocence?

609
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:23,540
What's gotten into you?
Are you as deluded as she is?

610
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:25,210
You're the one who's deluded.

611
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:27,150
You believe you can deceive everyone.

612
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,830
You believe you'll be happy
if you get what you want

613
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,610
even if it's through evil means.

614
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:35,030
Now, I've finally realized

615
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:38,410
that heinous soul
behind that beautiful shell of yours.

616
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:40,740
So...

617
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,460
You'll never be able

618
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:51,960
to harm Yeon-seo again.

619
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,470
Not on my watch.

620
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:12,780
-I'll see you tomorrow!
-Bye!

621
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:27,250
He told me not to be alone.

622
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:29,140
Where is he?

623
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:34,470
Kim Dan.

624
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:37,110
Come out, Kim Dan.

625
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:39,310
Come out.

626
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:55,100
What's with his face?

627
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:57,740
Is he still upset?

628
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:09,180
Stop. People might see us.

629
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:10,680
I'm going to protect you.

630
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,240
You'll never be alone ever again.

631
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,900
I'm really fine.

632
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,210
You should have told me
if you were going to leave.

633
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,480
Why did you come here alone?

634
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:00,140
There must be

635
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,660
something going on. I'm sure of it.

636
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,670
(Report)

637
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:24,830
(Angel Kim Dan will be back to work
from his vacation.)

638
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:30,330
(I wanted to tell her I was an angel.)

639
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:33,460
(And she almost found out
that I was an angel.)

640
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:35,390
(However,)

641
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:37,950
(everything stemmed from my greed.)

642
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:40,320
(Perhaps,)

643
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:43,050
(I might fail my mission.)

644
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,890
(I might turn into dust.)

645
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:52,510
(However,)

646
00:48:53,390 --> 00:48:55,150
(before that happens,)

647
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:58,980
(please allow me to keep my promise)

648
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:00,740
(that I'll protect her.)

649
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:14,420
So when you followed the suspicious man,

650
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:16,400
you saw him meeting
with Associate Director Geum?

651
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,790
I'm not certain if he kidnapped Yeon-seo
two days ago,

652
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:22,030
but my suspicion of him won't go away,

653
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:23,440
so I decided to tell you.

654
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:26,130
But why would she do that?

655
00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:27,800
Why not General Director Choi or Ni-na?

656
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:30,880
Evil behavior

657
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:33,830
doesn't need a good reason.

658
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:37,390
Ji-woong has to confirm to this.

659
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,940
Gosh, I'm so stupid.

660
00:49:40,290 --> 00:49:42,140
I should've gotten the files
the other day.

661
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:45,750
-Who?
-This guy vanished into thin air.

662
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:52,440
Yes?

663
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,680
This is Jung Yu-mi.

664
00:49:57,940 --> 00:49:58,910
What?

665
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:02,120
I'll be right there.

666
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:05,950
What is this about?

667
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:07,350
Please look after her.

668
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:13,950
(Thank you for identifying his body.)

669
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:15,450
(We didn't find any belongings)

670
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:16,950
(and thought this would take a while,)

671
00:50:17,030 --> 00:50:20,250
(but luckily, we found
your business card in his pocket.)

672
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:23,020
(The autopsy results showed
that he had terminal cancer.)

673
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:26,230
(We'll close the case as suicide
to an unhappy life.)

674
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:46,210
I'm here. What is it?

675
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:47,970
Are you sick? Do you need anything?

676
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:53,160
Can you clean my practice room for me?

677
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:55,450
I'm going to practice all day today
at home,

678
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:57,070
but I hate it when it's dirty.

679
00:50:58,170 --> 00:50:59,540
I'm sure your housekeeper did it.

680
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:00,680
Can you do it?

681
00:51:01,030 --> 00:51:02,400
That will help me feel at ease.

682
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:04,600
You'll do it, right?

683
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:08,380
Yes.

684
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:44,420
If you're not telling me what it is,

685
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:45,780
you must have a reason for it.

686
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,580
Then, I'm going to find out that reason.

687
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,310
He didn't throw it out.

688
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:22,740
Is it completely broken?

689
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:30,660
(Slide to unlock the phone.)

690
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:46,680
It's all done.

691
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:51,780
Do you need gloves? Do you want to check?

692
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:00,670
What's going on?

693
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:02,340
You don't...

694
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:06,780
truly love me.

695
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,880
What's gotten into you all of a sudden?

696
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:11,890
I...

697
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:14,530
I trusted you to the end.

698
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:16,860
And I wanted to trust you.

699
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:21,570
Can you explain it?

700
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:23,370
That way, I can at least give you
an explanation.

701
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:24,430
I don't need it.

702
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,460
Why would I do that
when you won't do the same for me?

703
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:31,340
Don't even talk to me.

704
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:33,980
Hey, hey. Yeon-seo!

705
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:36,660
(Ji Kang-woo)

706
00:53:38,070 --> 00:53:39,120
I'm busy. We can talk later.

707
00:53:39,210 --> 00:53:40,310
(I'm in front of the house.)

708
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:48,850
Why are you here?

709
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:51,180
I told you to tell Yeon-seo that I'm here.

710
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:52,280
I need to talk to you.

711
00:53:55,490 --> 00:53:56,900
I think Associate Director Geum is

712
00:53:57,870 --> 00:53:59,670
after Yeon-seo.

713
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:01,830
I knew it.

714
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:04,160
-What?
-I mean,

715
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,100
I suspected that it was her.

716
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:07,810
But why didn't you tell me?

717
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,850
What can you do?

718
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:12,870
How much time do you have left?

719
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:14,940
Two weeks? One month?

720
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:16,920
You'll only stay here for a few days

721
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:18,060
and go back to your realm.

722
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:20,260
On top of that, you're an angel.

723
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:23,780
If necessary, I can even kill those people

724
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:25,500
for Yeon-seo.

725
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:28,490
You cannot...

726
00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:31,170
repay evil with evil.

727
00:54:31,390 --> 00:54:33,020
That only applies to angels like you.

728
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:34,390
A human like myself

729
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:37,290
isn't afraid of His judgment anymore.

730
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:38,610
You're not...

731
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:41,250
afraid of it anymore?

732
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:42,480
There was

733
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:45,740
a young angel who thought he was special

734
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,320
just like you.

735
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:50,050
I knew it. You were him.

736
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:53,790
The young angel.

737
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:55,370
What matters now are the present

738
00:54:56,030 --> 00:55:00,300
and the man who will stay
by Yeon-seo's side to the end.

739
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:02,330
When did you turn into a human?

740
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:06,070
No. How did you become a human?

741
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:07,910
No.

742
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:09,720
Can an angel...

743
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:12,490
turn into a human being?

744
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:17,510
Answer me now.

745
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,490
What are you talking about...

746
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:23,620
without me?

747
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:27,450
I asked him to call you.

748
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:29,470
I can only contact you
through your secretary.

749
00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:34,310
I told him to go back.

750
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:36,290
You guys have nothing to say.

751
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:37,260
Let's go.

752
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:39,550
I need to talk to Director Ji.

753
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:42,810
Let me come with you.

754
00:55:42,890 --> 00:55:43,950
Stay at home.

755
00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:45,310
Why?

756
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:53,670
I have a secret just like you.

757
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:12,420
Darn it.

758
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:20,650
(Director Ji, I'm sorry.
I feel too burdened)

759
00:56:20,730 --> 00:56:22,540
I've never sent that text message.

760
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:25,270
But you received that message from me.

761
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:31,030
I thought that you probably
didn't mean it.

762
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:32,660
Don't lie.

763
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:36,310
In hindsight, everything is odd.

764
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:37,450
I'm not the type

765
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:41,990
to easily faint
just because I started to practice again.

766
00:56:42,290 --> 00:56:43,880
I hate how you and Kim Dan are whispering

767
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:45,020
to each other without me.

768
00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:46,870
Tell me everything you know.

769
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:48,670
Do you remember

770
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:52,060
my friend I placed at the temple?

771
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:54,310
She died

772
00:56:54,970 --> 00:56:56,020
right in front of me.

773
00:56:58,440 --> 00:56:59,450
And...

774
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:07,510
This is the photo I took with her.

775
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:17,710
You two look alike.

776
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:19,960
The resemblance is uncanny.

777
00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:23,960
Is this why...

778
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:26,950
you insisted on working with me?

779
00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:30,250
Director Ji,

780
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:32,630
I'm not her.

781
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:33,730
I know.

782
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:34,830
At first,

783
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:38,260
I thought you were her replacement.

784
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:39,840
But not anymore.

785
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,220
I love Lee Yeon-seo's dance.

786
00:57:42,310 --> 00:57:43,850
And I love you as a person,

787
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:46,490
Yeon-seo.

788
00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:50,840
You asked me to tell you
what happened that night.

789
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:52,520
But I cannot tell you.

790
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:54,410
I will take care of it
without you knowing,

791
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:57,580
and I don't want you
to remember a tormenting memory.

792
00:57:58,320 --> 00:57:59,290
A tormenting...

793
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,450
memory?

794
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:04,660
And above all,
I don't want to lose you again...

795
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:07,480
like that time.

796
00:58:15,310 --> 00:58:18,390
An angel became human.

797
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:23,450
An angel fell in love

798
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:26,130
and became human.

799
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:31,320
(The moment she knows
that you're an angel,)

800
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:33,170
(Noisy Gong and you won't be able
to stay together.)

801
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:38,500
If I become human...

802
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:53,100
(Lady Yeon-seo)

803
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:05,730
Hello?

804
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:08,240
It's me. Noisy Gong.

805
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,130
Where are you?
How did you find your phone?

806
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:13,120
I'm at the park where I fainted.

807
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:14,530
All alone? Where is Ji Kang-woo?

808
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:16,860
No one would tell me what happened,
so I just came here

809
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:18,800
thinking I might remember something.

810
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:21,920
I'll come over. Stay right there.

811
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:23,550
Let me ask you one last time.

812
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:26,760
Do you

813
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:29,760
really have nothing to say to me?

814
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:36,530
I'll tell you when I get there. No.

815
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:39,480
Let's keep talking on the phone
until I get there.

816
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:40,580
It's too late.

817
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:43,090
I said it was the last time.

818
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:47,310
Yeon-seo. Yeon-seo!

819
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:07,950
Yeon-seo!

820
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,630
May I ask you something?

821
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:23,610
Sure. Do you want something?

822
01:00:24,010 --> 01:00:26,340
Do you remember the guy who bought
a red balloon here

823
01:00:26,430 --> 01:00:27,620
a couple of days ago?

824
01:00:31,930 --> 01:00:32,890
It's this guy.

825
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:36,020
Oh, this man.

826
01:00:36,330 --> 01:00:38,440
He bought an umbrella and a balloon.

827
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:41,390
Yes, that's him. What happened after that?

828
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:43,720
He ran around everywhere screaming

829
01:00:43,810 --> 01:00:47,150
that his girlfriend suddenly went missing.

830
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:49,000
I wonder if he found her.

831
01:00:49,830 --> 01:00:50,850
He said...

832
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:53,490
she went missing?

833
01:01:24,510 --> 01:01:26,000
Yeon-seo, are you okay?

834
01:01:26,570 --> 01:01:28,820
Don't go around alone.
If anything, be with Ji Kang-woo.

835
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:30,360
Do you know how much I was worried?

836
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:35,550
Are you...

837
01:01:37,050 --> 01:01:38,100
I'll tell you everything.

838
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:40,130
I didn't want to surprise you.

839
01:01:42,330 --> 01:01:43,380
Kim Dan.

840
01:01:46,990 --> 01:01:48,050
Are you...

841
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:51,350
an angel?

842
01:01:58,170 --> 01:01:59,400
Answer me.

843
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,550
You can't lie.

844
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:11,630
You don't truly love me.

845
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:13,570
(The moment she knows
that you're an angel,)

846
01:02:13,650 --> 01:02:15,550
you and Noisy Gong won't be able
to stay together.

847
01:02:15,810 --> 01:02:16,780
I...

848
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:20,030
trusted you to the end.

849
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:21,930
And I wanted to trust you.

850
01:02:28,570 --> 01:02:29,540
Yes.

851
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:33,810
I'm an angel.

852
01:03:07,110 --> 01:03:10,630
(Angel's Last Mission: Love)

853
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:13,980
Do you want me to stay with you tonight?

854
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,370
Pseudo-religious con artists.

855
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:18,470
That was humiliating.

856
01:03:18,550 --> 01:03:20,750
I came to tell you to stop fooling me.
Got it?

857
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:21,810
-Yes, we got it.
-Yes.

858
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:25,510
I mean, shouldn't she thank me first?

859
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:27,930
I'll make sure
those who hurt you get punished.

860
01:03:29,070 --> 01:03:30,040
I promise.

861
01:03:30,130 --> 01:03:32,630
(What do I need to do to become a human?)

862
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,220
The deity is very jealous.

863
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:36,640
Kim Dan will dissipate.

864
01:03:37,650 --> 01:03:39,010
(Because he loves you.)
