1
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,350
Are you all right?

2
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,190
One moment.

3
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,120
What was that sound?

4
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,830
Are you hurt?

5
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,129
Your face is

6
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,400
red.

7
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,080
Are you feverish?

8
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,000
What

9
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:24,980
are these?

10
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:29,600
What are these?

11
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,100
Wings.

12
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,229
Are you...

13
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,390
Are you really...

14
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,250
Don't come near me.

15
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:53,800
You'll get hurt.

16
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,000
I really can't believe this.

17
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,300
I can explain.

18
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:08,900
- Don't be alarmed. / - Forget it.

19
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:11,320
There's no pervert who can explain his perverseness.

20
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,030
- What? / - You ignored my call

21
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,350
and the pager.

22
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,120
It's because you had these things on.

23
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,540
I didn't put on anything...

24
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,240
Please excuse me, then.

25
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,220
Take these off right now.

26
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,550
Take these off.

27
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,660
Take these off while I'm watching, now.

28
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,020
Let me go!

29
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,090
Take these off!

30
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,590
What are you doing?

31
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,260
Let me go! Let me go!

32
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,420
Hey. I said, take it off!

33
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,410
I can only take it off if you let me go!

34
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,610
I can only take it off if you stay still.

35
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:51,930
It's unsightly and disgusting.

36
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,200
I'm going to burn it.

37
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,990
"Unsightly"? Hey, how could you say that?

38
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,260
Have you ever seen

39
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,540
such big, brilliant, and beautiful wings?

40
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,680
Did you...

41
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:02,840
just talk rudely to me?

42
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,030
If you can, then I can.

43
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,580
Wake up. I hired you.

44
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,560
You know nothing else except employing,

45
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,450
contracts, and hierarchies.

46
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:13,000
You're so ignorant to notice what's beautiful.

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,980
- Are you done talking? / - No, not yet!

48
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,310
These wings don't deserve to be called unsightly

49
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,160
by someone who is dead inside, you noisy gong!

50
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,410
You're the one who's unsightly!

51
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,450
Right.

52
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:05,580
It is all the same to humans whether it is

53
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,050
an angel, monster, or pervert.

54
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,610
Lee Yeonseo!

55
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,590
Gosh!

56
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,100
Hold on!

57
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,430
Hey! Call the police!

58
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,880
Gosh. Ms. Lee.

59
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,990
It was him! Call the police!

60
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,140
What are you talking about?

61
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,770
Ms. Lee, I just came...

62
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,880
- Gosh! Hurry up! / - Gosh.

63
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,520
- What? / - What?

64
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:03,710
You're not going to get down?

65
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,700
You little punk.

66
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:10,880
Tell me.

67
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,420
Who are you?

68
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,310
I'm Ji Kangwoo, okay?

69
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,170
I'm the art director of Fantasia.

70
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,800
It's me, Ji Kangwoo.

71
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,700
You're Ji Kangwoo

72
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,220
from the ballet theatre in New York?

73
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,360
(Ji Kangwoo)

74
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,810
(Art director of Fantasia)

75
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,250
You're not going to report this?

76
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,700
I'll take care of it.

77
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:41,020
You may go.

78
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,950
Then let me.

79
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,320
Don't taint the crime scene.

80
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,460
Look here, Mr. Ji Kangwoo.

81
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,050
This is my house.

82
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,890
I have full authority over what goes on in here.

83
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,280
What are you afraid of?

84
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,530
I'm not afraid. I just can't be bothered.

85
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,430
People around me are eager to talk about me.

86
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,690
Anyway, just leave.

87
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,180
Let me help you.

88
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,310
Leaving when I tell you to

89
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,200
is how you can help me.

90
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,440
Ms. Lee.

91
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,110
Are you deaf?

92
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,710
She wants you to leave.

93
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,960
If you were mistaken, you should apologize

94
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,120
and ask for forgiveness, okay?

95
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,220
Mr. Secretary.

96
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,860
You were standing there, looking so suspicious.

97
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,350
Still, that doesn't give you the right

98
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,580
to attack me like that.

99
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,220
Well, you collapsed like a paper doll,

100
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,560
so I was flustered, indeed.

101
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,330
I had no idea

102
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,010
you'd attack me out of the blue.

103
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,900
I'm a man of common sense, you see.

104
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,190
Are you telling me you'd have won

105
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,080
if you had been prepared for it?

106
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,220
Were you with him

107
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,680
when the window broke?

108
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:59,380
No.

109
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,030
- But... / - To break that window,

110
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,840
you'd have to be out at the garden.

111
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,240
It's not an outsider's doing.

112
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,440
Hey.

113
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,250
You were out there, weren't you?

114
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,180
Who do you think

115
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,030
is the most suspicious?

116
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,090
You fool. How dare you falsely blame me for this?

117
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,680
You must be upset over what happened.

118
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,820
Let's fight fair and square this time.

119
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,620
Come at me. Come on!

120
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,300
- You little... / - Enough.

121
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,120
Don't make me repeat myself again.

122
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,530
Leave.

123
00:07:42,409 --> 00:07:43,780
And I'm warning you.

124
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,840
You'd better not babble about what happened

125
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,909
to the people at Fantasia.

126
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,830
Forget it. You're noisy.

127
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,210
The door is

128
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,290
- over there. / - I know.

129
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,800
What are you afraid of?

130
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:40,360
Are you all right?

131
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,220
Is he in a cult?

132
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,420
He's a pervert and a lunatic.

133
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:52,990
Gosh, that hurts.

134
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,740
Why are you standing here?

135
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,720
Why are you coming out?

136
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,230
Drink this. It's chamomile tea.

137
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,830
I know you drink this when you can't sleep.

138
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:42,970
I read it.

139
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,360
You were startled back there.

140
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,730
Who was?

141
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,760
Me? No, I wasn't.

142
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:01,190
Why do humans lie?

143
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,740
"I'm afraid. I'm nervous."

144
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,930
"I need you."

145
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,920
Saying such things won't do you any harm.

146
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,150
Drink this and sleep.

147
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,670
I'll be here until morning.

148
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,610
Just in case.

149
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,700
Don't overreact.

150
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:40,870
Apply this.

151
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,850
Don't show up late because of your wound.

152
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,940
Gosh. That noisy gong.

153
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,910
I'd like some information about her new secretary.

154
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,690
His past, present, and work history. Everything.

155
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,880
What's going on in that house?

156
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,780
Hello.

157
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,900
Do you live in this neighborhood?

158
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,490
What a coincidence.

159
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,790
There's a great dumpling joint nearby,

160
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,980
so I came here to buy dumplings.

161
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,090
Yet, I don't see anything in your hands.

162
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,120
I was on my way to buy them now.

163
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,050
Okay then. Bye.

164
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:09,860
Bye.

165
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:16,280
Nina.

166
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,030
Did you have dinner?

167
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,400
Why did you wait for me?

168
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,180
I told you that was a coincidence.

169
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,680
Is it that hard for you to trust people?

170
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,440
There are no dumpling joints nearby.

171
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,720
People

172
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:45,140
are not to be trusted that easily.

173
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:46,860
Why not?

174
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:49,280
Because they are weak.

175
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:53,330
Valuable people die too quickly.

176
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,760
Those selfish liars live very long lives.

177
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,210
They betray

178
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,710
and commit evil deeds.

179
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:01,950
I don't trust anyone.

180
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:06,350
Some people deceive and betray others,

181
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,760
but I'm sure

182
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,740
1 out of 100 people won't do that.

183
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,680
I want to trust people recklessly

184
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,000
and continue to do so.

185
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,370
And I also want

186
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,570
to be someone you can trust.

187
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,700
You're naive.

188
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,980
Yeonseo wasn't.

189
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,990
Have you met Yeonseo?

190
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:33,280
That's great.

191
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,910
The three of us should meet together.

192
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:37,020
Yeonseo will start practicing soon.

193
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,780
We should help her a lot.

194
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,380
You don't need to lie to me.

195
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,970
I'm sick of hypocrisy and pretense.

196
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,300
Why do you assume that I wasn't being sincere?

197
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,720
When I went to Russia to study abroad,

198
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,190
I couldn't wait to wake up in the morning

199
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:54,750
because I could see Yeonseo's dance.

200
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:58,230
She was the living proof that the deity existed.

201
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,740
The deity molded her body with the utmost care.

202
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,290
He gave her a lot of talents.

203
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,410
My heart was full.

204
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,450
If Yeonseo can dance like before,

205
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,230
I'm ready to become her understudy.

206
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,180
That's how I truly feel.

207
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,900
Then why did you come to me?

208
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,180
I thought you came to complain

209
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,680
about not being the lead.

210
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,060
I told you it was a coincidence.

211
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,260
I should go to the restroom.

212
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,490
What are you doing?

213
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,480
If you keep doing this...

214
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,360
You can't...

215
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,690
Luckily,

216
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,930
your salivary gland isn't swollen yet.

217
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,510
Geum Nina.

218
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:15,970
You just threw up, didn't you?

219
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,790
It was indigestion.

220
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:28,120
It was just this once. I would never...

221
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,100
You said you wanted

222
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,520
to become a ballerina I could trust.

223
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:34,810
You eat and throw up.

224
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:36,130
And you overeat again.

225
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,630
I've seen many ballerinas whose careers were over

226
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,040
because of anorexia.

227
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,270
I'm sorry.

228
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,340
Please keep this a secret to my family.

229
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,150
Especially to my sister.

230
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,870
She'll blame herself and be really upset.

231
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,600
It's all my fault, so you can be angry at me.

232
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,420
You should care about yourself first.

233
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,030
Should I tell you how to become a good ballerina?

234
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,210
Be selfish.

235
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,720
Put yourself...

236
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,210
first before anyone else.

237
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,310
Is he sleeping?

238
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:49,740
Young Lady.

239
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,310
You're up, right?

240
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,780
Can you tell me again

241
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,850
what you told me on the phone earlier?

242
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,690
You saw the living room on your way up here.

243
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,320
That's why I'm asking.

244
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,600
Last night,

245
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,240
someone broke the window in the living room.

246
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,950
And the chandelier fell too.

247
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,230
Did you have a nightmare?

248
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,170
I almost died!

249
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,500
It must've been so vivid.

250
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,480
I have a witness. Kim Dan.

251
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,500
Where did he go?

252
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,820
Kim Dan!

253
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,290
Nothing happened to the lights and windows, right?

254
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:23,130
- Nothing happened. / - No, nothing.

255
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,810
- Okay. / - What's going on?

256
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,540
You're all here way before your attendance time.

257
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:33,830
Are you plotting something?

258
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:38,620
I called them to clean up before everyone came.

259
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,820
We worked so hard since dawn, you know.

260
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,370
Hey, watch your language.

261
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,310
Let me drop the honorifics since I already did.

262
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,470
My contract didn't say that I couldn't.

263
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,580
The three of them were in charge of the lights,

264
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,340
the garden, and security last night.

265
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,190
- So I was... / - This worked out well.

266
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:01,460
Actually, it turns out I had a question for them.

267
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,600
Who did it?

268
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,420
I asked them, but the lights and the windows

269
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,150
were fine until they got off work.

270
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,310
When everyone went home, the security guy left too.

271
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:20,070
If you tell me who was behind this,

272
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,390
I will forgive you.

273
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,840
I think it was an accident.

274
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,120
Or I'll fire you, sue you for compensation,

275
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,570
have you arrested, and make you stand trial.

276
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,150
And I won't stop until the end.

277
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:30,190
Look at this. I organized this chronologically.

278
00:19:30,190 --> 00:19:31,550
I didn't find a rock or anything

279
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,400
that could be used to break the window.

280
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,780
It's an accident. A pure accident.

281
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,100
You're a true detective.

282
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,030
What about the chandelier?

283
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:40,920
Why did that fall all of a sudden?

284
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,210
Did the termites nibble on it?

285
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,160
Why don't we talk?

286
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,620
Did I have a nightmare?

287
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,340
You think I'm delusional?

288
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,520
If you confess,

289
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,540
I will only fire you.

290
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,840
One, two...

291
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,080
Darn it!

292
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:03,580
I can't do this.

293
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:04,820
No, I won't work for you.

294
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,020
Do you think you're a royal princess?

295
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,290
Go on.

296
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,270
It made me wonder how bad you could be

297
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,590
when I heard the pay was double.

298
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:14,280
Paying me 20 times more won't be enough.

299
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:15,550
You're still wet behind the ears.

300
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,830
You throw a fit, threaten,

301
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,590
and treat us like criminals.

302
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,950
I've had enough of this!

303
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,060
Let's leave this place.

304
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,250
- Hold on. / - Let's go!

305
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,060
- Wait. Hold on. / - Gosh...

306
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,110
Wait, wait.

307
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,120
- Darn it. / - No, no.

308
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,100
- No, no. / - Wait.

309
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,620
People already call this place the Fiery Pit.

310
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:38,430
Ms. Jung, contact the security company.

311
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,900
Bring me all the footage up to three days ago.

312
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,120
What is this?

313
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:56,030
(External Input)

314
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:08,840
Excuse me.

315
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,660
Show me the footage from last night.

316
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,420
It was around the sunset.

317
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,750
- Start around 6:00 p.m. / - Okay, ma'am.

318
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,060
No.

319
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,240
What's going on?

320
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,450
Why isn't this working?

321
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,630
My gosh, this isn't working.

322
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,080
When it rained last night,

323
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,060
something must've gone wrong with the lines.

324
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,260
All the footage up to midnight is ruined.

325
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,450
Can't you restore them?

326
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:06,920
It wasn't recorded properly.

327
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,410
I don't think it's possible.

328
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,080
I'm sorry.

329
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:12,900
Okay.

330
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,540
She's not looking, right?

331
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,530
What are you doing?

332
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:26,850
I should ask you that.

333
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:28,470
Are you trying to promote our world to humans?

334
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:30,190
My wings just came out on their own!

335
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,200
Wings?

336
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,840
My gosh, you're driving me crazy.

337
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:37,540
It's the rain, isn't it?

338
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,780
I think that's the only way.

339
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,790
Anyway, but why?

340
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:43,040
She recognized you before you became a human

341
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,190
- on a rainy day. / - She did.

342
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:47,260
And you saved her from death on a rainy day too.

343
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,560
Wow, that's so mean.

344
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,230
You have 94 days left.

345
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,910
Humans have a life span,

346
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,970
and we have deadlines.

347
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,550
We just have to love the deity, and that's it.

348
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,910
But humans...

349
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,550
I especially have no idea what Lee Yeonseo is like.

350
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,310
I don't know if she ever liked anyone

351
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,590
or if there is someone

352
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,700
who makes her happy just with the thought of them.

353
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,950
"The bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh."

354
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:16,350
You should first look for her rib.

355
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,370
Isn't it the other way? It's the guy's rib that...

356
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:20,440
Come on, stop that. It's the 21st century.

357
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,070
The rib.

358
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,220
Humans call that...

359
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,890
destiny.

360
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,420
Is Ms. Lee in there?

361
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,030
Wait here.

362
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,460
Good work.

363
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:43,800
Yes, okay. Goodbye.

364
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:52,290
- Yes? / - Where are you?

365
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:56,170
I'm on my way in. I just...

366
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,400
Ms. Lee, this is Ji Kangwoo.

367
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,980
I'm in front of your place. I'm coming in now.

368
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,950
Let's go.

369
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:09,760
Will you be okay traveling long-distance?

370
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,090
It's your first time in a car after the accident.

371
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,190
Make sure the employees who got fired today

372
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,600
sign the agreement to keep confidentiality.

373
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,230
And train the employees again.

374
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,290
Gosh, I have a headache.

375
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,400
That's the way of this world.

376
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,890
There are troublemakers,

377
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,700
and there are those who fix things.

378
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:26,570
Do you still think I'm out of my mind?

379
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:29,080
You can't just go in there.

380
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:30,880
Who said that you can come in?

381
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,480
Young Lady.

382
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,630
Who are you?

383
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,190
This is Corporal Ko Seongmin,

384
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,550
a detective of Baegun Police Station.

385
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,570
He called the police?

386
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:44,480
Mr. Ji. What gives you the right to do this?

387
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:45,970
I made myself clear.

388
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:47,510
I didn't file an official report.

389
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,790
Detective Ko is here

390
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,590
because I asked him for a personal favor.

391
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:52,660
Okay, this is all I can do.

392
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:53,940
You can decide to go ahead with

393
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,270
the investigation after the field survey.

394
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,450
If the scene is completely cleaned out,

395
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,690
it must be done by someone who has something to hide.

396
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,300
The culprit.

397
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,400
Gosh, why are there so many of these?

398
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,120
This is what the employees did last night

399
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,970
and the state of the scene yesterday.

400
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,340
According to my investigation,

401
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,180
it looks like a simple accident.

402
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,770
The initial investigation wasn't done right.

403
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:49,600
You trusted everything they said and remembered.

404
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,240
If you make a report, I will investigate.

405
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,960
But there isn't any CCTV footage left,

406
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:56,460
and the evidence of the scene is gone,

407
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,220
so it'll be pretty tough to catch the culprit.

408
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,600
I see.

409
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,370
Thank you.

410
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,350
We will give you a call later.

411
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,050
Please excuse me. Goodbye.

412
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,650
Why aren't you leaving?

413
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,290
I have to talk to you.

414
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:27,660
Please spare me one hour.

415
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,980
I was on my way out.

416
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,120
I have to go somewhere.

417
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,760
Right now? Where?

418
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,390
Get the car.

419
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,630
Not even half an hour?

420
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,390
I'm already running late.

421
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:41,030
Someone who's very rude brought a detective

422
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,530
and wasted my time.

423
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,250
Why are you standing around?

424
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:50,360
I...

425
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,110
I don't know how to drive.

426
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,970
Why don't any of your employees drive?

427
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,600
We could just take a taxi.

428
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,800
Stop talking so much if you have no license.

429
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,540
And why do I have to sit here?

430
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,870
You said you can't let me sit there.

431
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,240
Excuse me, you two. I'm trying to drive.

432
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,400
You're both a bit too loud.

433
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,920
(The late Lee Jinwoong, Na Heesoo, Jo Seunghwan)

434
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,970
(The late Lee Jinwoong, Na Heesoo, Jo Seunghwan)

435
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,890
Mom, Dad, hi.

436
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:11,360
Did you both meet Mr. Jo?

437
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,590
I...

438
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,020
I am...

439
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,360
not sure what's going on.

440
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:26,760
I can see again, but I can't walk.

441
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:29,580
It feels like someone is always

442
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,120
targeting me and watching me.

443
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,850
It would be much better if I was just delusional.

444
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,460
Mr. Jo.

445
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,960
Why do we only realize

446
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,560
a certain moment was the last time

447
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,100
only after it passes by?

448
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,770
It drives me crazy whenever the sun sets.

449
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,040
When you said the sunset was pretty,

450
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:56,590
why didn't I say, "Is that so?"

451
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,190
"How does it look?"

452
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,190
"I actually want to see it very badly too."

453
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:06,140
"I am living this world"

454
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:08,340
"thanks to your descriptions."

455
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:14,810
Why didn't I tell you that?

456
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,260
You're all so mean.

457
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,040
You all left me here alone.

458
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:42,710
I'm sorry

459
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,430
for asking if you got dumped during a sunset.

460
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:46,840
I'm glad you know better now.

461
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,390
Thanks.

462
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,880
I began to have hope in you.

463
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,580
I realized that you can love too.

464
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,440
Love?

465
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,210
Yes.

466
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,280
It makes your heart flutter,

467
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,210
you keep on laughing,

468
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:09,500
and you feel jumpy because you're so happy.

469
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:12,630
Kim Dan, you are on the wrong track.

470
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:16,370
I really don't get your weird taste,

471
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,990
but I don't fire people because of that.

472
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,720
So stop sucking up to me and stop overreacting.

473
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,150
I will

474
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,910
help you.

475
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,690
You can do it.

476
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:42,990
Stop talking nonsense. Who do you think you are?

477
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:45,320
Someone who exists just for you.

478
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,070
Let me be frank.

479
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,890
The goal of my life...

480
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:55,750
is you.

481
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,220
Are you crazy?

482
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:12,250
Oh, gosh, the rain. It's raining.

483
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:14,310
Go bring the umbrella.

484
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:25,450
What was he talking about?

485
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,200
Thank you.

486
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,940
Gosh. What should I do?

487
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:41,290
Why did it have to be rain?

488
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,020
You'll catch a cold.

489
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,820
I was waiting in the car,

490
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,140
and it started to rain.

491
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,200
Let's go.

492
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,600
I'm waiting for Kim Dan.

493
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,170
You two must be very close.

494
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,500
I've never seen a secretary

495
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,560
talk casually to his employer.

496
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:13,010
It just happened that way.

497
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:15,300
In any case, he's good at what he does.

498
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,410
Then we can wait for him together.

499
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,290
It's a waste to wait idly like this.

500
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,000
Do you want to see something fascinating?

501
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:44,640
Sorry?

502
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,800
One minute.

503
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:56,960
You bring that around?

504
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,220
Of course not. I prepared it.

505
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,950
I wanted to show it to you.

506
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,280
You didn't spare me even for 30 minutes.

507
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:21,600
Moscow, 2006.

523

and running in celestial paradise.

00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:55,940
At least we won't be driving in the rain.

532
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:12,260
Ms. Lee.

533
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:14,810
You're okay now. Everything is okay.

534
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:16,310
I'm here, Ms. Lee.

535
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:17,850
You're okay now.

536
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,570

Was it...

540
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:39,060
you

541
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,770
on the day of the accident?

542
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,750
I can finally give this to you.

543
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:05,770
Were you the one...

544
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,810
who called the ambulance...

545
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,820
and held my hand?

546
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,990
Was it you?

547
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,710
Do you finally remember?

548
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,250
Why didn't you tell me from the start?

549
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,380
It wasn't something to boast about.

550
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,890
I'm sorry for startling you guys.

551
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:28,030
I'll drive more carefully.

Thank you for driving all day today.

556
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:06,840
I'm more grateful

557
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:08,950
that you spared some time for me.

558
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,560
Let's go.

559
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:14,190
Wait a minute.

560
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,790
What is that?

561
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:26,770
A bribe.

562
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:29,190
I'd like to get to know your secretary.

563
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,060
I bought one yesterday, but it got ruined.

564
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:36,540
But I can always buy more of them.

565
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,520
Here.

566
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,720
I hope we get to know each other more.

How could I?

570
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:06,190
It's obvious that it happened.

571
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,260
What is it exactly?

572
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:09,850
I heard you drink every day

573
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:11,340
since Mr. Jo passed away.

574
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,320
I keep seeing it in my dreams.

575
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,380
See what?

576
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:17,900
I'm so scared.

577
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,800
Every time there was a suitable donor,

578
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:23,130
there was someone she'd always call first.

579
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,170
And after that call ended, the donation got canceled.

580
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:28,540
I made the call.

581
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,740
I know. General Director Choi probably ordered you.

582
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:35,010
I didn't know you were like this.

583
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:37,870
Look. In order to make a living,

584
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:39,760
I must do what I'm told.

585
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,680
Even so, you'll only end up dirtying

586
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,110
your own hands.

587
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,370
Before she does something worse,

588
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,960
tell her to leave Fantasia

589
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,080
quietly.

590
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:57,890
But... Wait...

591
00:38:58,510 --> 00:38:59,920
I didn't think of it as a big deal.

592
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:04,050
Even North and South Korea argue in words

593
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,470
but never put anything into action.

595
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,320
as if someone had intentionally cut them.

596
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:23,940
I just went to scrap the car

597
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,580
because General Director Choi had told me to.

598
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,140
Are you insane?

599
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,510
How could you quit working at Ivy Mansion?

600
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,340
Did she call the police?

601
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:47,000
What if the CCTV camera caught you?

602
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:48,760
I was afraid the others

603
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:50,520
would spill if we stayed any longer.

604
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:54,080
So...

605
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,290
What about the documents Mr. Jo had gathered?

606
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:00,060
We were told that Ms. Lee had the key

607
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,600
to that room.

608
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,680
You went through all that

609
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,750
only to get fired empty-handed?

610
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:08,070

611

Let me help you

618
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,680
start ballet once again.

619
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,450
No. I did every dance I wanted as a ballerina.

620
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:18,160
And I had all the glory as a ballerina too.

621
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,260
I have no regrets.

622
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:23,140
So stop being adventurous with my body.

623
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,900
You can go higher than this.

624
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,170
And you ought to.

625
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,800

626
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,600
Please trust me this once.

627
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:32,290
Gosh. With what you just said,

628
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:33,830
you became someone I should never trust.

629

677
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:11,010
I think we're being too hard on Yeonseo.

678
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:12,990
After that day at the hospital,

679
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:14,750
I couldn't check on her.

680
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,820
Still, we're family.

681
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:20,420
I've been busy too. I totally forgot too.

682
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:22,180
What should we do?

683
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,100
What can we do?

684
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:28,700
She has hundreds of people working for her.

685
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,950
I'm sure she's eating well and living a good life...

686
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:34,500
No.

687
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:36,620
I'm very worried.

688
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:38,200
Right.

689
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:40,750
We've been too inattentive to her, right?

690
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:56,550
Gureum.

691
00:45:58,180 --> 00:45:59,580
Lee Gureum. Wake up.

692
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,780
Gureum! Gureum.

693
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:04,380
Gureum, Gureum. Wake up. Gureum.

694
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:07,640
Kim Dan, what did you feed Gureum?

695
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:10,450
Gureum. Gureum.

696
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:16,040
It was a small amount. Gureum should be fine.

697
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,760
We'll keep an eye on Gureum for a few days.

698
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,940
Why did you feed Gureum chocolates?

699
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,750
It was probably a piece my employee dropped.

700
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:31,310
Gureum is the only family I have left.

701
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,210
If something happens to Gureum too,

702
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:37,030
I'll really be alone.

703
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,520
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

704
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,010
Can't you stop saying...

705
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,320
I don't want to hear it.

706
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:50,140
But you're not alone.

707
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:52,380
You have me,

708
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:54,140
Ms. Jung,

709
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:55,640
and your employees too.

710
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:57,490
Are you going to stay with me forever?

711
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:59,160
Until I grow old and die?

712
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,630
I thought you existed for me.

713
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,830
You said I was the goal of your life.

714
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:12,100
Yes, that's true. But...

715
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:14,250
Stop it. Be quiet.

716
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:39,200
Here.

717
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:42,150
I only made a copy since I didn't have time.

718
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,290
Gosh, no. This isn't it either.

719
00:47:58,820 --> 00:47:59,830
Get some rest.

720
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:03,090
- Congratulations / - Congratulations

721
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:05,510
- Congratulations / - Congratulations

722
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:08,190
- Congratulations / - Congratulations

723
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:10,880
- On your recovery / - On your recovery

724
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,330
Everyone, this is the best

725
00:48:12,330 --> 00:48:13,830
ballerina in Korea, Lee Yeonseo.

726
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:15,100
I bet you missed her.

727
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,510
- Get that out of my face. / - Can you see her?

728
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:19,190
This is a surprise party we prepared in secret.

729
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:21,310
- She can see again. / - This is fun.

730
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:23,860
- Please give my cousin / - Right?

731
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:27,110
a lot of applause and love.

732
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:30,460
Why is he just standing there?

733
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,450
I told you to stop.

734
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:42,030
The candle...

735
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:44,270
It's out.

736
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:45,370
Who let you in?

737
00:48:45,370 --> 00:48:47,790
Everyone knows we're your family.

738
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:49,330
Honey, Yeonseo is here!

739
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:51,010
Come down quickly.

740
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:52,630
She went upstairs?

741
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:54,920
Who said you could?

742
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:58,790
(Gildam Hospital)

743
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:05,480
I wish I could just burn all of these at once.

744
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,730
That way, it will be simple and easy.

745
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:10,450
The call log. Let me see.

746
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:15,950
Slow down. You'll fall.

747
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,340
You're back, Yeonseo.

748
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,030
My gosh.

749
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:39,050
Nothing's changed around here.

750
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:40,550
You took good care of the house.

751
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:48,210
I heard you still need him to walk.

752
00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:50,710
That's terrible.

753
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:55,770
(Congratulations, Yeonseo)

754
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:07,740
All right. Since everyone is here,

755
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:10,210
let's have a glass of wine to celebrate.

756
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:12,190
Sure. Let's sit.

757
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:13,770
Get out. I'm tired.

758
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:17,290
Yeonseo.

759
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,400
Can't you open up to us just a little bit?

760
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:20,940
We made an effort

761
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:22,000
to celebrate your recovery...

762
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,930
I received these corneas after a man died.

763
00:50:24,370 --> 00:50:26,180
Is that something to celebrate with a party?

764
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:30,270
I prayed for you every day,

765
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:32,820
so we could dance on the stage again.

766
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,930
You were very kind ever since we were kids.

767
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:36,120
Right?

768
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:37,530
You...

769
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:40,870
want to get recognized by everyone except me

770
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:43,070
because you can never beat me except at being nice.

771
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:44,610
I never could.

772
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:49,450
- What? / - Let's make it clear.

773
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:51,520
I could never beat you. That's in the past now.

774
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,850
Three years ago when your eyes were fine.

775
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:02,300
You should leave.

776
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:04,410
I think that's for the best.

777
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:07,230
Sure.

778
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:09,740
Okay.

779
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:11,540
Let's go.

780
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:15,460
Let's go. Let's go, Nina.

781
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:18,800
Come on, let's go.

782
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:29,930
I must be crazy.

783
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,560
Why did I do that?

784
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:33,980
Great job, my girl.

785
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:35,700
Even I felt so relieved.

786
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,050
Let's go. Come on, let's go.

787
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,840
Isn't she your aunt? What's wrong?

788
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,080
Your family came to celebrate with you.

789
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,090
Quiet.

790
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:02,540
- I don't understand... / - Just shut up.

791
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:03,770
Hey, Lee Yeonseo!

792
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:04,820
This is your problem.

793
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:06,230
You get smug easily whenever I'm nice to you.

794
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,640
Don't tell me what to do.

795
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,050
You have no right to do that.

796
00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:10,190
No, I will.

797
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:11,600
Because I'm a human with a conscience

798
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,050
who is very rational.

799
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,940
You shouldn't be like that as a human.

800
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,160
What did I do?

801
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,310
How long will you act rude as you please?

802
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:21,980
Are you a five-year-old? Even a kid can be better.

803
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:23,740
They came to congratulate you.

804
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:26,820
They came wishing you happiness from now on.

805
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:29,330
Do you have to be so rude to them?

806
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:31,530
It's up to me if I want to be rude or mean to them.

807
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,340
You're the one who'll get hurt.

808
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:36,060
Let me make myself clear.

809
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:37,870
You're here in Mr. Jo's place.

810
00:52:38,350 --> 00:52:40,070
Mr. Jo said everything was okay.

811
00:52:40,550 --> 00:52:42,180
I didn't have to do things if I didn't like it.

812
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:44,160
He made things happen when I wanted to do things.

813
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:46,490
I'm Kim Dan.

814
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:48,030
Not that foolish man!

815
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:49,530
What?

816
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,510
It figures.

817
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,710
That nice man didn't do anything wrong.

818
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:54,940
He probably didn't know kindness can be bad

819
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:57,180
for someone who isn't afraid of anything

820
00:52:57,890 --> 00:52:59,820
and gets frustrated when she doesn't get her way.

821
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:03,650
I took you in because I felt bad

822
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:04,970
that you are left all alone in this world.

823
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:06,690
Are you all done?

824
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:08,100
If you can pity me

825
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:09,550
because I am left alone in this world,

826
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:12,060
why are you so mean to the rest of your family?

827
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:13,550
You regret things.

828
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:14,960
Are you going to regret this again

829
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,370
when everyone is gone like your parents and Mr. Jo?

830
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:18,170
What if that was the last time?

831
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,580
What if you can't turn back the time,

832
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:20,900
you foolish gong!

833
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:23,320
Stop it.

834
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:31,590
- You threw this at me? / - I did. So what?

835
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:32,600
You!

836
00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:34,580
You take this too.

837
00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:36,390
You!

838
00:53:40,570 --> 00:53:41,670
My gosh, seriously.

839
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:43,690
Hey.

840
00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:45,940
Stop. Let's stop here.

841
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,250
You little...

842
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:53,640
- Let go of me. / - You let go.

843
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,140
Darn it, man.

844
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:57,160
Hey, wait.

845
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:00,020
You can't let your blood pressure rise.

846
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:01,510
- Drop it on three, okay? / - Okay.

847
00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:03,800
Okay, then. Now, one, two, three.

848
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:08,200
You're fired.

849
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:09,920
Fine, I can't do this anymore either.

850
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:12,380
I'm a fool for seeing hope in you.

851
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:15,370
You're hopeless, useless, and helpless.

852
00:54:15,370 --> 00:54:17,220
You're worse than a gong.

853
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:19,330
How can you be so heartless?

854
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:21,970
My gosh.

855
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:40,580
(Congratulations, Lee Yeonseo)

856
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,490
"Forgive us our trespass,"

857
00:54:43,490 --> 00:54:45,070
"as we forgive"

858
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:51,980
"those who trespass against us..."

859
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:54,220
Darn it! Did I do something wrong?

860
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:55,890
If I'm at fault, just let me know.

861
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:13,140
Why have you forsaken me?

862
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:25,330
(Butler Jung Yumi)

863
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:48,520
Drink up.

864
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,110
When your heart is on fire,

865
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,140
this is the best remedy.

866
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,890
Gosh, that burns.

867
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,250
Can you please

868
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:23,320
bow down before her just this once?

869
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:27,940
Like I said,

870
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:29,220
I didn't do anything wrong.

871
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:34,280
And you know she's a type

872
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:36,570
who wouldn't take me back after she fired me.

873
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:38,280
Why do you keep asking me?

874
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,080
I don't know.

875
00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:46,070
I'm not really sure.

876
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:51,610
She looked comfortable when she was with you.

877
00:56:52,850 --> 00:56:54,830
The last time she bickered

878
00:56:54,830 --> 00:56:57,420
with someone was when she was ten.

879
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,570
Without you, she would have to resort to a stick.

880
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,630
Just this once.

881
00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:10,140
Can you do that?

882
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:15,680
I can't lie.

883
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:17,310
I can't say I'm sorry

884
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:18,450
when I didn't do anything wrong.

885
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:20,080
Never.

886
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:23,380
That's hot.

887
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:30,020
Drink this. It's chamomile tea.

888
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:32,490
I know you drink this when you can't sleep.

889
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:39,180
(Kim Dan)

890
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:43,140
(Kim Dan)

891
00:57:48,330 --> 00:57:49,740
Lee Yeonseo.

892
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:58,050
Lee Yeonseo.

893
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:03,240
Why won't she answer me?

894
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:12,260
Lee Yeonseo

895
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:16,930
can trip over this and fall down.

896
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:23,350
Lee Yeonseo hates these.

897
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:28,760
Why are these so heavy?

898
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:42,180
Lee Yeonseo

899
00:58:42,930 --> 00:58:45,970
might step on this and slip.

900
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:47,860
Go away.

901
00:58:48,170 --> 00:58:50,320
Hey, go away.

902
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:51,690
What are you doing?

903
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:54,460
Hey!

904
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:57,280
There's a rude princess.

905
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:03,170
I forgot to sweep that.

906
00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:04,840
I thought I should clean that.

907
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:06,470
This is my last day here.

908
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:08,230
Give me the access card.

909
00:59:13,690 --> 00:59:14,920
You got hurt.

910
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:20,820
I'm sorry.

911
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:22,530
I said I don't want to hear you say that.

912
00:59:29,790 --> 00:59:32,480
This is me.

913
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:35,120
Think of this as me.

914
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:38,550
You're okay when you're with me.

915
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:40,620
Even without me,

916
00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:42,950
it's as if I am here with you.

917
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:47,790
You can go anywhere if you have this.

918
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:50,520
I'll put a spell on it.

919
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:54,610
Abracadabra.

920
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:58,350
It'll be great if you can

921
00:59:58,790 --> 01:00:00,940
dance again with this on, Lee Yeonseo.

922
01:00:01,910 --> 01:00:05,480
Instead of feeling like someone is targeting you,

923
01:00:06,490 --> 01:00:09,260
I hope you can feel that everyone is amazed

924
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:13,040
with your dance.

925
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:15,820
It feels like someone is always

926
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:17,440
targeting me and watching me.

927
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:20,260
It would be much better if I was just delusional.

928
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,820
You're very cheeky to the very end.

929
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:27,040
Trust me. I'm different.

930
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,530
I mean it.

931
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,390
I hope you can believe what I said.

932
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:34,380
I hope you can feel more grateful

933
01:00:34,690 --> 01:00:36,850
for someone who is more affectionate to you.

934
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:40,630
"Trust me. I'm different."

935
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:41,690
"I mean it."

936
01:00:42,350 --> 01:00:43,670
Those are the cliches.

937
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:45,950
I became an orphan at the age of 17.

938
01:00:45,950 --> 01:00:47,410
I've heard that too many times.

939
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:50,000
The more affectionate you are,

940
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,370
the bigger the reward is.

941
01:00:58,140 --> 01:00:59,150
No.

942
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:01,350
We don't have to do it later.

943
01:01:03,730 --> 01:01:06,150
Do it with me right now. Let's dance.

944
01:01:06,410 --> 01:01:07,600
I'll take this.

945
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:09,270
Hey.

946
01:01:12,930 --> 01:01:14,070
- Okay. / - What's with you?

947
01:01:14,510 --> 01:01:15,570
What's with you?

948
01:02:03,610 --> 01:02:04,630
See?

949
01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:07,660
You're the most beautiful when you dance.

950
01:03:02,350 --> 01:03:05,740
(Angel's Last Mission: Love)

951
01:03:06,230 --> 01:03:08,380
I have to walk without the stick until next week.

952
01:03:08,470 --> 01:03:10,050
I have to walk no matter what happens.

953
01:03:10,410 --> 01:03:12,780
But I have a condition.

954
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:14,190
Here, come to me.

955
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:17,400
Think as if it's just you and me in this world.

956
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:18,370
You con man.

957
01:03:18,370 --> 01:03:21,490
If I must leave, I will, but not like this!

958
01:03:21,930 --> 01:03:23,910
There is no ballerina who has three legs.

959
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,820
You survived from the verge of death.

960
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:28,670
I believe that you will live a new life.

961
01:03:28,670 --> 01:03:30,340
We were going to leave out Lee Yeonseo's name

962
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:32,100
and do a press call for this year's performance.

963
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:35,180
Do not help me, no matter what happens.
