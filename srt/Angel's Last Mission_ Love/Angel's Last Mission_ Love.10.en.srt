1
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,130
You're here.

2
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,950
I'm sorry I'm late.

3
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,870
Is everything finished?

4
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,250
You won't leave again, will you?

5
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:44,170
Why won't you say anything?

6
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,370
Promise me.

7
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,610
I love you.

8
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,160
I love you.

9
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:07,620
Lee Yeon-seo.

10
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,460
What? Why isn't he coming?

11
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,760
-Did you sleep well?
-You're late.

12
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,760
I told you to come within a minute
after I ring the bell.

13
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,240
Stand on the right
and give you my left arm.

14
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:37,910
Right?

15
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,930
Not bad.

16
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,520
I will serve you with my best

17
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,230
as if this is my first time.

18
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,860
-Don't be so cute.
-Fine.

19
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,140
Forget it then.

20
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,190
I never said no.

21
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,940
Do you remember

22
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,490
what happened

23
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,870
last night?

24
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,610
You got your hopes up, didn't you?

25
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,430
Hey, Yeon-seo!

26
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,540
Don't let me catch you.

27
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,130
-No.
-Stop running. You might fall.

28
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,230
If I catch...

29
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,800
If you catch me, then what?

30
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,010
What now? What will you do?

31
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,780
Kim Dan?

32
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,160
Goodness! Ms. Jung!

33
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:07,230
Have you been well?

34
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,160
What happened?

35
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,610
Are you back for good?

36
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,330
Things must have been tough because of me.

37
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,470
I'm sorry.

38
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,690
You've done well until today.

39
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:18,269
You can start commuting as of today.

40
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,100
No wonder.

41
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,690
I thought I heard the door open
last night while I was sleeping,

42
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,940
so I called the security company
to see the CCTV footage.

43
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,130
-No!
-No!

44
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,120
So it was you, Dan.

45
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,320
Young Lady, your friend
and the guy who wanted some time.

46
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,420
Is he back?

47
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,960
What?

48
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,730
Oh, yes. Probably.

49
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,830
I'm not sure.

50
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,510
Tell her not to trust men so much.

51
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,320
A guy who changes his mind often

52
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,310
will definitely turn out to be a bad guy.

53
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,710
I did my best as I waited for you.

54
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:17,050
I ate well and practiced hard too.

55
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,180
Good girl, Yeon-seo.

56
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,430
What were you up to?

57
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,690
Aren't you going to tell me?

58
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,040
Go inside.

59
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,500
They say fickle guys are always bad.

60
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,659
No way. I'm going to stay
by your side from now on.

61
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,380
I decided to do that
as soon as I walked in yesterday.

62
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,020
So what if you stay by my side?

63
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,740
Your heart might be with someone else.

64
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,470
It's not a crime to love a lot,

65
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:50,490
but it's a crime to have too many secrets.

66
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,350
-Who said that?
-Lee Yeon-seo.

67
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:54,940
She's a great person.

68
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,610
Do a great job,

69
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,060
great person.

70
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,920
Are you going to be her rib?

71
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,510
It's none of your business.

72
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:19,270
If I turn into dust or dissipate,

73
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,500
that's for me to deal with.

74
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,420
You'll be very lucky
if you just dissipate.

75
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,710
You can't even imagine
what the punishment is like.

76
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,070
Something horrifying

77
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,870
will happen.

78
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,409
How

79
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,440
do you know that?

80
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,180
There was a young angel

81
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,390
who thought he was special

82
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,110
just like you.

83
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,290
Her rib? Love?

84
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,370
You need to give up.
There won't be a happy ending.

85
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:54,820
One of you

86
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:57,280
will end up living a dreadful life.

87
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,310
So do not throw a stone

88
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,810
into still water to satisfy your desire.

89
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,500
Pretend you're a human,
then disappear quietly.

90
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,280
Desire?

91
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,570
You might be right.

92
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,370
But

93
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,550
I don't want to be a coward.

94
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,870
I want Yeon-seo to know who I am.

95
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,850
It doesn't matter if I'm a human or not,

96
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,830
or if I'm dead or alive.

97
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,470
I want her to know my present and my past,

98
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,140
and love me for who I am.

99
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,990
Don't you feel the same way?

100
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,150
Don't you wish

101
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,100
to be understood?

102
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,790
No, I don't need that.

103
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,690
The moment you tell her,
everything will be over.

104
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,340
Do as you please.

105
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,440
However,

106
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:54,300
keep your mouth shut until the audition.

107
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,620
I was going to do that anyway.

108
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,220
You're not the only one
who cares about her.

109
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,240
So don't try to give me

110
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,220
any advice.

111
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:13,180
By the way, about that young angel...

112
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,600
Why do I feel like it's...

113
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,100
Never mind.

114
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,540
You're nothing but a foolish and weak

115
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,620
human being.

116
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,140
My gosh.

117
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:18,520
Ask your petty deity why I'm like this.

118
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,110
And whether it's Yeon-seo or Kim Dan,

119
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,840
if He wants to ruin my plans again,

120
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,700
tell Him to wake up as well.

121
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,650
Ruin his plan again?

122
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,970
(Living is already a nightmare,)

123
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,130
so wishing to be born again
is a silly thought.

124
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,410
And wishing for peace in the afterlife

125
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,830
sounds lame, doesn't it?

126
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,860
(Choi Seol-hee)

127
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,220
Lower your shoulders. Okay, that's good.

128
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:39,170
Welcome.

129
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:46,820
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

130
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,540
-May I have a bottle of soju?
-Coming up.

131
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,510
-Here.
-Thank you.

132
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,840
(Butler Jung Yu-mi)

133
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,900
(Just give us a little more time.)

134
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,580
You're a dad too.

135
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,690
You know how I feel, don't you?

136
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,880
Mr. Park.

137
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:42,090
I'm known for my persistence.

138
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:45,040
Would you like me to leave

139
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,410
80 missed calls?

140
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,710
Hello, Ms. Jung.

141
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,440
Are you sick?
What's wrong with your voice?

142
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,130
Don't tell me you've changed your mind.

143
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:06,070
(No, that's not it.)

144
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,260
(Tomorrow at 3:00 p.m.)

145
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,630
(If you don't come,
I'll go to Fantasia myself.)

146
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,780
(Do you understand?)

147
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,490
(Don't sound so scary.)

148
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,070
I didn't forget.

149
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:23,970
Do you know that Kim Dan

150
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:27,010
is giving up on his mission
and is about to cause trouble?

151
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,740
I don't care if your junior or underling

152
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:33,170
turns into dust as punishment
after acting recklessly.

153
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,680
But I thought you should
at least know about it.

154
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:37,170
Do as you please.

155
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,550
Come sit down.

156
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,030
Let's have a drink.

157
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:50,370
Humans sometimes drink

158
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,310
instead of praying.

159
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,640
I have nothing more to say to you.

160
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,750
I once heard

161
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,130
about an abandoned angel

162
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,070
who had turned into a human.

163
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:12,550
"They reeled and staggered
like drunkards."

164
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:19,060
"They were at their wits' end."

165
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,010
You didn't forget it.

166
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,270
I'm tired of those verses,

167
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,260
but they just won't disappear
from my memory.

168
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:39,210
You must've gone through a lot.

169
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,600
You were left in this barren world,

170
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,720
not being able to live or die.

171
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:51,140
Are you saying that you're
a merciful angel who understands me?

172
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:53,290
Then what?

173
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,150
Did you expect me to kneel down
and repent my sins?

174
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,740
Dream on.

175
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:00,550
Just focus on managing
that junior of yours.

176
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,400
Why are you so hostile towards Dan?

177
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:08,080
You achieved your goal.

178
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,110
You successfully placed a woman who
looks like your dead lover, Noisy Gong...

179
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,470
No, I mean Yeon-seo on stage in her place.

180
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,790
You did it.

181
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,050
That's what I thought at first.

182
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,570
I thought that she was the key,

183
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,230
and everything would be over
once I put her on stage. However...

184
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,170
It might be an endless tunnel,

185
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,370
but it'll be easier together.

186
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,630
You want to live now.

187
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,760
You used to say
that living was a nightmare.

188
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,890
I want to break free

189
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,020
from that nightmare.

190
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,710
(Lee Yeon-seo, Yoo Seong-woo)

191
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,590
Yeon-seo.

192
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,100
Listen carefully
to what I'm about to tell you.

193
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:06,960
Do you know

194
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,790
what a guardian angel is?

195
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,350
No.

196
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,210
Don't be surprised. I'll...

197
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,720
Darn it. This is what Ji Kang-woo said.

198
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,090
So

199
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,910
I was Seong-woo.

200
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,850
I was him.

201
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,580
But after I died, I became an angel.

202
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,880
But I just happened to remember--

203
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,650
What am I saying?

204
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,070
It doesn't make sense even to me.

205
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,970
(Lee Yeon-seo, Yoo Seong-woo)

206
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,740
(Lady Yeon-seo)

207
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,240
"Lady Yeon-seo"?

208
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,610
(Lady Yeon-seo)

209
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:58,310
-Hello?
(-Come to the garden right now.)

210
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,890
Sit down. It's chamomile tea.

211
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,819
"Lady Yeon-seo"?

212
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,720
You changed it, didn't you?

213
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,839
You shouldn't use my phone
without my permission.

214
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,420
Why is it yours?

215
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,800
It's the cell phone
I bought with my money.

216
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:20,700
What's wrong with "Lady Yeon-seo"?
It's much better than Noisy Gong.

217
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:24,750
"Lady Yeon-seo". Repeat after me.

218
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:29,940
Lady Yeon-seo.

219
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,010
Why did you call for me?

220
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,610
Are you having trouble sleeping?

221
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,500
Which one is it?

222
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:46,750
Are you married?
Or do you have a terminal disease?

223
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,960
I've given it some thought.

224
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,210
I tried to figure out
what you're hiding from me

225
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,670
and what you need to take care of.

226
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:58,460
Why are you in pain because you fell in
love with me when you shouldn't have?

227
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,610
What could it be?

228
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,720
Either you're married or you're ill.

229
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,960
Come on. It's none of the above.

230
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,390
You're the only one for me.

231
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,080
You're my first and last.

232
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,770
And I'm really healthy.

233
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:18,870
I'm not ill.

234
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,790
Then tell me what you did
while you were away.

235
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,470
Where did you go?

236
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,030
I'll tell you everything
after the audition.

237
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:33,350
I don't want to bother you
for no good reason before your big day.

238
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:41,440
Kim Dan, listen up.

239
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:43,950
If it's about you,

240
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,900
even a strand of hair
is a good reason for me to care.

241
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,830
To me,

242
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,900
you're the most important.

243
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,190
Do you understand that?

244
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,310
Tell me.

245
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,510
I'm okay with whatever it is.

246
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:03,930
Really?

247
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,200
Actually,

248
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:16,640
I met

249
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,060
my dad.

250
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,630
Gosh.

251
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,500
I've never said that out loud before.

252
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,970
Your father

253
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,650
who kicked you out?

254
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:36,000
Did you ask for forgiveness
for your mistake?

255
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,080
Well,

256
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,590
it's a common, boring story.

257
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,210
I've totally forgotten about him
for over a decade of my life.

258
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,600
I barely managed to meet him right
before he died.

259
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,980
I asked him what I wanted to know

260
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,710
and said goodbye.

261
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,300
That's my story.

262
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,950
What did you

263
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,980
want to know from him?

264
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,000
Well,

265
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,840
I wondered why he was so harsh on me.

266
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,500
I was his son, after all.

267
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,160
He should've loved me.

268
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,670
Things like that.

269
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,890
Did he apologize to you?

270
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:38,300
Fortunately, yes.

271
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,380
All right. Storytime is over.

272
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,480
Wasn't it boring?

273
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,670
Come here.

274
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,180
No, I'm all right.

275
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,450
I let everything go already.

276
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,710
You and I

277
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,980
are both alone in this world.

278
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,390
You've been through so much,

279
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,020
Dan.

280
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,330
I'm all right.

281
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,580
I'm really fine.

282
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,590
When does your rehearsal end today?

283
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,260
Around 6:00 p.m.

284
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:57,630
Darn it. I was hoping it'd be at 3:00 p.m.

285
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,230
Hey, look at your outfit. Is that new?

286
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,080
What do you think? Isn't this pretty?

287
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:03,130
-It's pretty.
-What?

288
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,720
Are you teaching more classes?

289
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:06,520
Do you have time for that?

290
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,170
By the way, did you two

291
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,550
meet with Associate Director Geum?

292
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,280
My gosh.

293
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,840
Did Associate Director Geum
contact you in private?

294
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,290
I don't know.

295
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,140
I only heard about it.

296
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:29,050
I'll cancel the audition
and publicly announce that

297
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,090
the general director and the associate
director bought votes from the troupe

298
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:35,170
to ensure their daughter
and sister got the leading role.

299
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:37,320
I'll announce it to the association
and the media too.

300
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,300
Go ahead.

301
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,380
However, you don't have
witnesses nor evidence,

302
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:46,210
so be ready to take responsibility
for saying that Fantasia is in ruins.

303
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,110
Regardless of the results,
I'm sure you can't deny

304
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,390
that you tried to buy votes.

305
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,950
I only met with my dancers in private
as an associate director

306
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,870
to ask if they needed help or if there
were suggestions for the ballet theater.

307
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,850
If you're calling that buying votes,

308
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,180
I'll take responsibility
and resign from Fantasia.

309
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,640
Your resignation
won't resolve this matter.

310
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:06,140
If auditions aren't executed fairly,

311
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:08,470
don't you know that we can't
prepare for the show properly?

312
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:11,510
What do you and General Director Choi

313
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,750
want from this ballet theater?

314
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,340
Is it truly about money?

315
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,440
Director Ji.

316
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:21,060
You keep condemning
General Director Choi and me

317
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,340
as though we're
the most despicable people on Earth.

318
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,580
Let me give you a warning very politely.

319
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,740
Please refrain yourself

320
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,200
before my patience runs out.

321
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,740
We'll proceed
with the audition as planned.

322
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:42,620
Present the evidence that proves that
we bought votes with money or bribes.

323
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,110
Once I'll confirm it myself,

324
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,740
I'll cancel the audition.

325
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,160
My goodness!

326
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,550
No one followed you here, right?

327
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,690
No.

328
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,840
What about you?

329
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,990
Are you acting naturally,
so they don't suspect you?

330
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,750
Of course. No one knows. No one.

331
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:21,640
(I've got everyone fooled.)

332
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,140
(Good job.)

333
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,420
(Let's go in.)

334
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,360
Who is this?

335
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,210
Mr. Moon.

336
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:41,620
(Mr. Park.)

337
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:46,240
Where and how have you been?
You never called!

338
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:49,850
After hearing from Ms. Jung,
I knew it would be you.

339
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:52,090
What do you mean?

340
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,600
You can catch up later.
Let's cut to the chase.

341
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,620
Ji-woong is going to testify for us.

342
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,040
-Testify what?
-The accident

343
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,850
that caused Young Lady to go blind.

344
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:03,090
That wasn't an accident. It's an incident.

345
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:05,420
Someone instigated the incident.
It was planned.

346
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:07,930
What? What did you say? Who?

347
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,310
(Is it ready?)

348
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,860
(I'm doing it
because you're telling me to,)

349
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:19,020
(but she could really end up dying.)

350
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:21,260
(Right. That's the whole point.)

351
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,630
(If you fail,)

352
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:26,060
(you know that you have to give back
all the money we've given you, right?)

353
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:28,480
(Please.)

354
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:29,580
(Don't forget.)

355
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:34,950
(The ending of Act Two.)

356
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:37,280
(It's when Lee Yeon-seo's solo ends.)

357
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,060
(I knew it was wrong.)

358
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:55,710
I shouldn't have done it
even if I was about to lose everything.

359
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,470
I think it was a trap.

360
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,580
You said he never played cards,
not even once.

361
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:02,530
But your father owed thousands of dollars
for gambling within days.

362
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:06,230
And a stranger gave you 10,000 dollars
and 5,000 dollars for no reason.

363
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:07,940
I bet it was all part of the plan.

364
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,400
Who? Who planned it?

365
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,020
We should look into that now.

366
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:14,150
After the audition tomorrow,
I'm going to the police with Young Lady.

367
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:18,550
(Bring the recording and documents
you mentioned by then, Mr. Park.)

368
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,220
Okay.

369
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,030
(Untitled)

370
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,340
(We should look into that now.)

371
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:44,160
(After the audition tomorrow,
I'm going to the police with Young Lady.)

372
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,040
(Bring the recording and documents
you mentioned by then, Mr. Park.)

373
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:52,520
I told you not to do anything.

374
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,560
If you had any conscience,
you wouldn't have done it to begin with.

375
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,070
You're dying anyway.

376
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,490
Are you scared of being condemned?

377
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,280
I told you to stay still.

378
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:37,480
How can I?
You said you're going to die after this.

379
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:39,990
-This is his last time.
-He should know better.

380
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,620
He deceived Giselle.

381
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,750
She's going to die
because he deceived her.

382
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,380
How dare he hold her hand?

383
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,410
He didn't know that this would happen.

384
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:51,560
He feels bad,
so he wants to atone for what he did.

385
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:53,010
What's the point of that?

386
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:54,640
Can you just kill everyone

387
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:56,090
like Director Ji's interpretation?

388
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,500
That's more intense.

389
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:00,230
You really have to win tomorrow.

390
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,930
And don't forget. At 5:00 p.m. tomorrow--

391
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,470
How many times must you tell me?

392
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,450
A party at the cafe by the police station.

393
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:09,380
We can celebrate, or you can console me.

394
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:12,550
Things will get very hectic
after tomorrow.

395
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:14,530
-Be ready.
-Okay.

396
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,610
Let's try it one more time.

397
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,510
You've been doing this for three hours.

398
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,310
It's because something
is still bothering me.

399
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,810
I'm still in love,

400
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:30,110
but I know he deceived me.
I don't know what to do.

401
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:36,490
(Report)

402
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,340
(Are you asleep?)

403
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:46,250
No. Why?

404
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,510
Do you want to help me practice
a bit more?

405
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,610
What?

406
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,330
Come here.

407
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,400
I told you. I have to practice.

408
00:28:58,490 --> 00:28:59,630
You don't need to do that.

409
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,000
Let's forget everything
and get some fresh air.

410
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,290
What do you want to see?

411
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,360
The river, sea, trees, fields,
tell me anything.

412
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:08,340
I'll take you there. Okay?

413
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,780
Stars.

414
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:16,390
I want to see the stars with you.

415
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,340
He must have had a reason.

416
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:17,110
What?

417
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,260
He truly loved Giselle too, didn't he?

418
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,790
Maybe the first engagement
was made against his will.

419
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:30,800
That might be
why he ran away to the countryside.

420
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:33,960
Keep going.

421
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:40,170
He ended up in a strange place,
met a woman,

422
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,630
and fell in love with her.

423
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,670
He shouldn't have fallen in love with her,

424
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:48,090
but no matter how hard he tried,

425
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:50,680
he couldn't help but fall in love.

426
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,050
He probably made a decision

427
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:59,920
to abandon everything and live there.

428
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,220
Then he should have told her earlier.

429
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,370
He probably wanted to.

430
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:11,140
But he put it off for a day

431
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,520
and another day.

432
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:16,470
Probably.

433
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:19,680
Was he afraid she'd leave
if he told her the truth?

434
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,710
He was probably afraid.

435
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:24,120
He didn't trust her.

436
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,390
The man

437
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:32,480
trusted his love, but not Giselle's love.

438
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:35,080
She's a woman

439
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:37,630
who loved him
even after she became a ghost.

440
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,280
That's so sad.

441
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:46,250
Let's go. I need to dance this out.

442
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:48,150
Right now?

443
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:50,480
I need to try it out
when I get the feeling. Let's go.

444
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:21,760
I need to talk to...

445
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,940
Why did you come here?

446
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:32,940
Where is your handkerchief?

447
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,180
It's mine,

448
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,410
so I'll take care of it.

449
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:42,260
Stop threatening me.
I already made my decision.

450
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,940
No, you need to turn back.

451
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,170
Ji Kang-woo is...

452
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,850
You know he only wanted her
because she looks like his first love.

453
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,220
He was sincere.

454
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:53,180
He is sincerely in love with Yeon-seo.

455
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,780
That can't be right.

456
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,620
Your mission was half successful.

457
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:03,210
You just have to leave now.

458
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,950
If that's what you came to say, leave.

459
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,730
So what if you tell
your story to Noisy Gong?

460
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:11,790
Then what?

461
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,110
Then

462
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,350
are you going to show her
how you turn into dust?

463
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,070
The best thing you can do for her
at this point is leaving.

464
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,790
Before she falls deeper in love with you.

465
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,680
Before she gets more hurt.

466
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:41,750
Before something more frightening happens.

467
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,610
Ji Kang-woo will be by Noisy Gong's side.

468
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:47,250
You and I can return to paradise.

469
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,640
That's a happy ending for everyone.

470
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:53,100
Isn't that right, Dan?

471
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:59,660
I'm sure there is a way.

472
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:02,520
If a human can become an angel,

473
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,590
an angel can become a human too.

474
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:06,130
Stop talking nonsense!

475
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,750
Think about it.

476
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,600
If you act rashly,
something bad will happen.

477
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:11,580
Stop trying to scare me!

478
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:15,060
I'll deal with the bad thing
and get struck by lightning if I must.

479
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:16,730
Leave.

480
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,929
Dan...

481
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:29,710
Don't be nervous.

482
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:33,230
You're the one who'll be dancing,
so why am I nervous?

483
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:34,810
You can do it, Noisy Gong.

484
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,010
That again.

485
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,730
You're my Noisy Gong,
the prettiest one in this world.

486
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,639
Here.

487
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,449
It proves that you are an angel,

488
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:58,050
and it connects this land with paradise.

489
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,250
Do not lose it.

490
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:02,930
Make sure you always carry it around.

491
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,880
May I borrow that until today?

492
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,200
I want it as my good luck charm.

493
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,010
This is yours now.

494
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,870
Are you giving it to me for good?

495
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,470
I don't need this

496
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,540
because I'll be with you.

497
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,530
Your vote today
will determine the future of Fantasia.

498
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,340
I believe that you will vote for a dancer

499
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:57,880
who touches your heart.

500
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:24,770
Geum Ni-na didn't come?

501
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:30,930
Good luck, everyone.

502
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,040
San-ha, control your emotions.

503
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:34,400
Soo-ji, get bolder.

504
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:36,080
Jung-eun, maintain your balance.

505
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,260
And Yeon-seo...

506
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,730
Focus on your interpretation.

507
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,360
Whoever it may be,

508
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:47,950
I'm going to do my best
to use their interpretation.

509
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,990
So do your best to convince them

510
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,450
so that the troupe
and I will be able to follow.

511
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,020
Just give up.

512
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,740
You overworked after giving birth.

513
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:19,900
I think you have an inflammation
in your pelvis.

514
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,970
Have you gone to the hospital?

515
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:25,090
What is it?
Are you desperate to gain my vote?

516
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,080
You don't consider me a rival, do you?

517
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:29,800
You're not going to quit in a year or two.

518
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,970
You didn't work this hard to end to return
to quit so soon.

519
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,910
Give up on this audition
and focus on getting better first.

520
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,920
No. I can't do that.

521
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:41,500
I will never give up again.

522
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:44,540
You of all people know
how hard it is to come back

523
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,970
once you've fallen behind.

524
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,050
I may be nothing in your eyes,

525
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,510
but I am still a ballerina.
Do you know that?

526
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:03,410
We will now begin the audition.

527
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:07,070
The candidates were allowed to choose
any scene from "Giselle."

528
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,750
The first candidate is Lee San-ha.

529
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:23,210
(If we have 13 votes of 30,)

530
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,490
(are we in the clear?)

531
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:27,480
Since the voting will be done in secret,
we won't be able to track them.

532
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:28,890
We can't be sure.

533
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,080
I don't like this idea.

534
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,440
(If we meet them too often,
it'll leave a trace.)

535
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,680
(I know that.)

536
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,800
But there's no other way.

537
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:43,450
Yeon-seo is second to none
when it comes to ballet.

538
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,150
She's aware of that, and that is why she
has put everything on the line for ballet.

539
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,190
(The troupe will give back for
what they've received.)

540
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,700
(Ni-na should do well.)

541
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,380
(As an artist,
I'm sure she has her pride.)

542
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,050
(You can't act noble without money.)

543
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,680
(Whether you're an artist or not,)

544
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:05,190
(nobody can turn away from money.)

545
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:17,020
Next up is Geum Ni-na.

546
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:40,300
Geum Ni-na just arrived.

547
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:46,370
(Wow,
she has a completely different vibe.)

548
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,660
(Stop!)

549
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:02,210
I told you to stop crying.

550
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:04,190
What is this disgusting emotion?

551
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,300
I can't stop myself.

552
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:08,280
What use is all of this?

553
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,100
It has to be Yeon-seo.

554
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:13,910
As long as I'm not Lee Yeon-so,

555
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:16,510
nothing I do will be enough.

556
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,400
Did you just realize that?

557
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:20,820
This was your fate from the beginning.

558
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:23,590
No matter how pretty you are,
you're just a display that nobody wants.

559
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,960
Unless you're Yeon-seo,

560
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:27,330
you have no choice
but to be locked up behind glass doors.

561
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:31,120
Give up! Why do you even bother to try?

562
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:44,100
1,124. 1,125. 1,120...

563
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:50,570
She did it.

564
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,830
Bravo!

565
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,600
That was incredible.

566
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,190
You were really good.

567
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:29,870
Don't evaluate me.

568
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,940
I didn't do that to gain your approval.

569
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,140
Mind your own business.

570
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,990
(Next up is Lee Yeon-seo.)

571
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:41,500
(She feels resentment.)

572
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:45,590
(Not towards him, but towards herself.)

573
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:48,850
(Was my love not enough?)

574
00:43:58,090 --> 00:43:59,320
(It's not like that.)

575
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:03,020
(He probably couldn't tell me)

576
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:05,130
(because he couldn't trust me.)

577
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:09,400
(No, I do want to tell you.)

578
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,510
(I want to tell you the most.)

579
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:16,260
(I want to tell you who and what I am.)

580
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,480
(But can I do that?)

581
00:45:54,990 --> 00:45:56,050
Well done.

582
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:14,970
(I will now tally the votes.)

583
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:18,180
(1: Lee San-ha, 2: Lee Soo-ji,
3: Hwang Jung-eun)

584
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:20,340
(4: Geum Ni-na, 5: Lee Yeon-seo)

585
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,010
(Ballot Box)

586
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:28,430
The last vote goes to

587
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,470
Lee Yeon-seo.

588
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:49,910
(4: Geum Ni-na, 5: Lee Yeon-seo)

589
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:51,970
Since it's tied,

590
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:55,270
we can either have a final match
or a head-to-head vote.

591
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:58,000
But why are there only 29 votes?

592
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:02,670
Did one of you abstain?

593
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:05,750
Where did Ms. Hwang Jung-eun go?

594
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:08,650
She said something urgent came up,
so she left.

595
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:11,690
It looks like she didn't vote.

596
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:13,230
Let's call her and ask.

597
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,780
She left in a hurry,
but she saw the performances.

598
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:17,710
And I bet she has no idea about the tie.

599
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:21,190
We can just call her
and ask her whom she wants to vote for.

600
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:23,340
Including the candidates and the voters,

601
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:25,760
if anyone is against this idea,

602
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:27,740
we'll push forward
with a head-to-head vote.

603
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:32,800
Does anyone object?

604
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,270
You know that Korea
is known for its competitiveness.

605
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,910
We can't end the audition
without a clear winner.

606
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:39,930
Go ahead and call her.

607
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:50,230
(Director Ji Kang-woo)

608
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,080
Hello?

609
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:57,310
Jung-eun, you saw the performances, right?
(Hwang Jung-eun, Fantasia)

610
00:47:57,310 --> 00:47:58,760
Jung-eun, you saw the performances, right?

611
00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:00,130
I won't drag this out.

612
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:02,420
You'll vote on the phone.

613
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:05,100
(Among the 5 candidates,
cast your vote for 1 of them.)

614
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,430
Now? On the phone?

615
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:08,530
Yes.

616
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:10,470
Everyone is listening to the phone call.

617
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,840
But if you feel uncomfortable,
you don't have to do it.

618
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:16,320
This is supposed to be anonymous,
but everyone will know whom you voted for.

619
00:48:16,410 --> 00:48:18,650
-If you want to abstain--
(-No, I'll vote.)

620
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:21,470
If you'll count my vote, I'll vote.

621
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:26,660
I

622
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:33,960
(Hwang Jung-eun, Fantasia)

623
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,150
(liked Lee Yeon-seo's performance
the most.)
(Hwang Jung-eun, Fantasia)

624
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:36,210
(liked Lee Yeon-seo's performance
the most.)

625
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:47,820
Giselle will be performed by Lee Yeon-seo
in Fantasia's 2019 production

626
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,860
of "Giselle".

627
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:27,110
Let's accept it.

628
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:29,800
The dancers who are performing
with them chose her.

629
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:32,480
Everyone will agree that it was fair.

630
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:37,010
What have you done for Fantasia?

631
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:39,520
What have you done for Ni-na's audition?

632
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:41,110
They're artists?

633
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:43,610
My foot.

634
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,560
Those two-faced dancers can't be artists.

635
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:48,540
They took everything we offered.

636
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:49,990
How dare they stab me in the back?

637
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:52,190
What do you mean?

638
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:55,100
Did you bribe them?

639
00:49:55,190 --> 00:49:56,640
Stop, stop!

640
00:49:56,810 --> 00:49:58,000
If she plays the lead,

641
00:49:58,090 --> 00:50:00,510
it's over for us. This is the end.

642
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,710
No. I can't let this be.

643
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,160
What choice do we have?

644
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:06,630
Should Yeon-seo go blind again
for Ni-na to--

645
00:50:10,370 --> 00:50:11,380
Right.

646
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:15,070
I just need to make sure
that she never performs at all costs.

647
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:17,580
Yeong-ja, come to your senses.

648
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:19,030
We've been

649
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:21,540
too kind to her since she is our family.

650
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:24,270
Right?

651
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,180
Ni-na.

652
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,770
Ni-na, where are you?

653
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:50,450
I wish she would die.

654
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:53,920
I wish

655
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:57,530
Yeon-seo was dead.

656
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:03,870
-Ms. Lee, can you change your pose?
-Okay.

657
00:51:04,350 --> 00:51:06,290
We'd like another shot of your face.

658
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:09,410
How will your 2016 interpretation of
"Swan Lake" be different from others?

659
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,700
I'll show you a visible difference
between good and evil.

660
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:13,990
Can we expect to see the best
"Swan Lake" of the year?

661
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:17,550
Of course. I'll show you 32 perfect turns.

662
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,140
If Yeon-seo weren't here...

663
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:25,160
If she weren't here,

664
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:28,640
I would be the lead dancer.

665
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:50,990
Congratulations.

666
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:52,750
Thank you.

667
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:55,390
I convinced you too, right?

668
00:51:56,050 --> 00:51:57,330
Shall we have dinner later?

669
00:51:58,210 --> 00:52:00,800
-Pardon?
-I've thought a lot about this,

670
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:02,610
but I must tell you

671
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:04,850
why I chose you

672
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:06,390
and what happened to me.

673
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:10,700
I have plans tonight.

674
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:11,800
I'll wait until you come.

675
00:52:11,890 --> 00:52:12,990
Don't wait.

676
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,190
If it's about work,
we can do it in the studio.

677
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:16,470
If it's a private matter,

678
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:19,990
-I won't listen to you.
-You don't know anything

679
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:23,590
about how I feel as I stand
in front of you.

680
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:28,210
I respect you, and I am grateful to you.

681
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:31,340
Working with you is fun,
and I'm excited for it.

682
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:32,480
Please

683
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:34,550
don't make me feel more uncomfortable.

684
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:35,830
Decide after you hear me out.

685
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:37,450
You know the restaurant out front?

686
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:39,480
Meet me there after your plans are over.

687
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:54,830
Yeon-seo. Yeon-seo.

688
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,830
Hey, someone might see us.

689
00:52:58,090 --> 00:52:59,890
Congratulations. You were so good.

690
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:00,990
You were beautiful.

691
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:02,310
What about my present?

692
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:03,720
What?

693
00:53:03,810 --> 00:53:05,970
What's this? You didn't prepare anything?

694
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:10,410
I don't have a present,
but there's a place we should go to.

695
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,080
I need to go meet Ms. Jung.

696
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:13,450
It won't take long.

697
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:16,440
-Where?
-Where we met for the first time.

698
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,170
There's something
I really want to tell you.

699
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:21,890
I'll tell you who I am
and where I came from.

700
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:25,100
I'll tell you everything
from the beginning.

701
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:38,220
I'll have some coffee first.
I'll order food once my party arrives.

702
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:39,320
Okay.

703
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,020
You still have some time.

704
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:00,790
No, it's not that.

705
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:04,700
Director Ji...

706
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,260
What about him?

707
00:54:07,390 --> 00:54:09,460
Did he yell at you for not
following his instructions?

708
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:10,780
Or did he say something weird?

709
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:13,330
Did he say something to you?

710
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:16,450
He said he needs to tell me something
and that he'll wait until I come.

711
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:19,090
I told him that I wasn't going to come,

712
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:21,380
but it's bothering me.

713
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,330
That man is unbelievable.

714
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:25,870
He had his nose in the air, you know.

715
00:54:26,350 --> 00:54:27,940
He said that he'd wait for you?

716
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:30,310
Neither think about him nor accept him.

717
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:37,000
Are you jealous?

718
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:40,830
-What?
-That's what it looks like.

719
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:42,060
No.

720
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:46,770
Fine. Yes. I'm jealous.

721
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:48,130
If this petty, embarrassing,

722
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:49,800
and nasty feeling is called jealousy,

723
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:51,870
you got it right. I'm jealous!

724
00:54:56,670 --> 00:54:57,900
I hate Ji Kang-woo.

725
00:54:57,990 --> 00:54:59,530
I hate that he's clinging onto you,

726
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:01,770
that you connect through ballet
which I'm clueless about,

727
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:03,840
and that he meets you in private. So...

728
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,670
Don't meet him unless
I'm with you from now on.

729
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,390
Do you like me that much?

730
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:30,940
Yes.

731
00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:41,900
Let's go.

732
00:56:01,870 --> 00:56:03,280
What's your deal with rain?

733
00:56:05,350 --> 00:56:07,330
-Why do you ask?
-In hindsight,

734
00:56:07,810 --> 00:56:09,570
you always ran away whenever it rained.

735
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:10,670
Didn't you?

736
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:13,890
-Well...
-Do you have a trauma about rain?

737
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:15,030
Or an allergy?

738
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:18,860
Or do you transform into
the Hulk or something?

739
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:24,670
How would you feel
if I can really do that?

740
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:27,530
What if

741
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:31,000
I become something else
other than what I am now?

742
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:39,890
I'll pray that you'll return to yourself.

743
00:56:48,950 --> 00:56:51,200
I'll go buy us an umbrella. Wait here.

744
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:53,040
Let's go together.

745
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:02,460
I won't run away anymore.

746
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:03,820
I'll be right back.

747
00:57:23,710 --> 00:57:24,940
Have a nice day!

748
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:32,820
Excuse me!

749
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:42,540
(I had a weird feeling.)

750
00:57:43,070 --> 00:57:44,610
(It felt like)

751
00:57:45,270 --> 00:57:47,870
(I will search everywhere for him
in the distant future.)

752
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:52,620
(It felt like I will be left alone)

753
00:57:52,930 --> 00:57:56,490
(in sadness and despair,
longing and missing him.)

754
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:59,310
Lee Yeon-seo!

755
00:58:15,630 --> 00:58:16,820
Be careful.

756
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:29,450
(Maju Police Station)

757
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:36,090
(Maju Police Station)

758
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:05,790
(Lee Yeon-seo)

759
00:59:08,910 --> 00:59:10,230
(Lee Yeon-seo)

760
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,210
(Director Ji, I'm sorry.)

761
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:14,460
(I feel too burdened,
and I'm not confident.)

762
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:17,100
(I think this is my limit.)

763
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:20,970
(I'll end everything
in the ballet theater that I loved.)

764
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:41,470
(Where am I?)

765
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:43,670
(I hear cars)

766
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,270
(and a ventilator?)

767
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:54,320
(Ji Kang-woo)

768
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:57,710
(Power off)

769
01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:06,730
Yes. Everything is ready.

770
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:09,500
I sent him an invitation,
so he will be there soon.

771
01:00:09,590 --> 01:00:12,580
We need to let him see the final moment

772
01:00:12,890 --> 01:00:14,120
of the ballerina whom he adored.

773
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:19,660
A hypersensitive ballerina who was
paranoid and spoke of conspiracies

774
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:21,860
before her death

775
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:25,210
kills herself due to the stress
of her comeback.

776
01:00:27,010 --> 01:00:28,380
It's a nice headline.

777
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:30,180
(Make sure you end this well.)

778
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:54,640
Is this 911?
There's a person on the rooftop.

779
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:57,150
I think she's about to fall down.
Hurry up!

780
01:01:05,550 --> 01:01:06,740
Who are you?

781
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:08,460
Who sent you?

782
01:01:08,850 --> 01:01:10,920
My aunt? Was it my aunt?

783
01:01:11,010 --> 01:01:13,910
Believe in whatever you want.
This is the end anyway.

784
01:01:15,150 --> 01:01:17,920
This is the rooftop
of the ballet theater, isn't it?

785
01:01:18,090 --> 01:01:19,460
You should reconsider.

786
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:21,390
Do you know how many
CCTV cameras are here?

787
01:01:21,570 --> 01:01:22,930
You'll definitely get caught.

788
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:27,030
You should just go.

789
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:30,150
You don't have to take off mt blindfold
or untie my hands.

790
01:01:30,550 --> 01:01:32,440
I'll let it go, and I won't go after you.

791
01:01:46,210 --> 01:01:47,620
You made the right decision.

792
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:51,840
Go. I didn't see your face.

793
01:02:09,310 --> 01:02:11,160
Thank you for letting me live.

794
01:02:11,470 --> 01:02:12,790
I'm not letting you live.

795
01:02:15,210 --> 01:02:16,790
No one kills themselves

796
01:02:18,290 --> 01:02:20,000
with their eyes covered
and their hands tied.

797
01:02:37,730 --> 01:02:38,740
(Dan.)

798
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:27,720
(Angel's Last Mission: Love)

799
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:31,410
(You can't hurt Yeon-seo ever again)

800
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:33,260
as long as I'm around.

801
01:03:33,390 --> 01:03:35,240
(You lost your consciousness.
You need to rest.)

802
01:03:35,330 --> 01:03:36,430
(Give it back to me.)

803
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:39,900
(Something is going on. I'm sure of it.)

804
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:42,280
(I'm going to find the reason.)

805
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,390
(It was you, wasn't it?)

806
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:49,630
You don't really like me.

807
01:03:50,110 --> 01:03:51,700
You messed with her memory?

808
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:53,720
Keep your eyes on her

809
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:55,480
(when I'm not around.)
