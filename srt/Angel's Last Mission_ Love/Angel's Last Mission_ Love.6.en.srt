1
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:09,750
(People say life is unpredictable.)

2
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:12,300
(Who would have thought?)

3
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:14,990
(The naive country girl, Giselle,)

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,150
would fall in love, be betrayed,
and then...

5
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,500
go crazy.

6
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,880
(Just like how I didn't know)

7
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,640
(I would meet you,)

8
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,160
(find you, and fall in love with you.)

9
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,110
(Just like)

10
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:05,019
(how we don't know
what our ending would be.)

11
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:39,829
Great job, really.

12
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,820
It took me a long time.

13
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,820
I was

14
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,430
lost in a dark and long tunnel

15
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,590
for a long time.

16
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,670
It was so long,
it felt like it was endless.

17
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,270
I thought I would never
be able to get out.

18
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:05,660
I finally found

19
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,610
the exit.

20
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:10,940
Finally.

21
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:20,840
Lee Yeon-seo.

22
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,750
Be my Giselle.

23
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,079
Giselle?

24
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,690
Goodness, you found me.

25
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:49,180
You wanted to come and roll around
on the sandy beach on your day off?

26
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,290
I was going to stay quiet,

27
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,460
but the guard post was way too old.

28
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,740
Stop smiling. You're annoying me.

29
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,850
What was it like to see me in secret?

30
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:05,980
I must have looked like a complete fool
to get so easily deceived to dance around.

31
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,080
That was so pretty.

32
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,360
That was really pretty.

33
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,960
This part of my body felt itchy,

34
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,899
and I became sad

35
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,610
and happy.

36
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,850
Don't act like you know
anything about dance.

37
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:25,830
It's because I don't,

38
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,420
and because there was nothing I could do,

39
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,540
I decided to make this.

40
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,300
I wanted to do something for you,

41
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:33,880
but as you said,

42
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,520
I don't know anything about ballet.

43
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,020
Then you should just sit still.

44
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,560
Yes, you're useless.

45
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,010
You can't drive. You can't do judo.

46
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,120
And you get on my nerves saying
I'm too mean.

47
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,440
That's enough.

48
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,159
Stop going behind my back.

49
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,180
Should we go now?

50
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,150
Let's go to Fantasia's Night.

51
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,370
Let's show the sponsors
who the prima ballerina is.

52
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,530
What should I prepare?

53
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,380
A revealing dress?

54
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,870
My business smile?

55
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,970
Don't be sarcastic.

56
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,470
You know that this is necessary.

57
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,590
Not all sponsors are perverted or dirty.

58
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,370
It's the dancer's job to attract attention
and bear through it.

59
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,170
Not your job, who only talks.

60
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,810
Over the ten years of my life
as a director, I never made

61
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,410
my ballerinas stand around like flowers,
not even once.

62
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,510
Trust me.

63
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:31,740
No!

64
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,700
There's a saying,

65
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,850
"There must not be even
a hint of immorality,"

66
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,570
"or of any kind of impurity, or of greed."

67
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:42,120
Hey, you crook.
What are you talking about?

68
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,409
Don't go. Your dance is more than enough.

69
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,520
There's no reason to prove yourself
any further.

70
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,250
There is no need to bear the wickedness.

71
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,970
Mr. Ji, do you think this is why I...

72
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,409
-Hey.
-You're right.

73
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,610
It could be dirty and uncomfortable.

74
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,280
And it could be worse.

75
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,790
But still, we shouldn't avoid this.
I'll fight with you.

76
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,250
I want to see you become the center of

77
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,010
Fantasia.

78
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:12,880
I'll manage. Mind your business.

79
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,300
Both of you.

80
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,310
Is this what they call a dream?

81
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,480
My gosh!

82
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,180
How did you know about that beach?

83
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,850
Even I couldn't remember,

84
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,300
so how could you?

85
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:06,160
You're smiling brightly, aren't you?

86
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,260
You look pretty.

87
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,900
Can you stop saying that?

88
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:10,870
Are you teasing me?

89
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,480
He said that a useless servant
should do what he can.

90
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,760
I may be useless,

91
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,700
but I will call something pretty if it is.

92
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,460
Because I can do that.

93
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,380
I'm sorry.

94
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,330
You said you didn't like me.

95
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,570
So why are you doing this?

96
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,640
(Mongyu Island, 2005)

97
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,180
(The day I started ballet once again)

98
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,570
(The moment you step into our academy,
you've already acquired your license.)

99
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,110
Your registration has been completed.

100
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,780
Thank you.

101
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,350
Are you Mr. Kim Dan?

102
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,810
-Yes.
-Come over here.

103
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,260
We'll start immediately.

104
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,430
Thank you, sir!

105
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:36,890
Brakes!

106
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:38,650
How many times do I need to repeat myself?

107
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,270
First, belt. Second, brakes.

108
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,370
Third.

109
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:42,960
Third, start the engine!

110
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:43,970
Again.

111
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:45,160
Brakes.

112
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,450
Start the engine.

113
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,370
We're pretty much crawling.

114
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,720
That's my report!

115
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,430
Wait! Come on!

116
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,670
(Disqualified.)

117
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,640
-Hu!
-What is it?

118
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,660
Are you seriously keeping an eye on me?

119
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,810
What?

120
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,840
Can't you see that I'm doing my best

121
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,820
to help you drive here?

122
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,580
Why do I sound like this?

123
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:16,930
I'm trying so hard to help you.

124
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,550
Then you should've told me earlier!

125
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,410
Because of you, I'm disqualified
as soon as I started!

126
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:30,170
There. Remember the steps and begin.

127
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,810
How could an angel threaten someone
and adopt an expedient?

128
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,000
Begin.

129
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,950
-Fine.
-Are you ready? Begin.

130
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:39,060
-No!
-Hey, hey!

131
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,640
Do it again.

132
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:41,870
Which one is the accelerator?

133
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,990
-The right side!
-Here I go.

134
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,920
-Good, good!
-Good, good!

135
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:48,210
-Which one is the brakes?
-Stop!

136
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,230
How does this work?

137
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,070
Why is it going this way?

138
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,710
Stop! You did it!

139
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:04,090
No wonder you always cause trouble.

140
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,850
You're not smart to begin with.

141
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,150
I'm never going to learn
anything from you!

142
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,310
You little...

143
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,650
Hey, Dan.

144
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:16,720
Dan!

145
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,400
You're pretty much a human now.

146
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,550
You're actually angry.

147
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,790
You were too harsh
when I was only a rookie!

148
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,420
-Goodness.
-I didn't know anything.

149
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,000
I didn't know what I was doing.

150
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,980
But you shouted and criticized me!

151
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:31,020
I wasn't happy with what you were doing,
so I wanted you to snap out of it.

152
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,740
Animals were your only clients.

153
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,380
I was worried you wouldn't know which way

154
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,190
to lead your human client and fail.

155
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,200
What do you mean?

156
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,270
I know this is your first time
dealing with humans.

157
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,030
This is your first time
in a human body too.

158
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,640
But still, don't you think
this was a bit too much?

159
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:47,610
Listen to this.

160
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,760
"Lee Yeon-seo danced."

161
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,660
"She was beautiful."

162
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:54,120
"It was the prettiest thing"

163
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,140
"I saw on earth."

164
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,080
(She overworked herself.)

165
00:10:58,650 --> 00:10:59,710
(I was scared)

166
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,100
(that she'd suffer and become unhappy.)

167
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:07,100
(But when she was dancing,
her face glowed.)

168
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,610
(She was definitely happy.)

169
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,480
How many times did you mention her?

170
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:14,760
There are 20 lines about her.

171
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,790
At the end, you wrote, "She hugged Rib."

172
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,990
It was just that one sentence.

173
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,100
What kind of report is this?

174
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,220
It's the truth!

175
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,810
Since we're talking about it,
I have a question.

176
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,920
Do you think he's a sturdy one?

177
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,110
What are you saying?

178
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,490
Her life has just begun!

179
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,420
She needs a strong, sturdy rib

180
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,150
beside her for her to become happy.

181
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,680
Could you

182
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,580
look into that for me?

183
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:04,340
(Choi Seol-hee)

184
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,650
Are you scared?

185
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:35,450
Well... No.

186
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,490
Because I'll be with you.

187
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,790
It's dangerous.

188
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:02,470
Stay back.

189
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,810
Listen, Raporas the angel.

190
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:27,500
You had received a mission
of inspiring artists

191
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,480
so that they would be able to draw things

192
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:32,340
that would give joy to the deity.

193
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,150
However, you betrayed your mission

194
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,040
and even decided to abandon the deity.

195
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:38,500
Therefore, you will be judged.

196
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,480
I've fulfilled my mission as an angel.

197
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,500
From now on,

198
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:46,070
I'd like to become a muse

199
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,800
for one person only.

200
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,740
Becoming an angel,

201
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:07,630
becoming a human,

202
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:10,580
starting a life,

203
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,690
and ending a life

204
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,990
all depend on the deity's will.

205
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,820
Don't come.

206
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,280
Don't come. Please.

207
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,020
He is cruel.

208
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,050
Then

209
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,070
why did He give me a heart?

210
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,880
Giving me a heart

211
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,030
and telling me to overcome my feelings

212
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:41,160
are the doings of a devil!

213
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,930
I will take everything
that the deity has given

214
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,470
away from you.

215
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:48,210
Please, no...

216
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,310
Please...

217
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:50,720
Please...

218
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:51,860
Please...

219
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,070
Please...

220
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:52,540
(Choi Seol-hee)

221
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,109
(I desperately wanted to become a human,)

222
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,060
(but not in the world)

223
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,260
(where you don't exist.)

224
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,540
(I could neither die)

225
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,960
(nor live a proper life.)

226
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,860
(I was lost for 15 years.)

227
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:03,990
I think

228
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,780
it will work out really well this time.

229
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:12,880
You must have lost someone dear to you.

230
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:16,580
I can still see waves of yearning
in your eyes.

231
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,420
As you prayed with all of your heart,

232
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,270
I am sure your loved one
will be in paradise.

233
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,220
And I can only assume
that she will be in peace.

234
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:27,840
Does "peace" really exist?

235
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,660
Living is already a torment.

236
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,810
Wishing to be born again
is a silly thought.

237
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,060
And wishing for peace on the other side

238
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,560
sounds lame, doesn't it?

239
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,610
Then,

240
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,660
what is it that you want?

241
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,260
Will you really attend the event?

242
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,950
"If you leave your home,
there will be trouble."

243
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:07,970
"Stay at home."

244
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,990
That's your horoscope for today.

245
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:11,350
Doesn't this sound too eerie?

246
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,250
One of you recited some sayings to me.

247
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,790
And you are reading my horoscope?

248
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,500
It's because we don't feel good
about this.

249
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,510
Horoscopes are big data

250
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,330
that contain the principles
of the universe and human history.

251
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,430
You shouldn't ignore it.

252
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,810
I'll face it.

253
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,920
I probably can't avoid it
even if I want to.

254
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:31,020
Fine.

255
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,560
Since you're attending it,

256
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:35,420
go announce it with a bright smile.

257
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,610
"Fantasia belongs to me."

258
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,680
"This job is mine." Make it official.

259
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:40,920
I'll be out after I get changed.

260
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,470
Okay.

261
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,000
Do you like me?

262
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,020
Just say yes or no.

263
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,280
Did you like me?

264
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,680
Do you?

265
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:16,740
No.

266
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,160
Hello. What would you like?

267
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,220
Something to help me be okay on my own.

268
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,540
-Pardon?
-Relaxing pills,

269
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,220
sedatives, or stimulant drugs.

270
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,110
I don't care what it is.

271
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,180
I've been

272
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,770
relying on people too much.

273
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,640
I've been relying on a guy
who doesn't even like me.

274
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:49,210
I'm not the type of person
who easily gets attached.

275
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,700
I must have lost my mind
for a second or something.

276
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:57,040
Give me some medicine that will
make me be okay without that jerk.

277
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,320
Darn it.

278
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,320
Gosh.

279
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:24,940
What is he...

280
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,610
Hold on. Get out of the car.

281
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,840
I'll move the car for you.

282
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,560
Let me keep trying.

283
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,010
Sure.

284
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,080
Okay.

285
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,400
Behind you. Watch out for the gate.

286
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:48,080
Goodness. You're in my way.

287
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:50,280
Get out of my way. I'm parking here.

288
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:51,730
Were you really parking?

289
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,360
I was keeping a safe distance, you know?

290
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:56,090
-When did you get your driver's license?
-What are you talking about?

291
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:59,080
My gosh, your driver's license...
You're not supposed to park your car here.

292
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,740
What is that?
Did you get a driver's license?

293
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:36,080
-Yes.
-Why don't you ride with me today?

294
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:37,580
For safety reasons.

295
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,050
That would be better.

296
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,780
Welcome, Yeon-seo.

297
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:51,790
Welcome.

298
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:55,180
He's the man of the hour today.

299
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:57,470
This is Mr. Ishikawa Seiji.

300
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:01,340
Ms. Lee, it's very nice to meet you.

301
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,350
Thank you.

302
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,450
Have a good time today.

303
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:15,860
Okay.

304
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,820
Why don't you escort Mr. Seiji, Yeon-seo?

305
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:21,970
Mr. Seiji, hello.

306
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,130
I'm Fantasia's artistic director,
Ji Kang-woo.

307
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,200
-Nice to meet you.
-I see.

308
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:27,610
Why don't we go in?

309
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:28,930
-Sure.
-Okay.

310
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,010
You're wearing the earrings.

311
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:33,630
How beautiful. They look great on you.

312
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,040
They don't suit my taste,

313
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:36,980
but I'm being considerate
for the gift-giver.

314
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,830
I'm very grateful.

315
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:41,640
Your attendance at the event means a lot.

316
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:44,990
You will make the official announcement
in front of the sponsors, right?

317
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,260
When will you announce it?

318
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,680
I'll announce it as soon as the show ends.

319
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:51,140
Don't worry, Yeon-seo.

320
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,640
Enjoy the event as much as you can.

321
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,540
I'll go check on the dancers.

322
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:14,680
Wait for me here.

323
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,150
I'll go inside first.
I can go in by myself.

324
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,340
-No, you can't.
-No.

325
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,160
Let me escort you.

326
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,190
Do not leave Yeon-seo alone

327
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,120
until I get there. Understood?

328
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:27,660
Just hurry back.

329
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:40,030
Hey, don't kid yourself.

330
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,880
I can walk just fine without you now.

331
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:44,380
I know that. I didn't say anything.

332
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,750
Let's go.

333
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,580
(Check for anything)

334
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,420
(that could fall around Young Lady first.)

335
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,660
(Like lights.)

336
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,610
Ms. Lee.

337
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:37,090
(Do you really think someone might be
trying to harm Young Lady?)

338
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,410
(But she's their family.)

339
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:40,170
Think about it.

340
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,330
The incident where the chandelier fell.

341
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:45,320
She was in a car accident.
And the light fell on her.

342
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,870
Scary things keep happening to her.

343
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,070
I'm just worried.

344
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,810
Attention.

345
00:25:58,170 --> 00:25:59,090
Don't get too excited.

346
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,470
-No injuries. Okay?
-Yes, sir.

347
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,750
The floor might be slippery.

348
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:04,590
-Apply a lot of resin.
-Yes, sir.

349
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,850
We'll get the sponsors to donate
a lot of money.

350
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:11,020
We're not here to beg for money.

351
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,560
Don't smile to make good impressions.

352
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:14,360
And don't overdo it
by looking too serious.

353
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:18,150
Just show them that what we do is worth

354
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:20,300
every cent they spend. That's all.

355
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:22,850
Okay? Keep up the good work.

356
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:06,150
It's an honor to meet
the legendary Ms. Lee

357
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,610
this up close.

358
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:12,790
Sure. Let us keep this good relationship.

359
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:14,990
What is this?

360
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,290
The world-renowned Ms. Lee is next to me,

361
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,400
but I can't even hold her hand.

362
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:23,480
I am so sorry.

363
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,830
Instead, choose a girl you like

364
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:29,070
among them.

365
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,000
I will

366
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:38,140
take her to you later
for a private meeting.

367
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:44,080
I like the one in the center.

368
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,070
I especially like her thighs.

369
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:50,590
Ballerinas all tend to be way too skinny.

370
00:27:55,560 --> 00:28:00,000
Ms. Lee, it is such an honor to meet you.

371
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,630
Will you please

372
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:06,340
show me a short performance?

373
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,160
That wasn't a part of our plan.

374
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:15,140
You should see that on a good stage.

375
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,600
We'll reserve a VIP seat for you
on her comeback.

376
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,920
Please interpret that.

377
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,520
She just declined.

378
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:29,090
She's being difficult.

379
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,920
If she truly is a genius,

380
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:37,400
she should be able to surprise
everyone with an improvisation.

381
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,240
Not bad at putting up with those jerks.

382
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,140
Eat up, Yeon-seo.

383
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,200
Bring what I prepared.

384
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,260
Yes.

385
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:11,810
(There won't be any security cameras
because it's a private party.)

386
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:21,270
(What's important is the people.)

387
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:23,250
(Don't miss anyone who looks suspicious.)

388
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,620
Who are you? What are you doing here?

389
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:35,830
Oh, I was trying to smoke.

390
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,290
I'm so sorry.

391
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,180
I know smoking is prohibited here,

392
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:41,030
but my hands began to shake.

393
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,970
No, I'm sorry.

394
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:23,620
Are you nervous

395
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,550
to stand in front of the sponsors?

396
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,560
I lived all my life
getting attention on stage.

397
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,140
Nervous? No way.

398
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,430
(What's important is the people.)

399
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,500
(Don't miss anyone who looks suspicious.)

400
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:41,390
Wait...

401
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,170
What's going on?

402
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,620
-What happened?
-Why did he fall?

403
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,620
I'm sorry.

404
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,480
-What was that?
-Goodness.

405
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,790
What are you doing?

406
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,590
Hey, just leave

407
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,090
before everyone stares at you.

408
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,660
(Make two more glasses. Hurry!)

409
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,510
It's okay. Get back to work.

410
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,850
Gwang-il.

411
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,180
Chairman Geum.

412
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:50,430
I was following the order
of the general director...

413
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,480
I know.

414
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,210
But you can't. Never.

415
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,350
You shouldn't hurt a person

416
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,370
no matter who gave you the order.

417
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,520
Why isn't he coming?

418
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:29,320
She'll be making a speech
after that segment.

419
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:31,650
Mr. Park won't come.

420
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,820
How do you know that?

421
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:42,570
What is this?

422
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:44,410
A sleeping pill? Sedative?

423
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,320
Were you going to

424
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:49,960
let Yeon-seo collapse
in front of everyone?

425
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:51,450
I told her that we shouldn't do it.

426
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,430
I told her that it cannot happen.

427
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,150
I mean it, Ki-chun.

428
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:21,950
You.

429
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,150
How much do you know?

430
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:27,450
You already know that Mr. Park
is a pushover.

431
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:29,560
Why do you keep taking risks?

432
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,850
Did you all enjoy the performances?

433
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,180
Your precious contribution

434
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:07,570
made Fantasia what it is today.

435
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:10,780
We truly thank you.

436
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:19,230
And now,

437
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:22,219
I would like to make
an important announcement.

438
00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:24,949
As of now,

439
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,460
I, Choi Yeong-ja,

440
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,080
who loved Fantasia with all of her heart,

441
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:37,100
who worked as

442
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,570
the general director of Fantasia,

443
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:41,980
will resign.

444
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,469
Let me introduce the lady

445
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,199
who will take charge of Fantasia's future.

446
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:57,820
Please welcome my lovely niece,

447
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,080
Lee Yeon-seo, with a round of applause.

448
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:49,250
I was trying to smoke.

449
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,680
What's going on?

450
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:01,180
My goodness!

451
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,030
What did you say

452
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:04,740
about their thighs and wrists?

453
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,630
You pervert.

454
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,020
Do you think ballet is pornography?

455
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:12,840
This isn't a brothel, you scumbag!

456
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:15,390
You speak Japanese?

457
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:17,680
I can even say "scumbag" in French.

458
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:19,000
What are you doing?

459
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,590
My goodness. What is it?

460
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,220
-Please!
-You...

461
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,820
You ignorant idiots!

462
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:29,910
Please, I beg you. Could you please

463
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,730
spend your filthy money elsewhere?

464
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:35,190
You guys make me sick!

465
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:39,810
Please, everyone.

466
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:43,730
Stop acting so sophisticated.

467
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,920
Sorry, sir.

468
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:50,060
Let's get out of here.

469
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,210
What's going on?

470
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:53,980
Where are you going, you perverts?

471
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:01,020
Shouldn't we put an end to this?

472
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:05,550
You Japanese geezer.
You wanted me to dance?

473
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:08,500
Where are you going? Where?

474
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:12,150
-Where are you going?
-Ms. Lee!

475
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:14,530
Fine!

476
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:16,950
I'll show you then.

477
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:18,750
Music!

478
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:21,520
Cue!

479
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:50,740
It's you again?

480
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,170
Yes. It's me.

481
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,760
It's always you.

482
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,570
You idiot.

483
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:52,860
Don't go.

484
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,820
Don't go.

485
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:26,610
Are you awake?

486
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:33,610
How did I come home yesterday?

487
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,600
Do you really not remember anything?

488
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:40,600
(You pervert.)

489
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:43,680
Do you think ballet is pornography?

490
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:45,790
You guys make me sick!

491
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,580
Darn it.

492
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:52,220
Where's Dan?

493
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:53,490
He took care of you all night,

494
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,650
then switched with me,
saying he had somewhere to go.

495
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:58,510
Were you in so much pain
that you had to drink?

496
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,460
Still, you said you'd be careful.

497
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:03,880
I didn't even have a sip of wine.

498
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:09,200
Ms. Jung, could you bring me my phone?

499
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,830
(Ji Kang-woo)

500
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,030
Please call Dr. Lee.

501
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,530
Are you feeling sick?

502
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:31,600
Is Lee Yeon-seo out of her mind?

503
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:34,990
That's why I told you that she was still

504
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:37,050
physically and mentally unstable.

505
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:40,440
And it seems to be getting worse.

506
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:42,070
That prima ballerina,

507
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,800
chairwoman, or whatever she may be,

508
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:47,880
swore in front of us
which was absolutely unforgivable.

509
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,910
But on top of that,
are we supposed to condone

510
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:53,950
that young artistic director's
brazen attitude?

511
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:56,190
Are we? Why?

512
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,860
Sir, will you please calm down

513
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:59,670
for my sake, at least?

514
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,560
It's also impressive

515
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:03,190
how you and your daughter maintained

516
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,180
your temporary positions for so long.

517
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,790
That mad heiress will
run this ballet theatre

518
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,150
and also perform?

519
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,350
Please give me a logical reason

520
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,680
why I should invest my precious money

521
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:17,440
in this preposterous ballet theatre.

522
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:21,710
Director Ji, say something.

523
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,520
Do as you please.

524
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,700
-What?
-What is he saying?

525
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:37,680
But if you back out now,

526
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,300
I won't allow you to become
a sponsor for "Giselle".

527
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,470
It's a chance for your name to be listed
under Korea's best performance.

528
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:47,450
This is your last chance.

529
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,090
Are you telling us not to miss out

530
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:52,340
on a chance to spend our money?

531
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,420
I will

532
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:01,880
no longer support this ballet theatre.

533
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,740
I don't know what you all may think.

534
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:06,940
But our company

535
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:09,580
will cease to do any business

536
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,480
that concerns Fantasia.

537
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:34,220
Director Ji.

538
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,970
-How is that possible?
-It's ridiculous.

539
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:43,680
-I can't believe it.
-Hey.

540
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,260
A strike?

541
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:54,460
Everyone on that ship saw it.

542
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:56,790
It's ridiculous for her
to become the prima ballerina.

543
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,770
What if she suddenly acts out
while performing?

544
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:00,490
Who will be responsible for her injuries?

545
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,290
Are you done?

546
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,580
Geum Ni-na.

547
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:07,050
Do you have anything to say?

548
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:09,330
I think it's a problem if the corps cannot

549
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,050
acknowledge the prima ballerina.

550
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:14,390
The prima ballerina should be someone
whom everyone can agree on.

551
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,180
I'm baffled.

552
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:21,520
I thought Lee Yeon-seo would be the one

553
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,650
to bail out, not you people.

554
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:28,250
Are you saying that she's going to quit?

555
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,270
No.

556
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:32,480
I'm talking about performing with you all.

557
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,370
I was worried she'd say

558
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:37,140
that she wouldn't be able to perform

559
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:39,250
with such an incompetent corps.

560
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:41,630
The five who performed "Spanish".

561
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:44,490
Did you know the angles of your elbows
were terrible?

562
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:45,720
Yi-geon.

563
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:48,050
I said not to smile or frown excessively.

564
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:50,610
But you had a stiff face all night long.
Were you at a funeral?

565
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:51,750
Geum Ni-na!

566
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:53,990
You were too focused on keeping the rhythm

567
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,550
that your dance moves were dull,
yet you mentioned acknowledging

568
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:58,040
and agreeing?

569
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,760
I couldn't feel anything.

570
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,170
Do you even listen to the music?

571
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:06,800
Do you even understand the story?

572
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:08,870
With Yeon-seo, she could just stand
in front of me,

573
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:12,120
and my body would feel electrified.

574
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:13,220
So how?

575
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:16,560
How are all your dance moves

576
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,160
so empty? How?

577
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:20,740
Why?

578
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:34,160
(With Yeon-seo, she could just stand
in front of me,)

579
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:37,290
(and my body would feel electrified.)

580
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:38,430
(So how?)

581
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:43,270
(How are all your dance moves so empty?)

582
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,030
(Why?)

583
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:53,920
This is awful.

584
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,010
I'm being awful to myself.

585
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,490
It's so awful that I'm not Yeon-seo!

586
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:03,950
What's there to yell about?

587
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,250
You're totally wasted in broad daylight.

588
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,370
Is that her?

589
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:19,790
Ms. Elena?

590
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:21,770
Ms. Elena!

591
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:24,410
Ms. Elena!

592
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:29,520
Ms. Elena!

593
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:31,760
Ms. Elena.

594
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:33,520
Ms. Elena.

595
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,190
Ms. Elena.

596
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,350
Ms. Elena!

597
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,000
Is that you, Ms. Elena?

598
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:43,330
It's me, Ni-na.

599
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:47,120
I learned ballet from you when I was a kid
for the first time. I'm Geum Ni-na!

600
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:49,540
Get lost!

601
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:50,590
I...

602
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,920
I thought about you from time to time.

603
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,210
I missed you.

604
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:57,460
I told you to get lost.

605
00:45:57,590 --> 00:46:00,230
The mere mention of Fantasia disgusts me.

606
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:01,720
It makes my blood boil!

607
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:02,910
Go away!

608
00:46:04,850 --> 00:46:06,390
I must be having a terrible day today.

609
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:25,790
A list of guests and agencies
that participated in yesterday's event?

610
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:28,870
Yes, there's something
I want to look into.

611
00:46:30,410 --> 00:46:31,550
Please.

612
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:34,850
That's too bad.

613
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:37,980
I can't share personal information
like that.

614
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:39,650
Then

615
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:43,350
why don't we investigate it together?

616
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,780
Investigate what?

617
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:48,540
Do you think that someone

618
00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:51,090
could have harmed Yeon-seo yesterday?

619
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:52,810
I would like to believe that I'm wrong.

620
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:54,300
That's why

621
00:46:55,490 --> 00:46:56,770
I want to look into this.

622
00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:00,070
Yeon-seo recently got her surgery.

623
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,740
And she worked too much to return.

624
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:03,010
Considering her circumstances,

625
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:05,350
a glass of wine is enough to push her
over the edge.

626
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:06,670
So you've already

627
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:09,090
made up your mind that it is completely

628
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:10,800
Yeon-seo's fault.

629
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:14,010
There's no reason to deny that.

630
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,290
Logically speaking.

631
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:18,900
I understand.

632
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:22,510
Actually, I expected

633
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:25,320
that you would be eager
to help me investigate

634
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:27,480
because you're her family.

635
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:29,210
(Artistic Director's Office)

636
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:34,400
What brings you here?

637
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:36,200
Director Ji isn't here now.

638
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,330
Excuse me.

639
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:41,700
What do you think you're doing?

640
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,340
Before I report you
for obstruction of business,

641
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:45,660
leave immediately.

642
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:55,610
I'll take care of him.

643
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:56,930
Just keep an eye on him for now.

644
00:48:58,690 --> 00:48:59,740
He's cute.

645
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,850
If I run the blood test now, I'll get
the result tonight at the earliest.

646
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:10,130
Please take care of it.

647
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:11,930
And you too.

648
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:12,940
Don't you worry.

649
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:15,850
I know a glass of wine won't
get you that drunk.

650
00:49:16,110 --> 00:49:17,120
Once we get the result,

651
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:18,880
we might be able to catch who it is.

652
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:42,470
I went to the ballet theatre.

653
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:45,770
How is it there?

654
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:48,760
Actually, it's so obvious.

655
00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:50,610
The sponsors probably demanded
to kick me out.

656
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:52,230
And dancers will be gossiping about me.

657
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,740
"She's unbelievable." "She was crazy."

658
00:49:58,310 --> 00:49:59,670
Everything will get resolved.

659
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,690
I believe that it wasn't your fault.

660
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:03,540
How will belief resolve anything?

661
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:28,840
My gosh, you look gaunt.

662
00:50:29,410 --> 00:50:31,750
Why are you here?
What do you want to know?

663
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:33,070
Don't be so cold.

664
00:50:33,150 --> 00:50:35,130
I barely managed to calm down
those sponsors

665
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:37,250
who wanted to barge in here.

666
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:38,570
What do they want?

667
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:39,970
Do they want me to kneel down?

668
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:42,040
It would be great if it was that simple.

669
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:54,930
Mr. Park.

670
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,940
(Withdrawal Agreement
on the Power of Attorney)

671
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:04,960
I truly did my best to help you.

672
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:06,500
When you weren't at your best,

673
00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:07,560
I tried to protect you

674
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:09,140
by extending the power of attorney.

675
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:11,120
And when you stubbornly asked me
to give it back,

676
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:13,190
I even announced that
I would be resigning.

677
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:16,360
You know what?

678
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:21,900
Power of attorney or extension.

679
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:23,400
Forget about those.

680
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:28,330
Give everything to me.

681
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:30,040
You must.

682
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:34,440
I don't need money from
those perverted sponsors.

683
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:36,640
I'll sell the house to pay for the show
if I need to.

684
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:37,830
That's enough, right?

685
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:40,870
It's not just about money.

686
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:44,430
They even said that if we should send you
to a mental institution.

687
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:47,510
They questioned how we could let a girl
who isn't in her right mind take over

688
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,450
this big foundation
and the ballet theatre.

689
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:50,550
I made

690
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:53,410
one mistake that day.

691
00:51:56,490 --> 00:51:58,780
Or it could be a trap that someone set up.

692
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:01,770
There you go again.

693
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:03,130
Who on earth

694
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:04,800
would set up this meticulous trap

695
00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:07,400
and go through all that trouble
just to kick you out?

696
00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:09,340
Oh, right.

697
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,680
The ballet theatre will go on a strike.

698
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:15,450
They can't perform with a girl like you.

699
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:16,640
You understand that, right?

700
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:19,190
Don't live in your memories
like an old lady.

701
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,080
You're not the same Yeon-seo.

702
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:23,940
No one is welcoming you back.

703
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:25,570
Do you get that?

704
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:27,110
Excuse me, ma'am!

705
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:29,660
Gosh, you startled me.

706
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:32,740
Did you just yell at me?

707
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:33,710
There is a saying.

708
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:36,350
"Throw out every kind or shape of evil."

709
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,550
"Greed gives birth to sin."

710
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,970
"When it's full-grown,
it gives birth to death."

711
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:43,170
Hey, Dan. What's the matter with you?

712
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:44,450
What's going on here?

713
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:46,080
Have both of you gone crazy?

714
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,790
I understand that you may
get carried away.

715
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,150
I know that temptation is strong,

716
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:52,810
but you're the only family Yeon-seo has.

717
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:56,630
Why don't you cherish her?
Why don't you love her?

718
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:59,890
How could you treat her no better
than a stranger?

719
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:02,790
Why do you hurt her like this? Why?

720
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:07,330
You are surely blessed with
having a loyal secretary.

721
00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:09,000
Mr. Jo and this guy now.

722
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:11,680
They'll do everything for you.

723
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:14,760
You must feel reassured
without your family.

724
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:19,160
Leave now.

725
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:20,790
Don't you ever come to see me.

726
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,430
I'll give you 12 hours.

727
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,580
Resign on your own.

728
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:30,210
If you continue to be stubborn,

729
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,270
all of the sponsors will leave.

730
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:34,210
And once the reputation of Fantasia
is marred,

731
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,670
this foundation your parents established

732
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:39,090
will vanish into thin air.

733
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:41,820
And the only person to stop that

734
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:43,980
from happening is me, Choi Yeong-ja.

735
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:47,190
Keep that in mind.

736
00:53:55,290 --> 00:53:56,780
Thank you for the juice.

737
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:19,270
It's almost ready.

738
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:22,390
Drink this and don't think about anything.
Just get some sleep.

739
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:32,550
Let's go upstairs.

740
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:14,220
What are you doing?

741
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:15,630
No, stop drinking.

742
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:16,990
Who do you think you are?

743
00:55:19,370 --> 00:55:20,470
Don't be such a fool.

744
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,580
Why are you doing this
after what happened yesterday?

745
00:55:23,110 --> 00:55:24,470
You requested a blood test.

746
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:25,620
When we get the result...

747
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:26,850
It'll be useless.

748
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:31,640
I'm sure someone put
a stimulant somewhere.

749
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:33,360
But

750
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:36,480
alcohol and sedatives were found
in your blood too.

751
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:38,330
Did you take any medications?

752
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:43,830
(Everything is mixed up, so they aren't
sure if it could be used as evidence.)

753
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:46,470
They can't find out if what I had was

754
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,580
poison, medication, or alcohol,

755
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:51,800
or who did it to me.

756
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:55,580
I must really have gone crazy.

757
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:57,030
It's all my fault.

758
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,660
I was going to keep my eyes open.

759
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:00,990
I wanted to make sure I protect you.

760
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:04,340
It's my fault.

761
00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:06,890
-No.
-You said

762
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,910
greed gives birth to sin.

763
00:56:11,590 --> 00:56:13,350
I guess it was greed for me to wish

764
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:16,480
to do ballet again.

765
00:56:21,410 --> 00:56:23,390
No. It isn't.

766
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:27,130
My first audience said

767
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:30,430
that my dance was the prettiest thing
he had ever seen in his life.

768
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:33,150
A kid who didn't know what ballet is

769
00:56:34,430 --> 00:56:36,190
became touched and cried.

770
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:38,350
(I know.)

771
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:40,370
(I felt that way too.)

772
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:44,730
I was so happy back then.

773
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,080
He helped me realize

774
00:56:50,310 --> 00:56:51,810
that I'm happy when I dance.

775
00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:56,560
But I'd forgotten that
for such a long time.

776
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,250
I finally

777
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,280
found my goal again,

778
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:06,200
but...

779
00:57:08,310 --> 00:57:09,410
it's too tough.

780
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:12,970
It's tough.

781
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:40,470
Young Lady.

782
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:45,310
Can't you just give up on everything?

783
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:49,930
I hate to see you suffer.

784
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:54,730
You don't have to keep dancing

785
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,020
for Fantasia.

786
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:01,680
If you need an audience to dance,

787
00:58:03,310 --> 00:58:04,580
I will watch you.

788
00:58:06,430 --> 00:58:07,400
Okay?

789
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,110
Should I?

790
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:15,940
Should I give up on everything,

791
00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:19,410
show my dance only to you

792
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:23,060
and live like that forever?

793
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:32,480
Okay.

794
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:41,460
I will give you my first performance.

795
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:44,800
This piece is called

796
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:46,820
"Giselle".

797
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:38,300
It's you.

798
00:59:51,110 --> 00:59:52,250
Kim Dan.

799
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:55,200
Yes, Young Lady.

800
00:59:57,970 --> 01:00:00,430
Why do you always save me?

801
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:06,200
You save me

802
01:00:07,430 --> 01:00:09,150
and help me out.

803
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:12,090
But why don't you like me?

804
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:16,760
Figures.

805
01:00:17,330 --> 01:00:19,750
No one in this world likes me.

806
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:23,400
I don't care about that.

807
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:29,250
But it's not okay for you

808
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,050
to not like me. I hate it.

809
01:00:34,890 --> 01:00:36,120
It's frustrating.

810
01:00:38,410 --> 01:00:40,080
You said I'm good.

811
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:42,980
You said I'm pretty.

812
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:45,750
But...

813
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:50,330
But why don't you like me?

814
01:00:51,210 --> 01:00:52,930
How can you not like me?

815
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:56,710
How?

816
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:59,310
Kim Dan.

817
01:01:39,210 --> 01:01:40,270
I...

818
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:44,140
cannot like you.

819
01:01:45,550 --> 01:01:46,650
And I...

820
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:51,530
can't stay by your side forever.

821
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:53,860
That really

822
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,280
breaks my heart.

823
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:58,350
Yeon-seo.

824
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:00,460
How can I

825
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:05,700
not like you?

826
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:22,290
Don't go.

827
01:02:25,850 --> 01:02:27,040
Don't go.

828
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:31,130
How do you really feel?

829
01:02:31,310 --> 01:02:33,820
Are you worried he isn't the real one?

830
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:36,460
Or are you wishing
that he isn't the real one?

831
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,100
I'm in huge trouble, aren't I?

832
01:02:51,550 --> 01:02:53,660
-What are you doing?
-No, what's with you?

833
01:02:55,420 --> 01:02:57,800
-Let go of me. Let go...
-You can't run away.

834
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:00,570
Tell me you'll disappear
from Yeon-seo's life now.

835
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:01,750
What are you talking about?

836
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:03,030
I warned you, didn't I?

837
01:03:03,290 --> 01:03:04,970
That I won't let you live
if you interfere.

838
01:03:05,050 --> 01:03:06,770
Who do you think you are to tell her

839
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:08,620
to give up on dancing?

840
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:11,610
I said, let go!

841
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:05,110
(Angel's Last Mission: Love)

842
01:04:06,650 --> 01:04:09,030
(You promised me that whatever you do,)

843
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:10,660
you'll do it to make Yeon-seo happy.

844
01:04:10,830 --> 01:04:11,710
(What's with me?)

845
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:13,030
He really gets on my nerves.

846
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:14,180
Hey, what are you doing?

847
01:04:14,270 --> 01:04:15,810
(No matter what you choose to do,)

848
01:04:15,890 --> 01:04:17,430
you are no longer alone.

849
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:21,090
(I'll make sure you like it.)

850
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:23,290
I'll make you love it.

851
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:28,740
(What are you doing to Yeon-seo?)

852
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:32,170
Mr. Kim. No. Angel Dan.

853
01:04:32,350 --> 01:04:34,290
Why are you here?
