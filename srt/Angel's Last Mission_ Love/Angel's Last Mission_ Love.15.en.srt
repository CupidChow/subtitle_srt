1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,730
You like fairness, don't you?

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:07,290
You take one thing

3
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:09,620
and give another.

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:12,880
Right?

5
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,780
If I must kill someone

6
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,950
for the sake of the one I wish to save,

7
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:33,430
then I will

8
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,340
commit that sin.

9
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,000
Take everything from me.

10
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,240
Anything.

11
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:47,680
I can give it to you gladly.

12
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:50,900
(Lee Yeon-seo and Kim Dan,
July 7, 2019, 2 p.m.)

13
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,040
(Wedding Day)

14
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,000
If you do not exist in this world,

15
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,500
do you think he would want to live?

16
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,480
That's not a reward. It's a punishment.

17
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:00,880
Live on.

18
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,050
Do that and stay by her side.

19
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,670
(Contacts, Lee Yeon-seo)

20
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:25,170
(Secretary Kim Dan)

21
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,640
You're actually worried
after you dropped the bomb?

22
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,430
You need to stop barging into my house.

23
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:35,910
Where are they, and what are they doing?

24
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,450
Did you

25
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,130
meet her?

26
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,830
Listen carefully
to what I'm about to tell you.

27
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,310
(Her fate was to be killed by the wicked.)

28
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,690
Are you

29
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,590
really going to kill me?

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,690
(No, I cannot accept that.)

31
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,300
(I'll change it.)

32
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,340
Why? Why are you doing this?

33
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:01,130
I told you to stay away from evil!

34
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,520
You must not meddle in human lives.

35
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,500
If you have blood on your hands,

36
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:47,860
you'll never be forgiven.

37
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,180
You will dissipate immediately!

38
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,540
In order to save her,
I need to get rid of those

39
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,690
who are trying to kill her.

40
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,020
That's the only way to change her fate!

41
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,210
Kim Dan!

42
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,019
Either way, I'll be dissipated.

43
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,220
If that's the case,

44
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,680
I'm going to save her first.

45
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,460
Hu.

46
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,740
You told me not to do it.

47
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,900
You said not to harm humans...

48
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,620
I told you before

49
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:56,870
that you changed me.

50
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,660
Hu.

51
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,370
I've lived such a long life

52
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:10,150
that I cannot even remember.

53
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,320
I've met countless humans

54
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,670
and just as many angels as well.

55
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:22,340
I was always a stranger and an onlooker.

56
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,520
I barely felt any emotions.

57
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,410
But you

58
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,710
completely turned me upside down.

59
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,260
Whenever I saw you,

60
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,820
I felt angry, anxious,

61
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,330
and frustrated.

62
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,060
Hu.

63
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:57,060
Don't do this. Please don't.
You can't do this!

64
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,070
Nevertheless, Kim Dan, I liked you.

65
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,400
You are a lifesaver.

66
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:11,140
Even if you had to cause trouble,
you saved the animals

67
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,690
and protected the weak.

68
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,430
You were always pure

69
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,300
and optimistic.

70
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,840
I wanted to return to paradise with you.

71
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,820
Hu.

72
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,340
No. No, don't go.

73
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,580
Kim Dan.

74
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,310
Never change who you are.

75
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,640
Go

76
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:44,970
and save Yeon-seo.

77
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:48,490
Hu. Hu!

78
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:24,880
Yeon-seo!

79
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,289
-Let me go.
-No.

80
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,530
Let me go!

81
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,980
Yeon-seo.

82
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,620
Is this why

83
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,100
you wanted to marry me?

84
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,440
Did you make me promise you
at the mausoleum

85
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,040
and practice with Ni-na alone

86
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,060
because

87
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,310
you were preparing yourself?

88
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,200
I can do anything to save you.

89
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,830
How can I live without you?

90
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,630
Then did you expect me to sit and watch?

91
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,310
When I knew I could save you?

92
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,690
When I knew you wouldn't dissipate?

93
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,760
What about after you die?

94
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,270
What about after that?

95
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,130
Kim Dan...

96
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:25,160
How am I to live

97
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,100
without you?

98
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,860
Kim Dan.

99
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,210
I'm here.

100
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,380
It's all right.

101
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:49,310
Hold on. Please.

102
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:52,220
Don't die.

103
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,300
I can't let you die...

104
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,490
because of me.

105
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:22,970
Kim Dan.

106
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:27,500
Kim Dan?

107
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,730
Kim Dan.

108
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,980
Please. No.

109
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,930
Please Kim Dan, please.

110
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,570
Please don't do this.

111
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:44,490
Kim Dan, get up. Kim Dan. No...

112
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:50,120
Please, Kim Dan. Please wake up!

113
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:54,480
No, Kim Dan! Don't leave me!

114
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:58,700
Don't do this to me! Please don't!

115
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,330
Kim Dan! No!

116
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,450
Kim Dan! Kim Dan! No!

117
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,280
No! Kim Dan!

118
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,060
What happened to you?

119
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,280
Where did you go?

120
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,660
Who did this to you?

121
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,250
Yeon-seo.

122
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,110
How did you know I was here?

123
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,870
Wait, no.

124
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,750
What on earth happened to Kim Dan?

125
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:12,350
Tell me everything you know.
Every single detail.

126
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:13,890
I think he was trying

127
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,400
to get rid of Geum Ru-na.

128
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,540
Because of me?

129
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,740
Because she might try to harm me again?

130
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,080
What are you guys doing?

131
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,020
Are life and death a joke to you?

132
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,390
I went to the church.

133
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,550
I heard someone was
transported to a hospital.

134
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,620
The floor was covered
with blood and the pills.

135
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,080
I was scared to death in case something

136
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,150
might have happened to you.

137
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,510
Unfortunately,

138
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,930
I'm too healthy.

139
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:47,950
I'll get going.

140
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,970
Both of you are fools.

141
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,880
You're awfully stupid and selfish.

142
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,390
Don't you dare judge us.

143
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:56,930
Do you know

144
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,650
how hard it was
for us to make this decision?

145
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,930
You're running away

146
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,870
because you don't want to be left alone.

147
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,300
That's not a noble act.

148
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,660
Don't fool yourself.

149
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:12,190
Why are things so complicated?

150
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,600
Noble act?

151
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,410
I don't need that.

152
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,680
I'm running away, you say?

153
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,220
What's wrong with that?

154
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,890
If I can save him,

155
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,360
I don't care
if I become a coward or lowlife.

156
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,020
I won't perform in the show.

157
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,870
Put on the show without me.

158
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,870
We have two days left until the show.

159
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,420
Tomorrow, the day after tomorrow,
and the day after that.

160
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,620
That's how much time Kim Dan has left.

161
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:44,050
He only has three days left.

162
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,080
I can't perform on stage.

163
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:48,580
I won't.

164
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:51,350
I won't stay away from Kim Dan
even for a second.

165
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,730
You've been informed.

166
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,270
Kim Dan!

167
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:12,300
When did you wake up?

168
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,450
What about your wounds? Are you all right?
Are you in pain?

169
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,240
Why won't you perform?

170
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,460
I don't need to. It's a waste of time.

171
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:49,920
Do it.

172
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,590
I don't want to.

173
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,080
Do the show.

174
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,930
-I don't want to.
-I came this far,

175
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,210
so you could dance

176
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,370
and live your life.

177
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,790
If you give up on that,

178
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,920
what have I done all this time?

179
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,240
You want me to live?

180
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,150
Is that why you tried to kill Ru-na?

181
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,000
Is that how you hurt yourself?

182
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,690
You tried to kill someone

183
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:16,800
to save me.

184
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:19,750
And you were ready
to be dissipated on that spot.

185
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,220
-Yeon-seo.
-Jerk.

186
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,740
Did you think I would be moved?

187
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,590
I'm not grateful at all!

188
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:31,410
No, had you disappeared after that,

189
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,610
I would have lived my whole life
resenting you.

190
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,190
I would've hated you

191
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,570
for disappearing and throwing away
the time we had

192
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,410
even if it was only for a day or two.

193
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:40,950
Look who's talking.

194
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:42,580
You were going to die too.

195
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:45,000
How could you?
How could you give away your life?

196
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,730
So what if I become a human after you die?

197
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,620
Did you think I'd be grateful?

198
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,160
This happened because of me.

199
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:54,420
You're in this mess because you saved me.

200
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,790
Because I wanted to live...

201
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,840
Because I said I wanted to live,
you have to disappear.

202
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,560
It's all because of me.

203
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,680
This is why I have to save you.

204
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,320
No.

205
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,120
I thought it had to be you.

206
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:16,110
If only one of us could live,

207
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:20,030
I thought it had to be you.

208
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,840
You've never had a life.

209
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:25,130
You didn't get to grow up.

210
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:29,220
Living a happy and healthy life...

211
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,850
Kim Dan, it has to be you.

212
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,330
I really want you to have that life.

213
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,520
Do you know how scared I was?

214
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,900
I thought that you were going to
die in my arms.

215
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,790
I was scared to death.

216
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,250
Don't die.

217
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,790
Please don't leave.

218
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,880
Don't disappear.

219
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,390
How could I live a happy life?

220
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,340
How could I live a healthy life?

221
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,819
Hu left me just like that.

222
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,970
And if you also die because of me,

223
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,640
how am I supposed to live?

224
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,700
What happened to Hu?

225
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,400
What happened to him?

226
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,470
Oh, no.

227
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:23,079
Oh, Kim Dan. You...

228
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,109
Poor you. Oh, no.

229
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,110
It might be completely empty.

230
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,970
Since Hu isn't here anymore,

231
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,990
that room could have disappeared too.

232
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,290
Wait here for me.

233
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,610
Let me go in and check.

234
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,500
Let me come with you.

235
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,200
Let's stay together.

236
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:05,950
What's this?

237
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,750
A report.

238
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,750
(Archangel Hu)

239
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,090
(I never thought
I would ever write my last report.)

240
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:27,330
(When was the first time
I went against Your will)

241
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,870
(and disobeyed You?)

242
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,390
Those young kittens are adorable.

243
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,770
(The more I crossed the lines,)

244
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,580
(the more I began to question.)

245
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:40,090
Angels are meant to be only bystanders.

246
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,200
If I can save her, I should.

247
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,430
That's a good deed.

248
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,280
And that's our job.

249
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,530
(I will never be able)

250
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,610
(to understand Your grand plan
for Kim Dan and her.)

251
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,040
(However, what I know for certain)

252
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,090
(is that they have earned their right.)

253
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,340
(They are struggling now.)

254
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,820
(Please.
I ask that you give them a chance.)

255
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:11,720
(Please.
I ask that you give them a chance.)

256
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:17,580
(Archangel Hu)

257
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:30,910
(Report)

258
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,510
Hu.

259
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,610
I really liked you too.

260
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,060
I wanted to become

261
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,060
an angel like you.

262
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:04,960
You are

263
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,880
cool even to the end.

264
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,850
I'm no match for you.

265
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,060
I won't forget you.

266
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,270
Never.

267
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:33,520
(Report)

268
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,730
Thank you.

269
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,270
Hu gave us

270
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:22,490
time as a gift.

271
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,450
We both couldn't have lived
if it wasn't for him.

272
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,950
Let's not waste our time,
not even for a moment.

273
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,160
Let's not get sick or die.

274
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,110
Let us be happy.

275
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,070
(It's because of him.)

276
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,840
Everything became a mess
after he showed up.

277
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,360
I won't let him live.

278
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:41,640
(Ni-na)

279
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,560
(Ru-na, where are you?)

280
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,990
I thought you wanted me to ignore you.
Why?

281
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,800
I was wondering if you're okay.

282
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:10,110
Ni-na.

283
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,100
Ru-na.

284
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,250
I'm sorry.

285
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:27,180
Ms. Geum Ru-na,
you're under arrest for murder,

286
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,600
attempted murder,
obstruction of business, and injury.

287
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,760
Geum Ni-na.

288
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,520
You...

289
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:34,750
Take her away.

290
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:48,080
-Anything in there?
-No.

291
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:04,450
Do not leave your residence
and be on stand-by.

292
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,770
Do you understand?

293
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:22,360
Yeong-ja, don't be like this.

294
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,230
I did so many wrong things.

295
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,780
It's my fault.

296
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:30,980
My greed

297
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:33,490
and covetousness

298
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:36,920
ruined my daughter.

299
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:40,710
What am I going to do? What will I do?

300
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,400
She was caught.

301
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:46,510
Geum Ru-na was arrested.

302
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,290
-When?
-Detective Ko just called me.

303
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,970
It's all finished. Everything is resolved.

304
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,510
There wasn't enough evidence.

305
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,270
I thought it'd be hard to get her

306
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,990
after Uncle Ki-chun took the blame.

307
00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:00,020
Ru-na's minion, the man named Ki Joon-soo,

308
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:02,090
is dead.

309
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,910
And they found everything on his phone.

310
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,010
There was proof

311
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:07,280
that he threatened
and controlled Moon Ji-woong,

312
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:08,950
and that he had a connection with Ru-na.

313
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:11,860
He has done all the dirty work
all alone for years.

314
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:13,530
Isn't he scared he'll get punished?

315
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:15,550
He was punished by fate.

316
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:18,550
No, someone punished him.

317
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,230
This is great.

318
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:24,180
You can solely focus
on your performance now.

319
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:27,210
Ms. Jung, I...

320
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,020
It's Director Ji.

321
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,750
Let's go and practice.

322
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:42,480
I thought I made myself clear
that I do not want to.

323
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:46,350
It's a shame
that I'm wasting my time on you right now.

324
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,720
-So...
-Even after Kim Dan leaves,

325
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,950
you will have to live on.

326
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,180
Watch your mouth.

327
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,410
He's right.

328
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,660
Kim Dan.

329
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:56,470
I want you to do that more than anyone.

330
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:59,900
For you to live on even after I leave.

331
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,850
Can't you think of this performance

332
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,960
as the last opportunity for you two?

333
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,550
It's the final chance

334
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:09,100
for your love to be heard in paradise.

335
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,360
What do you mean?

336
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:16,930
At first, I thought I could die in peace
after creating

337
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:19,790
a perfect performance of Seol-hee's dream.

338
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:23,840
That was my will,
and I wanted the deity to know.

339
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:26,830
That's why I was even more obsessed
about it.

340
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,300
I wanted to die that desperately,

341
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:31,850
but now I want to live.

342
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,530
Something like that happened to me too.

343
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:37,570
So please don't give up.

344
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,980
A miracle

345
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,530
may happen.

346
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,410
Listen carefully
to what I'm about to tell you.

347
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:59,740
Those two idiots
finally chose to risk their lives.

348
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,040
Where are they?

349
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,170
You still feel guilty, don't you?

350
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,580
Thinking that it's all your fault

351
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,780
that she died and you couldn't die.

352
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:19,850
You need to do something
to let someone live.

353
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:22,890
Help Yeon-seo live on.

354
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:27,070
That's the only way
your soul will find peace.

355
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,880
We can't be sure about this.

356
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,130
How should I dance?
What does it mean to perform well?

357
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,640
Then what will happen?

358
00:28:58,970 --> 00:28:59,980
Let's go.

359
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,400
To where?

360
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:04,950
Okay, right here.

361
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:07,720
Take a seat.

362
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:14,850
This is really the Tree of Prophecy?

363
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,040
Yes.

364
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:19,030
It helps you decide where to go
during the right time and moment.

365
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:23,120
Unbelievable.
A game of prophecy at a dead end?

366
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:28,090
Hey, there it is.

367
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:37,290
Is something written on it?

368
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,650
Here.

369
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,920
"July 11, Fantasia Ballet Theater"?

370
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,960
You really are like a cult leader now.

371
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,510
Can you just do it for me

372
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:05,230
without a prophecy or a sign?

373
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,350
I've never seen an official performance
of yours.

374
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,340
I want to see you jumping, twirling,

375
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:13,850
smiling, and crying on the stage.

376
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:17,240
Two days will fly by
if I practice and do the show.

377
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,570
Wouldn't that be

378
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,040
such a waste of time?

379
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,720
Not at all.

380
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:27,230
But come to think of it,

381
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,860
your dance marked our beginning.

382
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,040
The rainbow dance.

383
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:33,870
Your dance will mark our end as well.
It's perfect.

384
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,980
Don't say that it's the end.

385
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:38,360
Nothing's over yet.

386
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:40,690
-Let's go.
-You'll do it, right?

387
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:42,940
You'll be dancing, right?

388
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,710
I need to think about it.

389
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,610
Didn't you say
that we were running out of time?

390
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,720
(Report)

391
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,110
What are you doing?

392
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,940
I was about to write in my diary

393
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,560
since it's been a long time.

394
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,190
Don't bother.

395
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:38,150
I wrote so many reports,
begging him to turn me into a human.

396
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,050
But he set all my reports ablaze.

397
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:43,650
My gosh, that guy is...

398
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,460
No, that deity is unbelievable.

399
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,320
He's the most ill-tempered being
in the world.

400
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:51,090
If He wasn't going to read it,
why did He allow you to write anything?

401
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,890
Does He think this is funny?

402
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:56,460
That's exactly why
you don't need to write anything.

403
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:59,320
You don't have to put anything at stake.

404
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:02,400
What a pity.

405
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:04,730
Since I'll be dancing,
I was ready to bet on something.

406
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,880
I'm the most confident at dancing.

407
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:14,010
Are you going to perform?

408
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:18,110
Seriously?

409
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,250
Yes.

410
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:20,790
Really?

411
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,560
You made the right choice!

412
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:27,920
It's going to be so beautiful.
You'll do a terrific job.

413
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:30,340
How are you so amazing?

414
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,230
-Are you that happy?
-What? Of course.

415
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:52,780
Ms. Geum hanged herself with a blanket.

416
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:55,150
What? Call an ambulance!

417
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,300
Yes, sir.

418
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:02,770
(Ambulance)

419
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,030
It's great to see you all here.

420
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,630
We'll start the rehearsal
after warming up.

421
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:43,160
You'll finally be dancing tomorrow.

422
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:45,660
You're right.

423
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,500
Our last night is approaching.

424
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,700
I thought

425
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,120
it would last forever.

426
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:00,670
You're practically speaking like a human.

427
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,480
Is that right?

428
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,210
Do you remember

429
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:09,290
getting drunk and ranting at me?

430
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,940
That happened ages ago.

431
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:16,020
Imagine how upset I must've been
after you fired me.

432
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:18,050
I drank alcohol
when I couldn't even drink it.

433
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,800
For me, I think it was since that day.

434
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,570
Ever since the moment
you handed me your handkerchief

435
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:28,040
and told me to imagine that it was you.

436
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,949
I think I had already started liking you.

437
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:35,469
I danced with you back then
only because I was drunk.

438
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,290
Thinking back, I was quite bold

439
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,000
to have danced with you.

440
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:47,310
Let's relive that moment.

441
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:53,600
Imagine that it's our first time dancing.

442
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:56,239
What?

443
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:52,820
(July 11, Fantasia Ballet Theater)

444
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,760
The day we've been waiting for
is finally here.

445
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,090
Shall we, Young Lady?

446
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,110
I'll be back.

447
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:38,360
I'll be back too.

448
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:52,480
(June 11 to 12, 2019,
Fantasia Grand Theater)

449
00:36:56,490 --> 00:37:01,420
(Fantasia's Regular Performance, Giselle)

450
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:11,490
Excuse me for a second.

451
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:24,740
Thank you.

452
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,060
You look beautiful.

453
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:29,710
You truly look like Giselle
who has just woken up from her grave.

454
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,950
I hope you enjoy our show tonight.

455
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,710
The VIP seats are vacant.

456
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,990
The chairman, general director,
and associate director

457
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,350
are all absent,

458
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,800
so I'll be watching it alone.

459
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,780
It'll be a pleasant environment for you.

460
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:41,810
Our ballet theater
will get back on its feet soon.

461
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,300
Thank you for your patience.

462
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,150
I'll be looking forward to it.

463
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:46,690
I hope you keep your promise

464
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,670
about how you'll make us fall in love
with ballet.

465
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,410
I'm going to impress
both you and the deity above.

466
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,080
I'm confident.

467
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,200
I thought you'd be downcast.

468
00:37:58,130 --> 00:37:59,280
You're incredible.

469
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,510
I know this face.

470
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,980
Aren't you her secretary
who popped up everywhere

471
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,250
like Superman?

472
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,580
I'm her husband.

473
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:13,530
What?

474
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:16,170
Whose? You mean, her?

475
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,070
We got married last week.

476
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:22,550
I'm sure you all know already,

477
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:25,450
but let me introduce him
since you'll be seeing more of him.

478
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,640
This is my husband.

479
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,410
Good luck tonight.

480
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,170
He's amazing.

481
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,800
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

482
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:34,910
Congratulations!

483
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:47,850
Good job, everyone.

484
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,870
Before our show,

485
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:52,160
could our prima say a few words?

486
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:54,050
-That's okay.
-Huddle.

487
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,320
I thought I came second to none
in this world.

488
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:20,450
To be honest, I even wondered at times

489
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:22,650
if the deity loved me too much

490
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,280
and gave me everything.

491
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:27,580
I had no idea those were all delusions
and meaningless.

492
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:30,220
I've been waiting so long for this show.

493
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:33,610
And I'm truly honored
to take part with you all.

494
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:38,190
Today, I'm going to dance until I drop.

495
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:41,090
Let's make this performance

496
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,820
beautiful.

497
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,210
Fantasia. "Giselle".

498
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,920
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

499
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,210
-Good luck, Yeon-seo!
-You too.

500
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:02,740
She is seriously

501
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,110
the most beautiful, isn't she?

502
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,060
You're crazy about her.

503
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,560
Sure. Her beauty is enough
to make you stop breathing.

504
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,450
My Young Lady, Yeon-seo.

505
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,680
Thank you, Ms. Jung.

506
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:22,050
Why are you thanking me all of a sudden?

507
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:26,630
If Yeon-seo had a guardian angel,

508
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:28,520
it's probably you.

509
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:32,520
I hope you can continue
to take good care of her.

510
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:35,120
Gosh, you're making me cringe.

511
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:41,280
Be good to her just like
you've been doing so far.

512
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:43,480
If you make her cry or break her heart,

513
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:45,150
you'll have to deal with me.

514
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,060
Okay.

515
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:10,940
Good luck.
I'll be looking forward to your dance.

516
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,140
I heard you helped the police

517
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,200
arrest Ru-na.

518
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:18,810
Where did you hear that?

519
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:20,970
Are you all right?

520
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,630
It's hard.

521
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,400
But I have to overcome it.

522
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:30,430
Ru-na, Mom, and I should

523
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:32,580
face proper punishment.

524
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:35,530
Thank you.

525
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:05,190
(Watch me.)

526
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:08,090
(I'll show you the most beautiful
"Giselle" in the world.)

527
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,310
Sir!

528
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:53,370
Hold on.

529
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,550
I'm in stage management.

530
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,090
You're late.

531
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:57,410
Sorry.

532
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:25,940
What's going on? Why are you here now?

533
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:28,140
Slow down, Ni-na.

534
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:29,640
Did you run away?

535
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:31,480
You could say that.

536
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:33,420
Why? What are you plotting now?

537
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:36,150
It hurt my pride.

538
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,170
It's all because of one person.

539
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:40,280
I'm in this colossal mess
because of that person.

540
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:42,090
I ought to return the favor.

541
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,510
Who?

542
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:46,140
Yeon-seo?

543
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:47,890
Are you going after Yeon-seo again?

544
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:50,230
I told you that I didn't want you
to do this for me!

545
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:55,240
It's not Yeon-seo. It's that guy.

546
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:58,010
I realized this recently.

547
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:02,150
Losing the thing you cherish the most

548
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:04,700
can be infuriating and drive you to rage.

549
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:08,000
Yeon-seo should also feel what I felt.

550
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:10,950
Stop it, Ru-na.

551
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:13,370
Please turn yourself in! I'm begging you.

552
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:16,140
Watch.

553
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:17,590
Tomorrow,

554
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:19,840
you'll be Giselle.

555
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:24,410
If you don't want it,
report me to the police again.

556
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:56,430
Geum Ru-na is here now?

557
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:59,290
I already called the police.

558
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:00,740
They are on their way here.

559
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:02,770
Thank you, Ni-na.

560
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:04,000
But then again,

561
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:07,560
something was off about her.

562
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,370
She said

563
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,960
that she was after you, not Yeon-seo.

564
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,190
Be careful.

565
00:48:32,330 --> 00:48:33,570
Ni-na.

566
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:37,090
Did something happen?
Why are you so nervous?

567
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:38,450
What?

568
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:41,970
(I'm glad)

569
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:43,600
that it's me, not Yeon-seo.

570
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:47,600
Ni-na, please don't say anything
to Yeon-seo.

571
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:49,760
-But still...
-I'll catch her.

572
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:51,300
I'll handle it quietly.

573
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:53,850
Help Yeon-seo focus only on the show.

574
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:56,400
Please do this for me.

575
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:00,010
Nothing.

576
00:49:00,670 --> 00:49:01,770
It's nothing.

577
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:15,630
Yeon-seo.

578
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:19,720
Did you like the show?

579
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:21,920
How was it?

580
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,090
It was the best.

581
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,110
Act Two will be even better.

582
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,260
Enjoy it.

583
00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:29,490
Okay.

584
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:33,800
Kim Dan, actually, I wrote

585
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:37,150
a report yesterday.

586
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:40,840
(Report)

587
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,480
But it didn't disappear
even after I finished writing.

588
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:56,280
I guess He's going to answer my prayer,
not yours.

589
00:49:56,370 --> 00:49:57,340
Hey, what were you...

590
00:49:57,430 --> 00:50:00,070
Watch me, Kim Dan.
I'll never give up on you.

591
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:02,880
I'll pull off this show no matter what.

592
00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:05,960
And I'm going to protect you.

593
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:12,480
I have to get ready.

594
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:14,980
Yeon-seo.

595
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,240
I love you.

596
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:21,980
Me too.

597
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:42,130
Yes, where are you?

598
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:06,240
Yes.

599
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:09,150
I'll look for her until you get here.

600
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:54,600
Where is Yeon-seo?

601
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:56,750
I'm not sure.
Director Ji, we're about to begin.

602
00:51:57,990 --> 00:51:59,310
Everyone, let's go.

603
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:06,700
Let's go.

604
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:08,590
Me?

605
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:36,680
Everything is over. You need to give up.

606
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:39,180
It's not over.

607
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,560
I told you

608
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:44,020
that nice ones always lose
because they're too slow.

609
00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:53,480
This is your chance to kill me.

610
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:05,630
Isn't this great?

611
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:07,920
It can be self-defense
or accidental homicide.

612
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:09,940
This is enough

613
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:13,370
to let you live on in Korea
after killing a person.

614
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:27,360
Yes, kill me.

615
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,260
That's the only way
this agony will be over.

616
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:32,120
If you do not kill me,

617
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:33,880
I will go after Yeon-seo
until the very end.

618
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:35,370
Can I do that?

619
00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:12,110
Where have you been?

620
00:55:12,370 --> 00:55:13,560
I'm late.

621
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,720
You covered for me very well. Thanks.

622
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:16,990
Go out there.

623
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:18,930
Ni-na.

624
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:24,210
Can you fill in for me tomorrow?

625
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:27,420
Please do that for me.

626
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:38,910
(Please let me live.)

627
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,980
(Do not kill me.)

628
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,550
(Please.)

629
00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:03,940
Live.

630
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,850
Live and pay for your sin.

631
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:21,890
It was supposed to be you.

632
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:26,820
What do you mean?

633
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,890
I'll look for her.

634
00:56:42,530 --> 00:56:43,760
Hurry up and come.

635
00:56:47,850 --> 00:56:50,800
Why are you here?

636
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:53,970
You can't touch Kim Dan. Never.

637
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:57,490
Will you please

638
00:56:58,370 --> 00:57:01,230
stop this? Will you?

639
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:11,440
I hope you enjoy my present.

640
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:14,300
Let's go.

641
00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:09,870
(I must finish this dance. Please.)

642
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:12,860
(This is it.)

643
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:14,660
(This is)

644
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:17,650
(how I can save you.)

645
00:59:04,910 --> 00:59:06,270
(Did you see that?)

646
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,870
(No matter how hard I think about it,
I can't give up.)

647
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:14,060
(If my dance moved your heart,)

648
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:17,010
(then please grant me one wish.)

649
00:59:20,570 --> 00:59:22,030
(Please let Kim Dan live.)

650
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,360
(Even if we cannot be together,)

651
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:01,230
(even if my heart breaks,)

652
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:03,740
(even if I cannot see him again,)

653
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:08,620
(I just want him to be alive.)

654
01:00:39,990 --> 01:00:41,090
Yeon-seo.

655
01:00:43,470 --> 01:00:44,830
You came.

656
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:48,840
I thought I might not get to see you.

657
01:01:07,270 --> 01:01:08,330
No.

658
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:11,940
No, Yeon-seo.

659
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:14,970
I'm glad

660
01:01:16,070 --> 01:01:18,100
that I could save you.

661
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:24,650
I love you.

662
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:36,530
Yeon-seo...

663
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:39,870
Yeon-seo...

664
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:42,870
Yeon-seo. Yeon-seo, wake up.

665
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,780
Yeon-seo, wake up. Yeon-seo.

666
01:01:47,310 --> 01:01:48,280
Lee Yeon-seo!

667
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,300
Yeon-seo!

668
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:53,950
Wake up, Yeon-seo!

669
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:55,760
Yeon-seo!

670
01:01:57,170 --> 01:01:58,710
Yeon-seo!

671
01:02:00,910 --> 01:02:03,060
Yeon-seo!

672
01:02:30,030 --> 01:02:33,510
(Angel's Last Mission: Love)

673
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:36,810
(You will become a human.)

674
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:38,610
(I said I'd protect her.)

675
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,230
(Yeon-seo won't die.)

676
01:02:43,590 --> 01:02:45,040
(She'll never die.)

677
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:49,700
(I hope you think of this
as if I'm on a trip.)

678
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:55,860
(I will miss you so much.)
