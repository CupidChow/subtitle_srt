1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,940
(I want to be with her.)

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,230
(After I left,)

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:07,960
(the urge became stronger.)

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,400
(If there is just one reason why
I am allowed to do that,)

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:14,780
(then please)

6
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,290
(let me find that reason.)

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,160
(I don't care where that road leads me.)

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,590
(I will gladly go down that road.)

9
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,910
(You said you were going to do well.)

10
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,590
You said you'd show me
a great rendition of "Giselle".

11
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:48,750
Was this it?

12
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,650
I just followed my heart, that's all.

13
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,030
There is someone
that you just cannot hate,

14
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,530
no matter how hard you try to hate them.

15
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,030
Is this still about Kim Dan?

16
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,260
Is he the problem?

17
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,950
Pull yourself together.

18
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,710
I've gone through a breakup too.

19
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:08,630
I've lost someone dear to me,
lost my mind, and struggled before too.

20
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,750
I'm saying those emotions

21
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,030
that you feel right now
are nothing special.

22
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,100
Then you must know this well.

23
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,820
I believe this is correct.

24
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,580
I get angry, then I resent him.

25
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:20,380
But in the end, I just miss him.

26
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,320
And that's why I'm sad.

27
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,870
You can never get anything done
with sadness!

28
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,350
If Giselle and Albrecht
were truly in love,

29
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:31,340
then they should die together in the end.

30
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,960
It must be her.

31
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,380
The one who was put to rest at a temple.

32
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,050
The ballerina.

33
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,160
Stop talking nonsense.

34
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,140
That has nothing to do
with the performance.

35
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,080
Please

36
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,450
do not disappoint me anymore.

37
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,970
(Kim Dan)

38
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,460
(A missed call from Noisy Gong)

39
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,430
(Missed calls from Noisy Gong)

40
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:43,630
(Hey, Noisy Gong.)

41
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,480
You can roam about all you want.

42
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:46,750
Start dancing

43
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,340
and stop losing your temper.

44
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,920
(Missed calls from Noisy Gong)

45
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,880
How dare you save my name as Noisy Gong?

46
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,780
(Okay, come to me.)

47
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,430
Focus on me.

48
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,590
Just think

49
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,010
that it's just you and me
alone in this world.

50
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,470
Okay?

51
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,900
(Your nose is running.)

52
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,710
I knew it. I can never sleep well

53
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,520
whenever I sleep in a different place.

54
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,970
I want to go home.

55
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,810
At this hour?

56
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,370
The secretary quit just
because he wanted to,

57
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:39,920
and the boss's heart
is shaken to the core.

58
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,250
Goodness, my poor life.

59
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,300
What's wrong?

60
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,620
What is it?

61
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,270
You already know that your employees
clean up night and day.

62
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,030
Why did you turn this place upside down?

63
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,260
Go back to sleep.

64
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,270
I can do this alone.

65
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,180
Did you have a dream
about the man who must not be named?

66
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,440
I can't believe this.

67
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,200
I thought you looked fine for a few days.

68
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,150
I did have a dream.

69
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,480
But it's not like that.

70
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,040
Clean more.

71
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,640
Until all the dust and your regrets
disappear, vacuum as much as you want.

72
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,050
It's not like that.

73
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,300
I dreamt of my childhood days.

74
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,390
"Childhood days"? When?

75
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,150
Why?

76
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,570
I'm not sure.

77
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,680
Why did he appear in my dreams?

78
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,630
I had completely forgotten about him.

79
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,520
It's probably because you're in distress.

80
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,370
You have no one to rely on.

81
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,080
You should go and get some fresh air.

82
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,840
Reminisce the good, old days.

83
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,440
If possible, meet an old friend too.

84
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,930
The audition is coming up.

85
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,820
That's why you be
in the right state of mind.

86
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:54,720
I'm already in the right state of mind.

87
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:58,409
How can you say that when you're
torturing yourself at this hour?

88
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,590
Every time you were in distress,

89
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,570
that place gave you peace.

90
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,160
Who knows?

91
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,600
You might magically
find a solution there once again.

92
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,720
Where are you?

93
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,350
(I called the office.)

94
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,750
I'm going to take the day off.

95
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,070
Where are you?

96
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,540
(Let's talk. I'll explain everything.)

97
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,780
About why it had to be a tragedy and why

98
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,060
(it had to be you.)

99
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:36,250
I wish I could dream
the same dream as you.

100
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:41,130
(But you know very well
that we can't force it.)

101
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,950
I'll start from square one.

102
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:48,700
So please reconsider my dance.

103
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,120
You haven't answered me. Where are you?

104
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,320
-I'll go there.
-I'll see you later.

105
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,450
I'll go this way.

106
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,130
The way that makes you look pitiful?

107
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,350
You're only going to lose
your woman that way.

108
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,670
She'll be disgusted.

109
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,170
I thought you were determined,
but you're actually indecisive.

110
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,290
What should I do?

111
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,570
Should I burn everything down?

112
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,390
Or should I drown them all?

113
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,080
Who are you? Where are you from?

114
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,860
You're like fire.

115
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:54,390
Hey, do you know me?

116
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:57,120
You shouldn't pick fights with anyone.

117
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,570
Come to your senses.

118
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,800
I came here to find out.

119
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,960
She was worried about nothing.

120
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,080
(Lee Yeon-seo, Yoo Seong-woo)

121
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,390
Why

122
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:00,040
are you here?

123
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:05,630
I came to look for something.

124
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:08,660
The thing is, I prayed.

125
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,980
I wanted to know the reason.

126
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,270
And

127
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,470
I realized what it was.

128
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,300
But it pains me.

129
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,030
What are you talking about?

130
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,140
Well...

131
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,840
-It's...
-Forget it.

132
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,640
You don't need to tell me.

133
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,770
Don't follow me.

134
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,700
Pray or do whatever you need to do.

135
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,200
And I'll do what I need to do.

136
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,900
How could he seriously not follow me?

137
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,220
Fine.

138
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,030
I don't know you either.

139
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,920
We're strangers.

140
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:11,710
(Lee Yeon-seo, Yoo Seong-woo)

141
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,960
(Lee Yeon-seo, Yoo Seong-woo)

142
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,350
Welcome. Do you need a room?

143
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,330
(Ocean Garden Inn)

144
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,420
I have something to ask you.

145
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,810
Do you know the house with a blue gate?

146
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:41,500
It's been a while since I came,
so I don't know the way.

147
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:44,540
There are many houses with blue gates.

148
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,340
A long time ago...

149
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,280
About a decade ago,

150
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,480
a little boy used to live there.

151
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,560
By the way, you look familiar.

152
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,580
Who are you? Are you a celebrity?

153
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,350
No, ma'am. I'm a ballerina.

154
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,730
I came here before.

155
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,870
You visited for several years.

156
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:08,120
You danced in front of the villagers.

157
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,670
There were children as well.

158
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,310
I'm looking for someone
whom I met back then.

159
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,200
Tell me in detail.

160
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,880
That way, I can help.

161
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,680
I met him

162
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,450
on a rainy day.

163
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,660
(There was a sun shower
during my first day here.)

164
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:35,660
(I came out because
the rain sounded like music.)

165
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,540
(And then, I saw him.)

166
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,720
(He was standing)

167
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,320
(over a cliff.)

168
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,400
(I wanted to die.)

169
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,540
(I thought it'd be better if I died.)

170
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:53,920
(I was merely 12 years old.)

171
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,510
(Hey, you over there!)

172
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,150
Be careful!

173
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,390
(And then,)

174
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,040
(I met you.)

175
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,390
I'm Yeon-seo. Lee Yeon-seo.

176
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,760
What about you?

177
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,380
My name is

178
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,850
Seong-woo.

179
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,520
Yoo Seong-woo.

180
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:45,970
7, 8, 9, 10.

181
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,310
I'm coming for you!

182
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:50,680
Where are you?

183
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,300
You scared me!

184
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:07,970
You can see better now, right?

185
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:11,670
You're always falling down because
your bangs were covering your face.

186
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,430
Thanks.

187
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:16,420
Hey!

188
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,210
Is that me? You're awful at drawing.

189
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,010
It's not you.

190
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,310
(Is that it?)

191
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,070
You hung out for a couple of days?

192
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,910
Goodness.

193
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,730
-What is it?
-What's going on?

194
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,800
She's looking for someone after ten years.

195
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,880
He's a boy named Seong-woo who used
to live in the house with the blue gate.

196
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,300
Is today a special day?

197
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,590
Is this some kind of a treasure hunt?

198
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,610
If that's all you two did,

199
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,280
that boy will probably not remember you.

200
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:55,320
No.
Unless he's suffering from memory loss,

201
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,030
he will remember me.

202
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,930
Oh, my. How are you so confident?

203
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,720
No! I don't want to!

204
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,830
(I was told to go to Russia
out of the blue.)

205
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,770
I will never go.

206
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,350
I don't want to.

207
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,910
I'm going to quit doing ballet too.
I hate everything.

208
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,850
(What does a 12-year-old know?)

209
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:17,100
(I didn't want to be apart
from my parents)

210
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,960
(nor did I want to say goodbye
to my very first friend,)

211
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,110
(so I just hid.)

212
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,580
Your nose is running.

213
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,500
That's amazing.

214
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,300
I can't believe
you're going abroad to dance.

215
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,840
Are you even listening to me?

216
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,440
I will never go.

217
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:03,210
You said you enjoyed dancing.

218
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:05,800
You said you wanted to become
the best ballerina in the world.

219
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:07,920
If I go there, I won't be coming back.

220
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,910
You might not be able to see me
for the rest of your life.

221
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,670
I'll write to you.

222
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:20,540
(How have you never seen
a rainbow before?)

223
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,710
(I'll show you a rainbow.)

224
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,160
Why are you crying?

225
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:53,670
Were you disappointed?

226
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,350
That was so pretty.

227
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,970
That was the prettiest thing
I've ever seen.

228
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:12,070
(I wanted to live for the first time)

229
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,840
(in my life after meeting you.)

230
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,300
(You were beautiful.)

231
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:21,170
(I wanted to see more
beautiful things in life.)

232
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,780
(He understood what I wanted to say
with my dance.)

233
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,190
(He taught me)

234
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,400
(how my dance could touch)

235
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,900
(someone's heart.)

236
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,560
(I wanted to become an adult.)

237
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:45,900
(A strong and powerful adult)

238
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,910
(who could protect her.)

239
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:51,890
(I)

240
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,870
(really want to meet him again.)

241
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:00,600
It's him. He's the guy from
the house with the blue gate.

242
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:03,410
He had those big black gleaming eyes.

243
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,170
That's him. Do you know him?

244
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,630
Seong-woo. Yoo Seong-woo.

245
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:09,089
Hasn't it been over a decade
since that house became vacant?

246
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,940
Did he move? Where did he move to?

247
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,349
Do you happen to know his number?

248
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,240
I don't know.

249
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:17,010
He just disappeared one day.

250
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:19,170
My gosh, you're so forgetful.

251
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,710
How many times must I tell you?

252
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,470
That boy died.

253
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,050
Wasn't that the boy?

254
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,190
That's right.

255
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,869
What do you mean?

256
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,620
Why would he die?

257
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,360
No

258
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:38,700
Why?

259
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,740
Why?

260
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,310
How did you hurt your arm?

261
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,070
I fell.

262
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,060
(His dad used to hit that boy.)

263
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,880
That's why he jumped into the sea.

264
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,300
(The police came to arrest his dad later.)

265
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,150
But his dad

266
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,740
packed up his stuff and left the island.

267
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,210
Exactly. Poor kid.

268
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,510
-No.
-I wish I was wrong.

269
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,100
That's why I forget that all the time.

270
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:11,130
I forget it because it's too horrible.

271
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,380
(You brat!)

272
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,180
You little rat.

273
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,500
You come back here.
I'll teach you a lesson.

274
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,320
Darn it. This rat!

275
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:48,260
Where did you hide?

276
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:11,550
As you instructed,

277
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,940
I looked into each dancer's family
and finances.

278
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,520
Thank you.

279
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:21,940
I knew I could rely on you.
You're the best, Mr. Park.

280
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,700
Why do you need this now?

281
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:27,610
It's natural for a general director
to be interested in her dancers.

282
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,300
Every vote from each dancer
is very valuable.

283
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:33,030
I must look out and care for them too.

284
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,800
Are you planning to buy

285
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,510
their votes for the audition?

286
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,320
Why would you choose such a word?

287
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,160
I'm just sponsoring them.

288
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:43,630
That sounds scary, you know.

289
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,880
You've done so much for me, Mr. Park.

290
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,440
I have been inattentive to you lately,
haven't I?

291
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:01,930
What's this?

292
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,220
I heard your second child
will begin school this fall.

293
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,070
It's been a while since you've seen them.

294
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:08,840
Why don't you go to England
and see your kids?

295
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,350
Well, let's see.

296
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,060
Three months will be enough, right?

297
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:16,190
Of course, this will be a paid vacation.

298
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,290
Don't worry.

299
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,340
If I go,

300
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,120
will you get rid of me
before anyone finds out?

301
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,460
Just like Moon Ji-woong three years ago?

302
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:25,820
Mr. Park.

303
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:28,200
-Why would you bring him up?
-General Director Choi.

304
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:30,090
Even a fly has its anger.

305
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,860
And a rat bites a cat when it's cornered.

306
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,250
-Mr. Park.
-Please

307
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,890
stop threatening me.

308
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,990
I mean it!

309
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,610
My gosh.

310
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,810
What did I do to him?

311
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,180
Is offering him a bonus

312
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,420
and paid vacation considered wrong?

313
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:01,550
Why isn't he here?

314
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,620
He's gone.

315
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:09,120
Why aren't you here, Seong-woo?

316
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:23,200
(What are you doing here?)

317
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:42,910
He

318
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,030
died.

319
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,420
After I left,

320
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:53,600
he died.

321
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:57,610
He didn't even write back to me,

322
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,550
so I really hated him for it.

323
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:02,490
And

324
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:06,230
I had completely forgotten
about him afterward.

325
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,050
But...

326
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,570
But he...

327
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,340
It's not your fault.

328
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:21,190
Why didn't I know?

329
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:23,870
He didn't even have shoes on.

330
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,820
And he was standing there
when the waves were coming.

331
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,950
His hair was long and unkempt.

332
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,280
And his body was covered in bruises.

333
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,010
It's not your fault.

334
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,250
No.

335
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,190
It is my fault.

336
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:41,520
Everything was a signal.

337
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,350
But I didn't pick up on the signals.

338
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,920
When he was so determined
to become a grown-up,

339
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,110
I laughed at him and teased him for it.

340
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,710
I told him becoming a grown-up was
a natural thing for kids,

341
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,820
and he didn't have to try to be one.

342
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:01,400
But for him...

343
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,430
For him...

344
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:38,940
Don't beat yourself up for it.

345
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,220
It was probably

346
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,780
his destiny.

347
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,540
"Destiny"?

348
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:49,580
That's simple and brutal.

349
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,940
He must've been scared
and terrified his whole life.

350
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,270
I can't imagine how scared

351
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:00,140
he must've been to his last moment.

352
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:03,440
Just thinking about it makes me crazy.

353
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:07,540
Destiny?

354
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:11,890
No, that boy, Seong-woo...

355
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,580
That kid...

356
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,330
He probably thought of you

357
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,410
at the last moment.

358
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:24,960
To the very last moment,

359
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,550
until the last breath that he took.

360
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:29,670
How

361
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,390
do you know that?

362
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:38,730
I just have a feeling.

363
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,110
The only good memories he had

364
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,130
were the moments with you,

365
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,240
so I'm sure he thought of you.

366
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:47,930
I'm sure of it.

367
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:50,920
Really?

368
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:53,600
I bet that he's grateful

369
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:55,100
knowing that you're the only one

370
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,970
who still remembers him.

371
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,560
I'm sorry I'm late, Seong-woo.

372
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,420
I didn't know.

373
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:35,970
I couldn't even imagine such a thing.

374
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,470
I'm so...

375
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,170
I'm so sorry.

376
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,910
Why aren't you praying?

377
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:56,260
Why don't you ask your deity
whom you're so fond of?

378
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:59,120
Why did He give

379
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,150
a 12 year old so much pain in his life?

380
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,190
If a deity really exists,

381
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,070
I'm sure there is no way

382
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:16,230
he would have been so alone to the end.

383
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,430
You're right.

384
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,880
Why was He

385
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:25,160
so harsh?

386
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,760
I'm sorry.

387
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,360
For what?

388
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:04,980
For everything.

389
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,240
For saying mean things
and hurting you that day.

390
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,130
For now.

391
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,890
For everything.

392
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,920
That means

393
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,740
you won't come with me.

394
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:22,940
You can't

395
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:25,930
do this to me too.

396
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,080
My mom, dad, Mr. Jo,

397
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,850
and even Seong-woo.

398
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:39,080
Everyone that I loved

399
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,340
passed away first and left me here alone.

400
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:45,070
I couldn't even say a proper goodbye.

401
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,940
Do you know
what it feels like to be left behind?

402
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:54,170
It feels like I'm abandoned alone
in an endless desert.

403
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:55,670
So

404
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,650
can you

405
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:00,950
stay by my side?

406
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,810
Do you remember

407
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,590
how you were going to grant my wish?

408
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:12,650
Then grant my wishes. Just three of them.

409
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,120
You'll have to do

410
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:17,230
what I ask you to do without complaining.

411
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,350
I'll use the 2nd wish out of the 3

412
00:29:21,670 --> 00:29:22,910
right now.

413
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,720
Why are you suddenly bringing up a wish?

414
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,350
Give me some time.

415
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:28,890
Just a little.

416
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:31,490
If you give me just a bit of time,

417
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,920
I'll take care of everything
and return to you.

418
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,600
So don't ask me anything right now.

419
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:39,320
What do you have to take care of?

420
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:40,640
What is it?

421
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:43,500
Tell me what it is, so I can help you.

422
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,910
What is it?

423
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:49,220
That...

424
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,250
That's the thing

425
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,130
you gave me to help me
be all right without you.

426
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:57,230
I promise you.

427
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,250
It won't take long.

428
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,490
I will come back.

429
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:03,650
Until then, eat well,

430
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,320
practice well,

431
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,210
and be brave.

432
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:10,690
That's my wish.

433
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,000
Can you do that?

434
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:30,810
Director Ji, what brings you--

435
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,740
Please stop crying because of that jerk.

436
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,910
What do you think you're doing?

437
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:41,500
That's enough.

438
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:44,850
Don't waste your heart on a guy
who keeps running away.

439
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:48,500
I know you depended on him
when you were ill and weak.

440
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:49,860
But not anymore.

441
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,150
I will not let you cry over
a guy like him.

442
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,830
-Who do you think you are?
-Lean on me.

443
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,560
I won't run away

444
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:00,380
or disappear.

445
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:06,890
Let me make myself clear.

446
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:09,000
I'm uncomfortable if you keep doing this.

447
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:10,500
I know you helped me

448
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,740
make my comeback
and that you led me out here.

449
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:14,060
I'm grateful for that.

450
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:16,310
But you did that as a director.

451
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:18,290
Do not cross the line.

452
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,060
Who I rely on and whom I cry over

453
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:22,420
is my decision.

454
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:25,630
You don't have any right
to meddle with my feelings.

455
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,450
I hope

456
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,000
something like this never happens again.

457
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,300
Let me apologize if I startled you,

458
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:37,430
but I can't promise that
it won't happen again.

459
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,120
I meant it when I told you to lean on me.

460
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:42,660
-Director Ji.
-I will

461
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,170
stop here for today.

462
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:46,970
Let's go.

463
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:14,740
Thank you for giving me a ride.

464
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:15,880
Good night.

465
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,930
Yeon-seo.

466
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,220
I'll see you at practice.

467
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:05,420
(Choi Seol-hee)

468
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:12,989
You once told me that life
was full of surprises.

469
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:16,690
I had no idea

470
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,520
this day would come.

471
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:21,840
(Choi Seol-hee)

472
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,980
I thought

473
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:25,139
I'd always roam around

474
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,860
like a ghost,

475
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:29,889
neither alive

476
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,659
nor dead.

477
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:37,500
I guess I've also become

478
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,139
a trivial human.

479
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,320
Give me some time.

480
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:53,250
I promise you.

481
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:26,380
Is this your answer

482
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,830
to my prayers?

483
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,680
(Why were you only watching me?)

484
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:43,450
(Why did you make me die
in the midst of pain?)

485
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:46,750
(Why did you even let me)

486
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,950
(be born then?)

487
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,400
(Why did you let me)

488
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:56,430
(remember everything?)

489
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,170
I've found a new secretary for you.

490
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,500
I thought we could have the interview
next week.

491
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,550
Cancel it.

492
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,340
I know you trust me so much,

493
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:35,330
but I seriously can't live here.

494
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,560
Kim Dan

495
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,360
is going to come back.

496
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,180
Are we allowed to say his name again?

497
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:44,300
Can I say, "Kim Dan"?

498
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,430
Hold on. Did he call you?

499
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:51,430
He said he'll return.

500
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,150
He promised me.

501
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,390
This is unbelievable. When?

502
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,420
When will he come back?

503
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,780
I'm not sure about that.

504
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,950
Anyway, I don't need a new secretary.

505
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,360
I'm going to wait for him.

506
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,670
Look at her.

507
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,700
Was that your magical solution?

508
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,110
Let's talk.

509
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,500
Watch how you act.

510
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,000
What?

511
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:30,240
Just because

512
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,660
the troupe is back doesn't mean
they're on your side.

513
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:35,480
I know that.
I can feel it during practice.

514
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,150
Then you should've been more careful.

515
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,510
You ditched practice

516
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,580
and met with Director Ji in private.

517
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,520
What would people think

518
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:45,860
What? Do you think
he and I are seeing each other?

519
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,810
If that's the case, just be honest--

520
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,300
Don't be ridiculous.

521
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,720
It's nothing like that.

522
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,860
You gave us no choice.

523
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:58,180
We went on strike

524
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:01,480
because Director Ji was abnormally
persistent about choosing you.

525
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,900
You just need to be careful.

526
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:07,070
If you jeopardize the troupe's
relationship with Director Ji--

527
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,210
Geum Ni-na.

528
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:11,420
Do you like him?

529
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:17,980
What did you say? That's ridiculous.

530
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:20,440
I just have great respect for him.

531
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:21,500
You're

532
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,480
terrible at hiding your feelings.

533
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:26,690
Don't put this on me
because you feel cornered.

534
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:27,660
I'm...

535
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:28,760
I'm just...

536
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:31,880
Right.

537
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,930
I'm doing this because I can't condone
such a dirty rumor spreading in Fantasia.

538
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:39,050
Then don't confront me about it
and find those who spread that rumor?

539
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:42,400
I've never cheated
nor have I done anything shameful.

540
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:43,720
I don't need to.

541
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,360
What is this about?

542
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,850
It's nothing. We were just--

543
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:58,330
There's a rumor
about you and I being lovers.

544
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:02,420
I think you just need to do
what I asked of you.

545
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:06,160
-You remember it, right?
-I told you that I won't be able to.

546
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,410
Don't bring your emotions into work.
Be professional.

547
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,650
Don't worry about that.

548
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:17,420
Who spread such a ridiculous rumor?

549
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,710
Well...

550
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,780
All right. Let's hurry and begin.

551
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:00,800
Drop your shoulders.

552
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,450
Dad, why are you out here?

553
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:31,520
I was waiting for you.

554
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,230
I haven't been able to see you these days.

555
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:35,340
Dad.

556
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,690
Drink some broth.

557
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,980
Your body needs to be warm
to be energized.

558
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,520
Thanks, Dad.

559
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:47,310
It's hard, isn't it?

560
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:52,500
Don't torture yourself
because of Yeon-seo.

561
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,220
She's a poor kid.

562
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:57,340
You always say that.

563
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,060
She isn't poor.

564
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:01,260
She's pretty, wealthy, and talented.

565
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:05,130
I'm certain that the deity only loves her.

566
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,860
If the deity truly did love her that much,

567
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,050
He wouldn't have taken

568
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,940
her parents away from her that early.

569
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:13,710
What good is it that she's pretty,

570
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,340
wealthy, and talented?

571
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:17,270
She went through a horrific experience.

572
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:19,960
She's an unlucky, miserable girl.

573
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:21,850
So Ni-na,

574
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,750
you should take care of her.

575
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,830
Whose side are you on?

576
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,300
I'm forever on yours,

577
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:33,420
so I need you to be on her side.

578
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:35,530
No.

579
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:37,470
This is my first time

580
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,360
being in a real competition against her.

581
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:41,780
I can't be on her side.

582
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,020
There's a reason why karma exists.

583
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,410
No matter what you do,

584
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:54,590
whether it's good or bad,
it'll all come back.

585
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,490
You and Ru-na

586
00:41:58,410 --> 00:41:59,950
must be safe.

587
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,810
What do you mean?

588
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,750
You guys need to be kindhearted
like you are now.

589
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:24,150
You want all of them?

590
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,710
There aren't many people in the troupe.

591
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:29,920
About 3 to 4 days will be enough, right?

592
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:32,160
What a hassle.

593
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:36,300
I wish there was a simpler
and more effective way.

594
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,600
I've considered appointing new judges,

595
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,970
but we sounded very confident
in front of the troupe.

596
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:44,830
Collecting their votes like this
is quicker and more effective.

597
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:48,050
Do this for me, Assistant Director Geum.

598
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:49,890
Okay, General Director Choi.

599
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,930
(Let's target Hwang Jung-eun first.)

600
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:56,840
(As the oldest member of the troupe,
if we win her over, more will follow.)

601
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,090
(Then there's Soo-ji.)

602
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,820
(She's a poor girl who tutors students
to make ends meet.)

603
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:15,940
(If we win over the lead's male partner,)

604
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:17,520
(it'll be convenient in many ways.)

605
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,470
(Are you doing well, Kim Dan?)

606
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:05,970
Can't you sleep?

607
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,920
Not really. It's raining.

608
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:11,120
Would you like some tea too?

609
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:12,660
On a night like this,

610
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,990
a bowl of fish cake soup
and soju will hit the spot.

611
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:18,020
Do you want a drink?

612
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,860
I like drinking alone.

613
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:27,350
You can go back in.

614
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,910
Ms. Jung. If a guy

615
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:41,910
tells you to wait for him
and that he needs some time,

616
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:45,390
what does that really mean?

617
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,250
Young Lady, are you seeing someone?

618
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:49,790
No.

619
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,690
My friend asked me for my opinion.

620
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:56,830
You are more experienced
in this field than I am.

621
00:44:57,310 --> 00:45:00,920
I just wanted to give her better advice.

622
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:02,420
Is he married?

623
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:04,130
No.

624
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:08,230
-Is he?
-Run away from him.

625
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:11,920
What do you mean?

626
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:13,110
Men

627
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,280
never hesitate when it comes to love.

628
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:17,730
He needs more time?

629
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:19,400
And he's going into his man cave?

630
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:21,160
That's a load of nonsense.

631
00:45:22,310 --> 00:45:23,800
He looked really desperate

632
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,250
according to my friend.

633
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:27,810
He gave her a handkerchief
he really cherishes.

634
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:29,350
That's a token of his promise to her.

635
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:31,330
To her, it may be a token of his promise.

636
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:33,440
But to him, it might just be trash.

637
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:40,830
Young Lady.

638
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:42,900
I don't know who that man is,

639
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:44,390
but give up on him.

640
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:46,550
That was about my friend.

641
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,310
I know you don't have friends.

642
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,600
I have friends too.

643
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:51,960
Why won't you believe me?

644
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,950
I should look for another secretary.

645
00:46:02,870 --> 00:46:04,500
Gosh, she catches on fast.

646
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:07,930
Kim Dan.

647
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,850
Where are you? What are you up to?

648
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:18,760
(Nursing home)

649
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:38,250
(Room 105, Yoo Jong-cheol,
Male, 58 years old)

650
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,330
(You little brat.)

651
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:42,340
(Yoo Jong-cheol)

652
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:43,440
(Come here!)

653
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:18,290
(You ungrateful brat.)

654
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:21,760
(How dare you talk back to me?)

655
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,550
You foolish one.

656
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:33,200
Those who abuse children

657
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:35,230
and trample on one's life

658
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:37,910
will face a bolt of lightning.

659
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:42,930
Why?

660
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,390
Are you going to hit me again?

661
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:47,810
Go ahead.

662
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:51,550
Hit me mercilessly
just like you did back then!

663
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,420
Why did you do it?

664
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,180
Why on earth did you do it?

665
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:00,970
I was your son.

666
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,530
I was...

667
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,590
I was only 12 years old.

668
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:12,760
How did you live after running away
like that

669
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:14,520
to end up like this?

670
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:18,790
What about your life?

671
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:21,870
What about your son's life?

672
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,970
What is this?

673
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:35,860
I'm sorry.

674
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,650
I've wronged you.

675
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,370
I'm sorry.

676
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:54,430
I've wronged you.

677
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:56,580
Stop it.

678
00:48:57,150 --> 00:48:58,960
Stop. Stop it.

679
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:01,030
Stop it!

680
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:09,650
I am

681
00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:12,330
sorry.

682
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:39,390
His apology won't make any difference now.

683
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,860
He shouldn't have committed sins
from the start.

684
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:44,230
I'm furious.

685
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,950
I'm livid.

686
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:49,340
That's how humans are.

687
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,640
They make a mistake,
regret it, and repent.

688
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:57,040
That man has lived his whole life
repenting his sins.

689
00:49:57,170 --> 00:50:00,340
He donated every penny he saved
for the benefits of children.

690
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:02,980
He volunteered
at this hospital for 13 years.

691
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:04,210
His body began deteriorating

692
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:06,630
five years ago as the cost for
living recklessly before then.

693
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:08,040
That won't

694
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:10,150
bring back the dead boy.

695
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,390
But he was able to save a child
who could've died.

696
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:14,460
I guess his good deeds paid off.

697
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:16,220
At the end,

698
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:19,740
he got to apologize.
Something he thought he'd never get to do.

699
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,250
What do you want

700
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:28,850
from me?

701
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:32,760
Let's say that he did.

702
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,940
I was human, and I lived a miserable life
and faced a miserable death in His plans.

703
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:38,660
Then He shouldn't have let me remember.

704
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:40,860
Why did He let me remember?

705
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:43,590
Why did He make me meet Yeon-seo
when I can't tell her who I am?

706
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:44,690
I'm sure you know

707
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,370
the deity always prepares an answer.

708
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:50,710
It's just that we're too blind
to see His answer.

709
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:54,100
Let's go to church together

710
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:55,420
and pray.

711
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,250
-I don't want to go.
-Hey, Kim Dan.

712
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:01,190
He gave me a new riddle,

713
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:03,780
so I'm going to find an answer on my own.

714
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,290
Take care, Hu.

715
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:19,750
Are you thinking about...

716
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:22,530
It really must have been hard for you
to handle a troublemaker like me

717
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,030
all this time.

718
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:26,930
I thank you for every moment.

719
00:51:27,850 --> 00:51:28,950
I respected you.

720
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:01,640
Do you still have
unfinished business left on Earth?

721
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,290
Kim Dan. No.

722
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:07,140
Angel Dan.

723
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:08,950
Don't be so surprised.

724
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:12,070
I will give you a big surprise.

725
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:18,100
Look at you doing whatever you want,
you reckless angel.

726
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:20,910
Who are you?

727
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:22,890
How could a human know
the secrets of our realm?

728
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:24,960
Shall we go over that first?

729
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:26,280
What's your mission?

730
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,300
Why did you come to Yeon-seo?

731
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:30,280
Forget it.

732
00:52:30,370 --> 00:52:32,000
Just don't ever show up again.

733
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:33,940
If you ever show your face
around Yeon-seo again,

734
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:35,340
the Yeon-seo

735
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:39,570
will find out about
your strange and creepy world.

736
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:41,550
-Are you threatening me?
-It's a warning.

737
00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:46,300
Didn't you ask me

738
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:48,810
to make her happy the other day?

739
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:51,670
I'll do it.

740
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:53,780
I'll stay by her side forever

741
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:56,020
and love her and make her happy,

742
00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:57,260
so don't worry

743
00:52:58,050 --> 00:52:59,060
and get lost.

744
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:10,850
A recording?

745
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,010
You're sure, right?

746
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:16,880
Good job.

747
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:19,390
I think she's planning
to rig the audition.

748
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:22,690
I'll gather the evidence.

749
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:24,320
Okay.

750
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:25,900
Mr. Park.

751
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,060
Did General Director Choi send you here?

752
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:37,910
No.

753
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:40,900
You and I used to come here
when you were in distress.

754
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:42,970
Why didn't you answer my calls?

755
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:44,820
Give it back.

756
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:49,570
Are you really going to
blow the whistle or something?

757
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,120
You once told me

758
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:53,880
that you feel stuck.

759
00:53:57,620 --> 00:53:59,290
I decided to climb down this mountain.

760
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:02,860
It'll be a tough journey,
and it'll take me a while.

761
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:06,730
You understand, don't you?

762
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:11,880
Why are you...

763
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:13,590
Why are you doing this?

764
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,350
Please don't do this.

765
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,830
Gwang-il, will you please...

766
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:20,940
Will you please help me out
just this once?

767
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:24,510
Ni-na's audition will be soon.

768
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:27,060
And performing with Director Ji

769
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:28,820
is an opportunity of a lifetime.

770
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:30,490
You know that

771
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:33,390
my daughter is as innocent
and pure as snow.

772
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:35,680
She really didn't do anything wrong.

773
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:37,000
Of course, I know.

774
00:54:37,090 --> 00:54:39,990
I know that Ni-na is too kind
to even kill a bug.

775
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:42,150
Just give us a little more time.

776
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:45,540
After this is all over,
after "Giselle" premieres,

777
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:48,880
you won't have to step up.
I will turn myself in.

778
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:51,570
I will take the punishment.

779
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:54,560
Please, Gwang-il.

780
00:54:55,970 --> 00:54:59,310
You're a dad too.
You know how I feel, don't you?

781
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:10,750
I'm sorry. Where were we again?

782
00:55:12,070 --> 00:55:14,530
So you were in the lighting team
three years ago, right?

783
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:17,000
Mr. Moon Ji-woong?

784
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:28,220
My goodness, man.

785
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:30,900
I'm serious.
I'm an acquaintance of Ji Kang-woo,

786
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:31,960
and this is an emergency.

787
00:55:32,050 --> 00:55:33,890
But you said you don't even know
the room number.

788
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:35,430
There's something important in there.

789
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,540
I wanted to call the police,
but I just let him...

790
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:39,300
No, forget it. You need to go.

791
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:42,030
Sir, it'll only take ten minutes.
No, a few minutes.

792
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:44,760
If you keep doing this,
I'll call the police on you.

793
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:45,900
Will you please...

794
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:46,920
Hello.

795
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,860
Hello, sir. Do you know this guy?

796
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:52,590
He keeps on insisting that he knows you.

797
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:56,240
-Well...
-He's a friend of mine.

798
00:55:56,950 --> 00:55:59,320
-I'll get going. Goodbye.
-Of course.

799
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:11,030
I can explain.

800
00:56:11,470 --> 00:56:14,110
Forget it. I don't need you to explain.
You punk.

801
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:16,090
Gosh, my eyes hurt.

802
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:17,720
-Hu.
-Follow me.

803
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:43,810
Oh, my goodness.

804
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:47,280
Thanks, Hu.

805
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:49,440
I have no idea why I'm doing this.

806
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:51,820
I think you rubbed off on me.

807
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:54,940
Ji Kang-woo definitely has a secret.

808
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,440
He isn't just a normal guy.

809

What now?

819
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:00,540
Please forgive me.

820

Isn't that Noisy Gong?

821
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:20,910
No.

822
00:58:21,930 --> 00:58:22,980
This woman isn't

Yeon-seo.

824
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:28,570
Then who is it?

825
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:47,000
Now you disregard everything
and just break in?

826
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:50,300
Why did you deceive me?

827
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:54,660
Are you obsessed with Yeon-seo
because she resembles her?

828
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:56,200
-Shut up.
-I thought

829
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:03,640
you were Yeon-seo's missing rib.

I believed you were her destiny.

00:59:06,890 --> 00:59:08,960
Once Yeon-seo falls in love with her rib

832
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:11,070
and finds happiness,

833
00:59:11,910 --> 00:59:14,590
I thought I could return
to paradise in peace.

834
00:59:14,990 --> 00:59:16,620
Like I said, I'll do that.

835
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:20,050
Everything is settled. Mission success.

836
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:21,630
No, I don't need you.

837
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:23,830
You're out.

838
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:26,960
I waited to tell you that the one

839
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,520
who should stop lurking around her
is you, not me.

840
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:33,470
Listen to the angel's order

841
00:59:34,390 --> 00:59:35,400
and obey.

842
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:40,290
So what will you do now?

843
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:42,880
Are you

844
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,700
going to be her rib?

845
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:47,150
It's none of your business.

846
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:49,440
If I turn into dust or dissipate,

847
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:51,200
that's for me to deal with.

848
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:59,210
You'll be very lucky
if you just dissipate.

849
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:01,450
You can't even imagine
what the punishment is like.

850
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:04,400
Something horrifying will happen.

851
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:09,640
He'll come.

852
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:13,380
He won't come.

853
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:15,490
He'll come.

854
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:18,220
He won't come.

855
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:21,430
What is this? Forget it. This is no fun.

856
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,110
I'll start with "He won't come."
He won't come.

857
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:26,570
He won't come.

858
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:28,600
He'll come.

859
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:31,370
He won't come.

860
01:00:32,290 --> 01:00:33,790
Darn it, these flowers.

861
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:54,210
You're here.

862
01:00:55,830 --> 01:00:57,020
I'm sorry I'm late.

863
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:04,770
Is everything finished?

864
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:08,330
You won't leave again, will you?

865
01:01:10,930 --> 01:01:12,990
If you say that you'll quit again

866
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:14,890
or disappear without telling me,

867
01:01:15,550 --> 01:01:17,570
I'll kill you. Okay?

868
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:22,190
You can't get sick
without telling me either.

869
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:25,090
You can't die when I'm not around either.

870
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:27,470
Okay?

871
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:32,270
Why won't you say anything?

872
01:01:33,630 --> 01:01:34,730
Promise me.

873
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:44,230
(You can't even imagine
what the punishment is like.)

874
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:47,270
(Something horrifying will happen.)

875
01:01:49,650 --> 01:01:50,700
I love you.

876
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:55,100
I love you.

877
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:57,430
Lee Yeon-seo.

878
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:54,940
(Angel's Last Mission: Love)

879
01:02:56,660 --> 01:02:58,550
(It's not a crime to love a lot,)

880
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:00,480
but it's a crime to have too many secrets.

881
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:01,760
(Hey, Yeon-seo!)

882
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:04,000
Young Lady.

883
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:05,320
Goodness! Ms. Jung!

884
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:09,370
(Yeon-seo. Listen carefully
to what I'm about to tell you.)

885
01:03:10,030 --> 01:03:12,060
Do you know what a guardian angel is?

886
01:03:12,850 --> 01:03:16,150
(The best thing you can do for her
at this point is leaving.)

887
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:20,110
(I'm sure there is a way for an angel
to become a human.)

888
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:23,670
(I wish Yeon-seo was dead.)

889
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:24,730
(Yeon-seo!)
