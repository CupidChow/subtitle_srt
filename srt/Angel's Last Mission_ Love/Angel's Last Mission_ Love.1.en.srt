1
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,160
No.

2
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,270
No, don't go.

3
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,220
Don't go.

4
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,770
No, come out of there.

5
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,900
Why is my dream always in color?

6
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,080
It's so annoying.

7
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,900
Next.

8
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,910
Next.

9
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,880
Next.

10
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,920
One second.

11
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,540
What are you doing?

12
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,150
No one knows where this came from.

13
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,570
This pedestal found next to the bathroom,

14
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,480
in a perfect place for me to topple over.

15
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,860
No one knows why it's there.

16
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,930
They all need to experience

17
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,790
that someone who cannot see anything

18
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,070
may crack open their head and
die if they fall down.

19
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,860
No one yet?

20
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,340
Was there a ghost here or something?

21
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:37,980
Okay.

22
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,660
You're all fired.

23
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:46,650
One and two and three and...

24
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:47,800
It was me.

25
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,200
I know.

26
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,260
The pedestal was covered

27
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,410
with the scent of cheap lavender.

28
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,620
I used it yesterday when I cleaned up

29
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,090
old seasonal clothes
and forgot it was there.

30
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,800
I wasn't asking for the reason.

31
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,100
I do not care

32
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,420
to know that.

33
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,230
Only the lavender girl is fired.

34
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,360
Good morning.

35
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,589
Hello, Ms. Jung.

36
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,540
Your staff members cause trouble

37
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,730
because you always come
and go right on time.

38
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,620
I'll give you the room of your choice,
so move in.

39
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,020
How can I deal with your temper
24 hours a day?

40
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,950
Mr. Jo can stick around

41
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,050
because he adores you,

42
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,240
- but I... / - You don't like me?

43
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,300
You know that already.

44
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:41,030
Here, take your mail for today.

45
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,170
Five.

This is the water bill.

50
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,330
Oh, that's just an advertisement.

51
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,740
You know, like a chain letter.

52
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:12,570
Korea became a great country.

53
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,780
They made an ad in braille.

Why is this already here? Shouldn't it be next week?

59
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,510
Yeonseo isn't going to attend it anyway.

60

Let's go together.

65
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,090
I can go alone.

66
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,380
This is Jo Seunghwan speaking.

67
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:05,500
Hello, doctor. The results are out?

68
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:11,590
This is Lee Yeonseo. You can talk to me.

69
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,730
I'm the one who'll receive the cornea donation.

70
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,660
What's the problem this time?

71
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,410
Did the guardian refuse at the last minute again?

72
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:25,890
Or did you spot an infection again?

73
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,750
What mistake is it this time?

74
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,610
Forget it.

75
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:33,980
Don't call me ever again.

76
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,730
I'll remove myself from the waiting list.

77
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,659
Doctor, please don't hang up. One minute.

78
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,880
Let her be!

79
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,970
You're not dressed to go out.

80
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:51,920
She'll feel better after getting some fresh air.

81
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,380
I would've been upset too.

82
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,230
They've been doing this every single time.

83
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,200
I should visit the hospital.

84
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,040
You know what she went through.

85
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,330
After she went blind,

86
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,000
she forbade any of us from mentioning ballet.

87
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,380
She wanted nothing to do with Fantasia.

88
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,090
It's been three years already.

89
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,380
Goodbye, sky. Goodbye, world.

90
00:07:50,659 --> 00:07:51,850
Even though I'm not here,

91
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:54,190

92
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,580

95

You are a foolish man.

96
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,600
You steal animals.

97
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,050
You buy and sell lives.

98
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,400
You are living a miserable life.

99
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,680
Gosh, I'm so annoyed.

100
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,440
What's wrong with this lighter again?

101
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:06,430
What? What is this?

102
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,630
Is there a ghost? Is there? Gosh!

103
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,880
- I'm an angel, you punk. / - My goodness!

104
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,550
You should live a better life.

105
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,020
If you live a life that's uglier than your face,

106

Please give him peace.

113

Since it's my last day,

116
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,590
please assign me to an amazing one.

I'm sorry. Are you all right?

120
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,850
Darn it. Watch where you're going.

121
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:44,810
Did you fall?

122
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:47,450
What? Are you blind?

123
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,470
Gosh. If you're blind, you should've stayed home.

124
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,800
Why would you crawl outside and jog?

125
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,090
You'll only create trouble for others, okay?

126
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:59,020
You'll inconvenience those of us who are normal.

127
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,150
- I'm sorry. / - You are, right?

128
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:03,960
- Let's hang out. / - Who are you?

129
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,840
I saw you jogging here a couple of times.

130
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,750
Why didn't you come with that old man this time?

131
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,020
They say that brushing against

132
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,160
each other's clothes means it's fate.

133
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,770
So let's hang out.

134
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,770
Have a sip. Drink it.

135
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:19,480
Those little...

136
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,270
You're about 175cm tall.

137
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,610
And you're shorter than him.

138
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,550
Are you even 170cm tall?

139
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,020
If you insist on touching me,

140
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,620
you'll get hurt.

141
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,300
Have you been working out? Goodness.

142
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,060
No wonder you have such a nice look from behind.

143
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,010
I've warned you.

144
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:42,330
Are you going to do fencing with that?

145
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:43,830
You can't even see us.

146
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,310
Exactly.

147
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,590
What's the point in living as a blind woman?

148
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,520
Your life is meaningless anyway.

149
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,160
You should do us a favor.

150
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:02,600
Be careful.

151
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,010
You can get hurt in a blink of an eye.

152
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:06,210
Do you think I saw this coming?

153
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,790
I'm not blind. I'm visually impaired.

154
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,650
Repeat after me.

155
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:15,770
Visually impaired.

156
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:19,110
"Blind" is a derogatory term for calling

157
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,360
someone who has lost their vision due to

158
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,020
either congenital or acquired reasons.

159
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:25,090
Do you even understand?

160
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:26,930
You're worth far less than Gureum.

161
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,860
Let's go.

162
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,520
You brat!

163
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,210
The donor's final test results

164
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:10,020
don't look too good.

165
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,840
I'm afraid the donation won't be possible.

166
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:17,450
Gosh. If you're blind, you should've stayed home.

167
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:19,820
Why would you crawl outside and jog?

168
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,360
What's the point in living as a blind woman?

169
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,520
Your life is meaningless anyway.

170
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,170
Those dirtbags.

00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,220
You've died

172
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,700
here once, haven't you?

173
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:12,850
It's dangerous!

174
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,350
My goodness! Oh, no!

175
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:15,930
It's dangerous!

176
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,360
- I said it's dangerous! / - What should we do?

177
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,250
What should we do?

178
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:25,160
My goodness, come down!

179
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,640
- Please come down! / - It's dangerous!

180
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,000
It's a piece of cake for me.

181
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,650
I've practiced it over 1,000 times.

182
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:34,020
I can do it with my eyes closed.

183
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,850
It's dangerous! Don't do it!

184
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,700
Gosh.

185
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,410
How is this possible?

186
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,580
Mom.

187
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,690
Dad.

188
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:57,160
I can't see a thing.

189
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,790
They say that a ballerina dies twice.

190
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,660
The first time is when we give up ballet.

191
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,610
The second time is when we stop breathing.

192
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,770
When I stopped being a dancer,

193
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,570
darkness was all around me.

194
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,290
Is there a point

195
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,860
in waiting for my second death?

196
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,520
I wished to rather face two deaths at once.

197
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:12,740
You fool.

198
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,730
Humans die when they stop breathing.

199
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:24,640
Who's there?

200
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:29,300
Who are you?

201
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:33,440
Why did you sit on this bench without asking me?

202
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,120
Are you looking down on me?

203
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,450
This is my point. You're not even answering me.

204
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,560
I know you're right there!

205
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,120
Just because I lost my sight

206
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,760
doesn't mean I know nothing.

207
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,830
The only sense I lost was my eyesight,

208
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:57,120
so I can still smell, hear, and touch things.

209
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,440
Because I can't see anything,

210
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,410
my darned sixth sense is heightened more than ever.

211
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,590
Wait, that's not it.

212
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,880
Did she hear me?

213
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,600
There's no way she heard me.

214
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,450
You were a guy?

215
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,100
What?

216
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,300
Can you hear me? You can?

217
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,590
I told you clearly that my hearing is just fine.

218
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,270
How could this be possible?

219
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,550
I should be asking that.

220
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,570
How could this happen twice in one day?

221
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,050
What's your deal? Pickpocket? Pervert?

222
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:29,930
What is that you're after?

223
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,390
I doubt that you sat

224
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:33,590
next to a blind woman just to see the rain.

225
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,990
Wait.

226
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,010
Forget it.

227
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,980
I caught you, so just leave.

228
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,020
If you keep bothering me, you'll get hurt.

229
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:42,910
Wait...

230
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,900
I don't want to!

231
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:46,970
What?

232
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:52,410
This bench does not belong to you or me.

233
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:54,920
The bench belongs to the deity. No one else.

234
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,200
Am I wrong?

235
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,390
You're neither a pervert nor a pickpocket.

236
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,980
You were a crazy cult member?

237
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,000
How dare you?

238
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,050
You are only choosing ugly words.

239
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:08,120
Listen. Whatever binds you here

240
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,490
will continue to bind you up above.

241
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:10,680
- And... / - I don't need that.

242
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,590
Be it Buddha, Jesus, or Allah.

243
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,950
I won't believe in anyone.

244
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,930
Those who deny

245
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,340
the deity's existence will face...

246
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,710
I didn't say that.

247
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,520
The deity? Of course, there's a deity.

248
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,750
It's just that the deity is a jerk.

249
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,140
"A jerk"?

250
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,050
Those who blaspheme

251
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,280
- against the deity / - He won't listen to me

252
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,480
no matter how hard I pray.

253
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,060
He ignores my wish when it's my only wish.

254
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:39,050
I asked Him to keep my dad alive for one more day

255
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,970
to let me see my dad for a week before he died.

256
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,240
I cried and prayed for 11 hours on the plane,

257
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,340
but He didn't listen.

258
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,880
I asked Him

259
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,950
to take one of my limbs instead of my eyes.

260
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,720
That way, I could still be a dancer.

261
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,440
He ignored me when I desperately prayed.

262
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,660
That's what the deity, your superstar, did to me.

263
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,870
Not everyone behaves like you

264
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,760
after experiencing a tragedy.

265
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,120
Not everyone jumps off the bridge like you.

266
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,130
Who are you?

267
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,880
- She can grab me? / - You...

268
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,200
Who are you?

269
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,880
Who sent you?

270
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,860
Young Lady!

271
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,050
Ms. Jung!

272
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,410
Go get that guy.

273
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,750
A young man is running away, right?

274
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,200
Who? Who is it?

275
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,950
Over there! He's getting away!

276
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:34,670
Go get that man right now!

277
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,050
No one is here.

278
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:42,410
What...

279
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:44,170
He was right here...

280
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,620
Are you...

281
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,190
seeing ghosts now?

282
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,190
(Fantasia Cultural Foundation's)

283
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,200
(20th Anniversary Party)

284
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,730
That side is hung too high.

285
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,710
You came a day early.

286
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:22,200
Have you been well, Mr. Jo?

287
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,270
Tomorrow is

288
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:26,730
Yeonseo's parents' death anniversary.

289
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:27,730
I'm aware of that.

290
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:31,090
- What's your point? / - Must it be tomorrow?

291
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,550
To be precise, the 20th anniversary is next week.

292
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,380
Is Yeonseo coming?

293
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,380
Ms. Choi.

294
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,330
She's been cooped up at home for three years.

295
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,970
She never shows her face at foundation's events.

296
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,060
It's very hard

297
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:47,270
to run a big organization like this in place of her.

298
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:49,780
You have no idea.

299
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,600
I invited her, so she can come and watch.

300
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,100
To see it for herself how well

301
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,300
I ran the organization that she threw away.

302
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,800
My bad.

303
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:01,260
She won't be able to see it with her eyes.

304
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:04,080
My poor niece.

305
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,200
Yeonseo won't be attending

306
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,640
the event tomorrow.

307
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,790
I invited her officially.

308
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,540
Let's make one thing clear.

309
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,910
We've fulfilled our duties.

310
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:13,100
Don't you just find this odd?

311
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,460
It's been three years, you know.

312
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,000
I wondered why

313
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,500
she still hadn't received her cornea donation.

314
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,090
She's always so close.

315
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:21,950
But it's always canceled at the last minute.

316
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,930
Well, I guess the cells don't match.

317
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,270
What can I do? That's her luck.

318
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,200
Thanks to that, you managed to keep

319
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,660
your position as the general director. Right?

320
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:36,730
What's your point?

321
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,170
It's interesting that

322
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:41,030
someone's misfortune can be luck to someone.

323
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:48,030
I plan to ask the police to investigate

324
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,230
regarding the canceled donation this time.

325
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:56,220
Don't make a fuss.

326
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,060
- The transplant list... / - Of course.

327
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,970
No one would try to hinder the donation process.

328
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,900
If someone did,

329
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,110
I won't let that slide.

330
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:29,840
Tell me.

331
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,520
How much did he find out?

332
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,080
You can't go in. He's with a patient.

333
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,810
He already talked

334
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:45,150
to the administration and the donation center.

335
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:47,660
How am I supposed to...

336
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:50,870
hide the truth?

337
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:56,230
So are you telling me that you told him

338
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:57,590
the truth?

339
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:00,010
Today, I pretended that I didn't know anything.

340
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:02,210
- "Today"? / - I can't this do anymore.

341
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,750
I'm a doctor too.

342
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,000
I came here to tell you that.

343
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,380
Dr. Kim, I am aware that you are a doctor.

344
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,040
Because you're a doctor,

345
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,460
I'm talking to you very politely

346
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,320
and treating you with respect.

347
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,840
I don't know anything, you know.

348
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,950
The doctor takes care of

349
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,640
the corneas, transplant, and other stuff.

350
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,320
If there's an investigation...

351
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:31,700
No.

352
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:33,550
That won't happen.

353
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,620
No, that can't happen.

354
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:37,380
Investigation?

355
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,700
Just keep this in mind.

356
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,810
Dr. Kim, you crossed a bridge.

357
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,120
And I bombed the bridge.

358
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,410
You can't go back now.

359
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,170
Do you understand?

360
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:51,980
Yes.

361
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,700
Not everyone behaves like you

362
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,610
after experiencing a tragedy.

363
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:22,200
What was that guy?

364
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:24,930
That was upsetting.

365
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,900
No shadow.

366
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,300
And I can't be seen.

367
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,260
So how did that woman know?

368
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:27,250
My client. Are you alive?

369
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,190
What will happen to that cat?

370
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:36,700
I'm sorry, cat. I didn't see you there.

371
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:39,560
We reported it, so they will take good care of it.

372
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:41,770
Stop crying and drink some tea.

373
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:43,300
If you cry, you'll run out of breath.

374
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,670
Runa, let's go back.

375
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,190
What if it gets hit again before people come?

376
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,410
Let's go back and bury it.

377
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:50,870
I want to do that. Please?

378
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,940
Nina, get a hold of yourself and stop crying.

379
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,850
It was just an accident.

380
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,610
You didn't kill it.

381
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,140
But still...

382
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,650
Something tragic just happened to it.

383
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,540
That's what tragedy is like for everyone.

384
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:14,710
It suddenly comes and takes everything.

385
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:17,610
You have to get rid of it before it does that.

386
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:20,960
So pull yourself together and stay grounded.

387
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,410
Tomorrow is your performance.

388
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,480
You can't let your heart and body be shaken.

389
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:25,620
Runa.

390
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:28,750
So,

391
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,530
drink this and sleep it off,

392
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,480
Odette.

393
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:52,870
Goodness, look at you.

394
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,850
Isn't it amazing? The cuteness of babies.

395
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:58,530
They are much better than humans...

396
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,660
You little rascal. What will you do now?

397
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,930
I'm sorry.

398
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,780
But they're adorable.

399
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:17,110
Your eyes were filled with love just now.

400
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,610
I told you to stop meddling with life.

401
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:20,360
You told me to look after widows and orphans.

402
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,910
An angel's nature is

403
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,700
to love goodness and hate wickedness.

404
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,730
I just

405
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:28,070
followed my instinct.

406
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,880
I see. That's why you did this. That's why.

407
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:34,530
You pushed a 17-year-old boy into a honey bucket.

408
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:38,010
"Pushed"? I never touch a human.

409
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:40,340
And he bullied his childhood friend.

410
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,490
You do have money. It's right here.

411
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:43,590
That's not all.

412
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,660
You opened the cages on a truck full of dogs

413
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,470
and filled the streets with them.

414
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:49,800
They were about to be sold at a dog market.

415
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,910
It's illegal, and they were abused.

416
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,530
Oh, goodness.

417
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:55,830
What will I do about this immature kid?

418
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:59,260
The deity's great purpose won't be tampered with

419
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,670
just because a lowly angel like me flicked a finger.

420
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:01,760
Also,

421
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,540
I will be

422
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,000
up there tomorrow anyway.

423
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:08,680
My term is...

424
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:12,670
- over. / - You're so annoying.

425
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,050
Hey, Hu.

426
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,820
Humans can't see us, can they?

427
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,020
No matter how spiritual they are.

428
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:25,750
Who are you?

429
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,860
Why did you sit on this bench without asking me?

430
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,500
Never mind. I met a sensitive human

431
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,270
who has a very foul mouth today.

432
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,330
You.

433
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:35,990
Wait, did you...

434
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,950
I didn't do anything.

435
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,270
If anything, she did something to me.

436
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,010
If you lay a finger on a human,

437
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,830
you will disappear immediately.

438
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:51,170
You will disappear like smoke

439
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,550
and dust,

440
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:55,920
at once.

441
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,090
I only have 24 hours left.

442
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,240
Nothing will happen.

443
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:03,850
I'm scared that you have long 24 hours left.

444
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:05,880
I feel like you will finally manage

445
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,730
to do that hard angel's extinction.

446
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:11,110
Yes, I will be careful of even the falling leaves.

447
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,660
I'm scared I'll meet a wild and violent human.

448
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,250
My darned sixth sense is heightened more than ever.

449
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,360
I don't need that.

450
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,950
A deity? Of course, there's a deity.

451
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:21,140
It's just that the deity is a jerk.

452
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:31,480
Do you hear that? It's midnight tomorrow.

453
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:32,880
Don't be late.

454
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:37,510
Yes, sir.

455
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:39,130
I will make sure I return

456
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,900
before the bell rings 12 times.

457
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:44,330
Where is it? Darn it.

458
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,600
My gosh, man.

459
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:53,840
You are hereby appointed as a dispatched angel

460
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,590
in charge of animals on the earth.

461
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:57,800
That's the handkerchief, isn't it?

462
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,550
The one that only dispatched angels get.

463
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:02,060
This certifies your identity as an angel,

464
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,430
and it connects the earth with the sky,

465
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,860
so you cannot lose it.

466
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,050
Make sure you always keep it with you.

467
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,040
No.

468
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,400
No.

469
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:13,860
It can't be.

470
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,360
Come out, you coward.

471
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:21,110
You jerk.

472
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,000
You cult member!

473
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,750
Gosh, I have cramps.

474
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:40,080
You keep having nightmares.

475
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,370
All of my dreams are nightmares.

476
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:44,260
They're all in bright colors.

477
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:48,300
- Tomorrow... / - I won't go to Fantasia.

478
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:53,150
I was asking when you want to go to the mausoleum.

479
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:56,170
How thoughtless.

480
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,300
How can they decide to do that on this day?

481
00:31:58,870 --> 00:31:59,880
Yeonseo.

482
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,120
I'm always on your side no matter what.

483
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,710
Mr. Jo.

484
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,790
Did you know you can be creepy sometimes?

485
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,130
How can you be on my side no matter what?

486
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,870
How can you tune everything to me?

487
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:15,460
Why are you on my side no matter what I do?

488
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,430
You should be calling me the crazy princess,

489
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:18,610
little brat, and irritated rascal.

490
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,340
Isn't it normal to do that?

491
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:26,410
- Yeonseo. / - Don't call me that.

492
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,980
Leave. I'm tired.

493
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:37,310
I know who you really are.

494
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:39,260
I told you to stop pretending like you know.

495
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:55,620
(The 1999 Elena Ballet School Recital)

496
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:05,880
Yeonseo.

497
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:10,100
Goodness, I can't see the lead dancer too well.

498
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,290
It's all right.

499
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:12,880
He's our new driver.

500
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,890
Hello, Princess.

501
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:17,090
My name is Jo Seunghwan.

502
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,640
My service to you.

503
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:21,930
- Yeonseo. / - Mr. Jo!

504
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,360
Gosh.

505
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:25,640
How did I do?

506
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,300
You were the best.

507
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,660
I only get relieved

508
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,200
after you tell me that I was the best.

509
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,690
Goodness, you got the Grand Award.

510
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,150
It's because the sun went down in your heart.

511
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:45,700
You were such a bright child.

512
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:48,420
No matter what anyone says,

513
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:49,880
even if you deny it,

514
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:51,550
you are like an angel.

515
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:55,160
I want to see you shine brightly

516
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:59,990
like you did then just one more time.

517
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,969
That rude kid.

518
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:22,120
Sleep well.

519
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,989
Where is it? Where did you put it?

520
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,449
I'm so annoyed.

521
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,520
I'm so irked and annoyed!

522
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:27,070
Hold on. I don't have to act this way.

523
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,980
What's wrong with this?

524
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:57,700
Is it stuck?

525
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,730
Mr. Jo needs to go out today.

526
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:50,190
So we need a temporary secretary

527
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:52,380
who'll be by the young lady's side.

528
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,580
Any volunteers?

529
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,620
No?

530
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,430
A 100-percent bonus and a one-week leave!

531
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,120
Says who?

532
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,100
She's wearing a designer dress

533
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,640
and bedazzling false eyelashes.

534
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:14,210
This means she's attending the party, right?

535
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,390
The makeup looks great on you.

536
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,500
You'll look prettier than Nina.

537
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:22,480
I've always been prettier than her.

538
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,410
Didn't you know that?

539
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:29,070
Will you be all right?

540
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:30,450
Let's go.

541
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,700
They will perform

542
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,950
"Swan Lake" during the party.

543
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,580
Don't be ridiculous.

544
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,600
I won't watch it.

545
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:01,200
But you can feel it.

546
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:03,170
And you already know the story.

547
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:04,420
That's exactly why

548
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,090
it'll be even more torturous.

549
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:09,070
Do I need to spell it out for you to understand?

550
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,440
You are a foolish one.

551
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,710
You're always despicable.

552
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:20,040
Where's my handkerchief?

553
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:22,020
Since you've decided to attend the party,

554
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:23,410
you might as well show them

555
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,090
who the true owner of Fantasia is.

556
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,640
I told you. I'm not interested.

557
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,960
You can have it.

558
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,450
I'll stamp all the documents.

559
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:32,840
Gosh, was she rewarded a certificate for this?

560
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,340
She must have one for being

561
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,830
the most snide and despicable.

562
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:38,200
Then why are you going?

563
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,030
Yeonseo.

564
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,440
Don't talk to me. You're too loud.

565
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:56,160
Blessed are those who have patience.

566
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:00,120
This foolish one may not be aware as of now,

567
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,750
but she will appreciate you one day.

568
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:07,820
She will cry and regret her past actions.

569
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:12,160
Give it to me. Where is it?

570
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:44,380
Yeonseo!

571
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,950
I'm so glad that my niece is here!

572
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:53,300
You two are in big trouble.

573
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,810
This foolish one has no patience for you.

574
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:58,630
Watch out for her stick.

575
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:01,310
Have you been well?

576
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:03,290
Of course, of course.

577
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:06,550
We've cried so much, wanting to see you.

578
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,370
You never met us for the past three years.

579
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:10,730
But today, you're here.

580
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:13,240
Your parents must be proud of you.

581
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,470
This is great.

582
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:17,640
Our guests are very high-minded,

583
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,200
and they wanted to meet you.

584
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,340
You don't need to do anything.

585
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,540
That'll be better since you're pretty.

586
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,820
It will make you look more tragic.

587
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:27,710
The rich tend to spend money

588
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,790
when they feel a sense of superiority.

589
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,120
Mom, that's enough.

590
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:35,810
Please understand.

591
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,230
As the general director of the ballet company,

592
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:40,970
she's always thinking about sponsorships.

593
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:42,590
Runa.

594
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,380
You remember my voice.

595
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:49,020
I'm glad you're here.

596
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:50,550
Let's go in.

597
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:53,980
My goodness, Nina will be exhilarated.

598
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,340
She used to cry

599
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:57,690
dozens of times a day because she missed you.

600
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,280
- Let's go inside. / - Let's go.

601
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:26,410
Nina. Good luck.

602
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,340
You can do it.

603
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,030
You're the best.

604
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:37,230
The prima ballerina of Fantasia

605
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:40,010
is only you, Nina.

606
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:41,770
You're the star.

607
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:44,940
- Isn't that Yeonseo? / - Is it her?

608
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:50,170
- She's really blind. / - It wasn't a rumor.

609
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,800
- It was real. / - Goodness.

610
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,340
Poor girl.

611
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:57,520
- My goodness. / - I feel terrible for her.

612
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,700
Do you want to wait in the car?

613
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:00,470
I need to go to the restroom.

614
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:04,640
- It's on your left. / - I can go by myself.

615
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,580
It's right around the corner.

616
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,350
You can go in first.

617
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:20,800
Gosh. My handkerchief...

618
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:39,090
- Hello. / - Goodness.

619
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:57,880
No way. Yeonseo is here?

620
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,160
Did you see her?

621
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,010
Don't address her like that.

622
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:03,170
She was once my idol.

623
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:04,880
Call her, "Ms. Lee."

624
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:08,710
By the way, I don't understand why she came

625
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:10,430
when she's blind.

626
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:11,790
I hope she doesn't jinx any of us.

627
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:13,950
The performance will begin soon.

628
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:14,960
- Let's go. / - Okay.

629
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,180
Please enter the theater.

630
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:03,850
Yeonseo.

631
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:06,920
Yeonseo...

632
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:11,770
Gosh, hello.

633
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:15,890
How have you been, sir?

634
00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:17,390
I hope you've been well too, Odette.

635
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:18,800
You get prettier every year.

636
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:22,800
Hello, ma'am.

637
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:24,910
Hello, sir.

638
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:31,160
Where is the real Odette?

639
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,200
I've been looking for her, but I can't find her.

640
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:35,560
She'll be here soon.

641
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,280
It's been three years, you know.

642
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:39,800
Yeonseo.

643
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:49,600
Where is she? The ceremony is about to start.

644
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:51,800
Everyone, please raise your glasses.

645
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,440
- What should we do? / - To celebrate the 20th

646
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,880
anniversary of Fantasia Cultural Foundation,

647
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,340
we have invited a special guest.

648
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:58,490
She's the only daughter of the first chairman.

649
00:47:58,490 --> 00:48:01,220
Hey, we have to get him to shut his mouth first.

650
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:02,230
Go.

651
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:04,080
We have invited Ms. Lee Yeonseo.

652
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:06,760
Give her a warm welcome.

653
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:09,540
It's been three years.

654
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:12,170
The daughter of Fantasia. The madonna of Fantasia.

655
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:15,120
Where are you, Ms. Lee Yeonseo?

656
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:13,290
Hello, I'm Lee Yeonseo.

657
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,070
Today is a special day.

658
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:18,270
It's the 20th anniversary of Fantasia

659
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:20,640
as well as my parents' death anniversary.

660
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:24,730
I've given a lot of thought

661
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,480
on how to celebrate this occasion.

662
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:28,390
I thought about showing up

663
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:30,000
as a corpse by hanging myself in the restroom.

664
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:33,130
To make a dramatic scene.

665
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:38,410
I bet everyone is looking at me with pity.

666
00:49:39,730 --> 00:49:41,450
I hope that you can support us

667
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,480
as much as you pity me

668
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,800
and as much as you think that I deserve this.

669
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:52,490
As you know,

670
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:54,560
when I was the only principal dancer here,

671
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,900
my dear Geum Nina was my understudy.

672
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:58,520
In other words, she was my shadow.

673
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:00,680
If I would get sick

674
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,710
or run away because I fall in love,

675
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,120
her responsibility was to take my place.

676
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:08,150
Unfortunately, I was too healthy.

677
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:10,360
And except ballet, I found everything boring.

678
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:13,120
I've never skipped a performance.

679
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:14,940
However, when the sun is gone,

680
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:16,340
the moon is bound to dominate.

681
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:19,340
As you all know, I've lost my eyesight.

682
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:20,430
And Nina made a successful debut

683
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:21,570
as my replacement.

684
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:24,120
When I was living in darkness for three years,

685
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:27,390
Nina has been shining as a prima ballerina.

686
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:29,140
Isn't this story

687
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:31,390
quite dramatic?

688
00:50:32,050 --> 00:50:33,950
Please support generously to our ballet company,

689
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:36,370
Fantasia, as much as you find

690
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:38,120
this story entertaining

691
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:41,160
and as much as you'll share it with others.

692
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:50,450
I apologize for my long toast.

693
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:52,730
Enjoy your day today.

694
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:54,190
No one can be sure

695
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:55,550
if you'll be okay the next day.

696
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:06,070
Let go. Let go of me.

697
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:10,240
Director Choi!

698
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:12,130
You've crossed the line.

699
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:13,620
Get your hand off me.

700
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:17,320
I know that you are rude to the core

701
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:19,090
and that you do everything you want to do

702
00:51:19,090 --> 00:51:20,840
like a spoiled princess.

703
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:22,820
But this was just too much.

704
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:24,590
You should've braced yourself when you had a party

705
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:26,160
on my parents' death anniversary.

706
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:29,380
Those people inside are

707
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:31,930
in the first percentile of this country.

708
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:34,220
Their seconds and minutes are like gold.

709
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:35,530
Do you think it's easy

710
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:36,850
to accommodate their schedules?

711
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,050
What? You're laughing?

712
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:42,880
Hey.

713
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:46,050
Since we're at it, let's be frank here.

714
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:48,440
How have we wronged you?

715
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:49,660
What do you have against us

716
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:51,650
to come all the way here and ruin this event?

717
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:52,780
You smiled.

718
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:58,240
You smiled that day.

719
00:51:58,380 --> 00:51:59,440
Oh, no!

720
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:00,670
Yeonseo!

721
00:52:00,970 --> 00:52:01,990
Yeonseo!

722
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:16,590
Goodness.

723
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,000
Oh, my.

724
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:21,300
You're unbelievable.

725
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:24,730
I'm your aunt.

726
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:26,140
Sure. You could say

727
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:32,080
that we're a distant cousin.

728
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,550
But we're still a family.

729
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:37,980
There's a line you can't cross.

730
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:40,440
I thought you were just blind,

731
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:42,340
but is it possible that you've gone mad too?

732
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:44,660
Stop.

733
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:47,880
What if I don't?

734
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:50,160
There will be a bigger scene.

735
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:57,910
Let's go.

736
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,660
You foolish one.

737
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:37,740
The beautiful dance of your feet

738
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:40,730
melted away foul words on the tip of your mouth.

739
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:44,030
Thank the one who gave your talent.

740
00:55:18,890 --> 00:55:20,110
It looks like the sun will set.

741
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:22,050
The sunset glow is very beautiful.

742
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:24,160
It's...

743
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:27,070
breathtaking.

744
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:36,050
Let's start getting ready slowly.

745
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,840
You can begin your rehabilitation.

746
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,340
- And the foundation... / - Stop.

747
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:41,670
Yeonseo.

748
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:43,300
I told you to stop calling me that!

749
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:45,330
I hate everything!

750
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:47,970
I hate ballet, the foundation, everything!

751
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:49,950
So don't tell me what to do!

752
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:55,580
Lee Yeonseo!

753
00:55:57,650 --> 00:55:58,660
Did you...

754
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:01,070
just yell at me?

755
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:03,900
Pull yourself together.

756
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:06,000
You're in the middle of a battlefield.

757
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:08,610
Do you know how many guns are pointed at your heart?

758
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:10,540
No idea, but I hope I can die at once,

759
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:11,540
quickly.

760
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:13,090
And stop saying that you want to die.

761
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:16,210
We're almost there.

762
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:19,200
If you give me just a little more time,

763
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:21,980
I will bring you back to your place.

764
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:24,480
My place?

765
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:26,340
How?

766
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:28,180
Are you going to give me eyes?

767
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:29,710
- Yeonseo. / - Bring me back?

768
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:31,520
Where? Who says you can? Who do you think you are?

769
00:56:32,270 --> 00:56:33,850
If you act like my dad once again,

770
00:56:34,550 --> 00:56:36,050
I will really fire you.

771
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:21,250
Mr. Jo.

772
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:33,880
Yeonseo. Yeonseo, hold tight!

773
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:44,070
What? What's going on?

774
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:45,660
Yeonseo.

775
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:06,080
Gosh, I might be late.

776
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:07,830
Mr. Jo...

777
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,520
Mr. Jo.

778
00:58:48,310 --> 00:58:49,690
Can you hear me?

779
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,020
Mr. Jo?

780
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:15,380
Is anybody there?

781
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:21,050
Help us.

782
00:59:23,790 --> 00:59:26,910
Who knew these flowers were for a funeral?

783
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:43,450
Rest

784
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:45,340
in peace.

785
00:59:49,970 --> 00:59:51,150
Who's there?

786
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:55,980
Is...

787
00:59:57,270 --> 00:59:58,620
Is someone there?

788
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:02,370
Over here.

789
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:05,450
There are people here. Over here.

790
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:08,790
Please.

791
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:11,740
Please help us. Please.

792
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:16,840
Hey, who are you?

793
01:00:17,550 --> 01:00:19,480
Are you a human or an animal?

794
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:23,360
You jerk.

795
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:25,770
Don't you have any conscience?

796
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:28,110
If you ran away because you were scared,

797
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:30,480
make a report at least.

798
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:32,280
Sir.

799
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:34,760
Sir. Hey.

800
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:37,340
Whoever you are, please...

801
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:40,730
Why does her voice sound so clear?

802
01:00:58,120 --> 01:00:59,340
Help me.

803
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:01,590
I can't.

804
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:04,140
I really can't do anything about human life.

805
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:07,880
Please. Save me.

806
01:01:09,210 --> 01:01:11,880
I can't. I have no time. I have to go.

807
01:01:13,290 --> 01:01:14,650
I want to live.

808
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:18,750
I wanted to die every single day,

809
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:21,790
but I want to live now.

810
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:24,070
I want to live.

811
01:01:29,050 --> 01:01:30,980
I wanted to die every single day,

812
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:35,080
but I want to live now.

813
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:22,590
I shouldn't have done that.

814
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,180
I was not supposed to do that.

815
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:00,740
(Angel's Last Mission: Love)

816
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:04,920
Like smoke and dust.

817
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:09,410
Hey, is someone there?

818
01:03:09,490 --> 01:03:10,810
Young lady, were you dreaming?

819
01:03:12,190 --> 01:03:14,700
You must successfully do a mission for 100 days

820
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:16,500
for the door to reopen.

821
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:17,500
Hello.

822
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:19,090
I'm Kim Dan, the interviewee.

823
01:03:19,090 --> 01:03:20,360
I got closer to her.

824
01:03:21,550 --> 01:03:23,360
Why does a secretary have to learn to do this?

825
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:24,820
Clean up everything.

826
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:27,500
What is it that I have to do?

827
01:03:28,590 --> 01:03:29,610
Love.

828
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:31,050
I will make her fall in love.
