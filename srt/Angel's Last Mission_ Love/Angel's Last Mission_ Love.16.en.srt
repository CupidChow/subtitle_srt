1
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,920
(I'm going try,
even if it's just an imitation.)

2
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:10,540
(I pray and go to church,
but nothing seems to work.)

3
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,750
(Is tomorrow's stage)

4
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:15,470
(really our last chance?)

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,810
(Could we)

6
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:20,970
(get across)

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,960
(how we feel and what we hope for?)

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,670
(I'm writing this just in case.)

9
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:31,090
(I want to try
doing everything that I can.)

10
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,090
Come back home safely.

11
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,210
I'll be back.

12
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,290
(I never knew a moment was the last time)

13
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,610
(until it passed by,)

14
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,050
(so I never got to say goodbye properly.)

15
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,540
(I never got to say goodbye properly.)

16
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,710
(I thought that maybe
this is a chance I get)

17
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,520
(to say goodbye to Kim Dan)

18
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:02,850
(properly.)

19
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:06,680
(So that we can be happy to the very end)

20
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:09,280
(until we can have a beautiful goodbye.)

21
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,800
Yeon-seo!

22
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:30,660
Yeon-seo!

23
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,810
(But then again,)

24
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,150
(is there such a thing)

25
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:37,220
(as a beautiful goodbye?)

26
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:41,710
Yeon-seo.

27
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:44,350
Yeon-seo, wake up. Yeon-seo.

28
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,630
-There might be organ damage.
-Yeon-seo.

29
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,100
She neglected it for a while,
so she could be infected.

30
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:06,650
(Restricted Area, Operating Room)

31
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:34,680
(Operating Room)

32
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,150
(No matter how much you try
to escape from it,)

33
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,310
a prophecy will come to pass.

34
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,170
One's destiny will be fulfilled.

35
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:23,780
Detective.

36
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,410
Where is

37
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,520
Geum Ru-na?

38
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,890
She's under investigation.

39
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,430
-If you wait here...
-No, right?

40
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,960
Ru-na didn't stab a person, did she?

41
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,990
This is a lie.

42
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:39,970
This can't be right.

43
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,090
She was caught in the act.

44
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,329
No...

45
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,690
Sir, could you let us see our daughter?

46
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,400
It's our last request.

47
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,810
So you snuck into Fantasia with this knife

48
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,050
and stabbed Lee Yeon-seo. Is that right?

49
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:04,130
You stabbed Lee Yeon-seo,
then tried to attack

50
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,730
her secretary, Kim Dan,
which was a failed attempt.

51
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:07,870
Right?

52
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,890
It'll take a second.

53
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,990
You can have a chat with her.

54
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,880
And try to persuade her as her parents.

55
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,800
Ru-na.

56
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,040
I told you to never get your hands dirty.

57
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,590
Why did you do something like that?

58
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,730
Ru-na.

59
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,480
What happened to Yeon-seo?

60
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,390
She probably bled a lot.

61
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,500
How persistent.

62
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,270
I can't believe
she finished her performance anyway.

63
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:08,990
Very amazing.

64
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,270
Mom, Ni-na can play "Giselle" tomorrow.

65
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,170
She's going to throw a fit
and say she won't perform.

66
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,810
Make sure you persuade her
and get her on the stage...

67
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,240
Pull yourself together, Ru-na.

68
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:25,620
Yeon-seo is on the brink of death.

69
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,290
How can you talk about "Giselle"?

70
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,460
Who do you think you are to hit me?

71
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,690
This is why

72
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,890
you should've worked everything out
from the beginning.

73
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,000
You let a wimpy guy like
Mr. Park do the job

74
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,230
and acted innocent.

75
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,770
That's why everything became a mess.

76
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,090
Geum Ru-na!

77
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,190
(Operating Room)

78
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,960
It has been three hours.
Will you sit down?

79
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,100
It might take even longer.

80
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,310
I said I would protect her.

81
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:07,240
I said I wouldn't leave her alone.

82
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,020
(I'm going to protect you.)

83
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:12,960
(You'll never)

84
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,600
be alone ever again.

85
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,800
(Don't worry.)

86
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,870
(I won't ever let you go.)

87
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,070
(I'll protect you.)

88
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,770
It's not your fault.

89
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,870
No.

90
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:32,980
It's my fault.

91
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,830
You did everything you could.

92
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,020
After that,

93
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,570
it's not up to humans.

94
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,930
No.

95
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,640
Yeon-seo won't die.

96
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:47,980
She won't.

97
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,500
(Operating Room)

98
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,780
Why are you giving this to me?

99
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,540
I don't think

100
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,230
I'll be able to see her wake up.

101
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,690
Please give it to her for me.

102
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:27,670
Please.

103
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:32,070
Tell her I'm sorry
I couldn't be there when she wakes up.

104
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:35,460
That I'm sorry I had to leave

105
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,570
without saying...

106
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:40,830
proper goodbye.

107
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,280
That I'm very sorry. Please tell her that.

108
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,100
Do it yourself.

109
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,250
It's not over yet.

110
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,370
Her blood pressure is dropping.

111
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,380
She's in cardiac arrest.

112
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:59,480
Bring epinephrine.

113
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,050
Shock.

114
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,800
(Operating Room)

115
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,680
I lost.

116
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,460
The one who believed in you until the end

117
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,570
was Kim Dan.

118
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:21,030
I hoped and prayed
that your fates would be different.

119
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,240
But in the back of my mind,

120
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,670
I believed you would be sacrificed.

121
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,740
That's why I was afraid.

122
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,770
I wanted to stop that from happening.

123
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:36,870
I'm sorry.

124
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:41,400
I'm sorry for everything until now.

125
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,360
I'm sorry

126
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,570
for liking you rashly.

127
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:04,410
Kim Dan wanted me

128
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,870
to give this to you.

129
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,480
He said he was sorry numerous times.

130
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,350
I hope she thinks

131
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,170
that I went on a trip.

132
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,750
I hope she thinks

133
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,910
that I went on a long trip
to somewhere far away.

134
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:31,030
I hope she thinks

135
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,090
that I'll miss her a lot.

136
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,730
Get up.

137
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:50,430
I can't bear to see you both in torment.

138
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:01,790
Director Ji.

139
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,380
I'm here.

140
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,030
You should go home.

141
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,110
Go take a shower, get changed,

142
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,140
and direct the performance for tonight.

143
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:16,440
That's the least of my concerns.

144
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,600
It's Fantasia's regular stage for 2019.

145
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,920
I'm sure she'd want you to
continue with the show.

146
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,820
-Yes.
-Oh, yes. I understand.

147
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,270
You haven't announced it, have you?

148
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,730
Hold on. No, not yet. Why?

149
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,450
We'll be doing the show tonight.

150
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,940
Hello? We will be doing the show.

151
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,920
It'll go as planned.

152
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,430
Director Ji.

153
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,600
Will we be able to perform tonight?

154
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,120
Of course. "Giselle" will go on.

155
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,890
You all know very well
who our audience will be.

156
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,440
We're going to have some special guests.

157
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,910
We're going to invite those
who have never seen ballet before.

158
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,370
We'd like to show them
how beautiful ballet is.

159
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,900
Then who will be Giselle?

160
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:43,120
I'm only going to practice.

161
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,270
Soo-ji and Jung-eun are both capable of...

162
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,810
You should take the role.

163
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,540
No, I can't.
That's exactly what Ru-na wants.

164
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,210
-I can't do that.
-Ni-na

165
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:54,690
wasn't aware of anything.
I can give you my word.

166
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,960
We know that.

167
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:58,960
We know she called the police yesterday.

168
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,460
If the main ballerina is injured,

169
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,310
her understudy must take her place.

170
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:08,410
Thank you, everyone. But I can't do that.

171
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,880
If I go on stage,

172
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,590
I will only taint Fantasia's reputation.

173
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,230
Don't go on stage as Geum Ru-na's sister

174
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,600
or Choi Yeong-ja's daughter.

175
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,550
Go up there as Ballerina Geum Ni-na.

176
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:25,350
I wish it were you.

177
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,430
You should do it.

178
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,850
Ni-na should do it.

179
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,160
(How dare you come here?)

180
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,590
How dare you?

181
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,940
Ms. Jung, we're on our way
to the police station.

182
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,170
We wanted to see Yeon-seo before...

183
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,150
Don't you dare mention her name.

184
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,690
You have no right to do that.

185
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,110
We're here to apologize

186
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,050
and to atone for our sins.

187
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:00,860
She's still unconscious after her surgery.

188
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,930
Do you think saying,
"I'm sorry," will cut it?

189
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,130
Don't be ridiculous. Just leave.

190
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,330
Where's Yeon-seo's husband?

191
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,620
Let me get his approval.

192
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,620
Did Yeon-seo send you here?

193
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:24,490
I heard you're still insisting
that everything was your doing.

194
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,700
You can curse at me
and call me despicable.

195
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,850
But still,

196
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:33,110
no mother in this world
can accuse their own child.

197
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,300
That's what a parent is.

198
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,190
I'm sure you couldn't believe it at first.

199
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,530
Did you blame yourself
for being a bad parent

200
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,430
and not teaching her well?

201
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:43,810
After that,

202
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:46,140
you probably decided
to act like a righteous parent

203
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,560
by comforting her,
covering up for her wrongdoings,

204
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,060
and claiming that it was your doing.

205
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,720
You're wrong.

206
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,400
Everything that you've done so far

207
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:59,640
was wrong.

208
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,200
A true parent

209
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,070
would make sure
their child pays the price.

210
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,550
(If you repent,
you will be given a new opportunity.)

211
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,230
Humans are given new opportunities.

212
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,830
But before that,

213
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,830
you must apologize to her.

214
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,430
Make sure you apologize sincerely

215
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,970
with your life on the line.

216
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:41,310
Please get up.

217
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,020
Get up and tell me
that you won't forgive me.

218
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,330
Tell me that you won't let this slide.

219
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,460
Let me be punished

220
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:55,960
while you watch.

221
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,440
So please,

222
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,960
open your eyes, will you?

223
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:04,630
Yeon-seo.

224
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,839
Do you hear me?

225
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,970
I'm here to apologize.

226
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,579
We have done

227
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,890
some irreparable things to you.

228
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,970
I'm sorry.

229
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,359
I was wrong.

230
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,440
We came...

231
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,810
We came too late.

232
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:36,440
Yeon-seo, I'm so sorry.

233
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,980
Let's go.

234
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:15,910
Did you hear that?

235
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,350
Now, you just need to open your eyes.

236
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,850
You should be

237
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,470
dancing beautifully on stage right now.

238
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:34,170
This is too heartbreaking for me.

239
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,430
Excuse me.

240
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,430
What is it? Are you going to testify?

241
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:51,640
Can you check
if Fantasia performed today or not?

242
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,270
I'm not your secretary.

243
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,590
Please.

244
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,180
Darn it.

245
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:03,120
"Despite the disturbing
incident at Fantasia,"

246
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,590
"their show, 'Giselle',
ended successfully."

247
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,080
Who played Giselle?

248
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,770
-Who was the dancer?
-"As for the role of Giselle,"

249
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,440
"Ms. Geum Ni-na delivered"

250
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,770
"the best performance of her career."

251
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,640
It's a happy ending for us.

252
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,160
Can you show me the video? Please?

253
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,800
I have to see my sister dance.

254
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,300
(Ballerina Geum Ni-na,)

255
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:34,980
(who delivered the perfect performance,)

256
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,650
(announced her retirement.)

257
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,160
(Ballerina Geum Ni-na will take)

258
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,880
moral responsibility
for her family's actions.

259
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,160
And she said

260
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,370
she would never perform on stage again.

261
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,350
No.

262
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,770
No. No, Ni-na.

263
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,490
No! This can't be!

264
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,910
Oh, no. No, no

265
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,320
(Gildam Hospital, Lee Yeon-seo)

266
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,290
I feel empty.

267
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:24,840
This feels pointless.

268
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,750
She fought every single day.

269
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,030
To her, every minute,

270
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,790
every second of her life was a battle.

271
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,610
But look at her now.

272
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:38,040
She'll wake up.

273
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,680
You know that she's extraordinary.

274
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:50,140
Here, Ms. Jung.

275
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,520
Her doctor said

276
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,480
he wouldn't be surprised
even if she died any minute.

277
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:03,120
Her brain was severely damaged

278
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:05,230
because of the cardiac arrest
she had during surgery.

279
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,950
Even if she wakes up,

280
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,970
she may not be able to
recover to her old self.

281
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:15,620
It looks like
she's still struggling every day.

282
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,650
She's trying to hold

283
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:21,030
onto the flame of life
that's about to go out.

284
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,020
I'm sure she's waiting.

285
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:30,050
You can't reach Kim Dan either, can you?

286
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,080
No, I haven't seen him after that day.

287
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:39,640
That jerk.

288
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:41,230
Heartless man.

289
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:44,610
How could he run away
after abandoning her like this?

290
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:46,240
I clearly warned him.

291
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:47,740
Why did he marry her
if he was going to run away?

292
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,010
How could he?

293
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,290
I'm sure

294
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,500
he had to leave for an urgent matter.

295
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:57,020
He probably couldn't do anything about it.

296
00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:00,140
If that's the case,
he should have called me.

297
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:03,360
But Young Lady
is struggling to live every day.

298
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,580
Did you...

299
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:24,340
It was stained with her blood.

300
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,020
I couldn't just leave it as it was.

301
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,600
It was horrible.

302
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,990
This foolish girl

303
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,290
danced on stage
after wrapping herself with bandages.

304
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,740
He definitely dissipated
right in front of me.

305
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:07,770
Yeon-seo.

306
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:10,980
Yeon-seo.

307
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:14,150
Yeon-seo.

308
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,600
Kim Dan.

309
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:30,960
Did you sleep well?

310
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,260
You are alive.

311
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:37,470
I knew you would be.

312
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,170
Let's go.

313
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,370
Be it our honeymoon trip or whatever.

314
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:53,970
I'll take you to wherever you want to.

315
00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:55,770
Where shall we go?

316
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:02,200
Home. I want to go home.

317
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,650
Our home.

318
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:28,330
-We're home.
-We're home.

319
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,190
Here.

320
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:49,410
It really feels like I'm home.

321
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:51,040
You are really home.

322
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:54,210
What happened?

323
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:06,000
(I thought that was the end.)

324
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,930
(But...)

325
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,130
("Listen, Angel Kim Dan.")

326
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:43,260
("Angel Kim Dan,
you were given a mission")

327
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:47,000
("to let Lee Yeon-seo, a human,
know what true love is.")

328
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,600
("You became a human
to carry out this mission.")

329
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,940
("Love that can cover everything is")

330
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,160
("risking your life
and sacrificing yourself.")

331
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,980
("You have successfully
finished your mission.")

332
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:02,010
("However,")

333
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,920
("you committed
a sin of loving a human as an angel.")

334
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,430
("However,")

335
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,820
("the earnest prayers
of the archangel were heard,")

336
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,020
("and you stopped yourself")

337
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,380
("committing a mortal sin.")

338
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,250
("I gladly take the beautiful dance")

339
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,770
("and forgive your sin.")

340
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,280
("Therefore,")

341
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,680
("Angel Kim Dan will leave the earth")

342
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:35,320
("and return to paradise.")

343
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,560
So you didn't become a human.

344
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,920
You're still an angel.

345
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,120
Are you disappointed?

346
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:59,470
I'm happy as long as you don't disappear.

347
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:01,940
Because if you do,

348
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,840
I feel like I will too.

349
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,840
I didn't return to dust thanks to you.

350
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,780
You're the reason why I'm here.

351
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,690
I truly missed this smell.

352
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,060
Me too.

353
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:32,380
Let's plant these rape flower seeds.

354
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:35,330
-What should I do?
-Press them down.

355
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,610
Pour it.

356
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:39,030
Slowly.

357
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,970
Here.

358
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,630
Come here.

359
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:51,870
My gosh!

360
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,560
It's really scary, isn't it?

361
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,360
No, it's not scary at all.

362
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,650
Then why were you surprised?

363
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,540
They said girls should do this.

364
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:02,570
What?

365
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,380
You startled me.

366
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,120
Hey.

367
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:13,130
What's wrong?

368
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:19,990
Come here.

369
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,990
One, two, three.

370
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:36,090
My forehead became red.

371
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,340
No, it didn't. It looks the same.

372
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,510
-My turn.
-Be careful.

373
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,580
Come here. This will hurt.

374
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:52,060
("'It's me.
I came because I missed you.'")

375
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:55,630
("But sadly, the Little Mermaid's voice")

376
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,430
("didn't come out.")

377
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:01,880
"The prince couldn't recognize her."

378
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:03,990
What a jerk.

379
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,760
He had a great time
with the Little Mermaid

380
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:08,700
and then ended up
marrying some other girl.

381
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,150
He didn't know, that's why.

382
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,330
Go on.

383
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,230
Change the story
by saying that the prince found out

384
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:20,180
and married the Little Mermaid instead.

385
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,590
Goodness, you always need to
have it your way.

386
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:28,450
"Her sisters told her."

387
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,270
"'Pierce the prince's heart
with this dagger.'"

388
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,960
"'If you don't,
you'll turn into a bubble.'"

389
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,690
"The Little Mermaid replied with a smile."

390
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,700
"'It's okay. I'm still happy.'"

391
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,510
Kim Dan.

392
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,540
Yes?

393
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,320
This is a dream, right?

394
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,520
How did you know?

395
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,700
Your heart

396
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,530
isn't beating.

397
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,870
You are just

398
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:46,640
an illusion.

399
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:49,670
I missed you so much,

400
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:52,360
so I created you.

401
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,980
I'm not an illusion.

402
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:10,840
It's really me.

403
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:17,790
("Therefore,")

404
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,170
("Angel Kim Dan will leave the earth")

405
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,670
("and return to paradise.")

406
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:39,750
No.

407
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,470
I won't leave.

408
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:48,020
Are you allowed to do that?

409
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,890
I couldn't say a proper goodbye to you.

410
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:54,270
I'm going to

411
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:58,230
die soon, aren't I?

412
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:01,310
That's why

413
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,950
you're here.

414
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,410
It's our last farewell.

415
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,420
Listen to me carefully, Yeon-seo.

416
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:23,130
At first, I was flustered

417
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,500
and mad at Him.

418
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,630
I didn't understand
why He brought us together,

419
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,000
only to make me witness your death.

420
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,560
It was too painful.

421
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,640
But after giving it some thought,

422
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:39,280
I think the time that was given to us

423
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:42,620
was a gift.

424
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,670
It's not a gift when you take it back.

425
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:57,100
I didn't die that night

426
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,210
and was given 100 days.

427
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:04,270
And because of that,
I could meet you, recognize you,

428
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:07,700
and fall in love.

429
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,210
This is enough for me.

430
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,850
It truly is.

431
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:18,219
I hope you laugh a lot.

432
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:20,679
You can cry at times.

433
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,530
But don't cry too much.

434
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,860
And dance all you want.

435
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:27,239
Be happy.

436
00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:31,060
At times, be fussy.

437
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:35,070
Live like a human being.

438
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:37,440
You want me to live?

439
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:38,980
It's my last wish.

440
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,100
I want to give

441
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:43,690
my last breath to you.

442
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:55,969
I loved you.

443
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,190
I love you.

444
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:05,120
And I'll keep loving you.

445
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,030
(I tried to fight against destiny.)

446
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:36,090
(But looking back,)

447
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,090
(everything was based on my choice.)

448
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:44,890
(Saving Yeon-seo, loving her,)

449
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:48,020
(trying to kill an evil person,)

450
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,390
(and not killing her.)

451
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:55,230
(I was given this life once again
as an angel,)

452
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,570
(and I'd like to give it to her.)

453
00:35:58,750 --> 00:35:59,850
(This is)

454
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:04,560
(my final decision.)

455
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:10,900
Goodbye.

456
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:15,120
Yeon-seo.

457
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,010
Young Lady.

458
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,930
You woke up! You did!

459
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:07,660
You survived!

460
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:09,500
Doctor!

461
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:25,780
(3 months later)

462
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:28,910
I'm the new chairwoman, Lee Yeon-seo.

463
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:30,710
Let me officially introduce myself.

464
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,080
How are you feeling?

465
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,920
It's your first time to be here
after three months.

466
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:35,380
I can't dance right now,

467
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,220
but I'm going through
rehabilitation training now.

468
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,590
Meanwhile,

469
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:42,020
Director Ji managed
the ballet theater very well.

470
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:45,060
Don't you want a grand inauguration
after that terrible incident?

471
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:47,120
I should cut down
on unnecessary expenses first.

472
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,120
I plan to overhaul
all of the existing systems

473
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,010
the predecessor had been using.

474
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,600
I plan to hire
a group of management specialists.

475
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:56,010
More than anything,

476
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,860
Fantasia Ballet Theater will take

477
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,710
a step closer to the public.

478
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:03,010
I plan to bring back Visiting Ballet
in the second half.

479
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,470
Are you all right?

480
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,800
I'm fine.

481
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:17,000
I even started to make turns
starting last week.

482
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:18,500
I was asking about your heart.

483
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,750
You didn't go outside once
for the past three months.

484
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,200
In your first week,

485
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:26,280
you stayed in your room and cried all day.

486
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,850
People who are left behind must go on

487
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,480
with their lives

488
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,030
although nothing can be as cruel as that.

489
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,450
Director Ji,

490
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:38,210
I have this hope.

491
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,850
It's like having a hunch.

492
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:43,440
A hunch that I might be able to
meet Kim Dan again.

493
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:46,870
Don't you know
what it means to be dissipated?

494
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,770
After looking at the handkerchief,
I wasn't sure.

495
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:50,880
But right now, the feather on it

496
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,590
turned black.

497
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,490
And so is yours.

498
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,030
But you are

499
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,310
alive and well.

500
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:01,310
I didn't know that
I'd be able to meet Seong-woo again.

501
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:03,730
Meeting a dead boy

502
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,270
is actually impossible.

503
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,850
But I met him after he became Kim Dan.

504
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,520
-Then...
-Even if you met him again,

505
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:11,030
he came to you
after losing all of his memories.

506
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,670
Kim Dan who can't recognize you.

507
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,390
Do you think that's really him?

508
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:16,530
I don't care.

509
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,470
I remember him.

510
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:28,810
What happened?

511
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:31,180
Isn't her final trial or something today?

512
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:33,120
I told you
I wanted to watch the trial in court.

513
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:34,970
Would you want to see her face again?

514
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,240
I don't want to see her even in my dream.

515
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:37,650
-What is it?
-The news article.

516
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:40,070
-Where?
-The article is up.

517
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,810
-17 years?
-"Violation of medical law,"

518
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:44,950
"attempted assault,
obstruction of business,"

519
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,140
"flight from police..."

520
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:48,210
That's a long list.

521
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:50,100
Seventeen years in prison?

522
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,740
Chairman Geum Gi-cheon
will serve six years in prison.

523
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:55,120
Mr. Park had mitigating factors,

524
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:56,260
so he got seven years.

525
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:58,240
What about her?

526
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:00,000
Associate Director Geum Ru-na?

527
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:03,080
(Defendant Geum Ru-na)

528
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:05,150
(is guilty of murder,
obstruction of business,)

529
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,480
(and assault.)

530
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,780
(Given that the defendant
shows no signs of remorse,)

531
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:12,410
(her acts are considered depraved,)

532
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,920
(and it is highly likely
that she will commit another crime,)

533
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:19,100
(the court sentences Defendant Geum Ru-na
life in prison.)

534
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:27,810
Inmate 5030. You have a visitor.

535
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,150
I don't have anyone to visit me.

536
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,820
Who is it?

537
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:34,540
She said she's your family.

538
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:41,050
(Rules of Visitation)

539
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,170
Why are you my family?

540
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,620
I know.

541
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:02,080
I really hate that too.

542
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,840
Are you here to mock me?

543
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,820
To see how low I have gone?

544
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:08,160
Well, that's part of it.

545
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,500
I heard that you kept trying
to kill yourself.

546
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,610
I came here to tell you not to do that.

547
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,220
Are you worried about me now?

548
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:19,510
Yes, I'm worried that you might try to die

549
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,140
in order to run away

550
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,250
from paying for what you did.

551
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,840
Ru-na.

552
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,620
Have you ever

553
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,710
loved someone with all of your heart?

554
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,300
Are you that stupid?

555
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,120
Whom do you think I did all of this for?

556
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:39,660
Stop lying.

557
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,340
You've never loved Ni-na.

558
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:45,030
You would never do this
if you truly loved her.

559
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,580
You would rather die,
so you could save that person.

560
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,290
You have never

561
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,240
felt this way. Not once.

562
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:57,260
That's why your heart is empty.

563
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:59,770
And you're desperately trying to
fill that empty heart.

564
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:03,200
What do you know?
How dare you run your mouth?

565
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:04,430
I truly

566
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,720
pity you

567
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,270
because you will live here
for the rest of your life

568
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,170
without knowing
how precious and beautiful love is.

569
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:16,440
Stay healthy.

570
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,250
Why did you want to come here?

571
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,410
I'm sure just the sight of her
disgusts you.

572
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,080
I wanted to tell her

573
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,680
that it was a total defeat of hers.

574
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:47,680
You're back, Young Lady.

575
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,130
I'm happy.

576
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:52,520
Now that everything is settled,

577
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:55,340
forget about everything
and go back to the old you.

578
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:56,920
Okay?

579
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:15,530
Are you sure you guys have no idea?

580
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:17,430
I definitely put the handkerchief

581
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:18,970
in the drawer right there.

582
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:20,680
As soon as I got discharged,
I put it there

583
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:23,720
and never took it out.
But that handkerchief is gone!

584
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,970
-Young Lady.
-How does this make sense?

585
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:29,220
They've neither seen nor touched it.

586
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:30,540
Are you telling me

587
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:32,080
that a handkerchief somehow

588
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:33,750
walked out of the house and left?

589
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,210
Her old self is back,
and so is her temper.

590
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,970
Please!

591
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:45,670
I'm begging you.

592
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,020
When you clean my room and Kim Dan's room,

593
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:52,100
please do not touch anything in the rooms.

594
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:57,160
The person who finds the handkerchief

595
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,090
will get 200 percent
of the paycheck as a bonus.

596
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:27,650
Why did you call the doctor?

597
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:29,100
I told you I was fine.

598
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:30,550
If you were fine,

599
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,700
why would you come to the park
on rainy days

600
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:32,880
like a crazy woman?

601
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:34,820
And if you were fine,
why would you talk to yourself

602
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:36,580
when there's no one around you at home?

603
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,390
How long does it take to brew this?

604
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:54,660
No matter how much I try,

605
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:56,600
it doesn't taste like your tea.

606
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,800
About three minutes?
Won't the tea be too bitter then?

607
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:06,410
It's too hot.

608
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:13,940
Don't just stand there. Come and hold me.

609
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:15,300
Come on.

610
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:19,960
No, I mean...

611
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:22,690
I did that
because I saw an illusion of him.

612
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:24,850
And that hallucination is a symptom.

613
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:26,960
Trauma. Stress.

614
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:32,500
Actually, when we first met,

615
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,570
I sensed that he was there.

616
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:36,990
No one could see him,
but I was the only one who could.

617
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:39,450
So the Kim Dan I'm seeing right now

618
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:42,310
might be real. No?

619
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:45,260
I'll prescribe you medicine.

620
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:47,770
Make sure you take your medicine.

621
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:04,580
Young Lady.

622
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:08,190
Want to have some soju?

623
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:12,100
You won't take the medicine, will you?

624
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:14,480
You can drink it then.

625
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:17,950
Sometimes, this is better than medicine.

626
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:21,430
Ms. Jung, give me back the handkerchief.

627
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:24,860
I'm telling the truth. I didn't take it.

628
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:27,680
You are the only one who hates Kim Dan.

629
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,330
Darn it.

630
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:41,490
What's this?

631
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:43,650
Mementos to people who were left behind.

632
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:45,320
And trash to people

633
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:46,730
who ran away.

634
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:56,540
His clothes are still here.

635
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,220
All of his stuff is still here.

636
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:03,760
Where on earth did he...

637
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:19,330
(Happy first wedding anniversary!)

638
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:23,380
Why did you give me this now?

639
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:26,460
Look how he wrote those
even before your performance.

640
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:28,400
He was already thinking about
leaving then.

641
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:30,990
That's why he was in a rush
to get married.

642
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,310
This is Kim Dan's

643
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:35,880
handwriting.

644
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:40,190
(Happy first wedding anniversary!)

645
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,730
Happy first wedding anniversary!

646
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:46,830
(This is the first letter
I wrote to a human, not the deity.)

647
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,060
Isn't it an honor?

648
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:52,680
(Happy second wedding anniversary!
I love you.)

649
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:55,280
(Happy second wedding anniversary!
I love you.)

650
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,040
(Happy third wedding anniversary!)

651
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:05,840
(Did the rape flowers bloom beautifully?)

652
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,680
(Happy 10th wedding anniversary!)

653
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:14,510
(Gosh, you're still not over me?)

654
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:20,180
(Happy 30th wedding anniversary!)

655
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:21,860
(I still)

656
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:24,060
(love you the same.)

657
00:48:31,670 --> 00:48:32,680
Wait...

658
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:45,090
I really shouldn't drink too much.

659
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:48,390
Drink up.

660
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:50,720
Drink up and forget everything.

661
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:52,880
Forget it.

662
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:56,130
Exactly.

663
00:48:57,890 --> 00:49:01,020
I heard brain cells get damaged
when someone drinks.

664
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:04,230
That means I'll forget.
No, I can't do that.

665
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:07,830
I won't even forget an eyelash on him.

666
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:13,910
Young Lady, pull yourself together.

667
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:19,490
I really feel like Kim Dan is with me.

668
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,710
I keep seeing him.

669
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:25,920
Look over there.

670
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:29,130
He's standing right there.

671
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:30,760
Kim Dan!

672
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:34,230
What's over there? Nothing is there.

673
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:37,230
You're scaring me. Stop it.

674
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:39,950
Did I really go crazy?

675
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:41,980
You can take medicine.

676
00:49:42,990 --> 00:49:45,280
You can talk to a doctor and get treated.

677
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:48,090
No. If I take medicine,

678
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:50,430
I won't be able to see him.

679
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,320
If I get treated,

680
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:54,910
I won't be able to see him anymore.

681
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:58,130
If I can see him
because I have gone insane,

682
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:02,350
then I wish to remain insane.

683
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:04,070
I just want to be crazy 24 hours a day,

684
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:05,740
365 days a year.

685
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:06,930
But...

686
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:10,620
But I can't live like that.

687
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:15,770
He gave me his life.
He gave me this breath.

688
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:19,200
I have to live really well

689
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:24,220
because I have to live for Kim Dan too.

690
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:30,250
I miss you.

691
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,280
I want to hug you.

692
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:37,770
I want to smell you, Kim Dan.

693
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,960
(Report)

694
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:17,900
(After wandering
around the deep darkness,)

695
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:21,280
(Angel Kim Dan
reports back with another mission.)

696
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:32,640
How long does it take to brew this?

697
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:35,670
No matter how much I try,
it doesn't taste like your tea.

698
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:38,880
About three minutes?

699
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:48,080
Don't just stand there. Come and hold me.

700
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:51,290
Come on.

701
00:51:58,770 --> 00:52:00,660
He's standing right there.

702
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:01,980
Kim Dan!

703
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:05,640
What's over there? Nothing is there.

704
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:08,850
(-Thank you.)
-You're scaring me. Stop it.

705
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:10,830
(You let me stay with her)

706
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,730
(even if she cannot see me.)

707
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:15,930
(It's all right.)

708
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:18,400
(Even if she doesn't know to the end,)

709
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,070
(even if nobody knows,)

710
00:52:21,170 --> 00:52:23,240
(even if I must just watch her forever,)

711
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,050
(it's all right with me.)

712
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:44,490
This is disappointing.

713
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:46,690
I wanted to perform one more time
with you.

714
00:52:46,770 --> 00:52:49,190
You won't listen to me
and dance the way you want anyway.

715
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:50,870
And there was fun in creating

716
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:52,410
a piece of that, wasn't there?

717
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:56,230
Thank you for everything.

718
00:52:58,570 --> 00:52:59,670
Me too.

719
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:02,700
Are you sure you'll leave
without seeing the corps?

720
00:53:02,970 --> 00:53:04,950
I hate doing something like that.

721
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,440
It's embarrassing and awkward.

722
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:07,760
Okay, then.

723
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:13,130
Director Ji.

724
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,220
Do you feel

725
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:19,510
more at ease now?

726
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:30,470
Is there a principal dancer
you're looking for?

727
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:32,530
Not sure. I'll look for one.

728
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:35,920
There is a great ballerina I know.

729
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:37,420
Do you want to meet her?

730
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:45,690
You can't run away like this.

731
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:48,150
You should try to lose your temper
when you're in New York.

732
00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:51,450
Thank you for everything.

733
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:53,480
Keep up your good work
no matter where you go.

734
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:58,930
Eun-young, Woo-jin.
Lower the lift for the judgment.

735
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:00,910
Soo-ji, make sure
you always watch your shoulders.

736
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,010
And...

737
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:04,830
Come on, you're nagging us
until the very end.

738
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:06,940
Just make sure you look after yourself.

739
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:12,440
Thanks. Great work. Great work, everyone.

740
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:13,450
Thank you. Great work.

741
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:14,950
-Thank you, Director Ji.
-Thank you.

742
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,750
-Let's take a picture.
-Time for a picture.

743
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:18,910
Okay.

744
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:21,510
Make sure your face is shown.

745
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:23,260
-Lower it a little.
-I can't see myself.

746
00:54:23,350 --> 00:54:26,920
-Okay, Fantasia!
-Fantasia!

747
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:36,950
One.

748
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:40,950
Up. And down.

749
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:44,120
You shouldn't look in the mirror.

750
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:46,670
Down. To your fingertips.

751
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,310
Your eyes.

752
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:50,590
Come here.

753
00:54:50,810 --> 00:54:53,010
What did I say you need to look at
when you're dancing?

754
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:54,720
-Myself.
-You're right.

755
00:54:54,810 --> 00:54:57,450
What do you think you became
when you hear this music?

756
00:54:57,540 --> 00:54:59,210
Like a cloud in the sky.

757
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:01,980
Right? Then you can feel that
when you try again.

758
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:04,100
Everyone, let's take it from the top.

759
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:22,180
That's a cup of drip coffee. Very fancy.

760
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:25,610
I have to save in order to pay my rent.

761
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:31,600
I heard you're going to New York.
Yi-geon told me.

762
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:32,870
Congratulations.

763
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:36,700
Are you sure you don't want to
return as a performer?

764
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:39,380
I think this fits me the best.

765
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:42,110
Dancing happily with children.

766
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:43,700
I feel content.

767
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,690
If you change your mind,
come whenever you want.

768
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:50,740
I'm an expert
on bringing back a ballerina who retired.

769
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:56,500
When we meet again, I hope I can meet you

770
00:55:56,850 --> 00:55:58,960
as a human, not a ballerina.

771
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:27,340
I'm glad that she has been
taking the medicine.

772
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:31,170
It's not even raining.

773
00:56:31,790 --> 00:56:33,680
Where did Young Lady go?

774
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:41,110
Everything is going back to its place.

775
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:44,770
I guess they are all going back
to the beginning.

776
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:56,030
But you aren't here.

777
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:01,220
I can't see you as a hallucination either.

778
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:06,280
I'll be brave.

779
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:09,490
I'll believe that you are watching me
from somewhere.

780
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:00,180
Nothing is written on it again.

781
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:02,860
This is a huge scam.

782
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:04,930
I never even found one!

783
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,420
(Today.)

784
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:18,090
(Right here.)

785
00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:25,350
This is so weird.

786
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:32,830
I only spent

787
00:58:33,970 --> 00:58:35,690
a season with Kim Dan.

788
00:58:40,310 --> 00:58:41,850
But why do I

789
00:58:43,870 --> 00:58:46,030
feel completely empty?

790
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:53,380
I will be brave.

791
00:58:53,510 --> 00:58:54,830
I will.

792
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:57,640
But...

793
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:02,180
But let me think of you
and cry from time to time.

794
00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:33,720
Yeon-seo, pull yourself together.

795
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:46,880
Kim Dan.

796
00:59:48,510 --> 00:59:50,220
Kim Dan, come out.

797
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:52,440
Can you

798
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:54,240
see me?

799
01:00:59,170 --> 01:01:01,060
How can this happen?

800
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:04,100
I knew

801
01:01:07,090 --> 01:01:08,190
you would come.

802
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:21,480
(This is my final report.)

803
01:01:22,890 --> 01:01:26,230
(It is very interesting
to observe humans.)

(If the time of eternity
is colored in black and white,)

(humans shine in all kinds of colors,)

806
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:33,930
(as if they can be shattered
at any moment.)

807
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:36,480
(That's why it makes them interesting.)

808
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:38,770
(When the mission is over,)

809
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:41,190

with this miraculous love)

815
01:01:57,910 --> 01:01:59,540
(within that providence,)

816
01:02:00,990 --> 01:02:02,700
(brilliantly and dangerously,)

817
01:02:03,540 --> 01:02:05,210
(as we shine radiantly.)
