1
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,220
What's wrong?

2
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,980
Did you cry?

3
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:34,530
Why? What's wrong?

4
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,660
Nothing.

5
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:40,860
I just...

6
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,210
missed you...

7
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:46,760
so much.

8
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:52,040
Me too.

9
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,590
I missed you too.

10
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:04,800
(I wish to be human.)

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,060
(Is this...)

12
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,480
(possible?)

13
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:17,910
(Report)

14
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,310
(He will)

15
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:30,980
disappear like dust,

16
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,960
like powder.

17
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,009
-Why?
-Because the deity is very jealous.

18
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:40,130
He doesn't like
what's His being taken away.

19
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,229
Kim Dan...

20
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,350
will dissipate

21
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,330
because of your love.

22
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,330
You're lying.

23
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:50,820
Stop lying.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,450
You don't want to believe it.

25
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,180
I know what that feels like.

26
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,520
How do you know?

27
00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:00,280
I know you're trying to scare me

28
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,780
with your lie to break us up.

29
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,750
I can go to the church and check.

30
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,070
I'll ask his senior.

31
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,430
He'll tell me for sure.

32
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,370
Do you get it now?

33
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,050
This is why I know so much

34
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,250
about Kim Dan.

35
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,070
What are you going to do?

36
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,700
It's none of your business.

37
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,380
Are you going to ruin her
because you can't have her?

38
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,760
Whatever floats your boat.

39
00:02:58,850 --> 00:02:59,990
You said you wanted to live.

40
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,010
But if you destroy something
that lets you live,

41
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,070
you will die too.

42
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,680
I'm doing this to live.

43
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,530
I had no idea.

44
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,550
If I had known...

45
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,450
If anyone had told me, I would have never

46
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,140
gone to the church

47
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,510
with Seol-hee.

48
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,400
If I had to abandon the deity,

49
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,640
I would have done it alone!

50
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,990
You wish to protect

51
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,100
Lee Yeon-seo.

52
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,950
Just like

53
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,160
how you are trying to protect Kim Dan.

54
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,390
It was all for you.

55
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,540
But if you abandon me,

56
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,970
-what am I to do?
-Don't make excuses!

57
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,150
Don't use me as your reason

58
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,610
when you're just refusing
to give up Fantasia!

59
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,110
So why are you using me?

60
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,910
It's all because of your greed!

61
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,210
Can you say...

62
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,680
that I'm wrong?

63
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,010
You shouldn't have done that.

64
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,159
Had you really cared for me,

65
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,360
you wouldn't have done that.

66
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,409
You want me to be kind?

67
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,700
Because it'll all come back to me?

68
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,760
Ni-na.

69
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:52,060
If it's all because of me, I'll disappear.

70
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,040
That will fix everything.

71
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,490
Ni-na.

72
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,030
Mom told me. Yeon-seo was here, right?

73
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:17,090
Ru-na, tell me you didn't know.

74
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,510
Tell me you didn't know the things...

75
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,810
Mom and Dad did.

76
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,580
Let's go inside, okay?

77
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:29,410
When did I ask any of you
to kill people for me?

78
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,700
How could you do something so horrible?

79
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,380
Are you sure you didn't?

80
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,470
What do you mean?

81
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,150
When Yeon-seo returned,

82
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,050
did you really never wish
that she'd be dead?

83
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,190
You were happy when she lost her sight.

84
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:48,950
Am I wrong?

85
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,700
-That was because--
-Look into your heart.

86
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:56,470
You're only where you are right now

87
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,100
because of what happened to her.

88
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,840
We just gave you what you had desired.

89
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,460
So don't cause a fuss and come inside.

90
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,260
(Lee Yeon-seo, Yoo Seong-woo)

91
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,090
(Lee Yeon-seo, Yoo Seong-woo)

92
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,160
The one who's thirsty will dig a well.

93
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:30,570
I'm sure

94
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:32,810
there's another way.

95
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,110
Okay.

96
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,610
Who is it?

97
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,210
Is it you, Yeon-seo?

98
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,420
I couldn't fall asleep.

99
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,560
Were you busy?

100
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,230
What?

101
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,770
Well...

102
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:08,630
I was studying.

103
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,650
-I can leave if you're busy.
-No.

104
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,640
Come in. Come on in.

105
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,940
Let's see...

106
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,420
Do you want to lie down?

107
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,710
Is it too awkward? What should I do?

108
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,950
Should I change the blankets?

109
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,600
Wait. What I meant was...

110
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,430
Don't mind me
and continue what you were doing.

111
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,980
Okay. All right.

112
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,960
Okay.

113
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,450
Kim Dan.

114
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:14,760
Come here.

115
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,820
I want to touch you.

116
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,630
What is it? Am I that fascinating?

117
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,090
You're so warm.

118
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:39,130
Your heart is...

119
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,210
thumping like this.

120
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,570
(Kim Dan will dissipate)

121
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,980
(because of your love.)

122
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,540
(Will everything really disappear?)

123
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,370
I look like human on the outside.

124
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,100
But since I'm not completely human,
my wings pop out,

125
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,300
and my wounds heal on their own.

126
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,370
But other than those things,

127
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,650
I'm just like any other man.

128
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:07,730
I run out of breath and sweat too.

129
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,710
Thanks.

130
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,180
Thanks for showing me

131
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,040
your weak side.

132
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,970
You may pretend to be strong and unfazed,

133
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,710
but I know you're weak at heart.

134
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,090
Everything will turn out all right.

135
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,070
Tomorrow's board meeting,

136
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,830
your performance for "Giselle,"

137
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,050
and us.

138
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,730
Okay.

139
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,310
Thank you for coming out
on such short notice.

140
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,490
I have an important announcement to make.

141
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,860
From today on, General Director Choi,

142
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,100
Associate Director Geum,

143
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,820
and Chairman Geum will be dismissed.

144
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:32,960
-"Dismissed"?
-What?

145
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,280
What is the reason?

146
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,400
Why is their entire family
being dismissed?

147
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:52,580
Yeon-seo.

148
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,630
Please allow me to say my last goodbye.

149
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:24,090
Hello, I'm Choi Yeong-ja.

150
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,760
Up until today,

151
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,190
I've given my all to make Fantasia better.

152
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,370
I may have been unskilled and lacking
in many ways,

153
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,960
but I can confidently tell you

154
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,510
that my passion
for the past ten years was genuine.

155
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:42,130
I am forever grateful for your support

156
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,550
during the past...

157
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,730
What is this?

158
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:00,830
No way.

159
00:11:59,810 --> 00:11:59,730
(Chairman Geum Confesses to Preventing
Lee Yeon-seo's Cornea Transplant)

160
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,760
What is this?

161
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,830
"Chairman Geum Ki-chun Confesses"

162
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,040
"to Preventing Lee Yeon-seo's
Cornea Transplant"?

163
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:13,370
Who?

164
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:16,230
What?

165
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:32,640
-This is ridiculous.
-It's unbelievable.

166
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,630
-He really did that?
-My goodness.

167
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,890
I was the one who gave all of the orders.

168
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,220
Yeon-seo couldn't receive
a cornea transplant sooner,

169
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,860
and her secretary died from a car accident

170
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:46,670
all because of me.

171
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,520
I will take full responsibility for this.

172
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,830
-Wait a minute.
-Please explain, sir.

173
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,770
-Sir!
-Please wait!

174
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,570
"Chairman of Fantasia Prevented"

175
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,950
"the Cornea Transplant
and Abetted Murder"?

176
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,020
What will happen
to our ballet theater then?

177
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,730
We won't get disbanded, will we?

178
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,800
That should never happen.

179
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,180
Don't worry.

180
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,190
You must all be shocked.

181
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,700
I tried to keep it quiet,

182
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,420
but it blew up.

183
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,760
Everything's just returning
to how they were before,

184
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,520
so please don't worry and be patient.

185
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:24,250
Fantasia won't disappear
just because of this.

186
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,830
You have my word.

187
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,080
What if the sponsors back out?

188
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,970
What if they want a refund

189
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,420
for the upcoming performance?

190
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,840
Let's not worry about things
that haven't even occurred yet.

191
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,830
My performances were always
the best so far.

192
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,100
You should all go home for today.

193
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,340
We'll start practicing again
once everything's settled.

194
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,660
Your corps seemed very agitated.

195
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,210
This is exactly why I tried
to keep this a secret.

196
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,350
Yeon-seo, can we talk?

197
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,200
I'm sorry.

198
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,360
What kind of tactic is this now?

199
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,030
Whether it was an order or a favor,

200
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,700
I shouldn't have done it.

201
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,590
I shouldn't have done what I did.

202
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,540
But I found myself on this side
before I knew it.

203
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,220
I really regret it.

204
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,720
I'm really sorry, Yeon-seo.

205
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,820
What can I do to make up for this?

206
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,080
I'll die in front of you
if that's what you want.

207
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,090
Please forgive my family.

208
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,870
You'll only be at peace if you forgive us.

209
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,290
I see. That's what you wanted.

210
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,320
If that's why you wanted to talk,
I have nothing else to say.

211
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,480
-Yeon-seo.
-You've got the wrong person.

212
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,430
Who am I to forgive you guys?

213
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,680
It was Mr. Jo who died on that bridge,
not me.

214
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,450
It was Mr. Moon who was murdered

215
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,090
when he finally came to help
after gathering his courage.

216
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,100
Those people are dead.

217
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,890
I can't ask them for forgiveness
even if I wanted to.

218
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,740
I wanted your mercy, at least.

219
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,790
Uncle was behind everything?

220
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,770
You had no choice but to help him?

221
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,750
Stop putting on an act.

222
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,250
I know you were behind everything.

223
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,450
It's over for my family.

224
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,750
My family is in ruins.

225
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,170
Let's wrap it up here.

226
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,380
What can you gain
after sending an old man to prison?

227
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,800
He's getting punished
for the crimes he committed.

228
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,470
Don't try to guilt-trip me.

229
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:21,080
You know, assailants always complain
why the victims won't forgive them

230
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:22,970
when they are about to pay
for what they did.

231
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:25,000
They act like they're the victims.

232
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:29,180
Ru-na.

233
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,030
I hope you cooperate
with the investigation.

234
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,920
I won't settle or be lenient.

235
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,820
It was probably because of Ni-na, right?

236
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,720
Because she's your sister.

237
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,700
Because you love her.

238
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,020
But Ru-na,

239
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,310
I'm also your cousin.

240
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,550
I'm your family too.

241
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,880
Family isn't that important.

242
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,690
We are only a group of people

243
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,320
that came together by coincidence.

244
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,910
It's fun now that you know everything.

245
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:10,930
Go ahead with everything

246
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,470
you're planning to do from now on.

247
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,970
That way,

248
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,260
it will excite me even more.

249
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:22,990
Watch your back.

250
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,820
(Are you still dreaming?)

251
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,810
Dreaming of becoming human?

252
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:54,890
Don't worry.

253
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,090
I will never sacrifice Yeon-seo.

254
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,240
I'm glad you understood me.

255
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,400
It's wise to give up.

256
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,740
I didn't give up yet.

257
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,750
I'm sure that He has a plan
for me and Yeon-seo.

258
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,730
And I'll figure it out.

259
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,020
Also,

260
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:17,590
I must have crossed paths with you
for a reason.

261
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:21,460
-What do you mean?
-I'm saying that our meeting was

262
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,710
also His providence.

263
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:42,320
-What are you all doing?
-We need to practice.

264
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,730
What are we going to do at home?

265
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:45,880
If we rest,
our bodies are going to feel stiff.

266
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:47,950
You said

267
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,280
you were going to direct us
for the scene with the Willis.

268
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,000
You said you would make us the best.

269
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,800
I want to be the best too.

270
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:56,130
Me too. And I like "Giselle."

271
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,370
I'll do a great job.

272
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:01,680
Warm up within 20 minutes.

273
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:02,910
Listen up, Willis.

274
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,590
I'll check everything
including the angle of your fingers.

275
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,980
Did they locate Ki Joon-soo?

276
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:16,950
Not yet.

277
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,890
He's probably staying low
in case he gets caught.

278
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,170
We must catch him quickly.

279
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:24,210
It looked like
Geum Ru-na was full of spite.

280
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:26,490
I didn't think she'd repent right away.

281
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,080
Usually,

282
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,850
people full of spite go down
only after holding out to the end.

283
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,280
Dan, take good care of Yeon-seo.

284
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:36,880
Let me go talk to the reporters
before I head back.

285
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,070
Okay, Ms. Jung.

286
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,340
Why did you pretend
as if you weren't affected?

287
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,650
Who? Me?

288
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,190
That's not true.

289
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,020
It's not just anyone.

290
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,130
Your own family tried to hurt you.

291
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,460
It's only natural for you
to be devastated.

292
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,100
I told you.

293
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:06,310
You can show me your weak side.

294
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,070
Those people

295
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,180
aren't my family anymore.

296
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,650
I only have Ms. Jung...

297
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,680
and you.

298
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,510
Yeon-seo, you got everything.

299
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:22,280
You have two people
who won't betray you ever.

300
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:24,880
"Ever"?

301
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,030
Kim Dan, there's a place
I want to go with you.

302
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,830
Where?

303
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,450
Where do you want to go? Where is it?

304
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,710
This. I want to do this with you.

305
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,220
You want to take a photo?

306
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,670
Yes, let's go inside.

307
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,880
How do we do this?

308
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,390
Well, I don't know either.

309
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:50,750
It's your first time?

310
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,010
Hey, I went to Russia to study ballet
when I was 12 years old.

311
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,680
So I didn't have much of school life.

312
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,580
Perhaps you didn't have friends
because of your temper.

313
00:20:58,670 --> 00:20:59,990
Ni-na was there too.

314
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,150
-What?
-What's this?

315
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,660
Who are you? Is this it?

316
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,070
That's it. That's the one.

317
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,220
What? It already took a photo.

318
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,370
What is this?

319
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:16,980
(Let's start having fun with the shoot.)

320
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,090
Hey, here it is.

321
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:24,020
-What is this?
-Look at you.

322
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:26,300
I can't believe it prints real photos.

323
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:27,450
This is fascinating.

324
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,020
These photos will last
until you become an old lady

325
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,470
with silver hair, right?

326
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:41,970
This is a cheap one,

327
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,900
so it will probably get faded.

328
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:45,440
What should we do then?

329
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,960
We can take one every season, every year.

330
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:58,730
This time, let's take a really funny one.

331
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,830
Are you in?

332
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:02,690
-What about this one?
-Look.

333
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,010
What?

334
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,170
My gosh, it looks great on you.

335
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,660
That's not how you put it on.

336
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,030
How do you put it on then?

337
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:37,050
(Don't tell me)

338
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,780
(you thought
an angel could stay here forever.)

339
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:41,940
(He will)

340
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,390
(disappear like dust,)

341
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,720
(like powder)

342
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,410
(because of your love.)

343
00:22:58,130 --> 00:22:59,890
What is it? Tell me what's upsetting you.

344
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:03,630
Should we just quit all this?

345
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,170
What can I do?

346
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:07,630
Don't disappear.

347
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,920
Can you not die?

348
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,660
How did you know?

349
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,080
You have less than a month.

350
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,190
When your time is up,

351
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,840
you'll disappear like dust.

352
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,350
You'll be gone forever.

353
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,410
I won't disappear.

354
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:42,920
Why would I when I have you here?

355
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,350
Really?

356
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:54,490
Yeon-seo. Listen up.

357
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,650
I will...

358
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:59,110
become human.

359
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:01,970
A human?

360
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,890
I'll make sure I become a real human.

361
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:10,070
I sent my report up there,
and I prayed too.

362
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:12,710
I haven't received a definite answer,

363
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,740
but I will wait and keep going.

364
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,780
Do you trust me, Yeon-seo?

365
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,090
Yes.

366
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:29,430
Oh, dear. Noisy Gong.

367
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,820
That's why you became a crybaby.

368
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,080
You should have told me.

369
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:41,400
Why were you worried all alone?

370
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,110
What are you doing?

371
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,870
I thanked you.

372
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,850
I told you I understood what you said.

373
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:17,960
I told you I wouldn't do anything
to hurt Yeon-seo!

374
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:19,940
Why did you tell her?

375
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,590
She's crying because of you!

376
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,370
To tell her to run away.

377
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,790
To run away with all her might.

378
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,260
But I guess she won't.

379
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,780
Lee Yeon-seo, how foolish of her.

380
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,860
I'm warning you.

381
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:42,950
Do not mention a word about life
and sacrifice to her.

382
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,550
If you do, I really won't stay back.

383
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,700
Do you understand?

384
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:50,650
You'll end up like me.

385
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,630
If the deity is fair,

386
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:55,090
you will also get destroyed like me!

387
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,630
If I was afraid of getting destroyed,

388
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:05,740
I wouldn't have returned.

389
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:22,950
(1. Loses wings and dies.
2. Disappears in the middle.)

390
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,310
(3. Does not become human.)

391
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:28,800
(4. Everything is a tragedy.
I can't believe this.)

392
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,360
(Lee Yeon-seo)

393
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,770
Yes, this is Ji Kang-woo.

394
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,880
I have a question.

395
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:55,680
You aren't an angel at the moment,
are you?

396
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,940
-Why do you ask?
(-The feather)

397
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:02,720
on your handkerchief was burnt in black.
Wasn't it?

398
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:06,500
How did you become human?

399
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:08,840
Can Kim Dan become human too?

400
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:30,480
There is no such way. You need to give up.

401
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,770
Why? You became human.

402
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,620
(Tell me. Please?)

403
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,010
I was unhappy for the last 15 years

404
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,480
after I became human.

405
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,080
(Not even for a moment was I ever happy.)

406
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:48,390
It will be the same for Kim Dan too.

407
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,670
Do you wish

408
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,310
to push him into such tragedy?

409
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,730
(Report: Yeon-seo)

410
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,400
(Yeon-seo found out.)

411
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:37,410
(That I will dissipate
if I fail my mission.)

412
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:41,450
(Are you really refusing
to give me an answer?)

413
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,150
(Report)

414
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:42,690
(Report)

415
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:41,720
(I don't have time.)
(Report)

416
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:53,290
(Report)

417
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:56,770
(Report)

418
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:05,260
Are you saying you won't take
my report at all?

419
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:19,730
(Report)

420
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:25,410
(Please give me an answer.
I wish to become human.)

421
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,990
(Report: Please give me an answer.)

422
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,490
(Report)

423
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,690
It's okay. I can write another one.

424
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,070
I can write 100, no, even 200 reports.

425
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,610
(Please give me an answer.
I wish to become human.)

426
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:48,200
(Report: Please give me an answer.
I wish to become human.)

427
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:55,590
(Please give me an answer.
I wish to become human.)

428
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,900
(Please give me an answer.
I wish to become human.)

429
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:10,510
(Please give me an answer.
I wish to become human.)

430
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:13,810
(Please give me an answer.
I wish to become human.)

431
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,980
(Please give me an answer.
I wish to become human.)

432
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,930
Please give me...

433
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,950
Is that my answer?

434
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:27,450
My answer...

435
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,740
(Lady Yeon-seo)

436
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,360
Yes, Lady Yeon-seo.

437
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:35,940
(Are you up?)

438
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,830
Come out to the living room in 30 minutes.

439
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:38,840
We're going on a picnic.

440
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,090
Right now?

441
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,160
It's a formal date.

442
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:44,430
Make sure you look cute.

443
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,420
A date?

444
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,700
A date? A date?

445
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:56,580
Not this one.

446
00:30:58,290 --> 00:30:59,220
My gosh.

447
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:01,990
Oh, man.

448
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,170
I should take a shower first.

449
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,950
Where should we go, Young Lady?

450
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:12,460
Mountain, fields, or sea?
Wherever you want.

451
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,940
Somewhere extra-special.

452
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,520
What?

453
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,270
Where is that?

454
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,590
Where?

455
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,700
Come here.

456
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,970
This isn't special.
We've been here dozens of times.

457
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:36,130
This is where we first met,

458
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,630
where we met again,

459
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:39,390
and where we cried a river.

460
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,740
It might just be a park for everyone else,

461
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,990
but this is like a symbol of our history.

462
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,300
Let's begin our date now.

463
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,920
All right. Let's see.

464
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,990
Wow, that looks good.

465
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:03,280
Hey, did you make this?

466
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,700
Let's see.

467
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:51,410
Why aren't you showing up for practice?

468
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,730
I know it's hard, but...

469
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,730
(Letter of Resignation)

470
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:56,960
Thank you...

471
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:58,810
for everything.

472
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,210
Ni-na.

473
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:05,050
Don't do this.

474
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,860
It may be uncomfortable, but let's work...

475
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,090
Am I a joke to you?

476
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:11,870
That day when you called me over
to my mom's office,

477
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,590
you already knew everything, didn't you?

478
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,440
Director Ji asked me to come in.

479
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,240
He said he had to tell me something.

480
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:20,450
There's something you must know, Ni-na.

481
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,300
(You were using me as a threat)

482
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,160
to show them that you knew everything.

483
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,360
Back then,

484
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:29,740
I had no choice.

485
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,990
I had to use the card
they valued the most.

486
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,630
Then you had the audacity
to praise my performance.

487
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,400
You even said I was the Giselle
you had always dreamed of.

488
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:42,540
Do I look like an idiot
since you know that I like you?

489
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:46,320
I'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking lightly of you.

490
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,080
I never wanted you

491
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,520
-to find out.
-Don't be ridiculous.

492
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:56,620
You have never been sincere toward me.

493
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:01,460
And yet, I gave my all
to make you acknowledge me.

494
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,750
I regret it.

495
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:08,409
I even wished that you would use me

496
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:11,580
for your obsession over Yeon-seo.

497
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:16,989
But then again,
I was probably useless in your eyes.

498
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,199
You're pretty.

499
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:51,090
You're dazzling.

500
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,660
Kim Dan, I have a favor to ask.

501
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:07,590
What is it? I'll do anything for you.

502
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,100
Can you really do anything for me?

503
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,830
Of course. Just say it.

504
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,520
I looked into

505
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,650
how you could turn into a human.

506
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:26,160
There are three things you must do.

507
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,430
First, jump off a high building.

508
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,540
I've seen it in a movie before.

509
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,090
An angel jumped without his wings
from a steeple

510
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,810
and turned into a human.

511
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:41,210
Do you think a 20-story building will do?

512
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,540
What else is there?

513
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:45,690
There needs to be a death for revival.

514
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:48,730
Just like how you reincarnated
as Kim Dan from Seong-woo.

515
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,970
How about drowning in the sea?

516
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,950
Are you serious?

517
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,340
If not, I think you could try
holding your breath

518
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:58,630
until your heart stops beating.

519
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,180
I've tried jumping into the sea
and the river.

520
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:02,810
I felt like I was drowning,

521
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,220
but in the end, it was useless.

522
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:06,330
Whenever it rained,
my wings came out again.

523
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:07,960
Those things won't work.

524
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,260
I see.

525
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,210
I knew it.

526
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,140
You knew?

527
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,420
No matter how much I research,

528
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,660
I can't seem to figure out
how you can become a human.

529
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,310
But I know how we can be together.

530
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:26,610
How?

531
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:32,460
Hold on. Why are we here all of a sudden?

532
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,050
I gave it some thought.

533
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,600
"Where would be the best place?"

534
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,580
I don't believe in a deity,

535
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,130
but He's like a father to you.

536
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:53,190
Let's get married, Dan.

537
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:57,410
Dan.

538
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,270
-Kim Dan.
-I'll forget what you said.

539
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,250
Why? Why can't we?

540
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:05,070
You said you love me, and I love you too.

541
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,900
I love you. I do.

542
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,850
What kind of shameless person
would get married

543
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,170
when they have limited time?

544
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,490
Why does that matter?

545
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:19,850
Snap out of it!

546
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,480
We don't know what will happen to me!

547
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:23,200
Why even consider that you'll disappear?

548
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:25,130
Just try your best to stay by my side.

549
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,680
You can strive to find a way
to become a human.

550
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:32,830
Let's get married.

551
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,560
-No.
-Let's do it.

552
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:37,360
-I won't.
-I will.

553
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,610
You said the deity brought us together.

554
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,820
Then shouldn't you take responsibility
until the end?

555
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,040
Please?

556
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,480
Dan! Are you okay?

557
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,460
-Hyun-woo!
-Are you okay?

558
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:10,050
Hyun-woo! Come here!

559
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,550
-Mommy...
-Are you okay?

560
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:15,510
We need to leave. I can't be here.

561
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:17,010
I think he's seriously injured.

562
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,330
What should we do?

563
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,610
It's okay. I covered it.

564
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:24,970
I'm fine. I'll be fine.

565
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:30,290
-Oh, no.
-Dan! Dan!

566
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:43,230
Where am I?

567
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:46,310
Are you awake?
You're in the emergency room.

568
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:54,670
Gosh, my head hurts.

569
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,890
Yeon-seo, why does my head hurt?

570
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,180
You couldn't stop bleeding.

571
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,690
I saw it with my own eyes.

572
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:06,020
While they tried to stop the bleeding
and treat you,

573
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:09,190
your wound didn't heal by itself.

574
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,600
Gosh, that hurts.

575
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,330
Goodness, that stings.

576
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:40,430
Last time, your wound healed
in five seconds.

577
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:42,450
Right.

578
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:45,050
Do you think...

579
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:46,680
No way.

580
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,210
This easily? Did you do something?

581
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,700
How are you already a human?

582
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:57,850
(Please give me an answer.
I wish to become a human.)

583
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:01,110
I think He accepted my request.

584
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,100
I think He felt my sincerity.

585
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:05,380
It's still strange.

586
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,630
Is it really this easy for an angel
to become a human?

587
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:13,380
He doesn't ignore desperate prayers.

588
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,720
Perhaps, that's why.

589
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,710
I hope you're right.

590
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:23,420
Right, the rain.
We can check once it rains.

591
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,310
If your wings pop out,
you're still an angel.

592
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,360
But if not...

593
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:31,120
that means you would've become a human,
right?

594
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,320
(Weekly Weather Forecast)

595
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,640
It's sunny again.

596
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,380
-Dan.
-Yes?

597
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,060
Since it's sunny,

598
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:50,120
do you want to get married?

599
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:51,090
What?

600
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,640
Dan, aren't you thankful?

601
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:55,360
Yes, I'm happy.

602
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:56,770
Since you're happy,

603
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:58,790
do you want to get married?

604
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:04,070
Look at the moon. It's so bright.

605
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,890
I guess it'll be sunny tomorrow as well.

606
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,630
I guess this was how the ancestors felt

607
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,260
when they held rituals for rain.

608
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,660
I imagined

609
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,600
how it'd be if it rained.

610
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:22,950
And?

611
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,760
I kind of wish it didn't rain.

612
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:29,280
I just want us...

613
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,830
to be happy just like we are now.

614
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:37,250
But we need to check.

615
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:38,790
We'll finally know.

616
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,130
Don't say anything
that has the word "final" in it.

617
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,430
I'm sorry.

618
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,950
Don't say that you're sorry either.

619
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,150
You know...

620
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:54,100
Even if

621
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:57,620
we find out that you're still not a human,

622
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:01,010
don't you dare apologize to me.

623
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:03,030
Okay?

624
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:13,060
What?

625
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:16,760
I thought it'd be sunny
for the next two days.

626
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:42,760
(Please answer my prayer.)

627
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:45,970
(Please allow me only one thing.)

628
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:48,530
(Allow me to be with Kim Dan.)

629
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,690
Are they out?

630
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:23,860
No.

631
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:26,450
I guess you really became a human!

632
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,360
Thank you. Thank you so much!

633
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:32,350
He answered my prayer for the first time!

634
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,280
Let me take a look.

635
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:39,920
You really are a human, right?

636
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:42,600
You'll stay by my side
until the day you die, right?

637
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:20,000
(Something)

638
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:23,300
(that I couldn't even dream of
happened to me.)

639
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:28,760
(This is the only miracle in my life.)

640
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,260
(-Love.
-Love.)

641
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:50,990
What happened to me?

642
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:52,660
Didn't I become a human?

643
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:55,170
My wings didn't pop out
when I got rained on last night.

644
00:45:56,050 --> 00:45:57,280
Look at the scab.

645
00:45:57,850 --> 00:45:59,170
My body doesn't heal quickly
when I get hurt.

646
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:01,290
It's because I'm a human, right?

647
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,150
You foolish one.

648
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:06,300
I have a human body, don't I?

649
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:08,460
I have bones, flesh, and a heart.

650
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:11,760
But why can't I touch things?

651
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:14,090
Did you check your handkerchief?

652
00:46:14,570 --> 00:46:15,980
When the angel's mission is over

653
00:46:16,070 --> 00:46:17,570
and its identity disappears

654
00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:20,730
whether by becoming human or dissipated,

655
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:23,860
the feather on the handkerchief is
burnt black.

656
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,860
(It means you are still an angel.)

657
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:30,150
(You will never become a human.)

658
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,350
That's His answer to your prayer.

659
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:33,930
There's only one way.

660
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:35,250
However, if you take it,

661
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:37,800
you'll live in the fiery pit
just like Ji Kang-woo.

662
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:43,260
I won't use that method.

663
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:45,500
I don't even know how.

664
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,040
And I don't want to know either.

665
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:48,450
I neither want to be

666
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:51,440
an angel or a human in the world
without Yeon-seo.

667
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:56,280
Why did you take things that far?

668
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:58,750
I didn't go there.

669
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:02,000
My heart

670
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:04,380
took me this far.

671
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:10,410
Then what's happening to my body?

672
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:12,650
Is he mocking me?
Why didn't the wings come out?

673
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,370
Why didn't my injury heal?

674
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:16,660
Depending on the special mission,

675
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,680
there's a deadline on the body too.

676
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:20,350
It's a blinker.

677
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:21,890
It's a warning.

678
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:24,970
A warning that your time
with the body is almost up.

679
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:48,910
You really are a human, right?

680
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:52,080
You'll stay by my side
until the day you die, right?

681
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:30,750
(Angel, Lee Yeon-seo)

682
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:32,110
(Kim Dan, Yoo Seong-woo)

683
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:40,740
(Kim Dan)

684
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:47,910
Did you talk to Hu?

685
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:49,670
Yes.

686
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,530
You said you're doing
a rehearsal today, right?

687
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:55,350
It's not an official one.

688
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,120
We're just checking our spots
and the lights. Stuff like that.

689
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:00,980
I'm sorry.

690
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:05,380
I think I'm going to be late.

691
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:09,160
You must have a lot to discuss with Hu.

692
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,020
It's fine by me. I can go with Ms. Jung.

693
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:15,850
I'm sorry.

694
00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:19,330
Remember?
You're not supposed to say that anymore.

695
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,510
I'm sorry.

696
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,360
I'll just see you tonight.

697
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:30,990
Come home safely.

698
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:50,520
(Flower)

699
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:56,150
May I help you with anything?

700
00:49:58,350 --> 00:49:59,720
Do you have rape flowers?

701
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:01,560
I'm not sure. Their season is almost over.

702
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:05,700
Oh, I have them. I have one bunch left.

703
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:07,460
I'll take that.

704
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:17,620
Are these for your girlfriend?

705
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:20,350
Girlfriend?

706
00:50:25,410 --> 00:50:26,380
Yes.

707
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:28,760
I'm going to give them to someone

708
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:29,990
I love with all my heart.

709
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,500
I guess you really love her.

710
00:50:32,890 --> 00:50:35,050
But why do you want rape flowers
out of all flowers?

711
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:37,600
Guys usually ask for roses.

712
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:41,560
We promised to see them together
next spring,

713
00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:43,940
but I might not...

714
00:50:46,930 --> 00:50:48,380
be able to see them with her.

715
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:15,840
It's been three years

716
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:18,390
since you began working
for Fantasia's Lighting Team, right?

717
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:20,240
Yes.

718
00:52:02,250 --> 00:52:03,270
What are you doing?

719
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,990
Why aren't you answering my calls?

720
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:12,680
How could I?

721
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:13,740
Don't run away.

722
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:16,990
How could I continue to dance
for Fantasia?

723
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,710
You didn't know.

724
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:21,310
No.

725
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:24,910
Perhaps, I might have known.

726
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,170
And I might have wished for it.

727
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:30,150
For me to die?

728
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,680
Just thinking about something isn't
a crime.

729
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:37,320
Although we probably
still can't be friends.

730
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:40,360
My family hurt you.

731
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,470
They killed...

732
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:44,540
Mr. Jo.

733
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:46,470
How can I lift my head up and...

734
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:48,280
It was amazing. Your Giselle.

735
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:54,390
It was different from mine,
but it was excellent.

736
00:52:56,550 --> 00:53:00,470
I wish to be on the same team
with a good ballerina.

737
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:04,070
And do not run away.

738
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,200
Keep seeing me here and feel the pain.

739
00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:10,360
Consider that as your punishment.

740
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,300
The place is quite large,

741
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:31,750
so the lights will come

742
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:33,640
from the left and right corners
of the top.

743
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:35,360
The spotlight will drop from the middle.

744
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,690
Lastly, for the main part,

745
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:40,200
I'll set the top lights
on top of the stage.

746
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,820
Console, are you ready?

747
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:45,120
We'll begin the spacing tech rehearsal
in ten minutes.

748
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:23,580
I thought you couldn't come.
You even brought flowers.

749
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,120
Rape flowers.

750
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,470
It's just a rehearsal.
You didn't need to do this.

751
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:36,520
I wanted to give that to you
when I first saw you.

752
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:38,800
When?

753
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:40,480
During the 20th Anniversary Party.

754
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:43,340
You were there?

755
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:46,680
I saw your dance.

756
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:52,440
You were the most beautiful on that day,

757
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:53,850
so I wanted to give it to you.

758
00:55:05,290 --> 00:55:06,790
So let's get married.

759
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:09,600
That again? I said I can't.

760
00:55:09,870 --> 00:55:11,490
Let's begin the rehearsal.

761
00:55:11,930 --> 00:55:14,620
It'll be a small and simple wedding
just between the two of us.

762
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:19,680
I am going to marry you no matter what.

763
00:55:21,570 --> 00:55:24,250
I'll use this as my bouquet,
so keep it well.

764
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:25,930
Okay? I'm going inside.

765
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:41,990
You're so stubborn.

766
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:43,880
Kim Dan.

767
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:46,170
You fool.

768
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:28,760
I'm sorry.

769
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:32,280
Remember?
You're not supposed to say that anymore.

770
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:36,810
I'm sorry.

771
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,180
I'll just see you tonight.

772
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:43,940
Come home safely.

773
00:56:56,870 --> 00:56:57,880
I'm not going to cry.

774
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:03,470
Let's see who wins.

775
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:07,650
I'm going to do everything I want to do
with Kim Dan.

776
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:03,580
Where is the wind coming from?

777
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:40,620
Don't say a word.

778
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:47,440
Death.

779
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:51,670
I didn't hear anything.

780
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:52,680
You...

781
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:56,020
know everything. Stop pretending.

782
00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:05,570
I don't want to be human.
I won't become one.

783
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:07,550
I give up. I surrender.

784
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:09,840
I'll just dissipate. I'll disappear.

785
00:59:11,070 --> 00:59:13,230
I'm determined to do that. Okay?

786
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:14,850
You weren't the only one...

787
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:19,120
who received a final chance that day.

788
00:59:28,630 --> 00:59:30,910
She should have died on that day too.

789
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:34,700
That was her fate.

790
00:59:36,680 --> 00:59:38,000
How can that be?

791
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:39,760
It was fate...

792
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:43,670
that we met again.

793
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:46,050
Her fate was to be killed by the wicked.

794
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,290
Some people are born that way.

795
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:52,690
No. No way.

796
00:59:52,910 --> 00:59:54,500
It was just postponed, that's all.

797
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:57,270
No matter how much you try
to escape from it,

798
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:00,350
a prophecy will come to pass.

799
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:02,280
And one's destiny...

800
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:05,500
will be fulfilled.

801
01:01:10,130 --> 01:01:11,230
Let's do it.

802
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:18,980
Marry...

803
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:22,670
me.

804
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:24,520
Yeon-seo.

805
01:02:30,390 --> 01:02:33,730
(Angel's Last Mission: Love)

806
01:02:35,090 --> 01:02:36,330
I wish to marry Yeon-seo.

807
01:02:36,410 --> 01:02:38,390
I'm nowhere good enough,
but if you allow me...

808
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:41,080
In your dreams. Never!

809
01:02:41,170 --> 01:02:42,750
Yeon-seo, a marriage is...

810
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:45,480
-Do you want to officiate our wedding?
-Me?

811
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:49,260
No, I'm going to change this.

812
01:02:49,790 --> 01:02:50,670
I will...

813
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,840
save Kim Dan.
