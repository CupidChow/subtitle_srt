1
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,270
-I mean...
-Hey...

2
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,520
-I...
-Did I...

3
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,800
What are you doing...

4
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:15,970
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,480
I'm sorry, Yeon-seo.

6
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:32,950
Darn it!

7
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,490
Come here.

8
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,880
-This way.
-It's raining!

9
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,300
-Go to the side!
-It's raining!

10
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:48,229
Why are you doing this to me?

11
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,120
Thank you.

12
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,229
I almost got caught.

13
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,210
My wings!

14
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,610
Goodness, my brother.

15
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,290
Please come to your senses.

16
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,750
That jerk.

17
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,390
That pervert. That fanatic.

18
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,240
I'm sorry I'm late.

19
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,120
Where's Mr. Kim?

20
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,810
Let's go.

21
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,800
I'm fine.

22
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,680
Summer rain can give you a cold too.

23
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:28,410
And you get a fever when you catch a cold.

24
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:29,860
Do I?

25
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,240
You're wrong.

26
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,190
You get a fever when you catch a cold.

27
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,240
Come here.

28
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,730
It's too suffocating! I don't like it.

29
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,270
Stay still.

30
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,740
You can't do this.

31
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,470
From now on, you must never

32
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,230
get sick or injured.

33
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,870
You shouldn't be alone either.

34
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,180
A Pilates instructor will come over
in the morning.

35
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,250
Check your condition.

36
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,280
Do cardio exercise and weight training
in the morning and stretch after that.

37
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,720
You'll start getting back in shape.

38
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,450
Take a breath.

39
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:12,890
Why are you in a hurry?

40
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,790
You need to prepare yourself for war.

41
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:15,970
From tomorrow...

42
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,480
No, from now on, it's war.

43
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:19,620
I can take care of myself.

44
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:21,000
Then why did you get drenched?

45
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,200
You're the one who dropped the bomb.

46
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,590
You announced your own comeback.

47
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,360
(A dancer speaks with his or her body.)

48
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:31,770
I regained my sight,

49
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,590
and nothing is wrong
with my body and mind.

50
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,990
I will speak to you more in detail

51
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,850
with my dance on my return performance.

52
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,200
Are you sure
you're physically and mentally healthy?

53
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,200
Just look at me.

54
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,100
Imagine that it's just

55
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,090
(you and me in this world.)

56
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,450
Yes, I am.

57
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,120
I'm completely fine.

58
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,120
People are more excited to hear about
others' failure more than their success.

59
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,040
Those who applauded your comeback

60
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,310
will be the first ones

61
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,210
to criticize you if you fail.

62
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,980
You're on the edge of a cliff.

63
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,660
Whether it be a cliff or the fiery pits,

64
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,480
it's me who's there, not you.

65
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,800
I'm the one in charge
of your comeback performance.

66
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,050
If you fail, it will humiliate me too.

67
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:30,520
Two weeks.

68
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:32,940
I'll give you two weeks.

69
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,340
Get your body back in shape

70
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,880
and get my approval first.

71
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,470
If you fail,

72
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,880
Geum Ni-na will be
the prima ballerina of Fantasia.

73
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,470
One week.

74
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,340
That's all I need.

75
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:50,840
Ni-na. Where are you? Ni-na.

76
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:55,409
Ni-na.

77
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,660
Why are you out here?

78
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,020
Ru-na.

79
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,720
Director Ji.

80
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,100
I have something to tell you.

81
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,950
Next time. I have an appointment.

82
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,800
Are you meeting Yeon-seo?

83
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,770
That's none of your business.

84
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,360
Don't go.

85
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:24,620
Geum Ni-na.

86
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,610
You told me to be selfish.

87
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,300
I'm going to

88
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,590
like you.

89
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,300
No.

90
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,659
I already do.

91
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,050
I'll pretend that I didn't hear that.

92
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,270
It was since that night.

93
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,220
That night when you touched my ankle.

94
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,950
It feels like a big rock fell on my heart.

95
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,240
Why today?

96
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,800
Your biggest rival announced

97
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:03,270
her comeback after a three-year gap.

98
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,620
But instead,

99
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,490
you decided to listen
to your useless emotions

100
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,150
and confessed to me.

101
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,270
I'm disappointed in you.

102
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:12,890
"Useless"?

103
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:14,740
Let's not waste any time.

104
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:18,050
I'm not Prince Charming you think I am.

105
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,620
Then you can tell me.

106
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,390
That's what I'm most curious about.

107
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:25,210
What kind of person are you?

108
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,020
I'm an evil person.

109
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,410
I'm beyond what you can imagine or handle.

110
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,520
I'm very evil.

111
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,520
I shouldn't have told him. I was too rash.

112
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:41,840
Once Yeon-seo returns,

113
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,880
I'll be nothing short of a shadow again.

114
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:48,490
I thought he would care less about me
once that happens.

115
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,120
I agree with him.

116
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,700
You already act like a shadow,
so who will take notice of you?

117
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,409
Why are you scaring me?

118
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,620
Where's your pride? Are you not angry?

119
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,920
You were looked down on as a ballerina
and also as a woman.

120
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,820
That makes me so upset.

121
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,210
But you're just being childish and crying.

122
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,700
Stop being a baby.

123
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,950
No one's going to fix this for you.

124
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,000
I said, go. Please go.

125
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,070
There's no emergency.
The rain has stopped.

126
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,790
It's getting late, so go.

127
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,980
Don't get kicked out again.

128
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,230
I feel like I did something wrong.

129
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,550
Is it possible for an angel
to feel guilty?

130
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,450
Can an angel commit a sin?

131
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,340
Answer me. Who are you?

132
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,300
I'm Kim Dan.

133
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,670
Don't tell me your human name.

134
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,860
Tell me your real name.

135
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,440
What are you?

136
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,130
I'm Dan, an angel.

137
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,510
That's right. Then you must know

138
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,340
what'll happen to an angel if he gives up
on his mission and commit a sin.

139
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:23,050
I didn't commit a sin.
It just feels like I did.

140
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,230
It feels like it?

141
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,090
You don't want to go up there, do you?

142
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,300
Would you like to turn into dust
right here?

143
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,590
Are you threatening me?

144
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,480
You're a thug!

145
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:40,650
Come on!

146
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,170
I still have time left!

147
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,160
An angel should only be obedient.

148
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,490
If you have other intentions,
you'll only be doomed.

149
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:00,180
Just like how you can differentiate
what's holy from what's worldly,

150
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,730
and a good man from an evil one,

151
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,180
remember who is before you.

152
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,140
You've led cats and dogs into paradise.

153
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,650
It's the same with that woman, got it?

154
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,290
(Kim Dan)

155
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,990
(Kim Dan)

156
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:40,330
Excuse me. I'd like a bottle of soju.

157
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,590
Thank you.

158
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,100
What brings you here?

159
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,520
What about you?

160
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,360
Why are you here at this hour?

161
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,530
Someone told me

162
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,120
that it is the best remedy
when my heart is on fire.

163
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,290
Okay, then.

164
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,790
Your heart is on fire?

165
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,450
Just quit if this is
how you'll do your job.

166
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,700
-Pardon?
-I'll get you a new job.

167
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,280
I can get you a better paying job.

168
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:39,450
A job that can accommodate your needs.

169
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,090
What if I say I don't want to?

170
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,770
"I don't want to"? Not, "I can't"?

171
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,700
-Why not?
-Even if I get fired,

172
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,470
I'll make Yeon-seo fire me.

173
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:50,370
This isn't your business to meddle with.

174
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,220
You said you were going to help me.

175
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,830
Have you forgotten what you need to do?
Or...

176
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,660
Or did you have a change of heart?

177
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,020
I keep my promises.

178
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,090
I'm going to fix you up

179
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,820
with Yeon-seo myself.

180
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,260
"Young Lady".

181
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,320
You keep calling her by her name.

182
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:13,820
That's been bothering me a lot.

183
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,250
Seeing how you drop your honorifics
to your boss,

184
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,790
I doubt that you're good at your job.

185
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,250
Why are you getting angry at me?

186
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,120
I've already seen her alone

187
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,500
in the rain twice.

188
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,110
You were worried because Yeon-seo

189
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,050
was alone.

190
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,200
Is that why you got angry?

191
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,190
Listen.

192
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,910
I'm asking why you're not doing
your job...

193
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,340
What are you doing?

194
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,550
You're running a fever.

195
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:48,410
And your pupils are shaky too.

196
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:51,920
And you're nervous.

197
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,450
I was right. You're definitely angry.

198
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:01,070
I'm all for worrying about Young Lady.

199
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:02,270
I'm all for it,

200
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:05,570
but I'll take care of my job myself.

201
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,250
What was that?

202
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,520
She's a puppy or a kitty.

203
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:24,180
She's a pine tree or grass.

204
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,110
Yeon-seo is just a client.

205
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,270
After I make Yeon-seo fall in love,

206
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,550
I will go back up there no matter what.

207
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:52,990
I wasn't angry.

208
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,620
No. Actually, I was.

209
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:00,950
I'm so livid.

210
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:04,750
(You were worried because Yeon-seo)

211
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,420
(was alone.)

212
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,640
(Is that why you got angry?)

213
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,900
It's because of ballet.

214
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:12,710
I barely

215
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,120
managed to get you this far.

216
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:17,200
I just need to put you on the stage.

217
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,620
Then, I can keep my promise to you.

218
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:24,230
But how could you kiss a mere secretary?

219
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,770
Why are all the curtains closed?

220
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,510
It's so dark in here.

221
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,530
Young Lady.

222
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,620
What are you doing here?

223
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,380
Did you stay up all night?

224
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,370
Absence without notice
and leaving a workplace

225
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:06,040
can be the reason for dismissal, right?

226
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,000
Dan?

227
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,460
Did something happen last night?

228
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,810
(I know what your wishes are.)

229
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,500
I will grant your wish.

230
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,430
Because I listened to you...

231
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,550
What did I do?

232
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,410
I see. You're talking about Dan?

233
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,790
-He has a crush on you.
-No, he doesn't.

234
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,980
He doesn't.

235
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,230
Did you ask that to his face?

236
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,980
Of course, he'd deny that.

237
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,910
No, I didn't do that.

238
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,770
Please refrain from spreading and making

239
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,620
groundless rumors starting now.

240
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:45,590
There's no way my instincts are wrong.

241
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,660
Besides, fire this jerk.

242
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,080
For good this time.

243
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,660
Good morning.

244
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,240
Did you sleep well?

245
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,340
Ms. Jung.

246
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,550
Tell him that staying out overnight can be
a reason for his dismissal.

247
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,700
Something urgent came up.

248
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:07,500
Please tell her that I'm sorry.

249
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,410
I'm sorry, Young Lady.

250
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:14,619
What's wrong with you?
Why are you so polite?

251
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,819
I had been overstepping my boundaries.

252
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,859
I will focus on my work from now on.

253
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:23,550
I'm glad to hear that.

254
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,710
I'm going to practice.

255
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,910
I have something to tell you.

256
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,870
Go ahead.

257
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:56,870
Last night...

258
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,460
I was...

259
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,020
I'm sorry about last night.

260
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:14,870
Please forget what happened.

261
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,500
What do you mean?

262
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,570
Nothing happened last night between us.

263
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,500
You and I...

264
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,750
Right. Nothing happened.

265
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,550
Nothing at all.

266
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,880
Something happened between us.

267
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,380
No, nothing happened.

268
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,650
No, it did.

269
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:36,550
What's your point, you jerk?

270
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,090
You told me to forget about it.

271
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,470
I'm trying to pretend and move on.

272
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,480
You're so clueless.

273
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,530
Can't you play along?

274
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,380
I can't lie that nothing happened
when it did.

275
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,150
-To pretend that...
-Stop.

276
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:49,350
That's exactly my point.

277
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:50,900
I was going to tell you that first.

278
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,150
I don't have time for anything else

279
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:54,810
than to practice and get back in shape.

280
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,840
Fine.

281
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,550
Pretend nothing happened last night.

282
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,800
And act as if we met

283
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,380
for the first time today.

284
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,090
Okay?

285
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,290
I'm glad

286
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,830
that we are

287
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,740
on the same page.

288
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,120
Good then.

289
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,660
Tell me if you need anything.

290
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,800
Young Lady,

291
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,820
you can do it!

292
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,190
"You can do it"?

293
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:35,770
"I'm glad that we are on the same page."

294
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,950
I guess he's a player to whom

295
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,280
a kiss means nothing.

296
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:44,010
Because this happens to him all the time?

297
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,810
Whatever.

298
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,270
I don't need him either.

299
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,590
(Things Yeon-seo Hates)

300
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,870
(105 Things Yeon-seo Likes)

301
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,860
Let's focus on my mission.
Think about my job.

302
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,360
There's a mission I must complete.

303
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,660
I cannot delay your love and my return
any longer now!

304
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,980
(I know who you really are.)

305
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,400
You were such a bright child.

306
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,550
(If you got the eyes of someone like him,)

307
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,170
don't let them go to waste.

308
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:04,450
One, two.

309
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:06,640
Three.

310
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:08,710
Four.

311
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,880
Two.

312
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,680
Two.

313
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,710
Three, four.

314
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,240
Young Lady, are you okay? Are you hurt?

315
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,700
Did you sprain your ankles?

316
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:48,880
Take your hands off.

317
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,190
-Pardon?
-Take your hands off,

318
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,480
you pervert, idiot, psycho, and con man!

319
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,300
If you lay a finger on my body again,

320
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,350
I will fire you immediately.

321
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,940
Understand?

322
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,710
Yes, I understand.

323
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,490
I will be careful.

324
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:11,890
Get out.

325
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,530
Don't jump in before I call you.

326
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,080
Yes, Ni-na.

327
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,530
You mean Young Lady?

328
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,300
Yes, I am with her, but...

329
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:52,300
What is this?
Why did you call my secretary?

330
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:55,550
Is that you, Yeon-seo? Hi, Yeon-seo.

331
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:57,970
I called Dan
because I don't know your number.

332
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,730
(Can you come out for a second?)

333
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:02,580
I don't want to.

334
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:04,000
I want to see you,

335
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,070
but I guess you don't want to see me.

336
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,210
I don't. And I plan on not wanting
to see you.

337
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,120
So don't call my secretary.

338
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,490
You can't just hang up...

339
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,960
like that.

340
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,500
How do you know her?

341
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:18,730
Are you two close?

342
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,750
I ran into her a few times by coincidence.

343
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,610
(You've been going around
and hitting on women.)

344
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:27,320
At this rate, you might want to make
what didn't happen happen.

345
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,910
Gu-reum, let's go for a walk.

346
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,200
Hey, Yeon-seo.

347
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:46,150
You came out.

348
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,160
Why are you looking so pathetic here?

349
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:51,300
Take this.

350
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,100
Congratulations on your rehab,
and I support you.

351
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,410
Dan, please.

352
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:58,550
Oh, yes.

353
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,920
This is a challenge for a competition.

354
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,640
I improved a lot
for the last three years too.

355
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,090
I want to officially compete against you.

356
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:13,960
Why are you all so determined?

357
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,450
Calling this a war and competition.

358
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,200
I hope you can return to
how you used to be.

359
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,250
So that I'll be fairly acknowledged.

360
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,590
Be prepared, Yeon-seo.

361
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,180
I'm going to try really hard too.

362
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,960
I'm done.

363
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,550
What a nice person.

364
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,160
What about me?

365
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,150
Should I put this in your room?

366
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:47,970
Throw it away.

367
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:49,160
After the press conference,

368
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:53,240
a total of 14 articles became top news
for daily papers and offline newspapers.

369
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:56,100
Over 200 related articles
were published online in a day.

370
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,660
Because of the SNS incident,

371
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,030
negative comments

372
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,830
turned into support and encouragement.

373
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,210
Over 80 percent of them
were positive comments.

374
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:13,090
We should keep this going
while it's going well.

375
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,630
Ishikawa Seiji of Japan

376
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,570
called us in secret.

377
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,680
The man who's worth over trillions of won?

378
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:21,930
The biggest sponsor of Bolshoi Ballet.

379
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:26,200
He's a second generation Korean Japanese,
so he became interested in Korean ballet.

380
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,610
This is an opportunity

381
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:32,350
for Fantasia to become world-renowned.

382
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,260
So...

383
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:36,150
when will you be done?

384
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,380
-Pardon?
-My dear

385
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,810
General Director Choi and Chairman Geum.

386
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:44,200
When will you two quit?

387
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,300
What do you mean?

388
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,940
The rumor got around.

389
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,830
She asked to take Fantasia back.

390
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:52,120
I'm not sure if we should be discussing

391
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,100
this important matter with someone
who'll quit soon.

392
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,300
Think about it.

393
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,150
The year's project completely changes

394
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:00,170
when just the artistic director changes.

395
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,190
There are a lot of steps
we must take before...

396
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,150
I can...

397
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:08,300
give up on everything
and leave tomorrow if I must.

398
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,600
But I can't.

399
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:13,140
No, I won't.

400
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:15,260
I'm sure you all are aware

401
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,770
of love and passion I put into Fantasia

402
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,180
for the last three years.

403
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:22,910
I did all that

404
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:25,380
because of my love for Yeon-seo.

405
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,640
I wanted to give back
a solid ballet theatre

406
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,710
when my niece returns as a healthy woman.

407
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,420
But Yeon-seo is not healthy

408
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,920
in body and in mind.

409
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,780
I heard dancers can know

410
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,850
their own condition the best.

411
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,840
Do you think she announced her return

412
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,950
without thinking about such things?

413
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:48,600
Do you have to see it to believe it?

414
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:57,190
I'm thinking of moving up
Fantasia's Night.

415
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,380
You can check her during the event.

416
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,310
Of course, the one who wants her

417
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,210
to be completely healed is...

418
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:09,720
me.

419
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:11,270
(Fantasia's Night?)

420
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,640
It's our year-end event of sponsorship.

421
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:17,340
We break up in teams, put on performances,
hold a party, and greet people too.

422
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:19,050
-You know, don't you?
-I do.

423
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,250
But you usually do it
at the end of the year,

424
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,020
after you're done with big performances.

425
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,770
Because you and Yeon-seo

426
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:27,070
wreaked havoc on the ballet theatre,

427
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,180
all of our schedules got messed up.

428
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:32,700
So you two need to get dressed up
and come.

429
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,900
-Yeon-seo too?
-She's the owner here.

430
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,660
Of course, she should welcome her guests.

431
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:40,520
We're expecting a very special guest
from Japan.

432
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:43,480
Ishikawa Seiji. You know him, don't you?

433
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:45,150
Of course, I do.

434
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:46,950
A big sponsor of the ballet world,

435
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,980
and an old man with dirty hands.

436
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,090
All art requires money.

437
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,620
And to correct what you said,

438
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,310
Mr. Seiji is known for giving out

439
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,940
countless amount of his dirty money

440
00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:00,940
when he likes what he sees.

441
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,750
Making the ballerinas stand

442
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:05,340
next to the sponsors
as if they're flowers?

443
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,010
I won't allow that.

444
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:10,710
I am not going to make
my ballerinas do that.

445
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,750
He calls them "my ballerinas"
only at a time like this.

446
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,390
He cares about no one other than Yeon-seo.

447
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,020
She's the lead role.

448
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:24,570
She is our lead role for sure.

449
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,340
Turn out.

450
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:41,520
Straighten your knee.

451
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,850
Up to here.

452
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:49,380
More. More!

453
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,420
Put your chest in.

454
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,850
What's the repertoire
for Fantasia's Night?

455
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,370
Are we getting ready for that already?

456
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:15,350
The event has been moved up.

457
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,070
We don't need to do anything special.

458
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,770
Let's just put on
what we always have done.

459
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,160
Is something wrong?

460
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:42,720
I think we were in great harmony just now.

461
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,080
Right?

462
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,020
Ni-na.

463
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,170
Yes, Director Ji.

464
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:54,060
Can you lead the rest of the practice?

465
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,890
Rib.

466
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,300
It's her first practice today.
Why are you so quiet?

467
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,590
He was so angry last time
as if he would devour me.

468
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:36,920
(Rib)

469
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,230
He'll manage it. Won't he?

470
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,030
Gosh, that shocked me.

471
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:54,030
You want me to stand here like this?

472
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,730
Don't say anything,

473
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:00,330
and just stand there.

474
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,760
One second!

475
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,800
Hey!

476
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,250
Goodness, Ms. Jung.

477
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,430
You have a guest.

478
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:46,620
The temperature and humidity are great.

479
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:47,950
The mirror is clean too.

480
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,840
And it's bright.

481
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,490
-Are you here to watch me?
-I came because I wanted to see you.

482
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:56,660
I was worried about the place

483
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:59,160
and the environment that you practice in.

484
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:02,870
You really don't need a trainer
or a masseuse?

485
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,330
I am still worried that you are doing this

486
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,740
all alone.

487
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,110
I'm not alone.

488
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,159
I have him.

489
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,850
And Ms. Jung.

490
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,780
Even if I was alone,

491
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:14,840
I can manage it.

492
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,659
Fantasia's Night

493
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,340
is scheduled in two weeks.

494
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:23,500
Let us decide how you'll participate

495
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:25,389
depending on your condition in a week.

496
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,980
We'll see if you'll be there
as a ballerina

497
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,409
or as the chairwoman of the foundation.

498
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:34,100
That's a long way of saying
I should get ready.

499
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:35,989
I took too much of your time.

500
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:36,969
Goodbye.

501
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,090
Oh, Mr. Kim.

502
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,550
I need to see you.

503
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,440
-Me?
-Just for a second.

504
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,760
I have a question.

505
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:00,330
What is it? I have to go back soon.

506
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:04,720
-What are you doing?
-Who are you?

507
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,670
Let me ask you again. What are you after?

508
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,850
Did you approach me first
to see how Yeon-seo feels?

509
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:13,210
Did you make me let my guard down
by saying you'll help out.

510
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,230
only to betray me later?

511
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:34,700
Are you after her money?

512
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:35,970
Are you a gigolo?

513
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,810
Did you get a job here as a secretary

514
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:39,700
and get her to like you to take her money?

515
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,720
What are you talking about?

516
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,480
Taking whose money? That's nonsense.

517
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:49,340
I was never interested in the wealth
of this land.

518
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,940
I don't want those things
that will rot away.

519
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,620
Then what? Do you really like her?

520
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:57,920
Wait, what?

521
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:58,980
Hey.

522
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:02,190
You and Yeon-seo belong
in two different worlds.

523
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,240
I know that more than anyone.

524
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,740
If you do, give up quickly.

525
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,460
Don't get your hopes up like a fool.

526
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,130
If you disturb her comeback

527
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,860
because of your petty emotions,

528
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,290
I will not forgive you. Do you understand?

529
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,140
Who likes whom?

530
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,950
What?

531
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:32,410
Hu, where are you?

532
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,950
Hu!

533
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,620
Hu, it's an emergency.

534
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,730
Hu!

535
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,030
I have a question.

536
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:51,080
Perfect. A man in this robe
is an expert at listening.

537
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,170
Go ahead.

538
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:54,240
Here?

539
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:56,480
Have you ever kissed a human?

540
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:01,680
What did he say?

541
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:03,920
What are you saying?

542
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,810
What? What now?

543
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,010
Tell me. What is it?

544
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,030
Why do you suddenly pop up like this?

545
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:16,380
Well, you can take on
a human body whenever you want, right?

546
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:19,230
Your wings don't suddenly pop up
as if they are broken. Right?

547
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,570
Yes, so what?

548
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:22,660
I think...

549
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,770
it's because of this body.

550
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,320
Hey, forget about your body.

551
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,820
Do you want to disappear into the universe
as dust?

552
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:30,980
My mission isn't over yet.

553
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,310
And about that mission...

554
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:39,260
I have to help her find her love, right?

555
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,450
But does that have to be

556
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,270
love between a human and another human?

557
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:46,950
It has to be, right?

558
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,030
I somehow ended up kissing her,

559
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,020
my heart suddenly begins to beat

560
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:58,090
(as if it's broken.)

561
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:01,070
(Then I suddenly feel suffocated.)

562
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:02,710
Rib asked me

563
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,380
if I have feelings

564
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,460
for Yeon-seo.

565
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,600
Gosh.

566
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:10,400
What am I going to do with you?

567
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:17,000
Let's see.

568
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:19,070
It was about 15 years ago.

569
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,500
There was this angel
who was in charge of art.

570
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:30,070
(He took on the human form)

571
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,350
(and was given a mission)

572
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:34,030
(to inspire artists.)

573
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,950
No, not this one.

574
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:40,670
I don't like it!

575
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:46,220
What the hell went wrong this time?

576
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:49,120
This is the 43rd time, for goodness' sake.

577
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,920
Where are you going?

578
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,810
Give me another canvas!

579
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,620
I failed!

580
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:58,150
(He met this person as he began
to grow tired of)

581
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,520
(picky artists.)

582
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,450
(I heard there's a chance
you can get confused,)

583
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,290
(especially the angels of art.)

584
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:09,240
(He got inspiration)

585
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,910
(confused with love.)

586
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:15,010
(An angel fell in love
with another being other than the deity?)

587
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,590
(Is that possible?)

588
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:27,070
So you can become a human with this?

589
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,140
No angel knows how, but...

590
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:32,480
I have to make this confession.

591
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,740
From this moment on...

592
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:53,410
No.

593
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:55,580
From the very beginning,

594
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:58,840
my love belonged to her.

595
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,070
I believe that You're the one

596
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,580
who helped us to meet

597
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:06,220
and made us fall in love.

598
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:09,040
So please bless us.

599
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:15,200
(Believing that you can love something
other than the deity)

600
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,800
(is an act of arrogance and sin.)

601
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,500
What happened to that angel then?

602
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:31,840
What do you think happened to an angel
who abandoned the deity?

603
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:42,030
Dan, an angel, will be judged.

604
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:44,230
You dared...

605
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,170
I want to live.

606
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:49,160
(You dared to meddle in the life
that the deity had control over.)

607
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:52,470
I like you so much

608
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,410
that it's driving me insane.

609
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:58,150
(You neglected and forgot
your mission, given to you by the deity.)

610
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:00,210
(By not carrying it out, you have sinned.)

611
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:02,500
Just look at me.

612
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:05,790
Imagine that it's just you and me
in this world.

613
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,380
(Above all,)

614
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:09,400
(you've deluded yourself into thinking)

615
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:12,790
(that you loved an insignificant being
more than the deity.)

616
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:16,890
You will be dissipated.

617
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,590
-Dan.
-Ma'am, what is it?

618
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:07,580
It's been hours.

619
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:09,900
She's refusing to eat
and not letting anyone in.

620
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:10,400
That's enough.

621
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:12,550
Don't push yourself too hard.

622
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:23,300
I said that's enough.

623
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,320
Did you forget?

624
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,380
I told you not to touch me.

625
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,740
You're bleeding.

626
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:43,310
So what?

627
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,700
My toenails have fallen off many times.

628
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:52,020
I've thrown away countless pairs
of bloody pointe shoes.

629
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,480
This is nothing.

630
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,790
Finally,

631
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:04,040
they look like a ballerina's feet.

632
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:15,040
I didn't know you had to push yourself

633
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:17,680
this much.

634
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,890
You're going through so much pain.

635
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:26,790
Let's call it a day, okay?

636
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:31,270
Don't be ridiculous.

637
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:32,950
I made a promise to Director Ji.

638
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,120
I have to get back in shape within a week.

639
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,230
Listen to me. You can't continue
practicing with this foot.

640
00:45:42,450 --> 00:45:43,910
What if you get injured again?

641
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:47,280
Are you going to return to being someone
who's in solitude and grumpy?

642
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:49,980
None of this matters if you're unhappy.

643
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,350
I hate you.

644
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,270
Don't be worried about me.
Don't care for me.

645
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:01,540
I hate...

646
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:04,620
receiving love.

647
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:07,360
It makes me want to become weak.

648
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:12,290
It makes me think it is okay to be weak.

649
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:17,340
I thought you liked me.

650
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:20,910
I really did.

651
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:23,950
You said you existed because of me.

652
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:26,750
You were the one who sweet-talked me.

653
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:30,140
If you're neither a liar nor a spy,
then it's only one thing.

654
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,760
Do you like me?

655
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:37,490
(Believing that you can love something
other than the deity)

656
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:39,780
(is an act of arrogance and sin.)

657
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:41,770
You said you couldn't lie.

658
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:44,130
Just say yes or no.

659
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:47,440
Did you like me?

660
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:53,200
Do you?

661
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,080
No.

662
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:16,160
All right, then.

663
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:21,360
Get lost.

664
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:56,380
(I had almost made a mistake,)

665
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:59,060
(but I am currently focusing
on my mission.)

666
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:00,660
(This is Dan, an angel.)

667
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:06,590
(My subject has begun dancing once again.)

668
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:11,560
(She is very sensitive
and rough-tempered.)

669
00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:12,020
(I'm struggling alone without receiving)

670
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:13,870
(any signs or prophecies.)

671
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,230
(At first, her temper was the problem.)

672
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,840
(But now, she's too busy)

673
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:39,600
(to love anyone.)

674
00:49:41,490 --> 00:49:42,910
(Could there be a way)

675
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:47,340
(for her to succeed
in both ballet and love?)

676
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:07,630
(Mongyu Island, 2005)

677
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:09,910
(The day I started ballet once again)

678
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:12,040
(My first stage and my first audience)

679
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:20,430
You're unbelievable!

680
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:22,890
Young Lady!

681
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:25,980
Wake up.

682
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:27,880
It's morning!

683
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:32,620
What date is today? What day is it?

684
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:33,630
It's D-Day.

685
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:36,090
It's been exactly a week
since your announcement.

686
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:40,670
You shouldn't have stayed up all night
to practice.

687
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:42,700
You really don't know
how to take care of yourself.

688
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:50,700
Your aunt called so many times
this morning.

689
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:53,740
Look at this.

690
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:55,590
She calls me every five minutes.

691
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:01,350
It's me.

692
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,620
Now?

693
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:14,900
You didn't come with him today.

694
00:51:15,790 --> 00:51:17,200
Please wait outside for me.

695
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:25,520
You never answer my questions.

696
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:27,480
How do you feel? Are you all right?

697
00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:30,520
Give me the withdrawal agreement on
the power of attorney. I brought my seal.

698
00:51:30,610 --> 00:51:32,590
My gosh, that's not ready yet.

699
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:35,370
You said I had to sign it today.
That's why you told me to come out.

700
00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:36,650
Is that what you told her?

701
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:40,470
My attorney is very meticulous.

702
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:43,020
So my attorney needs to
check it a few more times.

703
00:51:43,330 --> 00:51:44,300
I'm sorry.

704
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:46,190
-I'll get going then.
-Wait.

705
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:49,270
Have some tea before you go.
I'm your aunt.

706
00:51:49,350 --> 00:51:51,550
We're not that close, you know.

707
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:54,590
You must've been very disappointed in me.

708
00:51:55,830 --> 00:51:57,270
To make up for that...

709
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:09,340
-What's this?
-It's Fantasia's Night next week.

710
00:52:09,550 --> 00:52:10,880
Wear them to the event.

711
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,610
You know that I never serve my guests
at events.

712
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:16,410
A very important Japanese investor
will be coming.

713
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,610
When I told him your name,
he said he'd come.

714
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:21,790
We can't hold the show
for your return without his money.

715
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:24,070
Sometimes,
you must do things you don't want to do.

716
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,570
That's the world of adults.

717
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:28,200
We decided to announce

718
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:32,600
that Fantasia will belong to you,
Yeon-seo.

719
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:40,480
See how nice it is to start dancing again.

720
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:44,350
You can walk with me like this
even without Dan.

721
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,300
He has no place to go.

722
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,760
Where did he go on his vacation?

723
00:52:50,950 --> 00:52:52,050
Well...

724
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:54,090
What did he say?

725
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:56,230
No. Don't tell me.

726
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:59,010
Bosses who ask about
vacation spots are the worst.

727
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:03,270
On the day of Fantasia's Night,

728
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:06,490
I'll make him escort you no matter what.

729
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,570
Let's hurry. I need to practice.

730
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:28,930
I couldn't make him wait
at an empty house.

731
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:41,020
This has been the longest week this year.

732
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:42,840
Are you ready?

733
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,130
No, not at all. I'm totally doomed.

734
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:48,110
It's a mess.

735
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:50,620
Yeon-seo.

736
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:53,780
What?

737
00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:57,130
Make yourself comfortable.
This will take long.

738
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:02,020
-Where are we going?
-Well...

739
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:03,600
To the beginning.

740
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:46,470
This place...

741
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:47,560
Do you remember?

742
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:49,850
This feels familiar.

743
00:55:52,370 --> 00:55:53,280
What is this?

744
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:54,380
What are you plotting?

745
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,020
Why did we come all the way here?

746
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:57,200
Year 2005.

747
00:55:57,340 --> 00:55:59,190
Right before you went to Russia
for your studies.

748
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:02,400
You went to an island
for a program called Visiting Ballet.

749
00:56:02,830 --> 00:56:03,980
How do you know that?

750
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,510
Did you look into my past?

751
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:09,790
Dan told you, right?

752
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:11,890
She never misses a thing.

753
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:13,390
I bet...

754
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:15,510
Dan did everything here, right?

755
00:56:15,950 --> 00:56:17,000
Hey, Dan.

756
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:18,860
Where are you? Come on out.

757
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:21,140
Darn it. What's wrong with her?

758
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,340
You think I wouldn't know where my prima
ballerina was born and how she grew up?

759
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:33,810
I heard that you hid and cried
because you didn't want to do ballet.

760
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,060
I didn't know that. How did he know that?

761
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:41,550
I knew a kid.

762
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:43,940
I've totally forgotten about the kid.

763
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:45,550
That kid was

764
00:56:46,130 --> 00:56:47,370
my first audience.

765
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:50,480
I danced for him.

766
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:52,300
Just for him.

767
00:56:53,090 --> 00:56:54,090
Today,

768
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:55,850
I'll watch you dance.

769
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:58,410
The dance you did for your first audience.

770
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:01,450
I don't remember.
I didn't have a routine since I was a kid.

771
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:08,930
I can't make the turns.

772
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:13,980
I can pull off other techniques

773
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:16,540
once I get my muscles in shape
and practice more.

774
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:20,450
But I can't make the turns.

775
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:23,890
That's expected.

776
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,660
You didn't dance for three years.
It's only been a week.

777
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:29,640
Did you think I'd expect you
to be perfect?

778
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:32,380
You're too confident of yourself.

779
00:57:35,490 --> 00:57:38,190
I wanted to see how determined you were.

780
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:41,300
Your rhomboid,

781
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:43,590
spinal erectors, and the soleus muscles.

782
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:46,330
It took you a week to get them this far.

783
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:47,870
It's a miracle.

784
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,980
Well said, Rib.

785
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:55,080
Take it easy.

786
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,900
Don't worry about turnout, balance,
or anything else.

787
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:59,380
Dance like your first time.

788
01:01:13,990 --> 01:01:14,960
(Good news.)

789
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:17,700
(It looks like Yeon-seo,
who was icy cold,)

790
01:01:18,570 --> 01:01:20,820
(who was like an empty and noisy gong,)

791
01:01:21,610 --> 01:01:25,270
(is about to begin something.)

792
01:01:26,590 --> 01:01:28,430
(Her beginnings seems very humble,)

793
01:01:29,050 --> 01:01:32,000
(but her future will hold love.)

794
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,550
(I am about to finish my mission.)

795
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:37,760
(But...)

796
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:42,550
(why is my heart in so much pain?)

797
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:03,020
Why are you crying?

798
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:06,320
Were you disappointed?

799
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:11,860
That was so pretty.

800
01:02:13,090 --> 01:02:15,860
That was the prettiest thing
I've ever seen.

801
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:57,220
(Angel's Last Mission: Love)

802
01:02:58,410 --> 01:02:59,990
(You're smiling brightly, aren't you?)

803
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:02,980
You look pretty.

804
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,620
Don't you think this is too much?

805
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:06,290
("She was very beautiful.")

806
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:08,790
"She was the prettiest."

807
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:09,970
It's true!

808
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:11,070
(I'll fight with you.)

809
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:14,550
(I want to see you become
the center of Fantasia.)

810
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:17,020
(About how the chandelier fell...)

811
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,550
(I'm feeling nervous.)

812
01:03:18,910 --> 01:03:22,160
(You save me and help me out.)

813
01:03:22,250 --> 01:03:24,200
But why don't you like me?

814
01:03:24,410 --> 01:03:27,230
(How can I not like you?)
