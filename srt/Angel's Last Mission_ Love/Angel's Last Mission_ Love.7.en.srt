1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:02,280
Young Lady.

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,440
Can't you just give up on everything?

3
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,150
I hate to see you suffer.

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:15,920
You don't have to keep dancing

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,520
for Fantasia.

6
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,580
If you need an audience to dance,

7
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,260
I will watch you.

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,250
Okay?

9
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:32,250
Should I?

10
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,850
Should I give up on everything,

11
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,270
show my dance only to you,

12
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,430
and live forever with you?

13
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,010
Kim Dan.

14
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:51,960
Yes, Young Lady.

15
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,240
Why do you always save me?

16
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:02,870
You save me

17
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:05,690
and help me out.

18
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,630
But why don't you like me?

19
00:01:12,289 --> 00:01:13,300
Figures.

20
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,420
No one in this world likes me.

21
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,120
I don't care about that.

22
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,789
But it's not okay for you

23
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:29,710
to not like me.

24
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:30,850
I hate it.

25
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,660
It's frustrating.

26
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,620
You said I'm good.

27
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,390
You said I'm pretty.

28
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,340
But...

29
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,910
But why don't you like me?

30
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,550
How can you not like me?

31
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:53,340
How?

32
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,930
Kim Dan.

33
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,079
I...

34
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,990
I cannot like you.

35
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,460
And I...

36
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,430
can't stay by your side forever.

37
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,670
That really...

38
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,090
breaks my heart.

39
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,250
Yeon-seo.

40
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,360
How can I...

41
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,590
not like you?

42
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:38,980
Don't go.

43
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:43,550
Don't go.

44
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,200
How do you really feel?

45
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:57,590
Are you worried he isn't the real one?

46
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,750
Or are you wishing
that he isn't the real one?

47
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,170
I'm in huge trouble, aren't I?

48
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,769
-What are you doing?
-No, what's with you?

49
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,779
-Let go of me. Let go...
-You can't run away.

50
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:23,640
Tell me you'll disappear
from Yeon-seo's life now.

51
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,780
What are you talking about?

52
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,060
I warned you, didn't I?

53
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,080
That I won't let you live
if you interfere.

54
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,710
Who do you think you are to tell her

55
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,290
to give up on dancing?

56
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,770
I said, let go!

57
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,500
(I'm not really sure anymore.)

58
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,180
I thought I could know

59
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,690
(what humans are like
when I take on their body.)

60
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,720
(But I guess not.)

61
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,640
(Why are humans like this?)

62
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,500
(Why does my heart ache
when I like someone?)

63
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,100
(I know it's a vain hope,)

64
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:14,060
(but why do I keep wanting
and wishing for more?)

65
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,930
(Why do)

66
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,180
(humans love)

67
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,330
(in such a foolish way?)

68
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,660
You're awake.

69
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,610
He has a laceration on his arm.

70
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,880
Don't worry. It's not bad.

71
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,250
Ji Kang-woo. Where's he?

72
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,200
The guy I fell in with. Is he not out yet?

73
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,980
There's another man in the water.
Keep searching.

74
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:24,240
Be quick. He's human and could die...

75
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,670
We'll look for the other person.

76
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,210
Let's take you to the hospital.

77
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,450
That person. Is it...

78
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,780
Who do you mean?

79
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,760
Will you keep still?

80
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,250
I'm okay. I'm perfectly fine.

81
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,659
You bled a lot.

82
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,340
And just in case, we'll take some x-rays.

83
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,540
I'll heal right away. I swear.

84
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,680
Stay right here until it's your turn.

85
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,060
What's that I keep seeing?

86
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,060
It's not a dream or a prophecy.

87
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,530
It must've been Ji Kang-woo.

88
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,990
I hope he's okay.

89
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:35,390
So why did he lunge at me
and grab me by the throat?

90
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,630
Why would a civilized person do that?

91
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:41,190
Did he...

92
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,980
Can't you just give up on everything?

93
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,440
Should I give up on everything,

94
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:50,960
show my dance only to you,
and live forever with you?

95
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,510
Did he hear that?

96
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:56,950
If he did,

97
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,409
does that justify what he did?

98
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,600
It does.

99
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:07,420
Telling a dancer to quit
is like taking their life.

100
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,850
-What do you mean?
-After Yeon-seo went blind,

101
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,650
do you know she tried to kill herself?

102
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,360
She just got her sight back
and decided to dance again,

103
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,910
and you want her to give up? To quit?

104
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,100
How dare you?

105
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,480
Who do you think you are
to say such nonsense?

106
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:24,840
Quit your daydreaming.

107
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:27,920
Yeon-seo's standing
at the edge of a cliff.

108
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,210
Just one step and she plummets
into the darkness.

109
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,700
Don't push her!

110
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,179
That will be the fiery pit to her.

111
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:40,370
I'm warning you for the last time.

112
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,130
Resign and leave tomorrow.

113
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,669
If not, I will...

114
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,970
toss you into the fiery pit first.

115
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,160
Mr. Ji.

116
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,280
I won't leave. I can't yet.

117
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:05,410
Why not? You pretended it wasn't,

118
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,210
but is it because of your meager emotions?

119
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,970
Your sincerity and all that?

120
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,460
You're right. I like Yeon-seo.

121
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,090
I like her.

122
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,770
Much more than I thought.

123
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,400
That's why I'm doing this.

124
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,200
Because I want to see her happy.

125
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,050
You promised me

126
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,000
that whatever you do,
you'd do it for her happiness.

127
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,070
Keep your word.

128
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,480
If you do that,

129
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,810
I'll disappear.

130
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,180
I won't look back

131
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,510
and will leave with a smile.

132
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,710
But if you

133
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:41,660
give her a hard time over dance
or anything,

134
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,130
then I will make you pay.

135
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,160
Do you understand?

136
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,920
I know better than anyone.
I won't do anything.

137
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:19,990
I won't yearn for more.

138
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,230
Kim Dan, it's time for your x-ray...

139
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,990
What are you doing?

140
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,100
I'm fine now. I'll get going.

141
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,170
-Wait.
-Sorry.

142
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:31,780
Wait. Wait. Kim Dan.

143
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,180
Dear Deity. He is out of his mind.

144
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,480
Please ignore

145
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,770
all the confessions from today.

146
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,500
Seol-hee.

147
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:18,860
(You said that
the world is full of dance.)

148
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,450
Why am I...

149
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,750
like this, Seol-hee?

150
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,440
I thought it was done,

151
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,380
that I'm almost there.

152
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,380
He really gets on my nerves.

153
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,590
I can't stand him.

154
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,380
(Is it really him)

155
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,580
(that's getting on your nerves?)

156
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,500
(What's making you waver?)

157
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,180
(Is it that man,)

158
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:02,860
(or...)

159
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,840
(is it your heart?)

160
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,140
Where's Ni-na?

161
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,160
Just one glass should do it.

162
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,280
Ru-na.

163
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,920
Shall we talk?

164
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,720
About what?

165
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,840
It's nothing.

166
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,820
Call the sponsors' association

167
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,630
and have them gather by 9:00 a.m.

168
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,260
-Now?
-Yes.

169
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,420
-Good morning.
-Morning.

170
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,750
Did you drink?

171
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,180
Do you smell it? Oh, dear.

172
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,330
I showered two times
and brushed my teeth three times.

173
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,710
You never drank alcohol. Why start now?

174
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,730
Is it because of Yeon-seo?

175
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:00,320
You boycotted her.

176
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,030
The members are all in,

177
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,930
but the artistic director
is being stubborn.

178
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,640
Drink this. You'll feel better.

179
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:12,150
It will all work out.
Trust me and rest today.

180
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,180
Okay.

181
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,920
Well, Mom.

182
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:25,180
Do you remember the teacher
who first taught me ballet?

183
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:26,590
Who do you mean?

184
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:30,630
You know, there was
this teacher called Elena.

185
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,870
That lunatic?

186
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,270
Why talk about her?

187
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,080
She got kicked out long ago.

188
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:37,980
It's just that now Yeon-seo's back,

189
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:39,520
and I thought about her.

190
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,020
She's no longer a teacher.

191
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:43,220
She threw red paint
at an eight-year-old girl,

192
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:45,370
telling her to imagine death.

193
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,690
And she dunked you in a bathtub

194
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,970
so you could imagine the sea.

195
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,090
My goodness.
She was completely out of her mind.

196
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:54,440
Ni-na. If someone asks,
say you don't know her.

197
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:57,340
She never taught you
and you don't know her.

198
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:00,730
Nothing good will come from you
being associated with her.

199
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,300
I'll give you 12 hours.
Resign on your own.

200
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,850
(Telling a dancer to quit)

201
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,000
is like taking their life.

202
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,100
How long were you there for?

203
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:53,840
For a while.

204
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,710
You're pretty, as always when you dance.

205
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,560
You are.

206
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,180
That's a given.

207
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:05,320
Do I have about two hours left?

208
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,610
About what your aunt said yesterday?

209
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:10,730
-That's...
-Young Lady.

210
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,360
Take it.
It's the result of the blood test.

211
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,120
Didn't you say it's of no use?

212
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,220
Did you find something?

213
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,320
No.

214
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:24,020
If you're cornered, use this to bluff.

215
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:26,000
That someone set you up
and you're a victim.

216
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,890
If they push you,
you'll reveal the results.

217
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,460
No. Just don't go.

218
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:34,010
The 12-hour deadline was unfair
from the start.

219
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,310
You have no duty or responsibility
to go by what they said.

220
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,580
And if I don't go,

221
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,740
should I just give in?

222
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,200
You know that General Director Choi is

223
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,010
no pushover.

224
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:46,640
I know that.

225
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,750
I know too well
which is why I'm like this.

226
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,380
It's obvious what'll happen.

227
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,760
She'll nag at you to no end
and force you to quit.

228
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:02,120
My goodness.
She knew we were talking about her.

229
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,100
What do we do?

230
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:06,130
Let me answer it.
She probably wants to talk to me.

231
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,410
Yes, it's me.

232
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:13,520
Why aren't you answering my calls?

233
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:14,620
(I almost thought)

234
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,990
(that you went into hiding
because you were scared.)

235
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,720
(Hello? Are you there?)

236
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:20,910
Go on.

237
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,230
Your time is almost up.

238
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,990
Are you coming or not?

239
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,290
(Everyone from the association
is going to be there.)

240
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,450
(If you're not joining us,
I'll speak on your behalf.)

241
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,470
(I'll tell them
you'll take full responsibility...)

242
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,540
Just wait. I'll be there on time.

243
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,410
You've made the right decision.

244
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,090
People say ending things on a good note
is all that matters.

245
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,040
(It's much better that it will be you
who will put an end to this mess)

246
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,450
(without anyone's involvement.)

247
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,810
See you later, then.

248
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:48,980
What did she say?

249
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,570
I must get going.

250
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,360
If things go south,
just pretend that you faint. Okay?

251
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,160
Kim Dan.

252
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:03,590
Why are you so quiet?

253
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,660
Aren't you going to ask

254
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,770
what I'm going to do?

255
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,240
Hey, where are you going?

256
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:16,349
Kim Dan!

257
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,590
Why are we here?

258
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,920
Hey, what are you doing?

259
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,710
How did it feel
when you fell into the water?

260
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,440
Wasn't it dark,

261
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,160
suffocating,

262
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,240
scary, and lonely?

263
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,360
I know that too.

264
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,000
Have you gone mad? What were you thinking?

265
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:09,680
You almost gave me a heart attack!

266
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,790
It's really unfortunate.

267
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,180
Had I known you at the time,

268
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,080
I would've stopped you

269
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:22,260
like you held my hand just now.

270
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,700
Actually, yesterday,

271
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,900
this is what I told you.

272
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,020
I told you if it's too hard,

273
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:32,510
you can give up.

274
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,250
-I don't remember that.
-I did tell you that.

275
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,100
I told you to give up
and have an easy life.

276
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,140
But that day at the beach

277
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,130
and in your studio this morning,

278
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,250
you were happy...

279
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,040
for sure.

280
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,980
If you like dancing,

281
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,570
go ahead.

282
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,640
And just keep this in mind.

283
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,500
Whatever you decide to do

284
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,080
or wherever you are,

285
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,150
you are no longer alone.

286
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,980
We'll be late. Let's hurry.

287
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,230
Wait up for me!

288
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,170
The sponsors' association meeting
at this hour?

289
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,800
Everyone is in the conference room now.

290
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:31,560
General Director Choi called the meeting.

291
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,670
I thought that you should be informed too.

292
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:38,730
(Chairman Lee Yong-jin)

293
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,150
Thank you.

294
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,750
(What on earth is going there?)

295
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:47,000
Yesterday, you barged into my car
and threatened me.

296
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,280
It seems like you do business
with Mr. Ishikawa.

297
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:54,880
Would you like to pay taxes
in both countries?

298
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,290
What do you want?

299
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,400
Maintaining the status quo.

300
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,470
No more, no less.

301
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,520
And today,

302
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,720
(General Director Choi called me
at the crack of dawn.)

303
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,660
Lee Yeon-seo will make
an important announcement.

304
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:07,460
What did you say?

305
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,940
What are you doing?

306
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,920
Is this some kind of a prank?

307
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:15,780
We will submit an official petition
to dismiss you.

308
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,980
Ms. Lee Yeon-seo.

309
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:20,270
You and I went over this together.

310
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:23,130
If you keep this up,
you're going to ruin Fantasia.

311
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:43,630
I'm sorry.

312
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,460
I take responsibility

313
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,620
for what happened that day.

314
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,430
I won't make any excuses.

315
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,460
I apologize.

316
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,190
Go on. What else?

317
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:09,240
Do you think that just saying sorry
is enough?

318
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,290
Are you serious?

319
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:12,010
There's more.

320
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,210
Ms. Lee Yeon-seo, don't be nervous.

321
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,700
Just speak your mind.

322
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:19,180
Do you remember
what we promised yesterday?

323
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,860
Do you remember what we promised to do

324
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,240
for the future of Fantasia?

325
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,610
I know it's difficult.

326
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,670
Starting today, Ms. Lee Yeon-seo

327
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,430
decided to resign from

328
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,630
the foundation and the ballet theater.

329
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,170
No. I won't do that.

330
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:46,460
That's not true.

331
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,500
Are you telling us that you won't
resign from both of your positions?

332
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:51,300
Are you truly sorry?

333
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,020
I will show you with my performance.

334
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,170
I'm sure you've suspected me
since that day.

335
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,710
I will show you

336
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,250
that I'm not mentally unstable

337
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,010
and that I'm perfectly sane.

338
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:05,780
This all has to be worth something.

339
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,240
It must be worthy of our money
which we earned

340
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:09,820
with our blood and sweat.

341
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,890
If you're going to apologize,

342
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,930
you can kneel down
and put everything to rest.

343
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,130
It's clear and sincere.

344
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,280
I see.

345
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,390
Kneel down?

346
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,990
Sincere?

347
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:26,890
That's it.

348
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,730
Do you like ballet?

349
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,550
What's your favorite show?

350
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:53,950
What's your favorite role?

351
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,490
Do you know how many dancers

352
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,470
we have in our ballet theater?

353
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,470
You were in the middle of your apology.

354
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:02,580
What nonsense are you gibbering about?

355
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:03,990
You don't like ballet.

356
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,270
Right?

357
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:11,030
You know those people in the association?

358
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:12,790
They are ignorant,

359
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,410
but they want to look sophisticated

360
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,050
and believe they can buy taste with money.

361
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,570
They sit in the best seat

362
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,290
and doze off.

363
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,800
Those annoying snobs.

364
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:27,390
-What did she just say?
-What?

365
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,540
Lee Yeon-seo!

366
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:32,060
Were you just talking about us?

367
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,730
I'll make you like it.

368
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:36,110
Ballet.

369
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:38,750
I'll make you love ballet.

370
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,830
That will be worth your money.

371
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:44,380
If this show, "Giselle,"

372
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:47,110
isn't a success, I will resign from

373
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:49,920
the ballet theater
and Fantasia Foundation.

374
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:52,780
Is this enough of an answer?

375
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:54,670
We will extend
General Director Choi Yeong-ja's

376
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,480
power of attorney
until the day of the show.

377
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,490
After the show,

378
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:00,260
we'll choose which one of us
will leave Fantasia.

379
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,600
This is all. Bye.

380
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,040
My goodness.

381
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,290
-Gosh.
-She's unbelievable.

382
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,630
Ms. Lee.

383
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:38,800
Good job.

384
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,780
Let's come up with the best show

385
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:42,240
and make them kneel down.

386
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,570
I'll do my best.

387
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,460
Lee Yeon-seo.

388
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,460
Let's talk.

389
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,190
You...

390
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,080
Are you toying with me?

391
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,750
Do you think I'm a joke?

392
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:06,520
How could you con me every chance you get?

393
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:07,710
How did we

394
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,130
end up here?

395
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:15,190
Because of this?

396
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:18,320
Do you want it?

397
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,350
Don't patronize me.

398
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,160
You think I'm greedy for money?

399
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,730
If I was greedy for money,
I would've sold this off ages ago

400
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,140
while you were away in Russia,

401
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,900
and you were blind.

402
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:33,890
I was the one who grew Fantasia.

403
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:37,150
It was me who worked for a decade
to bring Fantasia

404
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:40,530
to where it is now
after your parents passed away.

405
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,600
I had to flatter those ministers

406
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:44,320
and play nice with the sponsors.

407
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,210
And it was me
who built this foundation up.

408
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,810
How does this belong to you
when I did all the hard work?

409
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,310
Since when

410
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,340
did you start to covet Fantasia?

411
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:54,750
Was it

412
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,420
when my dad took you and your husband in

413
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,870
because you had nowhere else to go?

414
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,450
Or was it when my parents passed away?

415
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,430
Did you think it'd be easy
since it was just me?

416
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:02,800
Did you begin to get greedy?

417
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:06,580
Stop denouncing me.

418
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:08,210
You don't even know anything.

419
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,490
If that's not it,

420
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,510
did you get delusional
and begin to think that

421
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,190
it's yours because the only successor
is now blind?

422
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,600
Did you ever...

423
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:19,340
feel bad about me as your family,

424
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:21,630
even once?

425
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:30,080
If you didn't do something like this,

426
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,230
today, I would have...

427
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:34,830
No.

428
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:38,310
I would have put everything down ages ago.

429
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:41,610
You're using me as an excuse
to the very end.

430
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:44,860
I'll also show you
that I am worthy of this.

431
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:51,370
Fine, I look forward
to seeing your "Giselle."

432
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,310
Although you won't have

433
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,810
corps de ballet or a partner.

434
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,560
How is your arm?

435
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:11,660
Well, I'm fine now.

436
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,820
So when will you quit?

437
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,510
You saw her. No matter what you say,

438
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,750
she said she'd make you love her ballet.

439
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,640
That's who a ballerina is.

440
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:24,810
Someone who stands by herself
on the huge stage.

441
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,720
She doesn't need a cheeky secretary.

442
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:33,480
In that aspect,
you didn't really do anything either.

443
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,840
Yeon-seo resolved this all alone.

444
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,580
I couldn't tell you before
because I was out of it,

445
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,690
but you can't just go down
to the fiery pit

446
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,980
when some arbitrary man sends you there.

447
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,440
I can't explain this in detail,

448
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:51,170
but especially someone like me
can't go to that place.

449
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:52,750
Keep that in your mind.

450
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,740
Where are the members of the troupe?

451
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,340
I know they're on a strike.

452
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:59,660
I'll go talk to them.

453
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,850
That's not necessary.

454
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:03,800
They aren't striking against you,
Yeon-seo.

455
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,390
It's a strike against the decision
I made as an artistic director.

456
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,400
I'll take care of this.

457
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:10,260
It's because of me. So I'll go and...

458
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:12,550
(Hwang Jung-eun, Fantasia)

459
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,940
This is Ji Kang-woo.
Where are you right now?

460
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,880
Let us tell you what our demand is.

461
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:26,810
First.

462
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,760
(Retract your decision in making
Lee Yeon-seo our lead.)

463
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:30,860
(Second.)

464
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,100
Please put an end
to your dogmatic leadership.

465
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,430
Is that all?
I will answer you immediately.

466
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,100
First, I will not retract anything.

467
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:39,740
Second, if you do not show up
at the practice at 10 a.m. tomorrow,

468
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:40,970
you will be fired.

469
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:45,680
-Director Ji.
-We can just get new dancers.

470
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:49,030
People line up to join our theater
as a member of a group dance.

471
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,830
(I do not wish to create a performance)

472
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,370
with members who do not trust me,

473
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,000
who needs to be humored to work.

474
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:55,050
(Tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.)

475
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,990
(It's the last chance I give you
as a director.)

476
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:57,960
(That's all.)

477
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,380
What did he say?

478
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:03,150
-What if I get fired?
-Do we have to go?

479
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,550
What were you thinking?

480
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,440
I'm giving them an opportunity.

481
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:11,110
They can use this as an excuse to return.

482
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,930
How can I perform with people
who return reluctantly?

483
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:16,350
I know you're trying very hard
for my sake.

484
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,510
Even so, this isn't right.

485
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,740
What do you expect me to do?

486
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:22,730
You can do things your way.

487
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:24,580
I'll try my best too.

488
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,690
Let's go.

489
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:35,270
"Those who oppress the righteous person"

490
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,430
"and deprive the poor"

491
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,640
"have many faults and a grave sin."

492
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:51,810
Should I give Ni-na a call?

493
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:02,860
Ni-na is a great person,
so she'll help you out.

494
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,790
(Geum Ni-na)

495
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:15,000
Yes, Dan. What is it?

496
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,500
(It's me, Yeon-seo.)

497
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,200
If you're calling
about the ballet theater,

498
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,740
I can't tell you anything.

499
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,460
I'm not asking you to persuade them.

500
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:27,410
Just tell me where you are.

501
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:28,770
Please.

502
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:35,020
I never asked you for a favor before.

503
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,970
Please don't put me in a tight spot.
I'm hanging up.

504
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,990
(I thought you wanted
to fight fair and square.)

505
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:44,000
You came to my house and told me

506
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,810
to return to my old self
because you wanted to compete with me.

507
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,920
(If you push me away
even before we begin,)

508
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:50,820
how could we ever know who won?

509
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,980
What are we going to do?

510
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:56,760
Director Ji always does whatever he says.

511
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,000
Can we really stay here
and do volunteer work?

512
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:01,330
Hey, can't you tell that
he's throwing bait to us

513
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,700
to let some of us return?

514
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:04,850
Sitting around on a strike
will only make us feel bad.

515
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:07,010
But if we do charity work,
we'll get good energy.

516
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,110
Let's hold out.

517
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,320
Ni-na, any ideas?

518
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:13,780
What do you think about having a talk
with them?

519
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:16,250
We need to talk to them to negotiate.

520
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:19,370
Are we going to go there obediently
after he gave us an ultimatum?

521
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,750
That's as good as saying that we give up.

522
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,390
Goodness, I'm sorry...

523
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,740
How did you find us?

524
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:30,550
I came to do volunteer work.

525
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:34,020
I'm a part of Fantasia Ballet Theater.

526
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,850
Stop putting on a show and go.

527
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,960
Since when did you do things with us?

528
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,530
Starting now.

529
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,680
I want to do things as a member
of the troupe.

530
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,500
Who says you can?

531
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,390
Hey, just let her do it.

532
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,770
The more help we have, the better.

533
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:05,040
I assure you

534
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,980
that she'll leave crying in an hour.

535
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,210
I feel so good.

536
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,150
This is refreshing.

537
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:30,910
Do you like it?

538
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:45,130
All right, here comes Lee Yeon-seo!
It's Lee Yeon-seo!

539
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:02,730
Let's dance among ourselves!

540
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:20,850
-Young Lady.
-Not a word.

541
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,170
I'm tired.

542
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:35,330
Young Lady, congratulations!

543
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:39,380
I heard you put the sponsors' association
in their place today.

544
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:41,050
People say that everything has its use,

545
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,810
and that was a great way
to use your temper.

546
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:43,950
Come on, blow them out.

547
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,100
Make a wish too.

548
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,810
"Giselle" will do awesome!

549
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,350
Lee Yeon-seo, you'll do even better!

550
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,070
In one, two, three.

551
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,160
What was that?

552
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:56,580
The ballet theatre is on a strike.

553
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,560
So she's feeling the worst right now.

554
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,210
Why are you telling me this now?

555
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,580
You should have told me before.

556
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,730
I was really out of it this afternoon too.

557
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:08,239
What? I look like I'm completely clueless.

558
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:25,530
You don't know where the members are?

559
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,690
I will report back before lunch.

560
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,179
No, there is no need to do that.

561
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:30,500
Make an audition announcement

562
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,100
-for new members now.
-Director Ji.

563
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:35,520
Make sure the resume screening
and the interview happen soon.

564
00:34:36,489 --> 00:34:37,590
What are we going to do?

565
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,040
It's 10:00 a.m.

566
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:41,239
Can we do this?

567
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:43,840
What if we really get fired?

568
00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:46,520
We took a stand. Let's push ahead.

569
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:51,449
Ni-na's on our side.
They wouldn't fire us all.

570
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,600
Good morning, everyone.

571
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,210
Good morning.

572
00:34:58,090 --> 00:34:59,190
Hello.

573
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,520
Hello. Good morning.

574
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,680
Where are you?

575
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:11,420
My husband. Where is he?
Where did my husband go?

576
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:14,190
He must've left without me.

577
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,260
He left me all alone.

578
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:18,770
Ma'am, I'll hold your hand.

579
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,400
Take my hand and calm...

580
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:23,960
No, no.

581
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,210
She lost her mind again.

582
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,390
Sir.

583
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,890
Take me with you.

584
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:32,190
I can't live in a world without you.

585
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,740
Don't do this, ma'am. Calm down.

586
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:36,330
Mi-ok.

587
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,950
Wait.

588
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,590
Mi-ok. Mi-ok.

589
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,650
I'm here. It's okay.

590
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,380
It's okay now.

591
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,830
We must get out of here.

592
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:08,840
Let's go.

593
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,390
Get them out of here.

594
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:20,770
Help everyone out of here.

595
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,390
Hurry. Let's get outside.

596
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,880
Take your time.

597
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,050
Sit down here.

598
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,610
What happened?

599
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:36,250
This old lady...

600
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,060
I did it.

601
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,390
I did it.

602
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:45,230
Are you okay?

603
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:51,080
Leave before we get kicked out
because of you.

604
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:54,120
I apologize. I meant well.

605
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,760
One more show of goodwill
and you'll burn down the building.

606
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,350
I just

607
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:02,780
wanted to show you that I'm sincere.

608
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:04,150
Sincere about what?

609
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,280
Oh, you being the lead
while we make you look good?

610
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:10,130
If the princess volunteers with us,

611
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,600
did you think we'd be touched
by your efforts

612
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,280
and shed tears with you
and come back to the stage?

613
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:16,910
Yeon-seo.

614
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,460
No one wants to remain
a backup dancer forever.

615
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:21,750
That's right. This isn't a joke.

616
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,200
You regained sight long ago

617
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:25,050
and this is the first time
you came to see us.

618
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,500
Because you need us.

619
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,580
Why did you lie?

620
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,700
You didn't start the fire.

621
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,380
Things could've gotten worse.

622
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,550
What if they decided to make her leave?

623
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:44,230
You got so nice.

624
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,760
I'm not nasty. I'm just impartial.

625
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:52,500
They'll understand your sincerity.

626
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,140
Because

627
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,400
they all love to dance as well.

628
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,350
I watched them clean up

629
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,460
(and they were all dancing.)

630
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,900
(It was a nice sight.
They all looked like leads.)

631
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,280
Do you think

632
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:13,580
they don't get that you want to come back

633
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:14,850
after three years?

634
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:16,700
They're shutting you out now

635
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:18,370
because they're upset and hurt,

636
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:20,220
but if you perform together,

637
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,430
I bet it'll be a great sight.

638
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,950
A lead?

639
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,670
Ki-chun?

640
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,650
Gwang-il.

641
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,350
Why are you here?

642
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,690
What about you?
Are you here to see Ms. Lee?

643
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:17,770
I don't have an appointment but...

644
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,320
Let me see.

645
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:26,750
Gwang-il. Hey, Gwang-il. Gwang-il.

646
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,210
-Gwang-il.
-Don't follow me.

647
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:32,210
-Gwang-il.
-He should've rung the bell.

648
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:35,240
What's he doing outside someone's home?

649
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:38,760
-Hello.
-Hello.

650
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:45,540
Are you afraid if Yeon-seo's here?

651
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:47,870
No.

652
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,020
She wouldn't come back after yesterday

653
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:52,090
if she has a conscience. Let's go.

654
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,610
The current time is 9:49 a.m.

655
00:39:57,590 --> 00:40:00,280
My gosh, this is amazing.

656
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,960
I just pressed a button.

657
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,180
If you press this down and talk,

658
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:09,300
you can call your husband.

659
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,760
What did you save him as?

660
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:14,970
"My old man." That's what he is.

661
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,700
Then give it a go. Press this down

662
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,520
and say, "Call my old man."

663
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:23,510
Call my old man.

664
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:30,200
You're doing so well, Mi-ok.

665
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,190
Are we allowed to accept this?

666
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:40,760
You paid for the repairs
and took the blame

667
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,430
for the fire we caused.

668
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:47,930
I'm so sorry.
I should be dead and gone at my age,

669
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:50,080
but I'm not and I keep losing my mind.

670
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:51,980
No, ma'am.

671
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:54,920
You can do just fine even if you're blind.

672
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,680
I'll help you.

673
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,170
Yeon-seo.

674
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,660
Let's go. The director's waiting.

675
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,860
Can you excuse us?

676
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:14,060
The director?

677
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:29,810
What is it?

678
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:32,190
Why did you call me here?

679
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:35,750
I want to propose something to you
and the director.

680
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:40,950
"Giselle."

681
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:42,750
Let's hold an audition.

682
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:46,930
I sincerely

683
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:49,970
want to work with you all.

684
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:53,440
You kept Fantasia going
for the past three years.

685
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:56,790
The new members aren't Fantasia to me.

686
00:41:58,410 --> 00:42:01,190
Let's compete officially and fair.

687
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:02,900
From soloist to corps de ballet,

688
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:04,570
everyone can participate.

689
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:07,210
Of course, I get the right as well.

690
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,430
If I don't pass,
I'll start from the corps de ballet.

691
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:23,100
(Who says there can be an audition?)

692
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:24,810
I don't want a free ride.

693
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,490
This is the best way.

694
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:28,550
To me, there's only one Giselle.

695
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:31,370
There's no need to make things harder.

696
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:34,890
I said I'd sort it out.
Why don't you trust me?

697
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,910
Thank you for believing in me.

698
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:39,950
Even when I didn't believe myself,

699
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,890
you pushed your way in

700
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:43,560
and made me dance.

701
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,640
Trust me again.

702
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:48,790
It might be an endless tunnel,

703
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:50,730
but it'll be easier together.

704
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,820
How about a group cheer?

705
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:04,060
Fantasia, Fantasia, let's do this!

706
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,860
Hello?

707
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,970
Elena...

708
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:48,370
Elena.

709
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:49,780
Darn it.

710
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,210
I need you.

711
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:55,410
Elena.

712
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:06,230
Teach me.

713
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:11,120
Teach me.

714
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:22,340
Teach me.

715
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:24,320
You can't take that all!

716
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:28,060
Elena, teach me.

717
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,650
Teach me.

718
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:33,910
Elena.

719
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,190
Elena, will you teach me?

720
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:39,320
Get out! I told you to pay for that!

721
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:43,450
Hey, hey!

722
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:46,930
-No, no.
-Let go!

723
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:02,730
You dropped this.

724
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,270
I picked it up.

725
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:07,830
You don't do this kind of stuff.

726
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:10,210
Are you saying

727
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:11,660
I'm a kind,

728
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:14,030
timid and boring girl
who always follows the rules?

729
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,000
You know it well.

730
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:16,370
You're boring and no fun.

731
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:19,050
I'm going to throw away that side of me.

732
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:21,210
That's why I need you.

733
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,070
Please make me a new ballerina.

734
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:26,570
You've been living like a softie
for 26 years.

735
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:27,940
Why all of a sudden?

736
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:29,210
I want to

737
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,590
beat Yeon-seo.

738
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:34,630
I'll do whatever it takes.

739
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:37,090
I'll beat her no matter what.

740
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:28,080
I should buy cucumbers too.

741
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:29,710
These cucumbers look fresh.

742
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:33,980
My gosh, what's all this?

743
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:35,960
Are you going to cook a meal
for your girlfriend?

744
00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:37,460
No, she's not my girlfriend.

745
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:38,730
Then is it for your wife?

746
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:41,060
My gosh. She's not my wife.

747
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:44,670
Well, she's not my girlfriend, wife,
or anything.

748
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:49,470
If she's not anything,
what are you doing here?

749
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:53,690
Why didn't you write your report?

750
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,160
You scared me!

751
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:17,100
Have you given up on everything?

752
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:18,680
Where's your report?

753
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:21,240
Why are you doing this? Why?

754
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,610
This girl has a hard life. What can I do?

755
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:25,420
I see her having a problem
after a problem.

756
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,320
When will she date and fall in love?

757
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:30,210
She needs to take care
of her problems first.

758
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:33,070
Right. Two months.

759
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,890
You think you have
all the time in the world, don't you?

760
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:39,580
Hu, here's my big picture.

761
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:42,440
Once she's free of problems
and has time to look after herself,

762
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:44,600
she's bound to fall in love with somebody.

763
00:47:44,690 --> 00:47:45,870
I haven't given up yet.

764
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:49,790
You really know nothing about humans.

765
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:52,470
No humans in this world fall in love

766
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,450
after getting everything ready.

767
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:58,060
If that's the case, why do you think
that poor guy, Heung-bu, had ten children?

768
00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:01,630
Anyway,

769
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:04,570
I'm going to focus on Yeon-seo's happiness
for the time being.

770
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:07,040
I'll submit all the reports I'm behind
with at once.

771
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:08,140
Okay.

772
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:11,260
Gosh.

773
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:14,560
My goodness.

774
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:51,920
("Those who")

775
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:55,000
"oppress the righteous person
and deprive the poor"

776
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:58,470
"have many faults and a grave sin."

777
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,230
But you can't just go down
to the fiery pit

778
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,990
when some arbitrary man sends you there.

779
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:04,110
I can't explain this in detail,

780
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,480
but especially someone like me
can't go to that place.

781
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:08,020
I haven't given up yet.

782
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:10,490
I'll submit all the reports
I'm behind with at once.

783
00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:32,040
Believe in the mercy of the deity.

784
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:35,430
And confess all of the sins
you have committed so far.

785
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,860
Father, do angels exist?

786
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:43,920
I'm sure they are fulfilling their duties

787
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:45,240
in places where

788
00:49:45,330 --> 00:49:47,490
they can't be seen
as loyal servants of the deity.

789
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:49,070
What about an angel that can be seen?

790
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:51,540
I bet he violated religious precepts.

791
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,260
Angels can't be seen in the eyes
of humans.

792
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:55,450
What if someone did?

793
00:49:55,890 --> 00:49:59,100
What happens to the angel
when a human finds out his true identity?

794
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:04,910
I believe you are mistaken, brother.

795
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:06,940
Father,

796
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,750
it sounds like you know
nothing about angels.

797
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:12,000
Or for some reason, you have to pretend

798
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:14,370
that you don't know.

799
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:16,480
This is where you confess your sins.

800
00:50:16,570 --> 00:50:18,290
You're not here to test me.

801
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:19,560
Please go back.

802
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:36,020
What... What is this about?

803
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:38,480
It's nothing. I'll see you around.

804
00:50:46,270 --> 00:50:48,340
My gosh. Goodness.

805
00:50:56,350 --> 00:50:57,450
Gosh.

806
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:58,810
What are you doing?

807
00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:02,640
Well, the past couple of days
have been hard for you.

808
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:04,220
You barely ate.

809
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:05,940
I'm trying to cook you something.

810
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:07,570
But it's a mess.

811
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:12,100
Move.

812
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,090
Let me help.

813
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:17,110
Hold on.

814
00:51:19,490 --> 00:51:20,940
-You should put this on.
-Forget it.

815
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:23,140
Hold on. Wait, wait.

816
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:25,610
You have to put this on.
Put your head down first.

817
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:28,110
Come here.

818
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:30,750
Your arms.

819
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:35,020
Stay still.

820
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,830
Come on. Stop it. What a hassle.

821
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:42,940
You and your temper.

822
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:50,770
Are you serious? You're a bad cook too.

823
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,210
What should I do?

824
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:00,100
Go wash them.

825
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:01,770
Do I wash everything? Not just two?

826
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:05,560
-Stop. I'm going to do it.
-Let me do it. No, no.

827
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:07,450
If you chop it like that, it's dangerous.

828
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:09,650
That's not how you do it.

829
00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:15,460
Like this.

830
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:18,930
-Okay.
-This is how you chop a carrot.

831
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,250
Darn it.

832
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,470
I smell something burning.

833
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:24,960
Let me take care of that.

834
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:26,720
It's hot.

835
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:29,320
-Are you okay?
-Stay there!

836
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:31,430
Hold on a second.

837
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:44,450
You can't hurt your feet.

838
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:54,220
Young Lady.

839
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:56,160
Should we...

840
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:00,560
just have ramyeon?

841
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,490
Here.

842
00:53:41,170 --> 00:53:42,180
No.

843
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,250
It's hot.

844
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:46,270
Gosh, it's hot.

845
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:27,850
Hey, you over there!

846
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:29,480
Be careful!

847
00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:45,930
Are you okay?

848
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:52,010
I'm Yeon-seo. Lee Yeon-seo.

849
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:53,500
What about you?

850
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:56,410
I'm...

851
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:05,780
I had another dream.

852
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:08,730
What was that?

853
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:19,330
Hu. Hu!

854
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:25,090
My gosh, man.

855
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,490
Why? What is it?

856
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:36,670
Can a human become an angel?

857
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,430
-What?
-I mean,

858
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:40,230
they were probably a human,

859
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:41,770
and they probably died, right?

860
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:45,200
So do their souls sometimes
become an angel?

861
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:48,540
Why do you suddenly want to know

862
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:50,440
about the secrets of that realm?

863
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:54,700
I keep having a dream.
I see a little boy there.

864
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:57,560
He runs, falls down,
and even drowns in the sea,

865
00:55:57,650 --> 00:55:59,240
but I haven't seen him anywhere,

866
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,640
not even in pictures.

867
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:02,840
He's not someone I passed by
when I was dispatched.

868
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:05,310
Then who in the world is he?

869
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:09,090
Oh, goodness.

870
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:16,530
This body has serious defects.

871
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,860
You're starting to dream
of what you wish for.

872
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:24,890
What I wish for?

873
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:27,400
When humans have a wish,

874
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:30,120
they begin to ponder about it
over and over again.

875
00:56:30,210 --> 00:56:32,020
Then their brain cells
begin to get confused.

876
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:34,300
Is this the future? The past?
Or just their desire?

877
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:35,980
It's just a side effect. Forget about it.

878
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:37,960
Humans dream of what they wish for?

879
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:38,970
Yes.

880
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:40,160
Hu.

881
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:44,380
Then do I wish to become a human?

882
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,030
Does that ever happen?
An angel becoming a human?

883
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:53,660
Why did you hit me?

884
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:54,760
Follow me.

885
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,620
You never explain
the most important things.

886
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:07,660
Why are we here? This is a sanatorium.

887
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:09,680
There he is.

888
00:57:09,770 --> 00:57:11,350
It's very refreshing.

889
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,720
Isn't it?

890
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,050
Hey. Sir!

891
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:23,190
No, we have to go. We must go.

892
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,280
We have to go. We have to go!

893
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:49,370
Angel Noel, receive your judgment.

894
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,870
He's an angel?

895
00:57:56,930 --> 00:57:59,220
Please spare his life. Please.

896
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:05,820
You foolish one.

897
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:07,710
I do not care

898
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:10,570
if I disappear like this.

899
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:12,820
But please...

900
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,240
Let her live.

901
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:16,730
Death...

902
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:19,370
is not a punishment.

903
00:58:19,770 --> 00:58:22,760
How dare an angel who refused
to bring her to paradise

904
00:58:22,850 --> 00:58:25,530
speak of life and death of a human?

905
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:33,850
Where are you?

906
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:35,700
Where are you?

907
00:58:36,270 --> 00:58:37,410
Where are you?

908
00:58:44,810 --> 00:58:46,040
Then,

909
00:58:47,010 --> 00:58:50,660
at least let me say goodbye to her.

910
00:58:51,710 --> 00:58:53,470
It will take only a minute.

911
00:59:04,470 --> 00:59:07,200
I am right here. Right here.

912
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:10,900
Don't go. No, don't leave me.

913
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:13,930
You promised to stay with me.

914
00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:16,840
I was here for a long time.

915
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:24,180
I was glad to have met you.

916
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:27,700
I will not forget,

917
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:29,990
my dear Mi-ok.

918
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:44,600
-No.
-Move aside.

919
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:48,340
Just a little more.
Give them just a little more time.

920
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:34,230
If you won't listen to what I say,

921
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:35,730
I'll have to show you.

922
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:39,110
You foolish one.
I hope you will be enlightened.

923
01:01:11,890 --> 01:01:12,910
Ma'am.

924
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:15,370
Ma'am! Ma'am!

925
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:04,030
You're here.

926
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:07,420
Let's eat breakfast.
It's better than yesterday.

927
01:02:08,430 --> 01:02:10,540
Did you go out this early to run?

928
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,060
-Do you want water?
-Young Lady.

929
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:16,570
I have something to tell you.

930
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:19,120
It's really important.

931
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:24,580
-What is it?
-I...

932
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:27,700
I want to quit my job.

933
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:30,610
I want to

934
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:33,030
move out.

935
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:02,900
(Angel's Last Mission: Love)

936
01:03:03,610 --> 01:03:05,280
(Why Yeon-seo?)

937
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:09,990
Why did you send me to her of all people?

938
01:03:10,210 --> 01:03:12,140
(I want to stay with her.)

939
01:03:12,940 --> 01:03:14,480
I got angry and resented him too, but...

940
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:16,060
Pull yourself together, will you?

941
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:20,330
Kim Dan may not be someone
that you think he is.

942
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:21,600
(What do you mean?)

943
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:24,110
Where is he? I have something to ask him.

944
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,710
(That naive angel went around
acting a little too cute.)

945
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:28,860
If you lurk around Yeon-seo one more time,

946
01:03:28,950 --> 01:03:32,030
(she'll also find out
about the beings of paradise.)
