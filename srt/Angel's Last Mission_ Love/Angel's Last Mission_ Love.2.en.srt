1
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:06,380
If angels can regret,

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,650
my only regret would be that day.

3
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,360
(09M 2904)

4
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,830
I shouldn't have done that.

5
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,820
I shouldn't have saved her.

6
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:44,680
I was not

7
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,450
supposed to do that.

8
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:03,990
No.

9
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:05,880
Please!

10
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,200
Darn it!

11
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,840
You're late.

12
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,900
I gave you my final warning.

13
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:29,950
Hello, there's been a car accident.

14
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,380
I'm on Route Eight heading toward Yangpyeong.

15
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,700
Please hurry.

16
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,160
Mr. Jo...

17
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,040
Please answer me.

18
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,160
I'm scared.

19
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,540
Who are you?

20
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,750
You're okay now. Everything is okay.

21
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,440
I'm here.

22
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,600
Ms. Lee Yeonseo.

23
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,590
This is the place

24
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:59,670
where I'll be

25
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,910
dissipated like smoke...

26
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,530
and dust.

27
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:18,540
Listen up, Angel Dan.

28
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:40,370
"Angels are mere messengers of the deity."

29
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,710
"You were to remain absolutely uninvolved."

30
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,320
"Angel Dan, you often blurred the lines"

31
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,700
"and overstepped your boundaries."

32
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,780
"However, I had hoped that you'd learn"

33
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,620
"to do good."

34
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,280
"Despite my hope,"

35
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,700
"you had gotten yourself involved in human life."

36
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,430
"It is only just to punish the angel"

37
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,060
"by dissipation immediately."

38
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,680
"Therefore, Angel Dan"

39
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,100
"will disappear now."

40
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,030
What are you doing?

41
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,650
I haven't been dissipated?

42
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,240
How?

43
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:55,780
But...

44
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,630
Why?

45
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,659
Starting now,

46
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,770
you won't be Angel Dan.

47
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,720
You will be a human named Kim Dan.

48
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,660
This is the last chance of your last chances.

49
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,010
Transform into a human and execute a special mission.

50
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,530
Hu!

51
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:17,120
There's a flood of prayers thanking for protecting

52
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,710
the animals and people you helped

53
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,070
which was considered insubordination.

54
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:23,280
Should I congratulate you for being insubordinate?

55
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,140
Or should I punish you for creating a big mess?

56
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,610
I have no idea what to do with you, moron.

57
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,730
Thank you.

58
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,760
Thank you so much!

59
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,860
You have 100 days.

60
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,790
And I barely managed to get you those 100 days.

61
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,780
You must successfully do a mission for 100 days

62
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,900
for the door to reopen.

63
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,050
You cannot take more than 100 days.

64
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,330
I'll do whatever it takes.

65
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,130
If you ask me to move a mountain

66
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,600
or switch oceans, it won't be a problem.

67
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,360
If you ask me to get every single feather,

68
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,409
I'll do it.

69
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,830
What's my mission?

70
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,360
Love.

71
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,790
You want me to find love?

72
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,390
For whom?

73
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,340
It's hurting my eyes.

74
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,720
What? A shadow?

75
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,500
I'm sorry.

76
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,250
It's all right.

77
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,400
You're a nice person.

78
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,330
A person?

79
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:32,860
That's right. I'm a human now.

80
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,430
(Gildam Hospital, Room 502)

81
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,060
Love? That's a piece of cake.

82
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,220
I'll find it.

83
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,950
I'll get the whole package with belief and hope.

84
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,790
I got you covered!

85
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,130
Yes.

86
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,700
How is it? Can you see well?

87
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,180
The sunset...

88
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,200
It's pretty, right?

89
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,800
The universe must have given us one

90
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,470
to celebrate regaining of your eyesight.

91
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,520
The sunset glow is very beautiful.

92
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,110
It's very beautiful.

93
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,560
Yeonseo. Yeonseo, hold tight!

94
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,230
What? What's going on?

95
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:43,390
Yeonseo, are you okay? Yeonseo.

96
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,580
Oh, no.

97
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,170
Let's lie down. Please?

98
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,620
But why are you

99
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:01,430
wearing a black outfit?

100
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,250
What about Mr. Jo?

101
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,370
Bring Mr. Jo to me!

102
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,910
She's going completely insane.

103
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,510
Honey, you're being too harsh on the sick girl.

104
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,800
"Too harsh"? Me?

105
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:27,350
Look at how she's treating us.

106
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,860
How could she treat us like this

107
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,490
unless she still looks down on us?

108
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,030
Let's be honest.

109
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,960
We didn't kill Mr. Jo.

110
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:36,850
Did I kill him?

111
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,050
I'm the one who was shocked

112
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,810
by the cornea donation.

113
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:41,830
Honey.

114
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,890
Let's go. We fulfilled our duties.

115
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,740
Go without me.

116
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:49,170
I will stay with Yeonseo today.

117
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:50,320
Will you?

118
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,460
No way.

119
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,350
Come home with us now.

120
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,470
Why stay with her after she humiliated you

121
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,740
like that two days ago?

122
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,950
I can understand her.

123
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,150
This must be confusing and scary for her.

124
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:03,910
The fact that she can see again

125
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,410
and that Mr. Jo passed away.

126
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,450
I would've passed out if I were her.

127
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:12,450
So we should give her time to accept this.

128
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:15,350
I asked the staff to take good care of her.

129
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,630
Don't worry too much.

130
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,680
I don't know how I gave birth to a softie.

131
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:28,030
She takes after me, so she's softhearted.

132
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,410
You should go home first.

133
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,310
I'll stay at the funeral a bit longer.

134
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:35,810
Why? You already paid your respect earlier.

135
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,370
He has no family, you know.

136
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,710
He's too softhearted.

137
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,170
(Gildam Hospital)

138
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:52,400
(Gildam Hospital, Room 502)

139
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,820
Room 502.

140
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,520
I need to see it for myself.

141
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,330
I won't believe it until I see it.

142
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,490
I refuse to believe it.

143
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:20,870
Room 502.

144
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:54,710
What was that?

145
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,240
Goodness.

146
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,250
My gosh.

147
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,620
You're here.

148
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,620
Is alcohol your nemesis or what?

149
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,470
Why are you drinking as if you ought to beat it?

150
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,790
Don't drink too much.

151
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,590
I remember everything so vividly.

152
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,130
That kindhearted man

153
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:33,730
greeted me with a big smile on his face

154
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,140
every time he saw me.

155
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,780
And saying that he can't let me leave empty-handed,

156
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:42,270
he always gave me a ton of fruit and cookies.

157
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,920
My fridge is still filled with those things.

158
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,220
Goodness.

159
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,790
We can't blame anyone. Everyone dies eventually.

160
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:57,540
That kindhearted man did a good deed,

161
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,180
so I'm sure

162
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,420
he's in a good place now.

163
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,800
- Let's remember him. / - Okay.

164
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,930
I'll remember everything,

165
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,050
so you can forget everything now.

166
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:15,090
The scary, cruel things that you experienced

167
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,270
and the times when you were wronged.

168
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,430
Forget everything and rest in peace.

169
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,860
"Wronged"?

170
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,410
What do you mean by that, Mr. Park?

171
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,910
I feel so bad

172
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,980
about what happened with Mr. Jo.

173
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,610
He was used.

174
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,810
She and her dad treated him like their slave,

175
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,390
and he even gave his cornea...

176
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,930
Have you heard that?

177
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,010
It's possible

178
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,950
that someone caused the accident on purpose.

179
00:14:58,130 --> 00:14:59,620
My gosh! That's crazy.

180
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,990
- But who? / - And for what?

181
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:02,390
That I don't know.

182
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,300
But he had gotten all the tests done

183
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,320
and even selected a recipient in advance.

184
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,830
I heard Lee Yeonseo knew about it.

185
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:13,040
- No way. / - That can't be.

186
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,520
Just like how light follows darkness

187
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,860
and how good and evil coexist,

188
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,570
life can't exist

189
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,550
without death.

190
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,310
May he

191
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:07,250
rest in peace.

192
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:51,780
I'm sorry I'm late, Mr. Jo.

193
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,550
I want to see you shine brightly

194
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,380
like you did then

195
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,440
just one more time.

196
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,020
What is she doing?

197
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:08,280
- Is she crazy? / - What's wrong with her?

198
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,819
- She's weird. / - What's with her?

199
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,160
Lee Yeonseo in Room 502

200
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,260
was last seen at the mortuary.

201
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,690
Room 502?

202
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,550
I heard she was smiling at the mortuary.

203
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:01,690
She can't have gone far.

204
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:02,970
I'll look for her.

Lee Yeonseo?

207
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:37,070
Yes, what's the room number?

208
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:38,780
Room 502?

209
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,030
Okay. How did the surgery go?

210
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,880
It went well, right?

211
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,140
All right, thanks.

212
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,510
Where to, miss?

213
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,270
Please

214
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:07,520
take me home.

00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:44,020
You did an excellent job.

220
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,370
Yeonseo, you were...

221
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:53,130
Hey, come here.

222
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,360
All right.

223
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,090
The man I only trust in the world, Seunghwan.

Ta-da!

225
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,270
Yeonseo, when I'm not around,

226
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:03,080
Mr. Jo is like your dad.

227
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,090
Okay?

228
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,980
No way. You're my dad,

229
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,390
and Mr. Jo is Mr. Jo.

230
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:08,710
Really?

231
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,800
He's Mr. Jo, whom I love the most in this world.

232
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,210
Here

233
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,840
I go!

234
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,500
If you give me just a little more time,

235
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:30,090
I will bring you back to your place.

236
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,410
How?

237
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,350
Are you going to give me eyes?

238
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,490
Yeonseo.

239
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:36,030
Bring me back? Where? Who says you can?

240
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,350
Who do you think you are?

241
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,800
If you act like my dad once again,

242
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,050
I will really fire you.

243
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,720
How dare you give me your eyes?

244
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:49,360
Who told you to pass away?

245
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,270
Who told you that you can?

246
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,950
Who said that?

247
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:59,700
Who said you can leave me and go away by yourself?

248
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,870
What is this?

249
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,110
Hu. Open the door, Hu.

250
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,370
You can't do this to me. This is not right.

251
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,560
She smiled like this

252
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,490
at the funeral portrait of the donor

253
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,050
of her corneas!

254
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,980
She was always cold-blooded,

255
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,390
and she isn't normal right now either.

256
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:41,330
How can someone like her love?

257
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,170
I want to change the mission.

258
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,550
Give me a new mission!

259
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:46,910
Hey! Come on!

260
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:09,710
Hello, sir.

261
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,860
Are you here for the morning prayer?

262
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:14,240
Oh, yes. Right.

263
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,340
You look like a homeless person.

264
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,770
Hey.

265
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,070
What?

266
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:31,970
Goodness.

267
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:33,950
My gosh.

268
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:36,500
Humans will die early

269
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,530
if they sleep in a cold place.

270
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:43,670
Are you also here

271
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:46,890
in human figure too? On a special mission?

272
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:49,000
This is a piece of cake with my experience.

273
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,760
Gosh.

274
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,210
I'm jealous.

275
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:53,350
You need all the time that you have.

276
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,720
Why are you sitting here?

277
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,020
I mean,

278
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,710
think of this in a humanistic term.

279
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:03,250
Okay.

280
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,890
There was this person who was ill-natured.

281
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,390
On top of that,

282
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:09,410
she became more vicious because she went blind.

283
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:10,730
One day, she almost died and woke up again,

284
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:11,970
and she could see again.

285
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,080
She must be grateful.

286
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,750
The world must look rosy to her.

287
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,640
You would think so, right? But her donor was a man

288
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,140
who always stood on her side,

289
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,950
someone that she always treated harshly.

290
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:24,590
In that case, how would you feel

291
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,350
as a human?

292
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,380
As a human?

293
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,790
Even so, wouldn't you still be grateful?

294
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,180
- Why? / - It'll drive you crazy.

295
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,070
Humans can go crazy.

296
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,520
I thought about it,

297
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,750
and that must be why she smiled like that.

298
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,600
No. No way.

299
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,230
She's emotionally unavailable.

300
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,200
She's emotionally unavailable

301
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,210
that I can't get her to love.

302
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:49,280
I can't. Impossible. I can't do this.

303
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,170
Then you should give up now

304
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:52,580
and turn to dust.

305
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,970
Why does it have to be her? Why?

306
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:58,080
Why did you have to save her, then?

307
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,180
That's because...

308
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,050
Lastly,

309
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,860
shine brightly.

310
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:15,240
What?

311
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,120
What is this?

312
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,850
Hey, Hu.

313
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:26,940
Hu. Hu?

314
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,350
Young lady.

315
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,600
Young lady.

316
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:53,560
We let Mr. Jo go

317
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,410
this morning.

318
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:58,230
What?

319
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,170
Were you doing this all night long?

320
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,110
Yes.

321
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:07,070
What about your eye drops?

322
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,870
Did you put them in?

323
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,850
Of course, you didn't.

324
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,390
Because I had it.

325
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:16,790
What are you doing?

326
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:18,730
No, what are you doing?

327
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,700
Those are Mr. Jo's eyes.

328
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,250
I don't care if you starve, get sick,

329
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,490
get sleep, or don't get any sleep.

330
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:28,720
That's up to you.

331
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,080
But not your eyes.

332
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,840
You got them from Mr. Jo.

333
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,580
I never asked him for them.

334
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,470
Then you can take them back out.

335
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:48,520
I mean that there is no one who will

336
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,750
let you whine anymore.

337
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,950
You probably don't know,

338
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,590
but Mr. Jo was special to all of us.

339
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:56,170
Not only did he celebrate our birthdays,

340
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:57,930
he even celebrated our families' birthdays.

341
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:00,400
If you got the eyes of someone like him,

342
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,030
then don't let them go to waste.

343
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,350
I ask of you.

344
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:04,490
If you liked him that much,

345
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:06,030
why didn't you treat him better when he was here?

346
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,430
You slacked off because Mr. Jo was here.

347
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:12,850
All the other employees made Mr. Jo do

348
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:14,390
all the tough and tedious work.

349
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,630
And you're getting angry now?

350
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:23,850
Thanks for the speech.

351
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,560
That really resonated in my heart.

352
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:32,170
Have you forgotten?

353
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:35,070
His tough and tedious work was you.

354
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,500
Fine, you can mock me all you want.

355
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,440
That suits you the best.

356
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,250
What's wrong?

357
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:03,050
I can't go.

358
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:09,390
I know this place.

359
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,870
I can see everything.

360
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:15,370
But my legs

361
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:18,500
My legs won't move.

362
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:25,930
A psychological trauma?

363
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,830
People usually suffer from this when they lose

364
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:28,930
someone who was the closest to them.

365
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,950
They cannot do anything

366
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:32,270
that they did with that person.

367
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,950
A husband who lost his wife who played

368
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,450
bowling with her every Sunday

369
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:38,690
has dry heaves when he sees bowling pins,

370
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:40,500
and even has a panic attack.

371
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,520
The closer they were,

372
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,890
the more severe the symptom is.

373
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:45,910
You should get hospitalized again.

374
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:48,110
It only has been days since the accident.

375
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,660
You can see things when you become weak.

376
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,690
I talked to her doctor.

377
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,530
Her inflammation level and leukocyte count

378
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:55,720
all look normal.

379
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,920
She can get discharged and rest at home

380
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,550
to fully recover soon.

381
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,530
So my heart is the problem?

382
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,930
I can't do the things

383
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,750
that I did with him?

384
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:14,910
I did everything with him.

385
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:16,840
I walked, ran, and ate with him.

386
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,210
Everything.

387
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:21,810
And I can't do

388
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:24,940
any of that now?

389
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,650
Although...

390
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:29,820
Although I can see now?

391
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,310
Too fast.

392
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,180
Who are you?

393
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:02,030
You're a 16th note faster.

394
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,450
If you die, get sad,

395
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:06,300
and fall in love before the music,

396
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,760
it's rushed and kills the expectations.

397
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,080
I asked who you were.

398
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,530
Corps de ballet.

399
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:13,730
Your backs aren't straight.

400
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:15,490
Won't you get tensed up?

401
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:18,180
Dancers express their emotions with their backs.

402
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,540
Isn't this basic?

403
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:20,990
One dancer with loose muscles is

404
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:22,880
enough to ruin the whole atmosphere of performance.

405
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,270
- Do you not know that? / - Hey, hey.

406
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,820
Who are you?

407
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,380
"Swan Lake."

408
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:35,250
A happy ending?

409
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:38,460
Is this intended for kids?

410
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,450
I apologize for my late introduction.

411
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:43,610
I'm a newly appointed artistic director.

412
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,930
My name is Ji Kangwoo.

413
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:47,570
Director Ji Kangwoo.

414
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,060
I'm Geum Runa, the associate director.

415
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:55,930
Assemble everyone within 30 minutes.

416
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:57,910
Aren't you tired of doing the same performance

417
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:59,230
for three years?

418
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,550
Your program is stuck in a rut.

419
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:01,780
You only perform these predictable shows

420
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,230
for the sake of your popularity.

421
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,400
Can you call yourself the best ballet company?

422
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,730
Have you watched our show in person?

423
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:12,380
Our dance and music might not be

424
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,010
perfectly synched in a video.

425
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:15,460
Everyone including myself

426
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,360
does our best on the stage.

427
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,420
If that's your best, you're in trouble.

428
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,760
I saw your show in person with my own eyes.

429
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,220
The performance for the 20th anniversary.

430
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,490
You must practice more, Nina.

431
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,250
Even if you split the music into 32nd notes,

432
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:35,920
instead of 16th notes,

433
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,380
I'm confident that I'll stay on the beat.

434
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,520
You're ahead of the music.

435
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,640
I'm sure the critics who are sponsored

436
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,140
by Fantasia never mentioned that.

437
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,280
You should check it now.

438
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,300
Next time.

439
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,240
Right now, I'm discussing the future of Fantasia.

440
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,220
- Play the music. / - This year,

441
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:52,640
we won't be performing "Swan Lake."

442
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:55,420
- What? / - We're not doing that?

443
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,010
- Seriously? / - But we practiced.

444
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:01,000
We've already released the schedule for the year.

445
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,900
We will do a new show on the scheduled date.

446
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,130
Artistic merits, popularity, tradition,

447
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:06,110
and originality. We'll cover all.

448
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,300
This will be a new kind of "Giselle"

449
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,880
no one has ever seen before.

450
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:10,240
- "Giselle"? / - "Giselle"?

451
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:13,320
And the main ballerina for the performance is...

452
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,680
Lee Yeonseo.

453
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,390
Stop, stop.

454
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:25,730
Who gave you the right to change the program

455
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:28,420
and to select the main ballerina?

456
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,970
This is my turf.

457
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:32,550
And only one dancer will be the main ballerina.

458
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:34,400
It's only Geum Nina.

459
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,480
Everyone, why are you just standing there?

460
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,980
You should go and practice.

461
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,180
Come with me.

462
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,960
Come with me.

463
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,910
I told you to come with me!

464
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:49,890
You must practice! You must!

465
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:51,650
Hey, Geum Nina.

466
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:53,500
Shouldn't you at least follow me?

467
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,950
I raised you.

468
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:00,320
Oh, my gosh. Goodness.

469
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,620
Bravo!

470
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,840
What a bold introduction!

471
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:11,760
You should have given me a heads-up.

472
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,870
I was very surprised.

473
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:19,980
Let me introduce him officially.

474
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:23,239
He will join Fantasia as a new member today.

475
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,840
He's Director Ji Kangwoo.

476
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:37,190
I will let this one slide today.

477
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,830
I want you to stop putting on these kinds of

478
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:41,100
rash acts from now on.

479
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:43,389
Well, the situation is very serious.

480
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:48,409
What you said about Lee Yeonseo earlier...

481
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,989
You're not serious, are you?

482
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:51,139
No, I was serious.

483
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:54,219
Let me make myself very clear.

484
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:56,020
I, Choi Yeongja, am the one

485
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,600
who hired you, Director Ji.

486
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,790
Let me make myself very clear too.

487
00:34:58,970 --> 00:34:59,980
The contract dictates that I have

488
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,390
the complete control over

489
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,500
the program and the appointment of dancers.

490
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,100
Only after discussing it with me.

491
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,810
That will be impossible.

492
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:10,500
If ballerinas rest for a day, they feel the effect.

493
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,080
If they rest for two days, their partners feel it.

494
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,140
And if they rest for four days,

495
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,540
the audience will see it.

496
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,700
Yeonseo hasn't danced for three years.

497
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:19,380
She can't do a fouette because she can see now.

498
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,920
I was going to make her do it

499
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,120
even when she was blind.

500
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:24,660
As long as she agrees,

501
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,640
it won't take long for her to get in sharp.

502
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,930
She's truly a talented dancer,

503
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:30,430
so help me persuade her.

504
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:32,980
Her aunt

505
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,050
and her cousin

506
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,560
should do so with all of their hearts.

507
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:45,390
I knew it. You don't want to do it

508
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,800
because your sister will lose her spot.

509
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,860
No. I've made my decision

510
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,670
as the associate director of Fantasia.

511
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,180
I like your ambition, but that won't happen.

512
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,580
If the prima ballerina's position becomes vacant

513
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,680
after overhauling our schedule,

514
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,740
we'll be a laughing stock.

515
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,280
Of course,

516
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,740
you will rightly be held responsible for it.

517
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,160
I understand.

518
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,850
I'll do it myself.

519
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,490
Yeonseo isn't easily persuaded.

520
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,250
It's no fun if she is.

521
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,940
(Baegun-dong, Ivy Mansion)

522
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:31,540
You're here for an interview, right?

523
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:34,670
Yes. I think so.

524
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,960
- Don't breathe loudly. / - What?

525
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,600
I just got fired for breathing too loudly.

526
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:44,570
She's so picky.

527
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:47,470
Hey, are you all right?

528
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:49,580
Yes, I am. Thank you. Goodbye.

529
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,560
- Thank you. / - Sure.

530
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,100
Thank you for your time.

531
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,290
You fired 20 people within 3 hours.

532
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,560
You're impressive indeed.

533
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,370
You know that wasting time isn't how I roll.

534
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:16,860
You should at least test them.

535
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,890
You should try holding their arms and stand up.

536
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:20,690
Can't you tell that they're all duds?

537
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:23,200
No matter how much they resemble him,

538
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,660
no one can be him.

539
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:27,420
The doctor said

540
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:30,280
that it might be better if they had a similar vibe.

541
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:32,400
Some people use

542
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,510
teddy bears to replace the deceased.

543
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,540
Instead of fake teddy bears,

544
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,920
I'd rather have a rude butler like you.

545
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,520
- You're holding / - A grudge? If I did,

546
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,790
I would've made you write an apology.

547
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:45,420
If you keep doing this, you can't hire anyone.

548
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,560
Let's just hire a driver

549
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,750
and a secretary from the current staff.

550
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:49,160
No one applied for the position.

551
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,320
Even with the 200-percent bonus,

552
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,250
no one applied thanks to somebody's temper.

553
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,330
Then, keep looking.

554
00:37:56,330 --> 00:37:58,930
You told me not to waste these eyes.

555
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,620
Hello.

556
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,200
I'm Kim Dan, the interviewee.

557
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:20,490
We just finished with the last interviewee.

558
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,690
I was told

559
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:24,180
to be at Ivy Mansion by 3:00 p.m.

560
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,290
(Kim Dan)

561
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:31,660
You're right. I do have your resume.

562
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,450
Mr. Kim Dan?

563
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:36,460
(Kim Dan)

564
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,870
How could a man in his 20s be here?

565
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,320
What was that guy?

566
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,720
That was upsetting.

567
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,030
Would you like to say anything before we finish?

568
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:57,580
Please hire me.

569
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,260
I like your enthusiasm.

570
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,730
I'll assist the young lady as best I can

571
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:09,460
so that she could shine brightly.

572
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,070
I want to see you

573
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,740
shine brightly

574
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,720
like you did then

575
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,480
just one more time.

576
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,130
What did you just say?

577
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,920
Please. Please be effective.

578
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,920
Shine brightly.

579
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,360
Shine brightly.

580
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:43,250
You'll shine brightly and sparkle.

581
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,260
Stop.

582
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,640
That's enough. Leave.

583
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,440
Did I do something wrong?

584
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,070
If you tell me what I did...

585
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:58,960
Your interview is over, so leave.

586
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,820
I have no place to go if I don't get this job.

587
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:03,360
My dad kicked me out.

588
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,070
And my uncle won't even help.

589
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:07,580
I'm all alone in this harsh world.

590
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:09,250
So what?

591
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:14,890
I was hoping you could help me.

592
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:33,980
I thought she would be dejected,

593
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,430
but she's still cranky.

594
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:37,460
They say you can't fix humans.

595
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:39,000
Gosh, that temper of hers.

596
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:40,760
Excuse me.

597
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,490
I just said that out loud, didn't I?

598
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:53,120
I totally forgot for a second.

599
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,350
Since you already heard it,

600
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:58,490
I'll say one more thing.

601
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:01,350
Be nice, okay?

602
00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:03,950
Be shiny. Be nice!

603
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:11,820
What was that about?

604
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:16,970
Hey! Stop right there!

605
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:18,640
Young Lady!

606
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:21,280
You just

607
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,390
walked on your own, right?

608
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,100
Gosh, I'm in trouble now!

609
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,120
This is crazy. I guess I really am a human now!

610
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:39,060
Should I go back and apologize?

611
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,030
But I don't want to.

612
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,870
Then I'll dissipate. Gosh! I don't want that.

613
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:43,020
Yes.

614
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:44,510
I should go back, apologize to her,

615
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,010
and go to paradise.

616
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,960
Gosh! I don't think I can do this.

617
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,370
- What do I do? / - Mr. Kim Dan!

618
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:51,860
What should I do? I'm so torn!

619
00:41:58,950 --> 00:41:59,960
All right.

620
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,640
Use this phone while on duty.

621
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,740
And put this next to your bed.

622
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,680
Whenever it rings, you must run to Young Lady.

623
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,220
This is an alarm for when she's going out.

624
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,540
When it rings, run to where she is.

625
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,730
This is her baby journal,

626
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:10,780
and this is the critiques of her ballet.

627
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,280
And this is a list of things that she hates,

628
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,990
and this is for the corneal transplant.

629
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,670
And most importantly,

630
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,290
here's your contract.

631
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:23,190
I have to go through all of these things?

632
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:24,600
Yes.

633
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:25,870
By the way,

634
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:27,810
where's your stuff?

635
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:29,530
Is this it?

636
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,350
You must be a terrible son.

637
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:35,030
I guess you got kicked out empty-handed.

638
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:39,870
I will return home eventually.

639
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:43,080
Well, then.

640
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:44,880
Thanks to you, I can call it a day.

641
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,110
Take it easy.

642
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:05,030
I got closer to her.

643
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:07,500
Yes.

644
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,690
Mr. Kim Dan is all moved in now.

645
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:22,680
You may leave, then.

646
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:30,730
The exact opposite of Mr. Jo could be better

647
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:33,370
than someone who is sort of but not quite like him.

648
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:34,600
I don't believe it.

649
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:37,510
The spiel about the teddy bear and so on.

650
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,890
- I don't believe it. / - But earlier, you took...

651
00:43:40,890 --> 00:43:42,260
That was it, though.

652
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:45,120
It's all in my mind anyway,

653
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,660
so I should just overcome it.

654
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,310
I will do it on my own.

655
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:51,720
Then

656
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:54,930
why did you hire Mr. Kim?

657
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:06,680
(Love)

658
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:13,150
What...

659
00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:14,550
What's this sound?

660
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,490
Gosh! Where's it coming from?

661
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:31,230
What can I do for you?

662
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:32,730
You're too slow. You must show up

663
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:34,220
within a minute.

664
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,220
Is it not the right side?

665
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:46,810
I read that you always stand

666
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:49,180
on the right side, so I should offer my left arm.

667
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:53,050
Gosh, don't.

668
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:55,250
Come on.

669
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:57,540
Here, hold my arm.

670
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:15,930
Oh, look at you! You're walking!

671
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:21,430
You don't need to thank me.

672
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:22,750
Since this already happened,

673
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:24,250
you should try to recover quickly.

674
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:25,830
Then you'll feel better,

675
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:27,990
and with the gentle spring breeze...

676
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:28,960
Be quiet.

677
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,130
I hate noise.

678
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:34,150
Just walk.

679
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:38,460
Where are you going?

680
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:53,550
You're so bad at this.

681
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:55,450
Why does a secretary have to learn to do this?

682
00:45:55,450 --> 00:45:56,940
Please teach him well.

683
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:59,190
His bones will break if he and I have a match.

684
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,390
Teach him the pinning technique.

685
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,030
Let go. Let go of me!

686
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:10,050
I'm doomed.

687
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:11,290
There isn't

688
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:13,880
a single ounce of love in this woman.

689
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:16,960
The piano.

690
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:23,430
Get out.

691
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:27,920
The corridor!

692
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:35,750
You call this cleaning?

693
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:38,390
Do better. Clean properly!

694
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:41,160
Were human beings really made

695
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:43,760
into the reflection of the deity?

696
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,490
You can't even add up the calories correctly?

697
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:52,950
I won't eat this.

698
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,640
Then why is she so condescending

699
00:46:55,770 --> 00:46:57,440
and rude?

700
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,980
My, these smell amazing. Smell these flowers.

701
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,410
She doesn't know how to be impressed,

702
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:11,120
and she's incapable of being marveled.

703
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:14,030
There are 198 things on her dislike list.

704
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,430
No one in this mansion loves her.

705
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,450
That includes me.

706
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:25,290
But wait and see.

707
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:27,670
No matter what happens,

708
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:29,820
I'll be sure

709
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,020
to make you fall in love.

710
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:35,300
When I was the only principal dancer here,

711
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:37,540
my dear Geum Nina was my understudy.

712
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,210
In other words, she was my shadow.

713
00:48:40,310 --> 00:48:42,070
You're a 16th note faster.

714
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,720
If you die, get sad,

715
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,840
and fall in love before the music,

716
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:50,560
it's rushed and kills the expectations.

717
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,180
I thought being rushed was your only problem,

718
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:03,590
but you're actually dumb.

719
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,120
Do you want to break your ankle?

720
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:21,010
You know what "next time" means

721
00:49:21,010 --> 00:49:22,680
to ballerinas.

722
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:24,580
"I don't want to see your dance, ever."

723
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:25,850
"You won't make it."

724
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:30,030
You don't want to give me another chance.

725
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,020
You've already made your decision.

726
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:36,590
When I say "next time", I keep my word.

727
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:37,730
I don't sugarcoat things.

728
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,060
I'm back.

729
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,540
(Principal Dancer of Fantasia Ballet Company)

730
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:17,730
(Geum Kichun, Choi Yeongja, Married)

731
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:19,490
(Geum Runa, Associate Director)

732
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,880
(Geum Nina, Principal Dancer)

733
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:27,720
(Lee Yeonseo, regained her eyesight)

734
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:34,890
How's she doing?

735
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:36,690
She still can't walk?

736
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:40,300
She can move around now

737
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:41,710
after she hired a new secretary?

738
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:43,120
Okay.

739
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:50,820
Then should I

740
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:53,100
get started now?

741
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:00,890
Don't worry about it.

742
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:03,710
Yeonseo just got surgery.

743
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:05,820
And she took three years off.

744
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:07,450
It won't be easy for her to return.

745
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,690
That surgery!

746
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:12,680
How did you manage it that she could

747
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:15,100
receive corneas after a car accident?

748
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,830
I had no idea that Mr. Jo designated her

749
00:51:17,830 --> 00:51:19,330
as the receiver.

750
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:21,840
You know that I tried to stop her

751
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,240
from contacting a donor

752
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:24,430
whenever there was one available.

753
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:25,840
The biter is bitten.

754
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:28,220
My gosh.

755
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:29,800
The minister is also giving me pressure

756
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:31,250
with her regaining eyesight.

757
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:34,330
I mean, what if she asks for the foundation

758
00:51:34,950 --> 00:51:37,150
because she can see now?

759
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:39,080
We should give it back. It was originally hers.

760
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,570
You idiot.

761
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:46,120
You can go back to your life in debt

762
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:49,160
and make points to others for a living.

763
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:52,370
But for me? I am not going back to that life.

764
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,030
Did you check?

765
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,590
I'm sure you'll find something.

766
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:05,750
What?

767
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:08,920
His articles are still left behind?

768
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:18,550
Then we should clean it out for her.

769
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:23,790
Hey!

770
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,850
Who's in charge of the garden today?

771
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:36,240
I just stepped on wet petals, slipped,

772
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,260
and almost cracked my head open.

773
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:39,410
Who was in charge?

774
00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:44,160
- You should stop. / - Don't get into this.

775
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:45,660
I'll clean up the garden.

776
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:47,860
I'll pick up every single petal left here.

777
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:48,960
Happy?

778
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,340
You can go back.

779
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:54,980
Do not go back.

780
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:01,850
This is a stretch of your authority.

781
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:03,560
Do you want me to read over the contract?

782
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,500
I haven't signed it yet anyway.

783
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,440
While we're on it, should we look into the laws

784
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,620
on the overuse of power by an employer?

785
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:10,960
I'll go into every single detail on that.

786
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,780
Go back inside. Come on, go back.

787
00:53:15,970 --> 00:53:17,160
Yes, go.

788
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:20,110
You!

789
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:25,700
You hate the sunset, don't you?

790
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:27,760
- What? / - You always

791
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,350
throw a fit during the sunset.

792
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:31,720
What is it? Were you dumped at sunset?

793
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:33,840
Did you see your first love having an affair

794
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,200
under the red sky?

795
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,430
What is it?

796
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:39,070
Yes, the sunset always drives me crazy.

797
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:40,790
I want to burn anyone that I see

798
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:42,370
with the burning sun.

799
00:53:42,370 --> 00:53:43,340
Happy now?

800
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,420
If you know better, why do you do that?

801
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:49,590
You can only get over love with another love.

802
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,050
Why don't you meet someone great

803
00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:54,960
before you go crazier?

804
00:53:56,410 --> 00:53:57,860
There is this saying too.

805
00:53:57,950 --> 00:53:59,710
"Even if we speak with the tongues of angels,"

806
00:53:59,710 --> 00:54:01,070
"even if we gain all the world and its knowledge,"

807
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:02,830
"even if we sacrifice ourselves,"

808
00:54:02,830 --> 00:54:04,060
"without love,"

809
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:05,870
"we have nothing."

810
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:09,920
Come to think about it, I regret

811
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,340
that I didn't ask for your religion in the interview.

812
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:15,860
Make sure this place is spotless.

813
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,630
Excuse me. I'll take this one.

814
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,760
"Tongues of angels"?

815
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:07,290
That crazy cult believer.

816
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:09,620
You're neither a pervert nor a pickpocket.

817
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:11,160
You were a crazy cult believer?

818
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,830
Not everyone behaves like you

819
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:14,550
after experiencing a tragedy.

820
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:17,280
Could it be?

821
00:55:30,610 --> 00:55:33,560
This rain is exactly like Lee Yeonseo.

822
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,190
No matter how much I sweep, this rain is

823
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:36,640
making more petals fall down.

824
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:38,710
In a word, it's useless.

825
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:40,200
It's all in vain.

826
00:55:40,990 --> 00:55:42,010
I mean,

827
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:44,560
she has nothing I can work with.

828
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:47,550
If she likes something, I can start with that.

829
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:50,230
Her soul is like Sodom and Gomorrah.

830
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,310
What? Why are these out?

831
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:13,330
What is this?

832
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:16,190
What's going on?

833
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:18,480
What is this?

834
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:23,810
Gosh.

835
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,520
(Noisy Gong)

836
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:27,060
Darn it.

837
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:30,980
(Kim Dan)

838
00:56:58,700 --> 00:56:59,890
She's gone.

839
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:39,350
Gosh, darn it.

840
00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:42,920
Dismissed. Begone.

841
00:57:43,310 --> 00:57:45,290
My gosh, this is driving me crazy.

842
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:46,830
I need this body fixed in an emergency.

843
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:49,120
This body is malfunctioning.

844
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:50,620
My gosh. Seriously.

845
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:01,840
Lee Yeonseo.

846
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:04,170
Oh, gosh, no.
