1
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:13,200
(Yeon-seo!)

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:17,740
(I clearly remember him waving his hand)

3
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:19,980
(from here.)

4
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,310
(He ran around everywhere screaming)

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,360
(that his girlfriend
suddenly went missing.)

6
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,900
(I wonder if he found her.)

7
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,610
(Wait, was it you?)

8
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:34,850
It wasn't me.

9
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,300
I just collapsed here for a second,
then...

10
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:41,540
(Are you awake?)

11
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,390
How do you feel?

12
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,780
Yeon-seo. Listen carefully.
Yesterday, you...

13
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,030
No, that's not what happened.

14
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,430
She must have been mistaken.
That wasn't me.

15
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:55,930
That's not Kim Dan either.

16
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:57,860
Then...

17
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:20,260
Wait, what's going on?

18
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:28,580
(I didn't save you.)

19
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:37,820
(No one can kill themselves)

20
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,380
(with their eyes covered
and hands tied up.)

21
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,140
What is this?

22
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,080
Goodness, what is this?

23
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,670
Are you okay?

24
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,960
(Look at me, Yeon-seo.)

25
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:58,979
It's me.

26
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,120
She regained her memory.

27
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,980
I knew it was useless to lock away
her memories.

28
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,390
But why did I still do it?

29
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,320
Because I was afraid of what was to come.

30
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,230
Kim Dan, are you...

31
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,450
an angel?

32
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:46,720
Answer me.

33
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,990
You can't lie.

34
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,550
Yes.

35
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:05,680
I'm an angel.

36
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,329
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

37
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,510
It's all my fault.

38
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,350
But hear me out.

39
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,410
No.

40
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:28,340
I don't need to hear it.

41
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,120
-I'm sorry.
-It was your last chance.

42
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,750
I told you that I wanted

43
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,520
to trust you to the end.

44
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,910
That day, I was going to tell you
right here.

45
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,350
Tell you I wasn't human.

46
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,600
That I was an angel with wings.

47
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,150
I was afraid that you'd be disgusted

48
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,829
and afraid of me.

49
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,470
Still, I was going
to tell you the truth. But...

50
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,190
But you couldn't because I was kidnapped?

51
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,430
How was I to tell you
that you had almost died

52
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,100
and that something horrible had happened?

53
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,420
You're making an excuse.

54
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,880
No, I'm trying to explain myself.

55
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,240
You had many chances.

56
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,880
When we first met,
when you started working for me,

57
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,240
when the chandelier fell on me,

58
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:18,320
and when I held onto you
and asked why you couldn't like me.

59
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,829
You should've come clean then.

60
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,720
If I did,

61
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,030
would you have believed me?

62
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,200
Did you think I'd be shocked?

63
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:37,820
What's so great about being an angel?

64
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,370
You should've told me the truth

65
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,470
even if you were

66
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,980
a vampire, a goblin, an alien, or whatnot.

67
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,409
You're the one who doesn't trust me.

68
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,430
And that fact...

69
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,580
The fact that
you don't trust me is infuriating.

70
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,420
-Yeon-seo.
-Don't touch me.

71
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,060
Are you okay?

72
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,080
-It's only a scratch.
-Let me see.

73
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:38,890
What was that?

74
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,040
Are you really...

75
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,380
Are you really...

76
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,220
You said you wouldn't be shocked.

77
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:51,470
How could I not
when a scar just disappeared?

78
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,020
I get it.

79
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,270
You're human.

80
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:01,280
Do understand
even if it's odd or disgusting.

81
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,970
Because no matter
how much you push me away,

82
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,560
I'll be by your side.

83
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:11,050
Are you not giving me a choice?
Aren't you ashamed?

84
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,030
You're still in danger.

85
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:18,310
Someone might harm you again.

86
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,990
Thinking that you may still be in danger

87
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,400
drives me insane!

88
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,850
So,

89
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,100
just understand me.

90
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,180
Don't act like you're doing me a favor.

91
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:32,570
It's an angel's duty
to save someone in danger.

92
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,970
Just leave.

93
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:35,909
I won't.

94
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,110
If you keep doing this,

95
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,130
I'll pretend like you're an invisible man.

96
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,810
You're not even human anyway.

97
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:44,310
Fine! Just think of me
as an annoying ghost.

98
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,730
I'm seriously going to ignore you.

99
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,540
-Fine!
-Fine!

100
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,330
I get that it could be appalling
or disgusting.

101
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,980
But still, as a human,
shouldn't she thank me first?

102
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,270
I saved her from falling off
a tall building.

103
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,510
He is

104
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,200
really an angel.

105
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,880
He really is.

106
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:49,610
I witnessed it with my own eyes.

107
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:53,310
Yet, I still can't believe it.

108
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,330
It's me.

109
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,659
-Don't you dare come in.
-I'm coming in.

110
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,020
Hey!

111
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,490
Are you not going to listen to me?

112
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,160
Just think of me as a ghost.

113
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,320
How can I consider an angel as a ghost?

114
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,760
Do you want me

115
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,230
to spend the night with you?

116
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,010
What? Are you insane?

117
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:21,770
Leave. Leave right now.

118
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,270
Will you be all right being alone?

119
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,720
You said you remembered everything.

120
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,810
That means you remember
what happened on that rooftop.

121
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,490
Don't worry.

122
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,500
I won't ever let you go. I'll protect you.

123
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,690
Okay?

124
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,060
Is that

125
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,310
your mission?

126
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,430
You said you were sent from above.

127
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,120
You said you had to complete your mission.

128
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:02,120
Did the deity really send you here

129
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,940
to save me from danger?

130
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,050
Are you something like

131
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,200
my guardian angel?

132
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,680
Get up. I knew you'd do this again.

133
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:26,100
I knew you'd be beating around the bush.

134
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,780
Where are we going?

135
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:39,610
Sister.

136
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,660
I'd like to meet with the provost.

137
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,440
I'm sorry,
but he's not here at the moment.

138
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,650
How could you bring her here?

139
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,330
She remembered everything!

140
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,650
My gosh, you little...

141
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,960
Do you even transform
to deceive people now?

142
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,940
This is the same smell from last time.

143
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:23,340
Is this smell from above as well?

144
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,080
No! Gosh!

145
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,720
It's so hot in here, right?

146
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:48,950
Why is there light coming in?

147
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,970
So you even set up your headquarters

148
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,530
to deceive people?

149
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,860
Look at you. You are being quite...

150
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,840
Is she always rude?

151
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,600
Right. I think she is.

152
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,790
He was an orphan?

153
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,030
What was it about the birds again?

154
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,290
Is this like an orphanage?

155
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,870
He takes care of birds

156
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,960
and humans who have no place to go.

157
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,470
He said he had a father
but was kicked out.

158
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,980
You know who we call "father" here.

159
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,850
I didn't say that he was an orphan,
per se.

160
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,920
You told me not to look for him
because it wasn't fate.

161
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,680
Your time is up.

162
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,090
Only after time has passed by

163
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,690
will you realize

164
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,280
that this was the end of everything.

165
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,340
Oh, come on!

166
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,100
I wasn't lying.

167
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:41,710
Do you know how heartbroken
and desperate I was that day?

168
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,260
I felt responsible for making him leave,

169
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,240
so I felt awfully guilty and worried.

170
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,660
You're a cult.

171
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,170
A cult?

172
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,590
That is extremely insulting.

173
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,300
I was just like you too.

174
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:03,920
I came here to warn you
to never deceive me again.

175
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,310
You've always been beating around
the bush.

176
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,470
I won't allow that ever again.

177
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,670
Are we clear?

178
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,720
Yes.

179
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,140
-Are we clear on that?
-Yes, we are.

180
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,510
-Yes, yes.
-I understand.

181
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,650
Of course.

182
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,500
So,

183
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,350
what's his mission?

184
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:25,220
I'm sure he must have had a mission
when he was sent to me from up above.

185
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,760
What is it?

186
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:34,110
-You come back here!
-Wait, wait.

187
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,520
No.

188
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,460
-Set me up with whom?
-You got the wrong idea.

189
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,400
How dare you pick my rib? How dare you?

190
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:43,130
At first, I just wanted you
to love anyone.

191
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,320
Anyone?

192
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,810
You must have no conscience!

193
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:48,630
Do you know how diligent and picky
even matchmaking agencies are?

194
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,390
I regretted it right away.

195
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,760
I wished you'd love me
instead of someone...

196
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:57,210
like him. That's what I thought.

197
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,020
There you go again!

198
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,090
Don't try to get your way out
of this once again.

199
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,720
I haven't forgiven you yet.

200
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,330
Unbelievable. He just spits out
what comes to his mind.

201
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,180
Wait up for me.

202
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,270
What is...

203
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,230
your life goal, honey?

204
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,270
Well,

205
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,150
it's to marry off my daughters well,

206
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:01,050
then go back to a rural area with you,

207
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,660
and farm onions and green onions.

208
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,510
That's my life goal.

209
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,940
I'll do all the farming.

210
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,010
I won't let you touch the dirt.

211
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,030
Why are you asking me that now?

212
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,390
What if the seeds you sowed

213
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,770
were poisonous plants?

214
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:25,290
-What?
-What if your cherished plant

215
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:29,030
grows up to be a poisonous mushroom
before you could stop it

216
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,860
and causes all the other plants to die?

217
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,850
I should weed it out

218
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:37,970
before it spreads more.

219
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,400
Mom.

220
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:16,510
Hey, you're up.

221
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,680
Did you have a drink?

222
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,600
Who's that man?

223
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:35,080
What are you talking about?

224
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:36,930
The man who acts like
he's your right hand.

225
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:39,740
When did it start?

226
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,430
Were you involved...

227
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,250
in Mr. Jo's death too?

228
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,790
Pretend you don't know anything.

229
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,530
I'll make you and Ni-na's wishes

230
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,560
come true.

231
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:54,830
No.

232
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,960
Ru-na, listen carefully.

233
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:02,090
From now on, let's say I was behind
everything that you've done so far.

234
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,050
-Mom.
-Everything including the evil, dirty,

235
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:07,940
and horrible deeds.

236
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,140
You don't know anything about this.

237
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,150
I was the one who plotted
and ordered them.

238
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,250
Do you understand me?

239
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:18,020
There's no need.

240
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,970
And from now on,

241
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:26,470
you cannot plot anything
without telling me first.

242
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,000
Promise me.

243
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,620
I promise.

244
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,910
Don't worry.

245
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,420
It's nothing.

246
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:10,819
(Kim Dan)

247
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,630
Are you sleeping?

248
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:22,960
No.

249
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,740
Should I bring you chamomile tea?

250
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:27,579
No.

251
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,150
Yeon-seo.

252
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,110
-Yes?
-I was so upset and heartbroken...

253
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,120
when I let you go to him.

254
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,500
And I thought something was wrong with me.

255
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,880
I won't send you away
to anyone starting now.

256
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,610
I'm sleepy. Let's go to sleep.

257
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,750
Good night.

258
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:31,780
(You must listen to this now.)

259
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,540
(You must listen to this now.)

260
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,890
(You must listen to this now.)

261
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:42,690
(How did you find me?)

262
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,980
(Money can do anything.)

263
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,500
I'm going to stay out of this,
but please just wait a bit.

264
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:51,620
Once the show is over...

265
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:52,990
I'm telling you to be careful.

266
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:54,830
I'm here to tell you that.

267
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,450
Yeon-seo doesn't know anything.

268
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,700
No evidence means
there won't be any punishment.

269
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,770
And only Yeon-seo will suffer from this.

270
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,880
So what then?

271
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:09,130
I plan to give up on everything.

272
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:12,520
We should call it quits
before she finds out.

273
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,500
Bye.

274
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,180
Why did you do that?

275
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,030
Ji-woong is dead.

276
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,880
No, he was murdered.

277
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,870
I need to buy some time.

278
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,250
We must go to the police right now.
What are you saying?

279
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,670
You were kidnapped
and almost fell from a building.

280
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,690
There's no evidence.

281
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:07,300
I checked the surveillance camera,
but it was clean.

282
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,370
You said all
of Mr. Moon's belongings disappeared.

283
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,790
A testimony won't be enough
to bring charges.

284
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,870
We should have a lead for them
to reinvestigate.

285
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,380
Mr. Park has to gather his courage
and make up his mind.

286
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,410
He must be scared. He went off the grid.

287
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,860
How did that happen?

288
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,270
How do you think they found out

289
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,380
that Ji-woong was in Seoul
and that he met with us?

290
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,540
I got my phone checked by a technician.

291
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:30,400
Since it wasn't mine,
that only means it's your phone.

292
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,380
They were wiretapping your phone.

293
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,280
Luckily, they still believe
that Yeon-seo doesn't remember

294
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:37,090
she was kidnapped that day.

295
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,020
I'm sure they're wiretapping his phone.

296
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:40,610
Let's use that to our advantage.

297
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,020
Why are you surprised?

298
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,610
Did you think you'd be safe

299
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,330
if you worked with both sides?

300
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,360
Comforting and coaxing
a faint-hearted person won't work.

301
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,530
We must make him face the harsh reality.

302
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,040
He should know there's no place to hide.

303
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,220
I'm sorry.

304
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,390
All of a sudden?

305
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,280
That was my chance.

306
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,140
When Seung-hwan scolded me...

307
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,060
that I would eventually get
my hands dirty.

308
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,170
I should have stopped then.

309
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,800
Mr. Jo...

310
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,360
knew?

311
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:23,950
Yeon-seo, hold tight.

312
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,740
If you give me just a little more time,

313
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,500
I will bring you back to your place.

314
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,650
Is that why...

315
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,940
you killed him?

316
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,340
No, no. I wasn't behind it.

317
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:37,240
I only did what I was ordered to do.

318
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,690
I didn't know they would hurt him.

319
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,660
Shut your mouth!

320
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,470
I won't give you time to ask
for my forgiveness

321
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,570
or to give me excuses.

322
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,850
Don't you dare say a word

323
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,960
and live in the fiery pit
for the rest of your life.

324
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:52,900
If what happened three years ago
wasn't an accident but an incident,

325
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:55,050
I suspected his car accident
probably wasn't

326
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,120
a mere accident.

327
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,090
But how...

328
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,830
Don't you know what kind of person he was?

329
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,210
He was good-natured and righteous.

330
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,450
How could you hurt someone like him?

331
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,350
Don't use your weakness to turn wicked.

332
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,460
And think hard about how

333
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,660
you can be forgiven, Mr. Park.

334
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:25,900
Let's go.

335
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,250
You two can go.

336
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,680
I'll try to convince Mr. Park
a little more.

337
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,390
Yes.

338
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,500
Are you okay?

339
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,990
I'm completely fine.

340
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,580
You're lying again.

341
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,440
Let's sit down for a bit.

342
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,600
Hey, Angel.

343
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,080
Does the devil

344
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,890
really exist?

345
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:21,870
If angels exist, devils must exist too.

346
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:25,960
I don't think they have horns and tails.

347
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,430
I'm a brat,

348
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:32,470
and I could be annoying, so I understand

349
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,450
if someone would want to kill me.

350
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,870
But not Mr. Jo.

351
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,970
Why must he be sacrificed?

352
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,000
Tell me.

353
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,640
If the deity exists, how can He do this?

354
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:49,500
Both humans and angels

355
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,190
will never know what His will is.

356
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,040
That's so boring and cheap.

357
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:04,810
Can you walk?

358
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,030
I want you

359
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,230
to come with me.

360
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,350
What is this? A fountain?

361
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,930
It's a rainbow.

362
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:09,840
Yeon-seo.

363
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,550
-This is...
-Open it.

364
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,410
(Lee Yeon-seo, Yoo Seong-woo)

365
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:54,060
Why...

366
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,580
do you have this?

367
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:00,700
I gave this to Seong-woo.

368
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:03,610
It's me.

369
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,200
What are you talking about?

370
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:08,090
The kid you met on Yeonhwa Island.

371
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:10,600
I'm that Yoo Seong-woo.

372
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,270
I didn't know that at first too.

373
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:18,650
But I kept on having dreams
ever since I met you.

374
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,940
I began to remember.

375
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,270
Do you remember?

376
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:25,910
The promise I made
on the day you showed me

377
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,150
your rainbow dance.

378
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,190
That you'll become an adult?

379
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:34,320
That I'll make sure I become an adult.

380
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,390
That after I grow up,

381
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,290
I'll protect you.

382
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,360
I think I was sent to you

383
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,530
to keep that promise.

384
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,390
From that bad deity

385
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:53,590
you despised so much.

386
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:58,910
I'll be with you from now on,
so do not worry.

387
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:02,790
I will protect you so that no one

388
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,330
will hurt you.

389
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:11,010
Are you angry?

390
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:15,190
Yeon-seo.

391
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:16,870
Do not follow me.

392
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,640
She's really angry.

393
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:34,330
I know you're angry, dumbfounded,
and shocked.

394
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,330
You can hit me as much as you want

395
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:38,430
until you feel better.

396
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:50,260
Why are you crying?

397
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,130
I had to say goodbye to him again

398
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,650
without realizing that he was with me.

399
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,620
I said goodbye to him,

400
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,980
and I told him not to live in pain
on the other side.

401
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,370
Until the last moment,
even when my final moment came,

402
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:17,800
I thought of you.

403
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:27,180
Don't cry.

404
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,300
I don't want to see you cry

405
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,590
because of me.

406
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:08,760
Then

407
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,040
did you fail your mission?

408
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,970
I don't know yet.

409
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:19,490
You were told to make me love again,

410
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,690
but you fell in love instead.

411
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,450
That means you failed.

412
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,930
Then what will happen to you?

413
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,080
Will you be reprimanded

414
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:31,240
back in paradise?

415
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,330
It's not over yet.

416
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,960
I'm looking for a way.

417
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:38,940
To do what?

418
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:41,270
To stay with you.

419
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:46,240
I'll make sure I find it.

420
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:47,700
Trust me.

421
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:11,810
I have a question.

422
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,050
I was wondering why
you suddenly called me out.

423
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,950
How can I become a human?

424
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:20,520
Let me ask you again. How did you...

425
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:23,770
become a human?

426
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,480
Do you think

427
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,460
I'll tell you that?

428
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:31,650
I thought about it.

429
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:33,850
About why you did it.

430
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,750
You knew it would be meaningless.

431
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:39,610
Projecting a dead person's image
onto Yeon-seo.

432
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:43,310
You would've known that wasn't right.

433
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,370
Shut it.

434
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,090
She isn't someone
you can dare to speak of.

435
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,780
You were in pain.

436
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:58,800
The pain of not being able to see
the one you love.

437
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:04,300
That's why you were obsessive
and determined.

438
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:10,900
That's all the more reason for you
to understand me.

439
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:14,070
Having a desire
may seem tempting at first.

440
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:16,790
But the truth is, it's venomous, stinging,

441
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,130
and extremely painful.

442
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,750
I can endure all that

443
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:26,560
because I was once a human too.

444
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:30,260
-What?
-The day you pushed me

445
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,360
into the water.

446
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,750
That's when I started to remember
who I was.

447
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:37,030
Yeon-seo's first audience

448
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,470
and the boy who watched her dance
for the first time...

449
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,380
was me.

450
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:48,250
I believe it's His providence

451
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,060
that I was sent to her

452
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,770
and that you and I met.

453
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:56,520
I've seen countless fools go down
after jumping to a conclusion

454
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:59,160
thinking certain incidents were
planned out by Him.

455
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,920
You can't become a human.

456
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,260
Even if He allows it,

457
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,680
I won't let it happen.

458
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,400
You're here.

459
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:16,100
(You can't become a human.)

460
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,380
Why not?

461
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:23,140
For that to happen, Yeon-seo must die.

462
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,330
I got some rapeseeds.

463
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,580
I wanted to plant them

464
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,070
as a way of remembering our reunion.

465
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:42,240
But for them to blossom next spring,

466
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:43,600
I need to plant them this fall.

467
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:46,290
So I'm going to prepare their pots
in advance.

468
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,950
"Next spring"?

469
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,790
When fall comes,
let's plant them together.

470
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,830
(Only an angel who has received true love)

471
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:00,320
(can become a human.)

472
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,310
-I'll do it.
-Okay.

473
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:17,180
(Sacrificial love is your ticket)

474
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,990
(to becoming a human.)

475
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,530
-Hi.
-Did you see her?

476
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:02,980
Did you?

477
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,300
She scares me.

478
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:29,949
(Do you think the accident
three years ago...)

479
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,690
(Do you think the accident
three years ago)

480
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,100
(was a coincidence?)

481
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:37,739
(Stop Mom.)

482
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:40,510
-Hello.
-Hello.

483
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,100
Are you really just going to be
my understudy?

484
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:05,150
Yes. I'm only going
to practice Giselle's parts.

485
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:06,600
It's a waste.

486
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:08,360
You've given it your all,

487
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:10,030
yet you're not going to dance on stage?

488
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,270
Mind your own business.

489
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:15,050
Ni-na.

490
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:19,360
The accident three years ago
won't happen again.

491
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:23,060
(That accident)

492
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:25,960
(wasn't a coincidence?)

493
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,870
(Did you know about it as well?)

494
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:32,080
(Are you also one of them?)

495
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,740
What do you mean?

496
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:40,570
If you're expecting it to happen again,

497
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:42,680
it'll be nothing but a pipe dream.

498
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,500
Yeon-seo.

499
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:53,370
May I speak with you?

500
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,640
What is it?

501
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,490
I'm sorry.

502
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,410
I'm sorry. I should've told you sooner.

503
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,680
What are these?

504
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:21,000
Associate Director Geum

505
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,850
handed them out before the audition.

506
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,580
She tried

507
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,780
to bribe you?

508
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:30,420
I'm sorry. I'm going to give it back.

509
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:32,620
I only wore it once.

510
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,520
It seems like she secretly met
with each of us.

511
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:38,120
We agreed to give them all back,

512
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:40,850
but she wanted to come clean to you first.

513
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,530
There's nothing I could've done

514
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,290
even if you accepted the bribes
and voted for Ni-na.

515
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,660
Because that would've meant

516
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,860
my dance wasn't worth more than this.

517
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:53,560
Thank you for telling me.

518
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:55,020
By the way, Jung-eun,

519
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,420
you didn't go to the hospital yet,
did you?

520
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,660
You should.

521
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:04,830
-She's amazing.
-You fool.

522
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:21,060
I believe it's His providence
that I was sent to her.

523
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:24,360
How can I become a human?

524
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,460
Come in.

525
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,110
Do you have a moment?

526
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:45,750
I didn't see you at practice.

527
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:50,450
I didn't want you to feel uncomfortable.

528
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,450
You're the one who seems uncomfortable.

529
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:55,910
That's exactly why I'm here.

530
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:57,760
We'll be seeing more of each other,

531
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:59,170
so we shouldn't be uncomfortable.

532
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,060
I came to give you my answer.

533
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,430
I'm going to turn you down once
and for all

534
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,800
but politely.

535
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:11,130
-I'll wait.
-No, please don't.

536
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,640
I already like someone else.

537
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:14,740
He's not...

538
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,470
even human.

539
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:21,520
How did you know that?

540
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,670
How?

541
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,560
You even told me last time

542
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:30,710
that he was deceiving me.

543
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:36,570
I saw him that day when you fell.

544
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,920
For now, it'll feel like a dream.

545
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:43,560
Having your own guardian angel
must feel wonderful.

546
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:46,770
However, you'll have to wake up
sooner or later.

547
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,360
I'll wait until then.

548
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,560
Even if I wake up from that dream,

549
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:51,830
I won't choose to be with you.

550
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:55,350
You can hate me. I actually hope you will.

551
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:58,210
I hope we never talk about this
ever again.

552
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,890
Please.

553
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,420
You can film now.

554
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:09,700
Okay.

555
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:14,360
How long do you think it'll last?

556
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,180
Don't tell me you thought

557
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:19,770
an angel could stay here forever.

558
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:23,780
-Kim Dan.
-Yes?

559
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:26,330
Don't ever let me go.

560
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,730
I won't.

561
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,080
(Sacrificial love is your ticket)

562
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:52,240
(to becoming a human.)

563
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:56,070
For that to happen, Yeon-seo must die.

564
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,570
No.

565
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,860
No.

566
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:06,460
What is it? Did I look weird?

567
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,620
Do you have to die?

568
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:11,430
Is that the only way?

569
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:13,320
Of course.

570
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,610
Act Two will only begin
after Giselle dies.

571
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,760
That's the only way for her
to save Albrecht.

572
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,420
No. I'm sure he didn't wish for that.

573
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:25,240
Don't become too immersed in it.

574
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,830
It's not like I'm actually dying.

575
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,860
Let me do it again. Make sure I look nice.

576
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:34,840
Okay.

577
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,060
Hu.

578
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,060
Hu!

579
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,720
May I ask who you are?

580
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:03,300
You don't have to put up an act here.

581
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:04,450
I'm here alone.

582
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:08,190
-Pardon?
-There's something I must check.

583
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:11,490
I don't understand.

584
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,870
You're really not Hu?

585
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,280
No, I didn't.

586
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,870
Listen. That wasn't me.

587
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:23,590
Be quiet.

588
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,790
How could a priest do such a thing?

589
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:28,380
If you're going to be a pervert,
take off your gown at least.

590
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:29,750
If you're going to be a priest,

591
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,800
take off the trench coat.

592
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:32,830
Wait, listen.

593
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,610
Fine.

594
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,990
Let's say that I did urinate on the street

595
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,720
because that's probably what you remember.

596
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:44,490
Even so, you cannot lock me up here
for days.

597
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:45,940
Isn't that against your law?

598
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:47,480
You, there. Be quiet.

599
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:48,710
Goodness.

600
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:51,880
-Excuse me.
-Come on, just sit down.

601
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,390
Darn it.

602
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:57,200
Wait. Please wait, officer.

603
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,730
Bring me back to church.

604
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:13,530
Come on, this is driving me crazy.

605
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:18,410
Aren't you being too cruel?

606
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:20,790
It was only once.

607
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:23,600
It happened only once.

608
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:25,890
Must you go this far?

609
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:27,430
If you've done it once,

610
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,010
you're on a fast track to repeat it.

611
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:32,930
Who are you?

612
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,510
The first time is always the hardest.

613
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,230
Once you let things loose,

614
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,470
you won't remember what you let loose.

615
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,380
Don't pout and just do
what they tell you to do.

616
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:43,180
And stop thinking so much.

617
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,250
You'll only make things complicated.

618
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:50,790
Father.

619
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:54,450
Ms. Park Bok-soon, please come on out.

620
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,290
If you eat without paying again,

621
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:57,880
you'll receive a harsher punishment
next time.

622
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:00,170
When did this world become so heartless?

623
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,400
Wait.

624
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:07,210
Are you Father?

625
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:11,650
Do you want to go see Father with me?

626
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,690
Father of soju, Father of beer,
and Father of liquor?

627
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:16,090
Which Father would you like?

628
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:17,330
Come on out now.

629
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:19,350
Why is he so fussy?

630
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,710
Come out now.

631
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,720
Hey, hey.

632
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,090
Hey.

633
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:29,380
Please sit down.

634
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:33,390
Go back to your spot.

635
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:35,760
Goodness.

636
00:43:57,850 --> 00:43:59,830
(Statement)

637
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,940
(My name is Park Gwang-il.
I work at Fantasia.)

638
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:09,860
(Park Gwang-il)

639
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,620
I'm sure it's from Mr. Park.

640
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,520
I think you helped him
make up his mind that day.

641
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:16,060
(Traffic Accident Report)

642
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,050
Then,

643
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,380
shall we get started?

644
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,200
It will be hard to arrest them right away.

645
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,910
It's only circumstantial evidence at best.

646
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,020
We'll check if the statement is true.

647
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:32,260
I hope you can help us.

648
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:34,410
Call me any time
if there's anything you need.

649
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,490
If we start
with the accident three years ago,

650
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:39,340
we will be able to find a connection

651
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:41,140
to Mr. Jo's accident.

652
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:45,060
(Do you think the accident three years ago
was a coincidence?)

653
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:46,160
(Stop Mom.)

654
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,130
There's no way.

655
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:53,510
I'm sure it's a misunderstanding.

656
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:09,220
You don't have practice today?

657
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:10,760
No.

658
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:14,280
Mom.

659
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:17,710
Mom, you love me, don't you?

660
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,840
Of course, I love you. I'm your mom.

661
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:26,730
I need to ask you a question.

662
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:33,150
Honey.

663
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:34,780
Come on out now.

664
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,810
What brings you here?

665
00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:53,430
Yeon-seo, you're here for the first time.

666
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,680
Where is Ru-na?

667
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,140
You just missed her.
She just went out in a hurry.

668
00:45:58,410 --> 00:45:59,420
Come inside.

669
00:46:07,210 --> 00:46:08,130
Sit with me.

670
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:10,770
You too.

671
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:14,290
(Lie low for the time being.)

672
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:17,590
Yeon-seo knows everything.
She's putting on an act.

673
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:18,910
I'm sorry.

674
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:20,630
(I'll need you soon.)

675
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:21,900
(I'll call you soon.)

676
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:23,660
I won't make any mistakes this time.

677
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,290
(It's probably that same man)

678
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:31,630
(who kidnapped me and threatened Mr. Moon)

679
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,470
(three years ago.)

680
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:40,070
Oh, hello.

681
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,810
Nice to see you again.

682
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:48,430
(You foolish one.)

683
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:51,160
(Turn from evil)

684
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:53,050
(and do good.)

685
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:00,530
(Hello? Why aren't you answering me?)

686
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:02,650
(Joon-soo.)

687
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:04,270
(Joon-soo!)

688
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:36,350
(ID: Moon Ji-woong)

689
00:47:57,290 --> 00:48:00,150
"From 2017 to 2019,"

690
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:02,090
"I was instigated"

691
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:03,890
"by the owner of Fantasia Ballet Theater,"

692
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:05,560
"Choi Yeong-ja, to obstruct"

693
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:07,190
"with Lee Yeon-seo's cornea donation."

694
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,740
How did you...

695
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:12,340
"I was instigated"

696
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,450
"by Choi Yeong-ja to plot a scheme to put"

697
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:16,300
"Ballerina Lee Yeon-seo in a predicament"

698
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:17,800
"on Fantasia's Night."

699
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:19,780
"Although the scheme ended in failure,"

700
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:21,360
"I report that"

701
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:24,620
"she deliberately tried
to hurt Ballerina Lee Yeon-seo."

702
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:25,850
Stop it!

703
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:27,260
That's enough.

704
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:31,920
I didn't do it. It's a conspiracy.
It's fabricated.

705
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:35,970
Have you gone mad?

706
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:37,770
Anyone can write some trash like this

707
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:39,000
on a piece of paper.

708
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:40,240
Get out of my house now.

709
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,660
(Why do you need this now?)

710
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:55,590
(It's natural for a general director)

711
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,570
(to be interested in her dancers.)

712
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:00,300
(Every vote
from each dancer is very valuable.)

713
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,370
(Are you planning to buy)

714
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:04,080
their votes for the audition?

715
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:05,980
Why would you choose such a word?

716
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:07,870
I'm just supporting them.

717
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,060
That sounds scary, you know.

718
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:10,730
(What's this?)

719
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:13,370
(Why don't you go to England
and see your kids?)

720
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:14,910
(Three months will be enough, right?)

721
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:16,180
(If I go,)

722
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,820
(will you get rid of me
before anyone finds out?)

723
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:21,110
(Just like Moon Ji-woong three years ago?)

724
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:27,230
Did you

725
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:29,780
buy off the corps' votes?

726
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:37,000
What is this?
I won't let this slide, Mr. Park.

727
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,930
What do you mean? Will you kill him

728
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:42,630
just like Mr. Moon and Mr. Jo?

729
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:51,030
If I could,
I would like to do the same thing to you.

730
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:54,420
I would like to make you beg for your life

731
00:49:55,470 --> 00:49:58,550
like a madwoman in a shattered car
at the edge of a cliff.

732
00:50:01,850 --> 00:50:03,920
But I'm holding myself back
for the sake of Fantasia.

733
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:07,400
I'll give you 24 hours.

734
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:09,250
I want you to resign.

735
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:11,530
I don't want to mar
the reputation of Fantasia

736
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:14,040
by revealing this dirty and nasty story.

737
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:17,210
Don't be stubborn unless you want to be
dragged out with cuffs on

738
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,280
along with your daughter

739
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:20,550
in front of our sponsors.

740
00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:24,430
You must

741
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:27,640
put an end to this yourself.

742
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:36,790
Ending things on a good note is
all that matters.

743
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:40,660
Someone told me that.

744
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:25,230
(Kim Dan)

745
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:30,470
I just came out.

746
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:34,610
I know. I'm looking at you right now.

747
00:51:54,490 --> 00:51:56,470
It was tough to do that alone, wasn't it?

748
00:51:57,090 --> 00:51:58,060
It was fine.

749
00:51:59,070 --> 00:52:01,270
You must've been surprised
because it rained.

750
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,480
I found Mr. Moon's bag.

751
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:06,420
We can take care of everything with that.

752
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,480
Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

753
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:11,260
Yeon-seo, I'm an angel.

754
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:13,810
I wouldn't lose even if there were
hundreds of people like him.

755
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:18,030
(Don't tell me you thought)

756
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,970
(an angel could stay here forever.)

757
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:30,040
Let's stay inside when it rains for life.

758
00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:32,200
It's even better.

759
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:33,920
You only get your feet wet

760
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,460
if you go out on a rainy day.

761
00:52:37,610 --> 00:52:39,640
Let's stay home
and listen to the raindrops

762
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,260
next to each other.

763
00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:43,730
Let's do that.

764
00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:48,050
Stop looking at me.

765
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:52,010
You're up.

766
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,700
I look ugly when I sleep.

767
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:02,000
I'm probably the one
who saw you sleep the most often.

768
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:03,850
Stop it.

769
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:06,360
You're pretty.

770
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:08,430
You look really pretty.

771
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:33,680
I believe it's His providence

772
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:36,010
that I was sent to her

773
00:54:37,990 --> 00:54:39,620
and that you and I met.

774
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:41,470
Even if I wake up from that dream,

775
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:42,790
I won't choose to be with you.

776
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,650
(Ji Kang-woo)

777
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:33,080
Yes, this is Lee Yeon-seo.

778
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:35,020
Come out.

779
00:55:36,070 --> 00:55:37,740
I will not meet you privately.

780
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:40,870
I have something to tell you
about Kim Dan.

781
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:55,210
(Kim Dan)

782
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,270
-Yes.
(-Where are you?)

783
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,480
You weren't in the practice room
or in your room.

784
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:04,670
Where are you?

785
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:07,530
I came out for a walk.

786
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,000
I saw Gu-reum at home. Are you alone?

787
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:11,710
Yes, I had to get something.

788
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:13,080
I'm nearby.

789
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,090
I'll be home soon. Don't worry.

790
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,200
Call me. I'll come and fetch you.

791
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:21,300
(Okay.)

792
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,760
I came to ask you a question too.

793
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:37,630
What did you mean
by what you said last time?

794
00:56:38,070 --> 00:56:40,710
That an angel can't stay here forever?

795
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:42,340
It literally means what I said.

796
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:43,960
What else could it mean?

797
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:47,920
It means

798
00:56:49,330 --> 00:56:50,700
he will go back to paradise.

799
00:56:54,130 --> 00:56:55,180
Why are you laughing?

800
00:56:55,540 --> 00:56:56,460
Then,

801
00:56:57,740 --> 00:56:58,920
will you stop this now?

802
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:02,880
He came as he wanted
and will leave when he wants.

803
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,260
You aren't foolish enough

804
00:57:05,740 --> 00:57:07,550
to be with someone that will be gone.

805
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:09,920
People die too.

806
00:57:11,110 --> 00:57:13,180
No one can stay with you
until the day you die.

807
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:15,070
I know that the best.

808
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:18,150
If we do not have much time left,

809
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:20,530
then I will love him even more

810
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:22,460
so there are no regrets.

811
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:31,220
Who said he'd go back to paradise?
Was it Kim Dan?

812
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:33,200
It must be your speculation

813
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:36,630
because angels can't lie.

814
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,330
I'm sure he didn't say
he returns to paradise.

815
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:43,100
Stop beating around the bush.
What do you mean?

816
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:44,150
He will...

817
00:57:45,390 --> 00:57:46,490
disappear like dust,

818
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:49,650
like powder.

819
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:53,530
Why?

820
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:58,540
-Why?
-Because the deity is very jealous.

821
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:01,890
He doesn't like
what's His being taken away.

822
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:03,160
Kim Dan...

823
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:05,930
will dissipate...

824
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,440
because of your love.

825
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:22,610
(It's not over yet. I'm looking for a way)

826
00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:25,560
(to stay with you.)

827
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:37,880
(Kim Dan...)

828
00:58:39,330 --> 00:58:40,830
(will dissipate...)

829
00:58:41,790 --> 00:58:43,110
(because of your love.)

830
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:52,490
(I make my confession.)

831
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:55,300
(You told me to look at this human,)

832
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:57,680
(but I began to want her.)

833
00:58:58,690 --> 00:59:00,850
(You told me to look into
what's in a human's heart,)

834
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:03,790
(but I keep on looking into my heart.)

835
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:07,530
(And from my heart, my soul...)

836
00:59:08,850 --> 00:59:10,000
(talks to me.)

837
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:13,170
(I have a question to ask You
for the first time.)

838
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:18,490
(Why am I not a human?)

839
00:59:19,550 --> 00:59:21,090
(Why am I on this side)

840
00:59:21,790 --> 00:59:23,290
(when she is on that side?)

841
00:59:35,830 --> 00:59:39,340
(Can we be angels to one another?)

842
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:43,740
(No, if it's possible, I wish to be)

843
00:59:44,670 --> 00:59:46,030
(a human to her.)

844
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:49,860
(I wish to be a human)

845
00:59:49,950 --> 00:59:51,710
(who can embrace her with my warmth.)

846
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,200
Will you be reprimanded

847
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:55,710
back in paradise?

848
00:59:56,370 --> 00:59:57,820
(I wish to be a human)

849
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:01,210
(who can lie and say,
"Everything will be fine.")

850
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:05,080
(I wish to be a human
who can sometimes forget)

851
01:00:05,790 --> 01:00:07,110
(painful memories.)

852
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:10,580
(I wish to be a human who can bleed)

853
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:13,000
(from a knife, so she could blow on it)

854
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,290
(to make it better.)

855
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:19,160
(They may be as fragile as glass, weak,)

856
01:00:19,470 --> 01:00:21,010
(and a mess,)

857
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:25,100
(but I wish to be a human
who can risk one's life)

858
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:27,300
(for love.)

859
01:00:28,230 --> 01:00:29,640
(I wish to risk my life)

860
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:32,100
(to love.)

861
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:34,340
(Is this)

862
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:36,810
(possible?)

863
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:39,710
(I will find a way.)

864
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:42,620
(A way that does not require)

865
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:45,520
(Yeon-seo's sacrifice or her life.)

866
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:50,050
(I will make sure I find a way
to save her.)

867
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:53,400
(Even if it means)

868
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:57,220
(turning my back from You.)

869
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:18,650
What's wrong?

870
01:01:19,270 --> 01:01:20,240
Did you cry?

871
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,290
Why? What's wrong?

872
01:01:36,070 --> 01:01:37,880
Nothing.

873
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:40,030
I just...

874
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:43,330
missed you...

875
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:45,930
so much.

876
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,170
Me too.

877
01:01:52,490 --> 01:01:53,810
I missed you too.

878
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:17,080
(Report)

879
01:02:52,150 --> 01:02:55,360
(Angel's Last Mission: Love)

880
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,690
(With him, I will never pretend like)

881
01:02:57,780 --> 01:02:58,840
(I'm not here when I am,)

882
01:02:58,930 --> 01:03:01,130
(or that I don't like him when I do.)

883
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:02,890
Come out to the living room in 30 minutes.

884
01:03:02,970 --> 01:03:04,070
(We're going on a picnic.)

885
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:05,570
(Just you wait. Watch who'll win.)

886
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:08,690
(I'm going to do everything
I want to do with Kim Dan.)

887
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:12,170
(How did you become a human?)

888
01:03:12,350 --> 01:03:14,720
(Everything will be gone?)

889
01:03:14,810 --> 01:03:16,350
She's crying because of you!

890
01:03:16,610 --> 01:03:18,900
You will also get destroyed like me!

891
01:03:19,610 --> 01:03:22,160
Kim Dan, the weather is
so wonderful today.

892
01:03:22,990 --> 01:03:24,230
Do you want to get married?
