1
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,470
There's a rude princess.

2
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,890
Do it with me right now. Let's dance.

3
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:22,690
-Come on.
-What's with you?

4
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:23,880
What's with you?

5
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,860
And one, two, three.

6
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,560
Oh, gosh. Alcoholic drinks.

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,060
It's the root of all evil.

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,460
Don't come near. I'm so ashamed.

9
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:37,560
Mr. Kim Dan?

10
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,370
You must leave.

11
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,320
Hey, wait.

12
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:48,920
You know me. I'm an employee here.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,190
I heard that you got fired.

14
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,440
Even so, you can't arrest me like this.

15
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,810
We have no choice.
We got a call for housebreaking.

16
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,310
-Let's go.
-Hey, let me go.

17
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,160
You! Lee Yeon-seo!

18
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:00,090
Hey, was it you? Did you do this?

19
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,590
Let's talk. Just five minutes.

20
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,820
No, one minute.

21
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,019
-We'll get rid of him.
-If I must leave, I will,

22
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:06,430
but not like this!

23
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,700
Stop being so loud.

24
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:09,020
One second.

25
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,910
Housebreaking? Reporting me?

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,890
I also know
how determined and hopeless you are.

27
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:16,990
But what?

28
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,450
I was going to walk out of here myself!

29
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,090
I still trusted you.

30
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,590
Although you may not feel like I do,

31
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,440
that you would at least know how I feel.

32
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,330
I thought you would know I came

33
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,039
because I was worried and sorry, you fool.

34
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,110
-You fraud.
-What are you saying?

35
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,259
You nasty rat.

36
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:35,470
You said I was a pervert,
and now I'm a fraud?

37
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,880
You deceived me.

38
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,120
If you tell me the truth now,

39
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,539
I'll skip your dismissal,
filing a damage suit,

40
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,080
the police investigation,
and the prosecution indictment.

41
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:48,310
I was always sincere.

42
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,160
I never lied, not even once.

43
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,770
I'm serious.

44
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,350
We have met before, haven't we?

45
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,070
Before you came for the interview.

46
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,259
When...

47
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,330
I couldn't see.

48
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,590
Answer me. Do not lie.

49
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,790
Kim Dan. Who on earth are you?

50
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,200
Yes?

51
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,360
Why are you doing this to me?

52
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,120
Don't worry about it.

53
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:36,360
I'll make sure I make it happen.

54
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,210
I'll make sure Yeon-seo will...

55
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,980
Mission complete.

56
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,190
I mean,

57
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,230
you shouldn't behave like that

58
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,440
even if you experienced a tragedy.

59
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:55,680
Not everyone behaves like you

60
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,260
after experiencing a tragedy.

61
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,800
If you tell me who was behind this,

62
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,170
I will forgive you.

63
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,620
I think it was an accident.

64
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,810
Why isn't this working?

65
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,400
My gosh, this isn't working.

66
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,690
It can't be.

67
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:20,800
Answer me, Kim Dan.

68
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,000
You already knew me before you came here.

69
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,070
Right.

70
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,220
Under the tree

71
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,020
on that rainy day.

72
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:38,579
Right?

73
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,560
It was a coincidence.

74
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,720
Of course,
he planned everything from the start.

75
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:45,130
You're just doing as you're told?

76
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,640
I was surprised to see that
it was you too.

77
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,040
Who sent you here?

78
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,770
From the above.

79
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,170
So you only do as you're told?

80
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,400
Yeon-seo, it's...

81
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,740
That's why you said
I was your life's goal.

82
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,330
That's why you said
you existed because of me.

83
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,100
I guess you weren't lying.

84
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,160
I thought it could benefit you too.

85
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,100
How so?
Being in a fix for the rest of my life

86
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,899
by scaring me with a broken window?

87
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,120
What are you talking about?

88
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,400
They're pretty stupid too.

89
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,350
How can they send such a stupid spy?

90
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,630
A spy?

91
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,700
You were pretty refreshing, though.

92
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,340
I'm done.

93
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,500
A spy?

94
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,320
Let's go back to that night.

95
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:53,990
What did you use to break the window?

96
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,540
Did you cut off the light beforehand?

97
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:58,480
With a knife? A saw?

98
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,690
Let me be honest with you.

99
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,970
I'm the one who saved her that night.

100
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,640
The window broke,

101
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,580
and glass shards began to rain down.

102
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:11,720
I opened up my...

103
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,610
arms very wide.

104
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,060
So you fabricated that accident

105
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,080
to earn her trust?

106
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,660
Ms. Jung!

107
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,550
Let's not do this.

108
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,360
Let's call him back.

109
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,810
Do I have to explain again?

110
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,350
He deceived me.

111
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,540
He just didn't tell you.

112
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,430
It's not like he lied on purpose.

113
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,840
He answered all of your questions.

114
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,820
If he were to hide it,
he wouldn't have said it.

115
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:44,409
You're suspicious of everyone, aren't you?

116
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,610
Then how do you trust me?

117
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,470
Because you aren't nice to me.

118
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,650
Look at this. What kind of a spy

119
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,720
eats so much chocolate?

120
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,170
My gosh.

121
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,470
And he waited so much for his birthday
like a kid.

122
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,350
He probably had to kill me by that date.

123
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,780
Look at this.

124
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,730
He studied so much about you.

125
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,220
What is this?

126
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:15,040
"Love, dating,"

127
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,800
"feelings, and heart"?

128
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:17,990
(Love)

129
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,090
Love.

130
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,080
Dating.

131
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,180
(Love, Dating)

132
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,390
Heart.

133
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,020
(Love, Dating, Heart)

134
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:29,820
Goodness.

135
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:32,900
No way.

136
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,390
He didn't, did he?

137
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:39,680
What?

138
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:43,900
Falling in love with you at first sight.

139
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,830
He approached you carefully.

140
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,340
He wanted to

141
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,800
breathe the same air as you for a moment,

142
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,000
to cherish that moment.

143
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,450
Nonsense.

144
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,670
He said someone above sent him here.

145
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,780
Yes, someone up there.

146
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,890
It might be destiny.

147
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,790
Do you not want to move in that badly?

148
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,650
You said he hugged you.

149
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,560
He read the contract so meticulously

150
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,360
but broke the clause of physical contact.

151
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,660
That was because the glass broke...

152
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,720
He probably swore to just stay beside you

153
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,160
as your secretary and helper.

154
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,930
But he couldn't control his feelings.

155
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,159
Ms. Jung.

156
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:41,140
Please give that to him.

157
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,760
He said he was kicked out
and had nowhere to go.

158
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:48,010
I wonder where and what he's doing.

159
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,400
For him to have been dragged

160
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,360
to the police station,

161
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,170
he must've been really hurt.

162
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,580
I was always sincere.

163
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:57,380
I never lied, not even once.

164
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,200
You were pretty refreshing, though.

165
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,760
It didn't work.

166
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,630
This isn't your home.

167
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,820
Just for one night.

168
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,580
The police told me to go home, but I had

169
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,900
nowhere to go.

170
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:24,040
I told you not to return

171
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,020
until you've completed your mission.

172
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,500
I'm going to start soon.

173
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,660
I found her rib. Her man.

174
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,059
I just need to link them together.

175
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,380
Then why were you kicked out?

176
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,799
I set the stage for you
and cleaned up after you.

177
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,340
I've done my part.

178
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:40,320
Darn it!

179
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,789
I think my body is the issue.

180
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,580
Are you not like that?

181
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,730
When I hear her criticisms,

182
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,960
my blood pressure skyrockets.

183
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,450
But when I feel closer to her,

184
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:52,860
my face itches.

185
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:53,870
Goodness.

186
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,070
You must be so proud to have gotten fired

187
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,190
after being emotional like a human.

188
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:01,090
I was fired from my job,

189
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,850
but my mission is still ongoing.

190
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,520
I don't have to be beside her

191
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:05,890
when she falls in love, right?

192
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:08,480
Wow, are you going to be
a matchmaker in the dark?

193
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,880
That's nice.

194
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,470
What if I appeared in her dreams?

195
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,960
Don't be startled.

196
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,380
Look. A new world will unfold before you.

197
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,450
Love will blossom

198
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,560
in Yeon-seo's barren heart.

199
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:25,200
Isn't that amazing?

200
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,560
Darn it.

201
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,320
Hu. Hu!

202
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,000
Then at least give me some money!

203
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:36,160
Just ten dollars! Or five dollars!

204
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,570
Come on!

205
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,510
I've been abandoned empty-handed

206
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,580
by both the deity and humans.

207
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,210
What would you like?

208
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:54,330
-Wow, hotdogs!
-Wow, hotdogs!

209
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,150
Go inside first. I'll buy them for you.

210
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,860
-Okay!
-Okay!

211
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,850
-Twenty hotdogs to go.
-Okay.

212
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,090
Here.

213
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:04,930
Hey, did you watch that?

214
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,180
Geum Ni-na's live broadcast is on fire.

215
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,690
You mean Lee Yeon-seo?
She's such a rude wench.

216
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:10,960
She's notorious.

217
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,720
My friend who's in Fantasia told me

218
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:13,690
how awful she was.

219
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,320
She would hit others and make them cry.

220
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:16,990
Why? Her career won't last forever.

221
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,790
But her fortune will.

222
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,470
That's how she got the cornea transplant

223
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,050
and is so obnoxious.

224
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,240
Gosh, I envy her.

225
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,700
Out of all the people you could envy,

226
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,330
you had to envy who's hated by everyone?

227
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,520
I bet she lost her vision

228
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,320
because karma got to her.

229
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,870
-Who is he?
-I'm sorry.

230
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,000
Thank you.

231
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,360
Lee Yeon-seo, that stupid gong.

232
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:38,810
-Goodbye.
-Thank you.

233
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,090
Did you see that?

234
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,890
-Live broadcast?
-My goodness.

235
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,950
"Awful Character"?

236
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,090
"Noise marketer"?

237
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,500
Let's see.

238
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,100
("Ballerina Lee Yeon-seo's
Awful Character")

239
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,680
My gosh.

240
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,220
What are you all doing?

241
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,080
(Can you see her?
This is a surprise party)

242
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,840
(we prepared in secret.)

243
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:58,000
(She can see again.)

244
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,720
(Please give my cousin)

245
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:04,330
(a lot of applause and love.)

246
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,830
There's no hope for a ballet theater

247
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,060
that lacks dignity.

248
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:09,170
(I told you to stop.)

249
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,680
Get ready for practice.

250
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,340
Director Ji.

251
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,620
When will Yeon-seo come?

252
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,870
If she doesn't come,
who will I dance with?

253
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,020
The official announcement for the casting

254
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,120
hasn't been announced yet.

255
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,710
Are you sure she's the lead?

256
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,170
We've never done "Giselle" before.

257
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,280
Until when should we do this
without the lead?

258
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:38,340
You lack skills but are greedy.

259
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,060
You lack the capability,

260
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:41,860
but only blame others.

261
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:43,710
Those who do that...

262
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:47,060
are called punks.

263
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,040
Right?

264
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,560
Mind your own business.

265
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,050
I will bring her here.

266
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,040
We'll begin the practice.

267
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,960
Who told you!

268
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,030
To change the practice song?

269
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,740
I was going to see you anyway.

270
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,240
Excuse me, Associate Director Geum.

271
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:18,560
Let's go to the meeting room.

272
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,190
We're having an emergency board meeting.

273
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:25,070
How could you humiliate us like this?

274
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,460
Were you trying to do noise marketing?

275
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,750
Our ballet theater
doesn't need to stoop that low.

276
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:33,030
-I know.
-Is Yeon-seo returning?

277
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,790
The problem is,

278
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:38,620
Director Ji has yet to persuade her.

279
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,530
-What? Persuade her?
-My gosh.

280
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:42,760
I'm at a loss for words.

281
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,250
What will you do now?

282
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,710
If you're going to use our money,

283
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,070
you'd better do things right!

284
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,490
What are you doing when you can't even

285
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,850
take responsibility for this?

286
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,480
Come up with a solution!

287
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:53,710
What's the plan?

288
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,740
-Tell me!
-What will you do?

289
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,300
I'll bring Lee Yeon-seo.

290
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:03,310
I'll bring her in front of
this entire country.

291
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,460
The ballerina
who lost her sight in an accident,

292
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,790
Lee Yeon-seo,
who's notorious for her temper,

293
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,180
will announce her return
at a press conference.

294
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:13,430
This will turn the tables,

295
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,540
and you'll be able to make money.

296
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,520
It will work.

297
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,520
What if...

298
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,500
you fail?

299
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,870
I'll do whatever you want.

300
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,490
Whether it be children's "Swan Lake"

301
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,680
or something else.

302
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:28,690
-What?
-What?

303
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,670
-Children?
-Children?

304
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,040
What is he saying?

305
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,150
"A press conference"?

306
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,020
Director Ji.

307
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,650
Do a press release about the conference.

308
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,630
Tell them Yeon-seo will appear
in front of them.

309
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,910
What if she refuses?

310
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,050
Let's not make things worse

311
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,330
and just choose Ni-na instead.

312
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,300
Yeon-seo will come.

313
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,730
Also,

314
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,040
don't you dare meddle with my songs

315
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,370
ever again.

316
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,270
It won't work anyway.

317
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,620
That video of Yeon-seo has already spread.

318
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,940
It will work out.

319
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,010
The one who caused it is going to fix it.

320
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:23,960
I want a two-shot.

321
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,020
Of you and Yeon-seo.

322
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:29,680
You two must have the brightest smiles.

323
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,700
If it's possible,

324
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:35,350
I'd like your cheeks to be attached.

325
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,730
You're insane.

326
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,560
Why did you immediately say yes to him?

327
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,950
I can't do it. I'm scared.

328
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,960
Of what?

329
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,240
My goodness!

330
00:14:58,450 --> 00:14:59,460
Hello.

331
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,490
Didn't you come here two days ago?

332
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,980
You're Yeonseo's cousin.

333
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,060
You're her secretary.

334
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,250
Yes.

335
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:10,680
Sir, please help me.

336
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:13,240
-Sorry?
-The cat's being noisy.

337
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,880
What? No, no. Don't put me upfront.

338
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,000
I can't do this!

339
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,660
Don't cry in front of my house.

340
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,800
By the way, why did you run?

341
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,740
What about you?

342
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,910
-I was embarrassed.
-I was embarrassed.

343
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,390
Oh, my.

344
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,810
Running made me...

345
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,180
hungry.

346
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,560
Have some more.

347
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,140
Why aren't you eating any, Ni-na?

348
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,090
Can I call you that?

349
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,330
Sure.

350
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:22,050
Yeon-seo

351
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:26,140
must've been very upset because of me.

352
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,450
She wasn't that upset from the beginning,

353
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:32,080
but I made her furious.

354
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,750
I made her very enraged.

355
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,700
Is that why you got fired?

356
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,870
You seem like a good person.

357
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:44,230
I'm sorry. I can't be of much help to you.

358
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,330
What should I tell Director Ji?

359
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,810
What kind of man is Ji Kang-woo?

360
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,150
Why do you ask?

361
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:04,510
He might date Yeon-seo.

362
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:06,050
I'm just curious.

363
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,050
I'm not sure.

364
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,500
It's strange.

365
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,170
I feel like I can say

366
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,589
hundreds of things about him.

367
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,000
But when I actually try to,

368
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:21,359
I can't seem to say anything.

369
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,130
I don't know if he's a good or bad person.

370
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:26,950
I don't even know if he's kind or mean.

371
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:31,170
But I know one thing for sure.

372
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,130
He's really cool.

373
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,890
He's a really cool guy.

374
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,040
Gu-reum is being discharged today.

375
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,750
Go and pick Gu-reum up in the morning.

376
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,640
The new security company will be here,

377
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,320
make sure to register your fingerprints.

378
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,520
(Letter of Resignation)

379
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:01,930
What's this?

380
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:03,690
These are our letters of resignation.

381
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,920
-What do you want?
-Reinstate managers

382
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:12,140
that were fired
without notice a few days ago.

383
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,680
That's our demand.

384
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,000
Young Lady.

385
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:21,510
If everyone quits this instant,

386
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,840
nothing will get done at Ivy Mansion.

387
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:24,900
Is that so?

388
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,330
Really? My gosh, I'm scared.

389
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,700
As you're all very competent,

390
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,330
I'm sure you'll have other offers.

391
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,320
I'll accept your resignation.

392
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,220
You don't need to transfer duties.

393
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,540
Leave now.

394
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,400
Now.

395
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,650
Now!

396
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,900
I guess yours wasn't included here.

397
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,280
No one can match my salary other than you.

398
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,550
Is that all?

399
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,150
What choice do I have?

400
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,910
No matter how nasty and petty things are,

401
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,620
I'm supposed to bury my resignation letter

402
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,250
deep in my heart as a member of society.

403
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,880
Employees who failed their assignments.

404
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:16,730
Employees who harmed the employer.

405
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,830
I can fire all of them.

406
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,910
Sure. You are one fair employer.

407
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,540
Young Lady,

408
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:25,920
if you try to buy people
like you've been doing,

409
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:28,120
no one will stay by your side.

410
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,570
I have you.

411
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:33,270
My heart is already miles away.

412
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,830
Forget it. I don't need you.

413
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,530
Congratulations.

414
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:26,730
Pardon?

415
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,050
I read that you'll perform soon.

416
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,470
I read the news.

417
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,790
I'm so happy for you.

418
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:38,480
(Lee Yeon-seo will have
a press conference.)

419
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,710
(I'm at the grand theater. Meet me here.)

420
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:09,810
I'm in the lobby.

421
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:51,910
What do you think?

422
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:54,330
The guy doing the pas de deux

423
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,400
is your partner. He's strong too.

424
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,160
His dancing line is delicate too.

425
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,100
Cancel the press conference.

426
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,060
No, I don't want to.

427
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:02,300
Mr. Ji Kang-woo.

428
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,010
Yeon-seo.

429
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,700
Hello, my name is Kang Yi-geon.

430
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,420
Look for another partner.

431
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,660
I don't know what he told you,

432
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,200
but I'll never perform.

433
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,700
-What?
-She looks fine.

434
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,060
Really?

435
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,900
Press conference?

436
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,320
I'll walk there with my stick
and tell them

437
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:31,690
that you planned it

438
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,580
and released
the news-press without my consent.

439
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:38,730
Everyone will find out that you're

440
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:40,620
one lousy artistic director.

441
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,170
Let's do that if that's what you want.

442
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,770
As a matter of fact, they are dying

443
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,410
to have an interview
with a spoiled princess.

444
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,810
People who love to gossip

445
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,220
will have a field day out of you

446
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,330
and bring you down.

447
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,530
Why are you

448
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:13,620
-doing this to me?
-I'm trying to protect you

449
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:15,640
and Fantasia as well.

450
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:17,140
-I won't do it.
-You will do it.

451
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,600
-I told you I won't!
-You made it out.

452
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:22,770
You survived from the verge of death.

453
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:25,100
I believe that you will live a new life.

454
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:28,090
I remember how tightly you grabbed my hand

455
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,380
that day.

456
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:31,790
I see.

457
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,640
That was it.

458
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:42,570
Here's your reward for saving me.

459
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:45,250
Tell me if you need more.
I'll pay you more.

460
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,440
With this,

461
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:49,610
don't use what happened that day
to boss me around.

462
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,360
How long will you run away?

463
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:03,030
-Out of my way.
-The reward?

464
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,880
That isn't nearly enough.

465
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:07,250
To me, your value is more than tens

466
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,280
and hundreds of millions of dollars.

467
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:11,830
Can you pay me that much?

468
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,720
I'll give up then.

469
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:15,880
Thank you for giving me a good price.

470
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,550
But that's too bad.

471
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:20,190
The Lee Yeon-seo you remember is dead.

472
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:22,390
Look at me.

473
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,900
There is no ballerina who has three legs.

474
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,450
So wake up from your dream
and come to your senses.

475
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,320
Here it is.

476
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:39,990
(Fantasia Ballet Theater)

477
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,310
"Ballet Theater."

478
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,090
What's this?

479
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:55,080
One, two, three...

480
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:57,540
One thousand dollars?

481
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:20,640
Get in.

482
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,870
I can't let you go home alone.

483
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,600
They are already dating.

484
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,460
I...

485
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:33,540
It all worked out. It did.

486
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:36,000
I guess they are really fated
to be together.

487
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:39,830
I loathe noises.

488
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,860
Move your car.

489
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,260
Are you Ms. Lee Yeon-seo?

490
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,380
-Pardon?
-This is for you.

491
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,590
What...

492
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:52,030
(Fantasia Cultural Foundation)

494
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:08,350
(Did you get it?)

495
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:12,360
-What's this?
-You didn't open it yet?

496
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,950
Take it out and sign the paper.

497
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:16,140
What is this?

498
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:18,300
Agreement on an extension of
the power of attorney.

499
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:20,760
(The board of directors threw
a fit today.)

500
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,870
The temporary chairman

501
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,280
and the temporary general director

502
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:25,250
were already unstable.

503
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,140
And the owner of the foundation is rude

504
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,610
and hated by everyone.
What are we going to do?

505
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,630

without your secretary.)

507
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,030
The fact that you'll perform

508
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,260
is a huge lie, isn't it?

509
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,980
(They all said they can't let you perform)

510
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,780
(or run the foundation,)

511
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:42,940
so I used this card to let them calm down.

512
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,570
(Sign the paper and send it over.)

513
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:45,800
Who said you can do that?

514
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:46,850
Hey.

515
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,740
Think about how rude you were to me.

516
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:56,490
I don't think
I should be taking your side now.

517
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:59,260
But that's the scary thing about
blood relations.

518
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,160
I already consulted
with the attorneys too.

519
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,230
An extension of the power of attorney

520
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,410
due to a feeble mind and body.

521
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,380
If I am healthy,

522
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:11,010
I won't have to sign that paper, right?

523
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,430
I'm doing this because
no one knows if it'll take

524
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,150
a year or two.

525
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:17,650
(Can you come out to the press conference)

526
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,670
(next week?)

527
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,780
Do you want me to cancel it?

528
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:21,920
I'll do it.

529
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:24,030
(I'll show you.)

530
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:26,410
I'll show you that I'm perfectly fine

531
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:27,900
and normal.

532
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,270
If I can't, I will sign the paper

533
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,590
and have it notarized there too.

534
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:38,380
Princess.

535
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,620
There is no use in putting up a fight.

536
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,320
If your temper could fix you,

537
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:47,040
why would you still need your stick?

538
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,720
(Documents on Cornea Donation)

539
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:04,910
Listen to me.

540
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,160
Do not help me no matter what happens.

541
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,920
Wait right there.

542
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,130
I am the owner of my body.

543
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,230
I am fine.

544
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:20,090
My arms and legs are fine.

545
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,430
And my eyes.

546
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,640
Why can't I do this?

547
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,780
No one will stay by your side.

548
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,540
I think that already happened.

549
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,480
Forget it. I don't need you.

550
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:02,240
Go have a great life.

551
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,570
You jerk.

552
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:08,710
Gosh, it looks so good.

553
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,820
Man, instant noodles are the best.

554
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,630
Man, it's so good.

555
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,840
Hey, are you okay?

556
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,860
Gosh, you shocked me.

557
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:23,580
Are you okay?

558
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:27,140
Why?

559
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,550
Gosh, I almost got even sicker.

560
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,760
Do you plan on wearing that?

561
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:34,310
It's because of the places that you go.

562
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,160
Why don't you go somewhere nice?

563
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,140
Instant noodles aren't
the only food that exists.

564
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:40,740
You should give me a bigger budget, then.

565
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,430
Weren't you broke?

566
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,500
I found some money
like a blessing from above.

567
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,100
Oh, so you kept it for yourself?

568
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,900
Hu, we are angels.

569
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:53,010
Of course, I gave it to the police.

570
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,690
I wanted to borrow

571
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:55,960
30 dollars from the detective,

572
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:57,850
but he just gave it to me
because he felt bad.

573
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:58,910
He was a nice guy.

574
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,850
And you came here with that money?

575
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,300
I wanted to see

576
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,770
some humans.

577
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:11,230
-Here we go!
-Keep it going, Son!

578
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,460
All right, great job.

579
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:14,220
-All right!
-Come here.

580
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,670
-Wait for me.
-Come here!

581
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,080
Yeon-seo

582
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:27,510
probably has never done that, has she?

583
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:36,090
My gosh, man.

584
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,810
Gosh, whatever.

585
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:10,630
Young Lady, have you had breakfast...

586
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,650
I'll do it.

587
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:13,880
I told you to move in.

588
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:16,080
How can I stay in this huge house
by myself?

589
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,280
You can tell Kim Dan to come.

590
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,260
I don't want to hear his name.

591
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,540
Come out for a second.

592
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:23,260
There's someone you should meet.

593
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:33,770
This is why I was late today.

594
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,300
Who is she?

595
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:44,990
The lavender?

596
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,440
I am Gi Bo-ra.

597
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,130
-Why?
-I sent her

598
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,890
to the ballet theater

599
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,650
after she was suddenly fired by you.

600
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,410
On your call?

601
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,480
A kind of re-employment.

602
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,030
A few days ago, she saw something.

603
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,320
I'm not sure if the former

604
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:18,960
security manager
caused the accident on purpose,

605
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:22,040
but I am sure
he has been working as their spy.

606
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,080
I doubt Kim Dan could sleep

607
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,310
because of the unfairness.

608
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,760
Then why?

609
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,740
Why did he...

610
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,410
I'm sure that I'm right.

611
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,700
Falling in love at first sight.

612
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:35,860
You'll tell him to come back, right?

613
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:36,910
No.

614
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,760
Why should I? I don't need him.

615
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:44,650
(His address is the Catholic church.)

616
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:48,610
(Of course,
I know that you will not visit him.)

617
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,210
Gu-reum, we have to go home.

618
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:57,770
Goodness.

619
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:02,910
Wait, no way.

620
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:05,030
Did he come here after he got kicked out?

621
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,270
Why would he come here?

622
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:28,210
(Is it because this is
where we first met?)

623
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,760
Yeon-seo.

624
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:49,690
What is this? Why are you here?

625
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,790
Twice your wage and 100 percent bonus.

626
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,110
What do you think?

627
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,880
You have nowhere to go. Come back.

628
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:00,550
You'll freeze to death if you sleep here.

629
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:06,360
If you die,

630
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:08,390
I know you'll haunt my dream as a ghost.

631
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:17,320
I have to walk without the stick
until next week.

632
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:18,730
I have to walk no matter what.

633
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:19,870
So...

634
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,170
I need you.

635
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,150
Because of the press conference?

636
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:27,700
How did you know?

637
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,200
("World-class Ballerina
Lee Yeon-seo's Return!")

638
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,820
The rumor got around.

639
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,020
You were lying here knowing that?

640
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:35,360
Come on, I was going to be there.

641
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,420
I mean, you need me so desperately.

642
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,180
You're so annoying.

643
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,040
I don't need to be paid twice as much,

644
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,360
and I don't need 100 bonuses.

645
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,440
But I have a condition.

646
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,490
What are you so happy about?

647
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,090
In a few days,

648
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,460
I'll no longer be
a temporary general director.

649
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:07,650
Aren't you happy?

650
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,060
It's for an extension
of the power of attorney.

651
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,380
Won't we still be temporary?

652
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,350
How many times do I need to repeat myself?

653
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,610
A human should be smarter

654
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,340
than an animal.

655
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,710
Ji Kang-woo has set the stage,

656
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,740
and I just need to take control.

657
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:27,580
She just regained her sight.

658
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:29,210
And now, she wants to do ballet again?

659
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:30,620
Whatever happens,

660
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:32,690
she'll never be able to do that.

661
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,860
We will push ahead
with the press conference.

662
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,400
We will release a news article,

663
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,800
claiming that Yeonseo will attend.

664
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:40,300
And when everyone's expecting her...

665
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:43,290
Ta-da!

666
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,580
She will never show up.

667
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:46,940
And you'll use that chance

668
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:49,140
to take over the foundation?

669
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,090
You're 100-percent correct!

670
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:02,610
(Where are you? Let's meet.)

671
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:06,480
(This is Ji Kang-woo. Please call me.)

672
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,120
Again.

673
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,570
Excuse me.

674
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,700
I need to pick my kid up from daycare.

675
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,280
You can leave.

676
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,820
Thank you.

677
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:22,580
Forever.

678
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,220
Let's start over the group dance again.

679
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,390
Music.

680
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:52,850
Are you protesting?

681
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,970
Why aren't you leaving?
You said you had to go.

682
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:55,930
It's okay, sir.

683
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,250
Your breath and balance

684
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,630
are unstable, and you're distracted.

685
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:01,480
Do you still think you're dancing?

686
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:03,190
-Soo-ji.
-Yes?

687
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,220
You can do the press call instead.

688
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:09,790
Then I'll be the understudy.

689
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,300
Says who? I won't allow you!

690
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,590
Start from the beginning.

691
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,010
You better not slack off.

692
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,390
Focus on every single muscle in your body.

693
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:20,530
Get ready.

694
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,790
Music.

695
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,000
You're getting off work late.

696
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:39,450
You too.

697
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,900
Director Ji.

698
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:43,890
Have you eaten yet?

699
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,730
Jung-won returned

700
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:58,280
only six months after giving birth.

701
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,390
She cried every day,

702
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,120
trying to get her body back into shape.

703
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,530
So?

704
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,980
You should reprimand me instead.

705
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,900
It's all my fault anyway.

706
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,360
Had I not uploaded that video

707
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:18,080
and taken a photo with Yeon-seo,

708
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,480
the press conference
would not have been necessary.

709
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:26,440
Are you saying that I bullied an innocent

710
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:28,640
because of Yeon-seo's press conference?

711
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,800
Is that it?

712
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,040
Maybe it's because

713
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:40,520
she's only been a soloist,
but Jung-won isn't

714
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:42,500
in harmony with the others.

715
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,880
When Lee Yeon-seo returns,

716
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,960
I want to present her with a perfect team.

717
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:54,250
I don't need the two-shot.

718
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,890
Because Yeon-seo will show up.

719
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,410
Yes. She will.

720
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,880
No matter how much she denies it,

721
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:05,290
she can never give up on ballet.

722
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,990
And how are you so certain?

723
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:12,240
Every time she scolded her team,

724
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,850
she'd say that our talents were
given from above.

725
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,020
She'd tell us to give it our all

726
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,870
so we wouldn't be an embarrassment

727
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,940
to those who couldn't be here.

728
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,150
That's something our ballet teacher

729
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,860
from when we were young always said.

730
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,140
She was taught well from the beginning.

731
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:36,490
Yeon-seo will return confidently.

732
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,690
And when that time comes,

733
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,230
I'll put up a good fight.

734
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,500
Then concentrate.

735
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,410
You have no time to focus on others.

736
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:48,720
You're right.

737
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:50,430
I don't know why...

738
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,870
I keep getting distracted.

739
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:57,340
You're still a long way
from being selfish.

740
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:04,250
(Geum Ni-na, Lee Yeon-seo)

741
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,540
But that's too bad.

742
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,830
The Lee Yeon-seo you remember is dead.

743
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:12,260
Are you going to keep lecturing me?

744
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,730
I know better than anyone in the world

745
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:18,330
how much of a hot mess I am.

746
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:21,410
Sometimes, you need to push yourself

747
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,910
so you can go farther.

748
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:25,110
When you're going through difficulties,

749
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,380
what you really need is

750
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:28,100
a sweet piece of chocolate,

751
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:30,210
rather than a harsh whiplash.

752
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,790
Okay?

753
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:43,630
Hello, this is Ji Kang-woo.

754
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,440
Ta-da.

755
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:54,540
What is that?

756
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:56,390
I'm going to teach you how to take steps.

757
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,530
You know how babies toddle?

758
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:58,990
One step, two steps.

759
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:00,790
Has this been proven to be effective?

760
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:03,340
-No.
-My gosh.

761
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:05,670
Still, let's try this.

762
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,260
You talked big to her.

763
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:09,680
I'm not going to humiliate you.

764
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,060
Good.

765
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:22,970
Okay. Now...

766
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,220
Here. Hold onto me.

767
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,370
You can do it.

768
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,920
You're doing well. Great.

769
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:39,240
Good job. Now, just grab my pinky.

770
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:40,870
You can do it.

771
00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:12,110
All right. Come to me.

772
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:30,460
Just look at me.

773
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:33,630
Imagine that it's just...

774
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,580
you and me in this world.

775
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:41,060
Okay?

776
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,960
Oh, no.

777
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:57,520
He shouldn't fall for me.

778
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,110
All right, come on.

779
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,180
-Gosh.
-Darn it.

780
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:27,660
You didn't run over to me back there.

781
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:29,110
It's dangerous here.

782
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:32,980
Hey. You have a hole.

783
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:37,070
-Mind your own business.
-Okay.

784
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,300
They're kissing!

785
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:47,460
Kiss!

786
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:48,870
Hey, we're...

787
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,240
Hey, do you know me?

788
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:52,960
Go to your mom.

789
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:00,570
Kiss? Kiss?

790
00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:01,930
Kiss...

791
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:07,610
No, it's not like that.

792
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:09,190
Get away from me.

793
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,600
Don't embarrass me by saying

794
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:11,970
what's on your mind.

795
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:14,430
I have a wish.

796
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:17,250
Already?

797
00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:19,970
But I have a condition.

798
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:24,640
Grant me three wishes.

799
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:28,770
You should grant them
without saying a word.

800
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:29,960
What if you're asking

801
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:32,070
for my entire fortune or my life?

802
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,790
What do you take me for?

803
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,030
My wishes will benefit you.

804
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:40,130
Will you do it or not?

805
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:42,940
Yes. Here's my first wish.

806
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:47,650
If it's something weird, you're dead meat.

807
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:50,030
We're going to be late. Let's hurry.

808
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,870
-Where?
-To pray for my wish.

809
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:53,940
Your first wish is

810
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:55,830
to pray for it?

811
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:57,110
Yes.

812
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:02,520
(Dopyeong Temple's
Floating Lantern Festival)

813
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:05,200
I thought you believed
in some other deity.

814
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,230
You said something about
the deity up above

815
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,160
and how foolish we are
in his eyes or something.

816
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:14,220
We're the world. The deity loves everyone.

817
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,260
Let's go.

818
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:26,590
Making a wish is so useless.

819
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:29,010
Your life is
the epitome of a lack of virtues.

820
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:31,300
You need to beg for blessings.

821
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,240
Why do you think I went blind
if that worked?

822
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:36,400
You have no faith.

823
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:37,850
Let's go.

824
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:40,450
Hello.

825
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:42,470
Hello. What brings you here?

826
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,360
We'll make a wish on the floating lantern.

827
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:45,420
What about you?

828
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:48,020
I came here to say hello to my friend.

829
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:49,780
My friend was put here 15 years ago.

830
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:51,010
It's my friend's anniversary.

831
00:46:51,490 --> 00:46:53,210
Last call for the floating lanterns.

832
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:54,920
We have two left.

833
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:57,560
Bye.

834
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:59,590
-Bye.
-Do you want to join us?

835
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,420
This is a good thing.

836
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:05,840
Excuse me. These two will go in now.

837
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,560
Hey, you didn't even ask Mr. Ji
if he wanted to.

838
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:10,280
I'd love to.

839
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:46,670
You're not going to write one?

840
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:50,630
I don't know what to write.

841
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:53,180
I don't have any wishes.

842
00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:55,950
In that case, write the most common wish.

843
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:59,820
Make a wish to be happy.

844
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:01,670
Did you write down

845
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:03,780
the same wish?

846
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:20,370
You'll help me?

847
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:22,700
Yes. Tell me whenever you need my help.

848
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:23,930
I'll do my best.

849
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:25,610
I'd be grateful if you can. I promise

850
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:27,280
to reward you.

851
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:29,040
No. I don't need compensation.

852
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:31,330
Just make sure
Yeon-seo gets her spot back.

853
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:35,150
When that happens, it will be only natural

854
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,000
for you two to spend time together.

855
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:39,070
A temple?

856
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:41,450
I prefer not to go there.

857
00:48:41,530 --> 00:48:43,380
There's a floating lantern festival
that day.

858
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:44,830
Come out to make a wish

859
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:46,510
before the important day.

860
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:49,410
-Gosh.
-You said you'd help me.

861
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:51,130
Yeon-seo isn't answering my calls

862
00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:52,530
and ignoring my messages.

863
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,600
We have to fake a coincidence.

864
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:59,050
Floating the lanterns will begin shortly.

865
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:01,600
Everyone, please come to Tusita now.

866
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:04,410
-Let's hurry.
-Wait.

867
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:06,130
My shoes.

868
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:09,610
Hold on. I put them here.

869
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:11,320
Hold on a second.

870
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:17,570
What?

871
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:20,560
They're gone. You wore those
every day during your practice.

872
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:25,970
I bet someone stole them.

873
00:49:26,190 --> 00:49:27,780
Someone probably mistook and took them.

874
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:30,150
There should be a pair of shoes here,
but there aren't any.

875
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,880
I'm sure someone took them on purpose.

876
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:35,120
What should I do?

877
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:38,420
Stolen or not,
that person probably didn't get that far.

878
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:40,320
I'll go get them. Wait here.

879
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:46,430
Let me inform you again.

880
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:49,560
Floating the lanterns will begin
in ten minutes.

881
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:51,140
Please hurry.

882
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:54,260
All right. Get on my back.

883
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:56,510
That's okay.
I'm sure Kim Dan will find my shoes.

884
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:00,470
If we miss the time,
this will be pointless.

885
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:03,420
Whatever it is,
you must do it at the right time.

886
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:05,040
Come on.

887
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,290
Loosen up. It's harder on me

888
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:34,660
when your body is so tense.

889
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:36,720
I want to come down. Put me down.

890
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:38,350
Hang in there. We're almost there.

891
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:24,590
The press conference.

892
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:27,190
Tell me if you're not ready for it.

893
00:51:27,450 --> 00:51:28,550
You don't have to do it.

894
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:31,060
And the show too.

895
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,580
I'll postpone the show
until you're okay with it.

896
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:37,050
I'm sorry about that day.

897
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:40,520
But I want you to understand
this one thing.

898
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:44,040
The life you're giving up on could be...

899
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:46,990
a dream that someone else

900
00:51:47,650 --> 00:51:49,060
desperately wanted.

901
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:52,930
Is that someone else

902
00:51:54,430 --> 00:51:56,140
the friend you came to see?

903
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:10,000
What's taking him so long?

904
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:26,770
-Where are you?
-Where are you?

905
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:27,950
Why aren't you coming?

906
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:30,510
I'm near the river.

907
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:31,870
And there's a big rock too.

908
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,230
I found your shoes.

909
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:34,290
I'll head over there,

910
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:35,430
so float your wish-lantern.

911
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:41,810
Shall we?

912
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:00,470
Just make this promise to me.

913
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:02,760
Anything. Tell me.

914
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:04,870
Promise me that whatever you do,

915
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,800
you will do it for her happiness.

916
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:08,560
Her happiness?

917
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:09,840
That's too abstract.

918
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:11,780
Promise me. Now.

919
00:53:34,390 --> 00:53:36,370
Help her find her true love.

920
00:53:37,690 --> 00:53:39,410
I ask that her true love

921
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:41,120
is someone

922
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:43,370
more angelic than a real angel.

923
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:13,160
(Press Conference
for Lee Yeonseo's Return)

924
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:19,230
What are you doing?

925
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:20,860
We were to take out Lee Yeon-seo's name

926
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:22,790
and do a press call
for this year's performance.

927
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,020
I'm sorry.

928
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,490
I was informed that
she promised to be here.

929
00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:28,510
The board was informed as such.

930
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,610
I was told to push ahead.

931
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,500
No, I'm sure it was just the chairman.

932
00:54:31,590 --> 00:54:32,960
Or it was the general director.

933
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:34,320
That's correct.

934
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:37,660
I told her not to cancel it.

935
00:54:38,370 --> 00:54:39,560
From what I remember,

936
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:41,580
you've been dying to work with Yeon-seo.

937
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:43,820
I don't see a problem here.

938
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:03,490

(Lee Yeonseo)

942
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:27,950
I'm sorry.

943
00:55:28,090 --> 00:55:31,080
Unfortunately, Ms. Lee Yeon-seo

944
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:34,290
is suffering from
a very severe mental condition.

945
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:35,570
I heard that she just arrived.

946
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:36,930
-What?
-She's here?

947
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:43,620
-It's Lee Yeon-seo.
-Lee Yeon-seo is here.

948
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:44,810
It's really her.

949
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:05,660
I told you that I'll show you.

950
00:56:20,670 --> 00:56:21,900
When did you get here?

951
00:56:32,550 --> 00:56:33,870
Hello.

952
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:36,810
I am Ballerina Lee Yeon-seo.

953
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:40,820
A dancer
is someone who speaks with their body.

954
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,280
I do not think I need to say a lot.

955
00:56:43,850 --> 00:56:45,350
I regained my sight,

956
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:48,560
and nothing is wrong
with my body and mind.

957
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,410
I will speak to you in more detail

958
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:53,660
with my dance on my return performance.

959
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,810
-Congratulations.
-Yes, thank you.

960
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,700
-Have a safe trip back.
-Goodbye.

961
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:09,500
Go.

962
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:15,620
You have always been fine, haven't you?

963
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,350
You did this to make a fool of me,
didn't you?

964
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:20,060
You are my legal representative as of now,

965
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:21,080
aren't you?

966
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,540
Why do you ask?

967
00:57:23,630 --> 00:57:24,820
Let me retract that first.

968
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:25,960
Please retract that.

969
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:29,170
Can you organize the management state

970
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:31,150
of the foundation and give it to me,
Ru-na?

971
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:34,190
Would you know a thing about it?

972
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,550
Then you can

973
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:37,310
make it look easy and accurate.

974
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:41,180
Are you saying

975
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:43,380
that you want to claim Fantasia again?

976
00:57:43,470 --> 00:57:46,160
"Again"? No. You're giving it back to me.

977
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:49,720
Fantasia is mine to begin with.

978
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,620
Please take care of it in a hurry.

979
00:57:58,170 --> 00:57:59,180
Hey.

980
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:02,300
I got a call from Mr. Ji Kang-woo.

981
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:03,800
They're going to go ahead
with the press conference.

982
00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:06,220
Should I go
and put footstep stickers there?

983
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:08,160
Or you can just go with me...

984
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,300
I have to go alone.

985
00:58:09,830 --> 00:58:12,120
If I don't,
they will do anything to cavil at me.

986
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:14,450
Even so. It's not perfect yet.

987
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:15,590
I can do it.

988
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:17,400
But give that to me.

989
00:58:18,850 --> 00:58:20,040
The handkerchief.

990
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:22,460
The one that
you wrapped around my wrist before.

991
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,000
The one that you put a spell on.

992
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:25,750
I'll think of that as you.

993
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,160
Great job!

994
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:40,890
Great job, Yeon-seo. I'm so proud of you.

995
00:58:41,370 --> 00:58:42,250
Let's celebrate.

996
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:44,630
It's not a drink,
but it kind of feels like it.

997
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,500
Why? Are you feeling ill?

998
00:58:58,840 --> 00:58:59,770
Was that too straining?

999
00:58:59,850 --> 00:59:01,480
Thanks, Kim Dan.

1000
00:59:04,690 --> 00:59:05,790
It's all thanks to you.

1001
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:10,280
Thank you. I mean it.

1002
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:24,670
You did this.

1003
00:59:25,370 --> 00:59:26,390
Great job.

1004
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,370
You've done so well.

1005
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:35,320
Cheers?

(We're at the outdoor stage.
Come quickly.)

1007
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:51,770
Two.

1008
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:54,110
Three.

1009
00:59:57,850 --> 00:59:59,250
You're doing so well now.

1010
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:04,010
You really

1011
01:00:04,890 --> 01:00:06,470
don't need me anymore.

1012
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:10,520
You're right.

1013
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:14,560
So this is it.

1014
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:16,850
I run out of things to do

1015
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:18,080
as you get better...

1016
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:21,430
and become happier.

1017
01:00:26,270 --> 01:00:29,170
Hey, Noisy Gong. Walk around freely now.

1018
01:00:29,570 --> 01:00:32,160
Go dance and lose your temper too.

1019
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:33,400
Is that your wish?

1020
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:34,670
Of course not.

1021
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:37,620
I only have two left. I have to save them.

1022
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:41,360
I know what your wishes are.

1023
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:44,400
How do you know?

1024
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:45,760
Close your eyes.

1025
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:50,200
-Why?
-I will grant your wish.

1026
01:00:50,420 --> 01:00:51,830
Come on, before I change my mind.

1027
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:54,780
I think you are completely off.

1028
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:56,360
There is no way you would know.

1029
01:00:57,730 --> 01:00:58,780
Okay.

1030
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:18,450
What are you doing...

1031
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:23,860
I was going to reward you on your cheek...

1032
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:26,770
Why did you turn your face?

1033
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:07,250
No, please. Please.

1034
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:09,010
Please.

1035
01:03:01,890 --> 01:03:05,370
(Angel's Last Mission: Love)

1036
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:08,230
(Yeon-seo is just a client.)

1037
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:10,210
After I make Yeon-seo fall in love,

1038
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:13,110
I will go back up there no matter what.

1039
01:03:15,450 --> 01:03:17,910
A kiss is just a common thing to him,

1040
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:19,760
(so he can pretend like it didn't happen?)

1041
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:21,870
Yeon-seo, pull yourself together.

1042
01:03:23,890 --> 01:03:24,910
Goodness.

1043
01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:27,900
(Fantasia's Night will be held
in two weeks.)

1044
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:32,390
I thought you liked me.

1045
01:03:33,090 --> 01:03:34,320
Did you like me?
