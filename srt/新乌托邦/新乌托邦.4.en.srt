LECTURE HALL

2
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:10,988
Young-joo, I have something to tell you.

3
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:15,993
I've had a crush on you for a while now
and given it a lot of thought.

4
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:16,994
And...

5
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,871
What was my next line?

6
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:19,830
Anyway.

7
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:23,918
Will you go out with me, Kang Young-joo?

8
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,295
Who does he think he is?

9
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:28,214
Don't do it. Turn him down.

10
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:29,465
Tell him no.

11
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:31,717
-Don't do it.
-Reject him.

12
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:35,054
-Turn him down.
-Say no.

13
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:37,640
-Don't do it, Young-joo.
-Please say no.

14
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:40,267
What's going on? What's with this vibe?

15
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,231
What's he doing down there?

16
00:01:45,648 --> 00:01:47,441
He's asking Young-joo out.

17
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:50,027
-Young-joo?
-Here we go again.

18
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,363
-He can't ask Young-joo out.
-Why not?

19
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:55,407
-Why do you even care?
-None of your business.

20
00:01:57,368 --> 00:01:58,744
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:01,789
I'm not looking for a relationship
at the moment.

22
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:09,255
Move!

23
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,139
Why is everyone so obsessed with her?

24
00:02:20,683 --> 00:02:22,977
What a bunch of fools.

25
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:26,105
You'll work in pairs
for the next presentation,

26
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:27,648
which will be in three weeks.

27
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:33,445
Use the rest of this lecture to pair up
with someone you'd like to work with.

28
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:35,114
Make sure you're well-prepared.

29
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:36,991
-Yes, sir.
-That's all for today.

30
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:40,035
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you, sir.

31
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:52,423
So, when do you want to do this?

32
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:56,719
I should lock you up
and beat some sense into you.

33
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:57,803
Tell me when you're free.

34
00:02:57,887 --> 00:02:59,805
-I'm free that entire week.
-Anytime next week?

35
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:01,515
Yes. Wait, I can't do Wednesday.

36
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,434
-Hey, Jae-yoon.
-What?

37
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,315
Do you want to pair up with me?

38
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:11,191
With you?

39
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:15,613
Well...

40
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,365
I already agreed to be his partner.

41
00:03:18,449 --> 00:03:20,492
Oh, I see.

42
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:21,911
Okay.

43
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:24,121
-I'll be your partner. I can ditch him.
-What?

44
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,581
Are you fucking kidding me?

45
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,750
-It's fine. I'll just cut ties with him.
-Hey.

46
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:28,751
What do you say?

47
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:31,795
Okay. Thanks, Hyeon-su.

48
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,464
I'll text you later.

49
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:34,506
Okay.

50
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:36,926
I'll text you back.

51
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:40,429
You're going to pull this crap?

52
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:42,681
Seriously?

53
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:49,480
You're tossing out ten years of friendship
over some girl?

54
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:51,482
You scumbag.

55
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:54,735
She's not just some girl.
She's the Goddess of Engineering.

56
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,278
"She's the Goddess of Engineering."

57
00:03:56,362 --> 00:03:58,572
That's why I'm treating you to a meal.

58
00:03:58,656 --> 00:03:59,823
Moron.

59
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:03,327
But why did she ask you?

60
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,162
HANKUK UNIVERSITY
MECHANICAL ENGINEERING

61
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,455
What's that supposed to mean?

62
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,208
Don't you find it a little strange?

63
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:12,586
Why did she try to pair up with you?

64
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:14,380
Isn't it obvious?

65
00:04:14,797 --> 00:04:18,175
I'm handsome,
and I've got the charm to back it up.

66
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,427
That's bullshit.

67
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:21,971
I just don't get it.

68
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:23,222
Hey.

69
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,349
What the...

70
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:26,976
Unbelievable.

71
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,980
-So why didn't you say yes?
-Why would I?

72
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:32,272
Why would you turn her down?

73
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:34,608
She's the most popular girl
in our department.

74
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:36,610
I don't think she's pretty.

75
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:40,197
-You don't think she's pretty?
-No, not at all.

76
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,658
-She's not charming, either.
-Get your eyes checked.

77
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:45,077
-All-boys schools messed you up.
-Watch it!

78
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,620
-You poor virgin.
-You punk!

79
00:04:46,704 --> 00:04:47,538
What, punk?

80
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:50,207
I've been with a girl.

81
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,333
No, you haven't.

82
00:04:51,417 --> 00:04:53,293
-I've dated before.
-When?

83
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:54,461
In elementary school.

84
00:04:54,545 --> 00:04:56,088
That doesn't count, man.

85
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:00,426
You scared me.

86
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:02,052
What are you doing here?

87
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:04,930
Am I not allowed to be here?

88
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:09,977
This place is open
to all mechanical engineering students.

89
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:17,985
Don't talk about people
behind their backs.

90
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:19,820
Speak for yourself.

91
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:21,655
Young-joo, I'll text you!

92
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,241
Do you think she heard us?

93
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,412
You crossed the line this time.

94
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,456
-I did?
-Yes.

95
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:31,540
What did I do?

96
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:42,634
-Good to have you on board.
-Thank you.

97
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:44,762
-Make sure you work hard.
-I will.

98
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,680
She'll show you the ropes.

99
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,042
Hey, Jae-yoon.

100
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:18,337
What? You two know each other?

101
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:20,756
{\an8}That's great news.

102
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:22,633
{\an8}Get him up to speed, okay?

103
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:25,886
{\an8}Don't worry, boss.
I'll give him some hardcore training.

104
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:27,638
You've got this.

105
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,515
I've got this, boss.

106
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:33,143
Welcome, Jae-yoon.

107
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,562
First time working in an ice cream shop?

108
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:40,943
I may be ugly and lack charm,

109
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:43,529
but I'll go above and beyond to train you.

110
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:53,122
She heard everything.

111
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:56,375
Every last bit.

112
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,340
-Did you see what I sent you?
<i>-I can't believe it.</i>

113
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,633
<i>Is this for real?</i>

114
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,760
-Isn't it ridiculous?
<i>-It really is.</i>

115
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:09,513
I couldn't believe what I was hearing.

116
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:13,475
My looks have never let me down
for the past 22 years.

117
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:15,686
But he thinks I'm ugly.

118
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:18,230
I'm not charming? Me?

119
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:20,774
How dare he?

120
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:24,194
He's the one that looks like
a cross between a flounder and a toad.

121
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:27,156
<i>-Come on. You're being too harsh.</i>
-It's just ridiculous.

122
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:29,908
Harsh? I'm just getting started.

123
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:32,870
My revenge will start
when he shows up to work tomorrow...

124
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:37,040
<i>Hello? Young-joo?</i>

125
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:38,667
<i>Are you there?</i>

126
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:41,211
You scared me.

127
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:42,546
What?

128
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,923
I didn't do anything.
I was just standing here.

129
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:48,302
Hey, what are you doing here?

130
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,262
"Am I not allowed to be here?"

131
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:52,306
Can't I stand here?

132
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:57,936
This bus stop is open
to all Korean residents.

133
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:07,446
Hello.

134
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:23,170
Damn it.

135
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,130
He heard everything.

136
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,258
Every last bit.

137
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:32,971
I told you I didn't take a single bite.

138
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:35,515
This is what it looked like
when I opened it!

139
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,018
Just look at it.

140
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:40,646
Take a close look.

141
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:44,775
My ice cream turned into sludge
because of your crappy packaging!

142
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:48,111
Sir, I just checked your receipt,

143
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:51,657
and it says you purchased this
seven hours ago.

144
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,368
We tell all our customers
to consume their ice cream

145
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,370
-within three hours--
-Hey, miss

146
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,622
Are you trying to lecture me right now?

147
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:01,750
I'd appreciate it
if you could keep things respectful.

148
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,336
-This is the policy--
-Just refund me.

149
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,296
I want a refund right now!

150
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,925
As I've told you before,
the policy forbids refunds in this case.

151
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:10,842
Damn it!

152
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,021
What are you doing?

153
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:26,650
Disrupting the business,
property damage, harassment,

154
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,820
-assault, defamation, and more.
-Hold on.

155
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,864
These are the charges
being brought against you,

156
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:35,993
and I have video evidence
documenting all of these violations.

157
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,538
Our corporate legal team
will take legal action against you.

158
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:41,081
But why are you filming...

159
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:43,375
Feel free to make your closing statement.

160
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:46,295
Learn how to run a business.

161
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,970
What an asshole.

162
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:06,231
-Thanks, Jae-yoon.
-Sure.

163
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:12,904
Are you a double major
in law or something?

164
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:18,035
I picked it up from a TV show
I watched last night.

165
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:22,039
I didn't think it'd work, though.

166
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,416
What show was it? I want to watch it.

167
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:27,544
Don't bother. It's not that good.

168
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:29,838
Okay.

169
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:33,800
You know...

170
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:36,345
That thing that happened...

171
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,186
I'm sorry about what I said
at the bus stop.

172
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:49,983
The flounder part?

173
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:51,985
Or the toad part?

174
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:57,699
Come on now. Who cares about all that?

175
00:10:57,783 --> 00:11:01,578
It's totally fine.
I also talked smack about you, too.

176
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:05,540
That's right. You did.

177
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:06,750
So you started it.

178
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:12,464
I just said you weren't that pretty,
but you compared me to animals.

179
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:14,466
-It was oddly specific.
-What I meant was--

180
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:17,928
-You called me a flounder and a toad.
-I'm sorry.

181
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:19,596
I am.

182
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:23,642
But it is also true
that humans evolved from aquatic life.

183
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:24,643
What?

184
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:27,270
I'll wash the rags.

185
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,412
I must be going crazy.

186
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:47,916
My favorite professor is Hugh Herr at MIT.

187
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:50,419
He lost both of his legs in an accident,

188
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:55,799
but despite that, he became a leader
in the bionic limb industry.

189
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,759
Since he was little...

190
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:07,185
Damn it, I'm seriously about to lose it.

191
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:09,729
This flavor over here is a crowd-pleaser.

192
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:11,440
And the Korean rice flavor...

193
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:28,498
-What about the rice flavor?
-Oh, right.

194
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:30,417
It's good.

195
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,112
There we go. That's more like it.

196
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:01,364
I'm finally coming to my senses.

197
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,918
-I'm off.
-Bye.

198
00:13:15,378 --> 00:13:16,796
{\an8}Hello.

199
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:21,885
Bye.

200
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:46,826
Damn it.

201
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:54,209
{\an8}LEE JAE-YOON

202
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:06,888
#ENGINEERINGSTUDENT #ENGINEERINGGRAM #HKU

203
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,725
This can't be happening!

204
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:13,061
You've got to be kidding me.

205
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:14,854
Why is this happening to me?

206
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:17,274
-Young-joo, time for dinner.
-I'm not hungry!

207
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,067
This is for you.

208
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,819
And this is for you, boss.

209
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,488
You shouldn't have.

210
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:26,658
-Thank you.
-Thanks, I'll pull them to good use.

211
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:30,912
Hey, what about Jae-yoon?

212
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,627
Oh no. I only got two pairs.

213
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:40,505
Hold on.

214
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,386
I almost forgot I had this.

215
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:49,806
Hey, Jae-yoon.

216
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:52,809
You can have this.

217
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,484
I get hot easily.

218
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:07,574
So I don't wear scarves in the winter.
They're too stuffy.

219
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,203
You should give it to someone else.

220
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:15,457
Should I wipe the glass outside, boss?

221
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:18,877
It's so hot in here.

222
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,056
Well, we all have our preferences.

223
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:41,399
Jeez!

224
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,611
You scared me.

225
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,782
Hey, how can you be so clueless?

226
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,241
What?

227
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,077
Don't you know what this means?

228
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:56,289
What does it mean?

229
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:03,338
It's my way of asking you out.

230
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,548
I knitted it myself.

231
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:10,720
Really?

232
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:14,683
The thing is...

233
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,064
I'm sorry.

234
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:25,860
I just have no interest in dating you.

235
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:27,112
What?

236
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:28,029
I'm sorry.

237
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:31,950
Oh, okay. I see.

238
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:34,369
Hey, that's okay.

239
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,246
I get it.

240
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:37,747
We should go.

241
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:40,417
What can I get you?

242
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,876
What's good here?

243
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:46,089
I recommend the Almond Caramel.

244
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:49,509
We just launched this flavor,
and it's been a big hit.

245
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:54,347
My Dad is a Caramelon
is also a recent addition.

246
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:58,727
A lot of people have been asking for it
because of its unique flavor.

247
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:00,729
Do you have anything sweeter?

248
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:03,064
-Are you looking for something richer?
-Yes.

249
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:06,818
Then, I personally recommend
the Chocolate Fudge.

250
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:08,153
Have a taste.

251
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:10,488
It's the sweetest flavor we have.

252
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:13,908
So, are you two an item now?

253
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:16,870
What are you talking about?
We're not dating.

254
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:18,580
Really?

255
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,291
That means I still have a chance.

256
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:29,174
Hey.

257
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:31,843
I'm just really curious.

258
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:33,928
Do you think
you're in a position to reject--

259
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:37,348
What are you trying to imply?

260
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:40,435
It's just an innocent question.

261
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,900
I mean, you do have a point.

262
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:52,781
How could I go after someone that pretty?

263
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:56,284
She's way out of my league.
Don't you think so?

264
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:01,831
What's the matter?

265
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:03,500
What's wrong?

266
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,168
It's nothing.

267
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:09,589
All I did was ask her
for the Almond Caramel.

268
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:12,300
No, he didn't do anything wrong.

269
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,596
I'm not feeling well.
I think I need to leave early today.

270
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,515
Sure, go on home.

271
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:23,019
Don't worry. We'll take it from here.

272
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:24,479
Young-joo.

273
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,792
Damn it, I can't believe I did that.

274
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,669
That was so embarrassing.

275
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:07,146
Young-joo, the thing is...

276
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:09,732
-Earlier...
-Damn it!

277
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:12,110
Where are you going?

278
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:14,112
Hey, wait up!

279
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:15,029
Hey!

280
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,575
Are you okay?

281
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,994
-This is so annoying.
-Young-joo.

282
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:23,663
They always get untied!

283
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:24,747
What did you say?

284
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:28,167
These stupid laces always get untied.

285
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:30,545
Your laces?

286
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,005
Hey.

287
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:35,925
You should've just asked me.
I know a trick.

288
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:39,262
If you tie it like this,
they'll never come undone.

289
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:42,098
Really?

290
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:46,269
Of course, just watch.

291
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:50,231
You do this.

292
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,275
And then, you...

293
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:56,821
Do you really find me that unattractive?

294
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:00,158
No.

295
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:04,203
You're really pretty.

296
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:16,799
Jae-yoon, you jerk.
You said they'd never come undone.

297
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:21,095
Take all the time in the world, will you?

298
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:23,765
Can you hurry up and tie them already?

299
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,733
Lee Jae-yoon, Ra In-ho.

300
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:35,902
-Private Lee Jae-yoon.
-Private Ra In-ho.

301
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:37,153
What now?

302
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,280
Is it over now?

303
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:55,588
No!

304
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:58,091
It can't be.

305
00:21:01,678 --> 00:21:03,346
-Fuck.
-Step back, sir.

306
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:04,847
Pull yourself together, sir.

307
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:06,557
Shit.

308
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:09,018
Fuck.

309
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:11,229
Why the fuck is this happening?

310
00:21:13,523 --> 00:21:15,149
He got up.

311
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,157
Private Lee.

312
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:37,964
In-ho.

313
00:21:39,841 --> 00:21:40,758
Corporal Jeon!

314
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:45,263
Sergeant Kim!

315
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:56,774
Corporal Jeon.

316
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:00,570
Please forgive me.

317
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:07,869
Keep moving.

318
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,084
I feel like shit.

319
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:17,712
Are you all right?

320
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:18,713
Hold on.

321
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,256
Look.

322
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:22,884
Please help me.

323
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:28,264
No, wait! I'm not one of them.

324
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,933
-Damn you.
-Wait, stop.

325
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:33,436
He's still talking,
so maybe he's just hurt.

326
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,521
-Let's not kill him just yet.
-Damn it!

327
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,691
-What the...
-Just leave if you're going to kill me.

328
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:41,569
Did you get bitten by a zombie?

329
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:43,362
Yes, it fucking bit me.

330
00:22:43,446 --> 00:22:45,907
That's why I'm dealing
with this shitty situation.

331
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:49,077
You're going to clobber me over the head
when I just got bitten?

332
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:50,661
You're all jerks.

333
00:22:51,329 --> 00:22:54,540
Get lost. You're all the same.

334
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,252
Get lost!

335
00:23:00,254 --> 00:23:01,756
Given how violent he's acting,

336
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:04,008
he must be far along
in the zombification process.

337
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:05,134
-Let's go.
-Okay.

338
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:09,263
You're really going to leave me?

339
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:14,018
Please help me.
I really don't want to die.

-Please help me.
-What?

343
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:23,027
-Can we take him with us?
-No way.

Please help me. I beg you.

00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,616
-Does it hurt a lot?
-What's wrong with you?

346
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:30,701
Get lost if you don't want to be here.

347
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:33,371
"Get lost"?
Why are you so rude all of a sudden?

348
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:36,415
You're the one who told me
to drop the formalities earlier.

349
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:38,876
If you don't want to deal with this,
just leave.

350
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,297
-Turn your phone off.
-Turn it off.

351
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:44,966
Hey, stop it. Don't touch me.

Sorry, I'm a bit drunk.

356

Fuck, I told you we should've just gone!

Take me with you!

359
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,485
-Run!
-This way!

360
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:05,403
Wait for me!

361
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:09,574
Wait!

362
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:19,750
Soo-jeong?

363
00:24:27,592 --> 00:24:28,509
Hyung-bae.

364
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:33,347
Civilians aren't allowed
to handle firearms.

365
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:35,474
You crossed a line there.

366
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:39,395
I'm... I'm sorry.

367
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,438
Sir.

368
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,441
If she hadn't stepped in,
In-ho would be dead.

369
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:45,318
Get it together, Kwak!

370
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,073
Stay focused!

371
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:54,869
-Kwak Gye-young.
-Yes, sir.

372
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:56,746
Escort the civilian to the barracks.

373
00:24:57,246 --> 00:24:58,331
The rest of you...

374
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:01,959
Clear the bodies of the fallen soldiers.

375
00:25:03,294 --> 00:25:04,545
Do you hear?

376
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:06,631
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

377
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:11,177
Let's get you inside.

378
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,094
Sir.

379
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:13,221
Watch your step.

380
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:15,348
First Lieutenant Park Sung-wook!

381
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:19,185
-Pardon?
-I'll brief the brigade about this.

382
00:25:20,228 --> 00:25:22,230
You need to pull yourself together, sir.

383
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:25,650
Yes, thank you.

384
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:29,946
I'm going to take a short break.

385
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,631
Look, they're really going in there.

386
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:50,508
Get back inside.

387
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:55,012
NECK TO NECK GRILLED INTESTINES

388
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:56,639
Hey.

389
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,976
Sorry, but this is the only way
you can be with us.

390
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,143
Hang in there, okay?

391
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:02,186
"Hang in there"?

392
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,230
What's the problem?

393
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:06,274
It's not like he's going to get better.

394
00:26:06,357 --> 00:26:09,151
Look at his eyes.
They're growing redder by the second.

395
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:14,991
Then, what? Do you want to kill him?

396
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:19,829
He's on the verge of becoming a zombie!

397
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:24,583
You'd better stop looking at us
with those puppy eyes.

398
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:27,169
That's why we gagged and tied him up.

399
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:29,755
Stop acting like you're a saint,
for fuck's sake.

400
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:30,673
Jin-wook!

401
00:26:32,008 --> 00:26:33,592
Words like "saint" are uncalled for.

402
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:36,345
But "fuck" is okay?

403
00:26:36,721 --> 00:26:39,682
Look at the shitty situation we're in.
How could I not--

404
00:26:41,684 --> 00:26:43,769
You should stop, too.

405
00:26:43,853 --> 00:26:45,563
You'd better not turn, you fucker.

406
00:26:45,646 --> 00:26:47,898
-I'll smash your head in, asshole.
-Stop it.

407
00:26:47,982 --> 00:26:48,983
Just try me.

408
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:55,072
Maybe we should take out the gag.

409
00:26:55,156 --> 00:26:57,783
-I made it clear that I'm against this.
-Okay.

410
00:27:02,997 --> 00:27:04,749
How much did you drink?

411
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:10,296
The first round was
at a Chinese restaurant.

412
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:12,214
<i>I had a bottle of </i>baijiu <i>there.</i>

413
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:15,968
Then, I went to the Han River Park
and had two bottles of soju.

414
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:20,806
After that, I went to sober up...

415
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:21,932
SINSA-DONG HANGOVER SOUP 267

416
00:27:22,016 --> 00:27:24,352
<i>...and had some </i>makgeolli.

417
00:27:25,353 --> 00:27:26,812
<i>And then...</i>

418
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,319
I'm missing something.
What else did I eat?

419
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:36,864
Just take a look at that spew.
You clearly had some fried rice.

420
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:39,075
I'm thirsty. Can I get some water?

421
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:43,287
If it's your third time taking the CSAT,
you should be studying, not drinking.

422
00:27:43,371 --> 00:27:44,830
Planning a fourth attempt, Tripeater?

423
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:50,127
"A fourth attempt"?
How could you say such a thing?

424
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:54,006
If I can't get into college this time,
I'll have to enlist.

425
00:27:54,632 --> 00:27:57,343
I just wanted one last drink
before I started studying.

426
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:01,263
Get him some water.

427
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:03,682
-Water.
-Me?

428
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:04,683
Hurry up.

429
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:06,894
This is complete bullshit.

430
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:09,563
-How about another drink instead?
-What if...

431
00:28:11,232 --> 00:28:13,025
Hypothetically speaking...

432
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:46,100
What are you doing?

433
00:28:59,447 --> 00:29:01,449
-I knew it!
-What was that for?

434
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:03,325
What's wrong with him?

435
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:06,328
Ta-da. Look at this.

436
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:07,746
What about it?

437
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,206
Young-joo, you saw it, too.

438
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:12,168
-The zombies went around him.
-Well...

439
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:13,878
Yes, I think they did.

440
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:15,212
It wasn't just some of them.

441
00:29:15,296 --> 00:29:18,048
They all paid him no attention
and were focused on biting us.

442
00:29:18,132 --> 00:29:20,342
Get to the point already.

443
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:21,760
Two possible explanations.

444
00:29:21,844 --> 00:29:25,181
One, the zombies don't attack the drunk.

445
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:28,767
Two, if you're drunk,
a bite won't turn you into a zombie.

446
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:32,605
Being wasted might be our biggest defense.

447
00:29:33,481 --> 00:29:34,690
-"Wasted"?
-"Wasted"?

448
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:37,026
-That's ridiculous.
-That's crazy.

449
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:39,612
Then, how do you explain him?

450
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:42,698
It's just a theory for now.

451
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,951
But how about a drink?

452
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,621
-What?
-How much do we have to drink?

453
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:54,752
Jeez, we'll be drunk as skunks.

454
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:58,297
Why are you looking at me?
You're making me feel like shit.

455
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:00,299
I'm a total lightweight, too.

456
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:02,510
But it'll be better to move
when the sun's up,

457
00:30:02,593 --> 00:30:04,011
so let's just drink until then.

458
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:05,596
Okay?

459
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,265
-Let's drink.
-Fine, let's drink.

460
00:30:08,349 --> 00:30:10,935
Can I have a drink, too?

461
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:12,853
I'd also like a drink.

462
00:30:12,937 --> 00:30:16,232
Damn, they're ignoring me.
That's so shitty.

463
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:20,027
<i>Our apologies.</i>

464
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:23,531

468
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:35,417
Ta-da. Enjoy.

469
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:40,339
Sir, can I get one, too?

470
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:43,425
Sir?

471
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:50,683
-You should eat something.
-Thanks for coming.

472
00:30:51,225 --> 00:30:52,059
Eat up.

473
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,613
-Are you crying?
-You scared me.

474
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:08,784
-I'm not crying.
-Come on, give me a smile.

475
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:09,868
Stop it.

476
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:13,038
-You're not tired?
-No, I'm fine.

477
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:16,166
-Thank you.
-No, it's nothing.

478
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,007
My dad wanted you to have this.

479
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:32,057
He shouldn't have.

480
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:35,603
Thank you, sir.

481
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:40,691
But you know I don't smoke, right?

482
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:43,611
-Right?
-Hey.

483
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:45,779
My dad wasn't a smoker, either.

484
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:48,115
That's true.

485
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:53,912
I only saw him carry this around,
but I never saw him use it.

486
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:56,248
When I was little,

487
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,835
I got him this as a birthday gift
with my allowance.

488
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:05,591
He carried it around every day
and claimed it was his greatest treasure.

489
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:11,055
He used to pretend like he was smoking
to make me laugh.

490
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:26,070
Stop it.

491
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:28,072
-Oh, that's good.
-Stop it.

492
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:33,827

<i>According to our analysis,</i>

Permission to speak, sir?

00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:34,675
Read the room, you punk.

511
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:37,177
What is it? Just say it.

512
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:42,349
Private Choi didn't turn into a zombie
as soon as he died yesterday.

513
00:35:42,432 --> 00:35:45,978
There must be a reason
it took some time for him to turn.

514
00:35:46,562 --> 00:35:47,396
Such as?

515
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:50,148
There must've been
something unique in his diet.

516
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:51,191
Well...

517
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,699
Based on my deductions,

518
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:01,785
I believe it was all due
to this health supplement he took.

519
00:36:02,202 --> 00:36:03,996
Red ginseng extract.

520
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:10,586
That's complete nonsense.

521
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:14,840
It's almost as if you're begging
to be beaten up.

522
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:18,010
Hey, your tone...

523
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:19,553
What about it?

524
00:36:19,636 --> 00:36:20,888
You sound like a soldier.

525
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,682
I thought I'd give it a shot.

526
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:25,350
What?

527
00:36:26,393 --> 00:36:28,145
I have a question for you.

528
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:29,855
Okay, what is it?

529
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:33,025
How did you manage to land
such a perfect shot yesterday?

530
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:34,026
He's right.

531
00:36:35,277 --> 00:36:37,696
I was surprised, too.
Did you learn how to shoot?

532
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:43,285
This is supposed to be a secret.

533
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:49,458
I was a competitive shooter in high school
and was on the national reserve team.

534
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,084
What? Seriously?

535
00:36:51,627 --> 00:36:53,879
No wonder! That explains it!

536
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:00,844
-What was that?
-What's going on?

537
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:03,555
-What was that?
-Where did that come from?

538
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:05,432
-What was it?
-What was that sound?

539
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:07,392
-What's going on?
-Damn it.

540
00:37:07,476 --> 00:37:09,978
Where was it?
Where did that gunshot come from?

541
00:37:10,062 --> 00:37:11,939
It came from the control room.

542
00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:16,360
-Where's the CO?
-He's in the control room.

543
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:20,322
-Damn it.
-Shit.

544
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:22,282
Damn it.

545
00:37:22,366 --> 00:37:23,575
-What's going on?
-Wait here.

546
00:37:23,659 --> 00:37:25,619
CONTROL ROOM

547
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:28,372
Sir, be careful.

548
00:37:36,046 --> 00:37:37,547
Shit, what's going on now?

549
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:49,393
{\an8}1ST PLATOON DUTY ROSTER

550
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:51,353
LIVE AS A SHIELD! DIE IN LOYALTY!

551
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,275
FIRST LIEUTENANT PARK SUNG-WOOK

552
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,153
RETURN TO BRIGADE

553
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:15,252
<i>If you get 0.209 percent...</i>

554
00:38:15,335 --> 00:38:17,587
-I did it.
-You got 0.209 percent?

555
00:38:17,671 --> 00:38:19,548
-You did? Are you sure?
-I did!

556
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:21,466
Congratulations! You did it!

557
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,802
You did it!

558
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:27,097
-I did it.
-You did it!

559
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:29,266
Well done. I feel great.

560
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:30,809
I feel so good.

561
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:34,438
-I'm totally wasted.
-Totally wasted...

562
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:39,192
Look at that jerk.

563
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:45,073
You always act all macho and stuff,
but you hold your liquor pretty well.

564
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:47,200
Can't you just untie me?

565
00:38:47,284 --> 00:38:51,413
I'm pretty sure I have
the highest blood alcohol level here.

566
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,458
-Can we untie him?
-Of course not.

567
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:56,126
We can't. Sorry, kiddo.

568
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:59,671
Wait, but when are we actually leaving?

569
00:38:59,755 --> 00:39:01,631
The sun is up already.

570
00:39:01,715 --> 00:39:04,551
But won't it be difficult for us
to deal with the zombies

571
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:06,219
if we're this drunk?

572
00:39:06,303 --> 00:39:08,013
Hey, nothing is easy in life.

573
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:11,683
Young-joo, don't worry.
We're going to A Tower.

574
00:39:11,767 --> 00:39:14,352
Do we have to go to that stupid A Tower?

575
00:39:14,436 --> 00:39:16,646
-Who cares about her boyfriend?
-Watch it.

576
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:18,148
Do you want to go back to studying?

577
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:19,524
Hold on, Young-joo!

578
00:39:20,442 --> 00:39:24,529
Listen up.
I'll tell you why we should go to A Tower.

579
00:39:25,072 --> 00:39:27,783
One, we'll be safe
since there are soldiers there.

580
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:29,618
-Jae-yoon's there.
-That's right!

581
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,578
Private Lee will protect us.

582
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:35,123
And my car is there.
It came all the way from the States.

583
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:38,794
-The States? That's amazing.
-It has a variety of survival kits.

584
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:39,795
Please untie me.

585
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:41,171
Wait, where are you going?

586
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:42,964
That's amazing. Please untie me.

587
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:43,882
I have a shovel.

588
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:45,383
-Young-joo.
-Let's go.

589
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:46,802
-That's cool.
-Young-joo!

590
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:48,595
-I'm off!
-Stop right there!

591
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:49,846
Untie me first!

592
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,515
-Where are you going?
-Untie me.

593
00:39:51,598 --> 00:39:53,100
-Here I go!
-Young-joo!

594
00:39:53,183 --> 00:39:56,019
-And I have a hammer.
-Where are you going? Untie me.

595
00:39:56,103 --> 00:39:59,231
Sorry, I can't untie you.

596
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:02,859
My car is built for off-road.
It's from the States!

597
00:40:02,943 --> 00:40:04,152
And it's safe!

598
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:07,864
Where did everyone go?

599
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,457
It's all coming to an end.

600
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:19,084
What?

601
00:40:19,709 --> 00:40:21,920
There's no reason for us
to guard this place.

602
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:24,047
Pardon me?

603
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:27,467
I'm saying I've lost my sense of duty.

604
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:31,555
Private Lee.

605
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:36,601
Are you thinking of deserting your post
to go look for your girlfriend?

606
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:42,566
She could've gotten hurt
on her way here to see me.

607
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:45,318
It makes no fucking sense
for me to be here.

608
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:50,949
That's why I'm going to leave
and look for Young-joo.

609
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:56,288
Then, I shall come with you.

610
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:02,419
I also need to protect Ha-yul and my wife.

611
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:06,423
Okay. All right.

612
00:41:07,007 --> 00:41:10,594
It's only right for each of us
to go and protect our loved ones.

613
00:41:12,429 --> 00:41:13,346
Let's go.

614
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,766
We should inform the first sergeant.

615
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:17,726
What?

616
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:20,270
Tell him we're deserting?

617
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:29,029
Zombies, move aside!
I need to go to Jae-yoon.

618
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:30,947
Stop! Have you lost your mind?

619
00:41:32,032 --> 00:41:34,743
He said zombies don't attack you
when you're drunk.

620
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:37,829
We need to get out of here. Let's go!

621
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:44,294
This way.

622
00:41:44,878 --> 00:41:45,962
Wait!

623
00:41:46,046 --> 00:41:48,506
-Hey, zombies!
-Stop it. Please.

624
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:50,467
-Be quiet.
-Come here! Bring it on!

625
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:51,426
This way.

626
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,678
-I can beat them.
-No, you can't.

627
00:41:53,762 --> 00:41:54,638
Not a chance.

628
00:41:58,642 --> 00:42:02,729
We're fucking screwed.
They're going to have a feast out of us.

629
00:42:07,776 --> 00:42:09,069
You think this is funny?

630
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:15,242
Look at you. Did the zombies scare you?

631
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:17,535
Hey, the zombies might not bite you.

632
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:19,162
Go and do something.

633
00:42:19,246 --> 00:42:21,373
Then, at least untie me.

634
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:23,250
There's no time for that.

635
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:24,918
-Come on.
-Just untie him.

636
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:26,878
-You go out there then.
-Come on.

637
00:42:26,962 --> 00:42:29,214
-I can't do anything in this state.
-That hurts!

638
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:32,509
-Okay, fine. I'll untie you.
-Free him.

639
00:42:32,592 --> 00:42:35,011
-There you go.
-He's free.

640
00:42:35,387 --> 00:42:36,221
Now, go.

641
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:44,479
-Bye. Good luck.
-I'm counting on you.

642
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:55,240
Seriously, this is...

643
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:57,659
What's this thing?

644
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:10,130
Stand up.

645
00:43:10,213 --> 00:43:11,756
-Where are we going now?
-Let's go.

646
00:43:16,177 --> 00:43:17,429
-Wait for me!
-This way.

647
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:19,514
-Hurry.
-Tripeater!

648
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,016
Hurry up.

649
00:43:31,568 --> 00:43:33,862
CHOI CHUL-WOO,
PARK SUNG-WOOK, JEON HYUNG-BAE

650
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:34,946

00:44:04,517 --> 00:44:06,603
Salute.
Private Lee Jae-yoon reporting for...

653
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:14,569
What is it?

654
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:17,072
Are you in the middle of something, sir?

655
00:44:17,614 --> 00:44:18,698
Well, I was...

656
00:44:19,491 --> 00:44:23,453
I was working
on First Lieutenant Park's case.

657
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:26,581
I was checking the trajectory.

658
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:28,416
The direction of...

659
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,668
-I was trying to act...
-A scene reenactment?

660
00:44:30,752 --> 00:44:32,670
-Yes, that's right.
-I see.

661
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:34,798
I was reenacting it.

662
00:44:35,465 --> 00:44:38,426
The reenactment of the death
of First Lieutenant Park.

663
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:39,469
What do you need?

664
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:42,764
Sir, we're about to run out of food,

665
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:44,891
and we don't know
when we'll be replenished.

666
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:47,727
But we actually have
a bigger issue on our hands.

667
00:44:47,811 --> 00:44:50,021
-What is it?
-Private Ra, go ahead.

668
00:44:50,105 --> 00:44:51,856
Yes, sir. Allow me to explain, sir.

669
00:44:52,482 --> 00:44:55,693
Do you remember the blackout
we experienced yesterday?

670
00:44:55,777 --> 00:44:58,405
The sudden blackout was caused
by the lack of an ATS.

671
00:44:58,488 --> 00:44:59,781
Yes, I remember yesterday.

672
00:45:00,532 --> 00:45:02,826
When that happened,
it's likely that the hotel's power

673
00:45:02,909 --> 00:45:05,703
switched from the external grid
to an internal generator.

674
00:45:05,787 --> 00:45:09,582
We only have running water
because the water tank is functioning.

675
00:45:09,666 --> 00:45:14,379
At this moment, both the tank and pump
are being powered by the generator.

676
00:45:14,462 --> 00:45:16,965
Therefore,
once the generator runs out of power,

677
00:45:17,507 --> 00:45:19,551
our water supply will be cut off as well.

678
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:24,722
And when do you think that will happen?

679
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:29,394
I suspect we only have
a few days before that happens.

680
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:41,072
COMMUNICATION SECURITY

681
00:45:41,531 --> 00:45:43,533
Line is secure.
Admin Supply Officer speaking.

682
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:45,785
<i>-This is the battalion commander.</i>
-Salute.

683
00:45:45,869 --> 00:45:47,662
<i>A supply chopper will be landing at 12:00.</i>

684
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:50,874
<i>Prepare for its entry</i>
<i>and stand by within the base.</i>

685
00:45:51,416 --> 00:45:52,250
Yes, sir.

686
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:56,504
At 12:00, a supply chopper will arrive.

687
00:45:56,588 --> 00:45:57,755
-What?
-What?

688
00:45:58,173 --> 00:46:00,800
This may be your first time
handling a chopper entry,

689
00:46:00,884 --> 00:46:03,845
but if you stick to the protocol,
you'll be good to go.

690
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:06,264
Safety is our top priority.

691
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:09,184
Stay sharp, and don't let your guard down.
Is that clear?

692
00:46:09,601 --> 00:46:11,102
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

693
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:14,481
Bulletproof vests
will remain on at all times.

694
00:46:14,564 --> 00:46:18,234
Gye-young, check the inventory
and issue one to Soo-jeong as well.

695
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:20,695
-Yes, sir!
-Thank you, sir!

696
00:46:25,158 --> 00:46:27,285
Damn it.

697
00:46:44,511 --> 00:46:47,305
This is Opera. Fish, do you copy?

698
00:46:48,097 --> 00:46:49,891
Come on, hurry up.

699
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:51,518
It's coming.

700
00:46:51,601 --> 00:46:54,020
This is Opera. Fish, do you copy?

701
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:56,022
Can't we just go home in that?

702
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,359
-Can we?
-Should we ask?
