1
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:33,135
What the hell do you think
you're doing, Private?

2
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:34,762
-Private Park Yun--
-Private!

3
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:36,639
-Speak up, Private!
-Private!

4
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:38,974
-Private!
-Private Park Yun-seung.

5
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:40,684
Rookie. Are you nervous?

6
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,395
Do you see that guy
who's about to go home?

7
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,024
He was stuck here for a year and a half,

8
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,484
and he's going home at last.

9
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:49,819
Are you jealous?

10
00:01:50,236 --> 00:01:52,488
-No, sir.
-Come on. Be honest.

11
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,198
Yes, sir. I'm jealous, sir.

12
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:57,493
I'm jealous too, damn it.

13
00:01:58,369 --> 00:01:59,703
I feel bad for you.

14
00:01:59,787 --> 00:02:03,958
You will never get to experience
being discharged from the army.

15
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,418
Because the world will end
before that happens.

16
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:10,798
Isn't that right, Sergeant Lee Jae-yoon?

17
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:12,591
Darn it!

18
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:15,344
I saw that civilian smile.

19
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,763
I'm so fucking jealous.

20
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:21,642
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Salute!</font></i>

21
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:23,352
Salute.

22
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,522
As of today, June 18, 2026,

23
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:31,694
I, Sergeant Lee Jae-yoon,
am officially discharged from duty!

24
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:33,988
Salute!

25
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,155
Salute.

26
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:38,158
-You did well, Jae-yoon.
-Thank you, sir!

27
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:39,660
Best of luck in your future endeavors.

28
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:40,703
Thank you, sir!

29
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:41,954
Goodbye, then.

30
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:45,541
See ya!

31
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:47,877
That punk.

32
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:01,765
Young-joo!

33
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:10,190
Young-joo.

34
00:03:15,738 --> 00:03:16,780
Young-joo.

35
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:21,243
Young-joo!

36
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:26,248
Young-joo!

37
00:03:28,334 --> 00:03:29,335
Young-joo!

38
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:39,053
Young-joo!

39
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:41,055
Young-joo!

40
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,057
Young-joo!

41
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,266
Young-joo!

42
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:48,812
1ST PLATOON LEE JAE-YOON

43
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:02,493
Salute.

44
00:04:02,952 --> 00:04:05,454
-Keep it down. You'll wake the others.
-Yes, sir.

45
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:07,915
-Wake In-ho and prepare for duty.
-Yes, sir.

46
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:09,458
It's coming.

47
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:11,752
It's headed this way, sir.

48
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:14,296
In-ho.

49
00:04:14,672 --> 00:04:15,923
Wake up. It's our shift.

50
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:18,550
Looks like a single US F-100.

51
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:20,552
Subtle retreat at wing roots.

52
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:22,972
-Blunt nose, like a sausage--
-In-ho.

53
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:25,057
The nose is circular. A circular engine.

54
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,517
Beware of circular hair loss.

55
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:28,227
What did you say?

56
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,814
Thousands of bombers
are heading toward us.

57
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:33,774
I think he can hear us.

58
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:34,942
Yes, sir.

59
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,778
How close are they?

60
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:39,071
They're under our noses.

61
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,406
Watch out. They will crash.

62
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:42,825
Watch out! They're headed straight for us!

63
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:45,494
Corporal Ra In-ho!

64
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,788
When did you become a corporal?

65
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,916
I don't follow, sir.

66
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:55,879
Oh, right. I'm not a corporal yet.

67
00:04:57,131 --> 00:05:00,009
Private Ra In-ho!

68
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:02,928
This guy's a total washout.

69
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:04,763
Get ready to stand guard.

70
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:05,973
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir.

71
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,876
{\an8}MY DARLING YOUNG-JOO

72
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:39,983
SWEET JAE-YOON

73
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:49,660
What?

74
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:50,994
Answer your phone.

75
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,166
Tell him if he calls at this hour again,

76
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,044
I won't let you date him anymore.

77
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:07,594
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Hello?</font></i>

78
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:10,055
-Hello?
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">-What is going on?</font></i>

79
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,933
Hi, Jae-yoon. What's up?

80
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,017
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">"What's up"?</font></i>

81
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,896
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">-That's what you have to say?</font></i>
-Yes.

82
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,189
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Young-joo.</font></i>

83
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:21,441
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Getting drunk is one thing.</font></i>

84
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,570
But I couldn't
get a hold of you for hours,

85
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:27,656
and then some random guy
picked up your phone.

86
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,326
So, what the hell is going on?

87
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:34,329
I think you talked to my manager.

88
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:37,624
He brought me home because I was drunk.

89
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:41,211
-A guy brought you home?
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">-Yes.</font></i>

90
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:44,047
You got hammered
and let some guy take you...

91
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:46,341
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Kang Young-joo,</font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">do you not think of me at all?</font></i>

92
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:49,720
I'm always thinking of you.

93
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:52,598
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">I'm sorry.</font></i>

94
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,058
But Jae-yoon, it's...

95
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,353
It's 3 a.m. right now.

96
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:01,315
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Even if I'm terribly in the wrong,</font></i>

97
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:05,652
calling and waking me up
at this time of night isn't right either.

98
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:09,072
I couldn't sleep a wink
because I was worried sick about you.

99
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,408
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Okay, fine.</font></i>

100
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,620
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">I'm sorry for not picking up</font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">or messaging you.</font></i>

101
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:17,706
I'll explain everything
tomorrow morning...

102
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,003
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Hello?</font></i>

103
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:24,671
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Hello?</font></i>

104
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:25,881
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">What happened?</font></i>

105
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:27,716
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Hello? Young-joo.</font></i>

106
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,009
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Hello?</font></i>

107
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:30,302
Young-joo? Hello?

108
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,555
What the heck?

109
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:35,641
I won't let it slide this time.

110
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:36,975
What is she thinking?

111
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:38,810
My thoughts exactly.

112
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,443
-Salute.
-I can't let this slide, either.

113
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,990
Look at him for fuck's sake.

114
00:08:52,074 --> 00:08:54,117
What should I do with you two?

115
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,078
I finished my meal, sir.

116
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:03,710
Salute.

117
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:05,212
Salute.

118
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,631
May 2nd, 2025.

119
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:08,966
First Platoon morning roll call.

120
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,093
Of the nine members, two are on duty.

121
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:14,012
The remaining seven are present.

122
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:15,013
Report complete.

123
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:17,015
-At ease.
-At ease.

124
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:19,268
At ease.

125
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:23,772
The CO canceled
today's national pledge and training.

126
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:26,733
It's easy to tense up
and strain your muscles in this cold.

127
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,487
So, don't stay indoors
and watch TV all day.

128
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,657
Do some basic exercise
to keep fit. That's all.

129
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,784
-Salute.
-Salute!

130
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:36,910
Salute.

131
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,789
Who is that dozing off?

132
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,417
Is this the best you can do?

133
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,835
-No, sir!
-No, sir!

134
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,004
You're in your prime. Act like it!

135
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,716
-Squad commander.
-Yes, sir.

136
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,593
Have them do 50 laps
around the training ground.

137
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,013
Are you complaining?

138
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,180
You punks.

139
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,100
Do you want to do 80 laps?

140
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:01,601
-No, sir!
-No, sir!

141
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:07,733
Let's make it 67 laps.

142
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:08,775
Get to it.

143
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:10,694
-Get to it.
-Yes, sir!

144
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:14,740
There are fewer than ten of you,
and you can't run in sync?

145
00:10:15,407 --> 00:10:17,117
Fall into step!

146
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,786
Left.

147
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,288
Left.

148
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,416
-One, two...
-Sixty-five laps to go!

149
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,960
Three, four.

150
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:31,131
One, two, three, four.

151
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:32,799
One, two, three, four.

152
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:34,509
-One, two, three, four.
-Sync up!

153
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:36,261
March in time!

154
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:40,015
-One, two, three...
-One, two, three...

155
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,743
SWEET JAE-YOON

156
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,245
Kang Young-joo. Wait up.

157
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:03,955
Hi. We're late. Let's run.

158
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,210
{\an8}EXIT

159
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:09,586
{\an8}ENTRANCE

160
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,505
{\an8}-Young-joo.
-Hello.

161
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:12,923
-You just got here?
-Yes.

162
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,926
-Hello.
-Long time no see, Seul-gi.

163
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:18,178
How's work so far?

164
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:21,181
I'm settling in really fast,
thanks to your help.

165
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:23,100
I owe you.

166
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,477
You've been saying that

167
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,104
since you joined a month ago.

168
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:32,359
Put your money where your mouth is
and buy me <i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">tteokbokki, </font></i>at least.

169
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:37,864
I could buy you
a hundred servings of <i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">tteokbokki.</font></i>

170
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:40,617
Really? How about today, then?

171
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:42,786
Today?

172
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:45,205
Today...

173
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,250
It's okay if you're busy.

174
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:50,544
Next week's fine too.

283
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,077

Be grateful I'm ending it at this.

285

288
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:29,174
Damn it.

289
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:34,345
I'd rather receive disciplinary action.

290
00:17:34,429 --> 00:17:35,889
Seventy-seven floors...

291

00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:11,007
Watch out.

295
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,927
We need to stay on schedule.

296
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:27,315
Shit!

297
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:30,610
Mom, I'm hungry.

298
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:35,365
-Still? We had a big breakfast.
-I'm still hungry.

299
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:56,261
Private Lee Jae-yoon.

300
00:18:57,345 --> 00:18:58,555
I'm a lost cause.

301
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,223
-Keep going.
-Leave me behind.

302
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,432
Keep going, punk.

00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:03,309
Kim Young-man.

304
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,354
I bet you're coasting
now that you're a sergeant.

305
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:09,274
If you don't manage your men,

306
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:12,193
people will think
you're pissing around, you moron.

307
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:13,486
I'll do better, sir.

308
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:24,038
Look at those bastards.

309
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:28,835
Push-up positions.

310
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,378
Hey!

311
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:32,005
Push-up positions!

312
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,804
In-ho and Jae-yoon, you bastards.

313
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:44,142
Just last night,

314
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:47,061
I caught one punk
using his phone on guard duty.

315
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:50,273
And the other was fast asleep.

316
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:53,151
As if that wasn't enough,
during emergency training,

317
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:54,777
a gunner dropped a missile

318
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:57,071
in front of our battalion commander.

319
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:01,284
And I realized

320
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:03,953
that our platoon is in shit shape.

321
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:06,956
If I were the battalion commander,

322
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:11,336
all you bastards would be in the brig!

323
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:12,462
You hear me?

324
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:18,426
From this moment on,

325
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:20,887
you're banned from using your phones.

326
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,306
If I catch anyone using their phone,

327
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:26,017
I'll kill him and go to the brig myself.

328
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:28,686
-Hyung-bae.
-Yes, sir.

329
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,104
-Take their phones.
-Yes, sir.

330
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:33,024
And you two.

Private Ra In-ho, reporting.

333
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:43,576
I really didn't want
to say this to you two.

334
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,204
But you're older than the rest of us,

335
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:47,789
so act your age.

336
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:49,332

00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:26,869
Move it.

346
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:28,121
Private Ra In-ho.

347
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:29,122
-Go.
-Yes, sir.

348
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:30,248
You moron.

349
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:32,625
Private Lee Jae-yoon.

350
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:35,211
{\an8}Let go.

351
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:37,338
{\an8}-Just a moment.
-Let go.

352
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:39,340
-Just one second--
-Hey.

353
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,509
It's a really important text.

354
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,720
Damn it, Jae-yoon.

355
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:45,054
Let go right now.

356
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:48,558
Get it together. This is all your fault.

357
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,600
I'm sorry, sir.

358
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:56,899
-Salute.
-Salute.

359
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,067
-Salute.
-Salute.

360
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:01,779
What's with the vibe in here?

361
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:03,740
I feel like I'm walking on eggshells.

362
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:04,699
What are you doing?

363
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:06,576
Private Choi Chul-woo, reporting.

364
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:10,288
After climbing all those stairs,
you still want to work out?

365
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:12,040
Why are your arms so huge?

366
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:15,460
You need to work your upper body
after a leg workout.

367
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:18,546
Just looking at you exhausts me.

368
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:21,507
I'll give you some boiled chicken breast.
Come to the mess hall later.

369
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:22,633
Yes, Corporal Kwak.

370
00:22:23,593 --> 00:22:24,552
Thank you, sir!

371
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:26,679
-Kwak, give me your phone.
-What?

372
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:28,056
Oh, sure.

373
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:30,725
It never rings anyway. Take it.

374
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:31,642
But, in return,

375
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,645
I need someone to help with the cooking.

376
00:22:34,729 --> 00:22:38,232
I have to make a delivery.
How much longer must I do this for?

377
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:41,569
Why is he the only one who's not beat?

378
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:42,779
That moron.

379
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:45,364
-I'll take Jae-yoon.
-Private Lee Jae-yoon, reporting!

380
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:46,949
-You're helping me.
-Yes, sir!

381
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:50,661
Move faster.

382
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:07,970
Unbelievable.

383
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:09,263
First Sergeant Jung
and First Lieutenant Park

384
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:12,683
always go on about how
the system needs to be cleaned up.

385
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:14,769
But they always make me bring them food

386
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:17,105
so they won't have to eat
the same slop we do.

387
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,316
Talk about double standards.
Just wait and see.

388
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,652
Before I'm discharged, I'll report them.

389
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:24,028
Isn't that funny?

390
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:25,113
You punk.

391
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:28,324
Am I talking to myself?

392
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,408
Say something.

393
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:31,077
I'm sorry, sir.

394
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:36,374
You know, you and In-ho are a liability.

395
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,376
Even today, the both of you--

396
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:40,169
In-ho makes more mistakes than I--

397
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:42,463
Why can't either of you
get the hang of things?

398
00:23:42,547 --> 00:23:44,257
In-ho's clearly not the sharpest tool,

399
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,342
and he's older
than the rest of us, so I get it.

400
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:49,220
But you attend a top-tier university
and look like a smart...

401
00:23:49,303 --> 00:23:50,555
What is it?

402
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:52,181
Is there a problem?

403
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:55,434
Those people...

404
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:03,568
What about those people?

405
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,737
It's nothing, sir.

406
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:11,159
You being here is a problem.

407
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:12,201
Let's hurry.

408
00:24:32,722 --> 00:24:35,099
-Hey, what are you looking at?
-I just...

409
00:24:35,183 --> 00:24:36,726
-Get over here.
-Sorry, sir.

410
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,811
-Shit, are you Ra In-ho?
-No, sir.

411
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,938
Hey, do it now.

412
00:24:41,022 --> 00:24:41,939
Attention.

413
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:45,151
Hello, Soo-jeong.

414
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:50,364
We installed an elevator
exclusively for you.

415
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:53,868
Your presence will upset the VIP guests.

416
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:55,244
Oh, dear.

417
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:56,287
You haven't heard.

418
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,372
That elevator is out of order.

419
00:24:58,456 --> 00:25:01,375
Then, you should have reported it.

420
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:04,420
Our phones were confiscated.
Can you believe it?

421
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,761
Anyway.

422
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,931
Please follow our instructions.

423
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:16,515
-Please.
-Sure. Sorry.

424
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:19,936
In case this happens again,

425
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:23,022
I think it'd be best
if we could contact you directly.

426
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:24,857
Could you give me a business card?

427
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:25,942
Soo-jeong?

428
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:28,069
What the heck are you on about?

429
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:30,738
Why the hell would I give you
my business card?

430
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:32,740
-Goodness gracious.
-What?

431
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:35,952
Are you this cold to everyone?

432
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:36,994
You lunatic...

433
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,124
Just do your thing and get lost.

434
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,960
You have no business with me.

435
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:46,254
-No, my business is right here.
-What?

436
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:47,713
Do you remember my name?

437
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:50,299
Why should I remember your name?

438
00:25:50,383 --> 00:25:51,842
It's right here. Kwak Gye-young.

439
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:54,011
You don't seem to get the message.

440
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:55,471
-It's not the first time--
-Excuse me.

441
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:56,389
Jae-yoon.

442
00:25:56,472 --> 00:25:58,015
-Yes?
-It's the man of legend, Arron Park.

443
00:25:58,099 --> 00:25:59,100
-Retreat.
-Hey.

444
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:00,393
-It's Arron Park.
-Hey!

445
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:10,152
Those little shits.

446
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:13,239
Arron Park...

447
00:26:14,115 --> 00:26:16,158
He almost caught us. Darn it.

448
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:21,080
-Things were going so well.
-What a shame.

449
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:23,541
-Let's drop this off and get out.
-Yes, sir.

450
00:27:00,328 --> 00:27:02,788
Speak of the devil.

451
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,499
Let's cut some meat.

452
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:07,293
Look forward
to the Korean banquet tomorrow.

453
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:08,377
-A banquet?
-Hi, Jae-yoon.

454
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:09,503
For real?

455
00:27:10,004 --> 00:27:11,630
I'll have dinner down here, then.

456
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:13,424
Me too.

457
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:23,225

459
00:27:25,061 --> 00:27:27,730
Corporal. I need to speak with Chef Jung.

460
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:29,231
-Get back in five minutes.
-Yes, sir.

461
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:30,983
The first sergeant
will freak if we're late--

462
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:32,401
-I know, sir!
-What a punk.

463
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:35,529
{\an8}<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Ongojishin.</font></i>

464

{\an8}KNOW THE OLD TO LEARN THE NEW

465
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:38,032
Here.

466
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:40,576
Use it freely, Private First Class Lee.

467
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:44,455
I'll remember this until the day I die.

468
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:45,664
Thank you.

469
00:27:46,374 --> 00:27:47,583
Thank you.

470
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:01,555
Young-joo, your phone's ringing.

471
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:05,601
You ate your shrimp already?

472
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:08,854
Hello?

473
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:10,356

474

<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">in the morning, but you didn't pick up!</font></i>

475
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,571
Oh, hey, Jae-yoon.

476
00:28:17,947 --> 00:28:18,989
Whose phone is this?

477
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:21,826
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">That's not what's important.</font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">I'm really angry.</font></i>

478
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:24,412
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Are you going to keep dodging the issue?</font></i>

479
00:28:26,122 --> 00:28:28,666

-Hey.

481
00:28:30,835 --> 00:28:32,962
I explained everything in the text.

482
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:36,549
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Are you seriously trying to brush this off</font></i>

484
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:40,511
Okay, fine.

485
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:41,971
Last night--

486
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:44,098
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">The first sergeant asked for me,</font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">so we have to go,</font></i>

489
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:50,396
Hey, Jae-yoon.

490
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,197
Was that your soldier boyfriend?

491
00:29:01,115 --> 00:29:02,450
-Yes.
-I see.

492
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:03,659
What's his rank?

493
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:05,828
-He's a private.
-Oh, dear.

494
00:29:06,287 --> 00:29:07,538
He has ages left.

495
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:09,790
Will you wait for him?

496
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:12,960
Why would you even ask?

497
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:14,336
She's not stupid.

498
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:17,089
Why would she waste time
waiting for someone she won't marry?

499
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:18,174
Right?

500
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:21,802
Is it a waste of time?

501
00:29:21,886 --> 00:29:23,888
-Of course.
-What's wrong with you?

502
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:27,308
Maybe she loves him enough
to marry him once he's discharged.

503
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:30,478
Right, Young-joo?

504
00:29:30,561 --> 00:29:32,563
You're thinking of marrying him, right?

505
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,694
I haven't given it that much thought.

506
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:39,612
Time out.

507
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,906
You should start thinking now.

508
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:45,868
You're not exactly young anymore.

509
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,370
Why would you say that?

510
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:50,164
What's your problem?

511
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:51,957
What I mean is,

512
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:55,085
you're of the age
to be thinking about these things.

513
00:29:55,169 --> 00:29:56,378
I'm just kidding.

514
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:58,380
He's right. You should think about it.

515
00:30:00,424 --> 00:30:01,884
I've got it handled.

516
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:03,385
Please, eat up.

517
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:05,137
I don't feel well.

518
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:08,349
Enjoy your meals.

519
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,241
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Hello?</font></i>

520
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:30,746
Can I speak with Private Lee Jae-yoon?

521
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:34,750
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">I'm sorry. He returned to his unit.</font></i>

522
00:30:37,545 --> 00:30:39,547
-Okay, then.
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">-Bye.</font></i>

523
00:31:00,818 --> 00:31:01,819
Ra In-ho.

524
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,406
Private Ra In-ho, reporting.

525
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:08,033
Where were you?
It's our turn to sort the recycling.

526
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:09,451
Private Lee.

527
00:31:15,332 --> 00:31:16,333
Here.

528
00:31:17,835 --> 00:31:19,503
You didn't hand yours in earlier?

529
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:21,380
What's wrong with you?

530
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:24,341
Hey, it's mine.

531
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:27,595
I told the admin supply officer
that I needed it because my kid is sick.

532
00:31:27,678 --> 00:31:28,846
Your kid is sick?

533
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:30,514
No, sir. My son's fine.

534
00:31:30,598 --> 00:31:32,474
I got your phone instead of mine

535
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:34,685
because it seemed like you needed it.

536
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:36,895
What if you'd gotten caught?

537
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:39,273
You clever devil.

538
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:40,941
Thanks a lot.

539
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:42,818
Ra In-ho!

540
00:31:43,777 --> 00:31:45,362
-Private Ra In-ho, reporting!
-Retreat.

541
00:31:45,446 --> 00:31:47,323
-Tap in!
-Yes, sir!

542
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,741
Ra In-ho!

543
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:50,492
Go and talk to your girlfriend.

544
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:52,828
-I'll finish this with Private Hwang.
-Okay.

545
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:54,246
Thanks.

546
00:31:54,622 --> 00:31:56,498
-Retreat!
-Don't let him grab you there.

547
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:57,916
There's no way out, then.

548
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,127
Is this what you want me to do?

549
00:32:00,628 --> 00:32:01,503
You punk.

Did you tell Jae-yoon

563

that I'll kill him
if he calls at that hour again?

564

Whatever. I don't remember a thing.

565
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:49,093
No sensible man
would call at such a late hour.

566

You need to think carefully.

567

If you marry someone that selfish,

568
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:57,726

What...

589
00:34:16,138 --> 00:34:18,599
What are you talking about?

590
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:24,062

Okay. I'll do as you say.

610
00:35:34,258 --> 00:35:35,592
-Come and eat.
-Mom!

611
00:35:35,676 --> 00:35:37,636
Will you knock first?

612
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,557
What is it? Why are you crying?

613
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,641
I'm not crying.

614
00:36:02,536 --> 00:36:04,621
-May I say just one thing?
-No, don't.

615
00:36:04,705 --> 00:36:06,874
Yes, sir. Copy that!

616
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:10,294
Say it. What is it?

617
00:36:12,296 --> 00:36:14,298
Are you all right,
Private First Class Lee?

618
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:18,969
Young-joo says

619
00:36:19,803 --> 00:36:21,263
she wants us to take a break.

620
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:27,978
That means she wants to break up, right?

621
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:30,898
May I say one more thing?

622
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:34,818
When it's just us two,
you don't have to ask permission.

623
00:36:34,902 --> 00:36:37,195
You can just speak. It's fine.

624
00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:38,363
Yes, sir.

625
00:36:40,282 --> 00:36:42,159
Then, I'll ask you a question.

626
00:36:44,328 --> 00:36:47,789
Will you marry your girlfriend
once you're discharged from the army?

627
00:36:51,168 --> 00:36:52,502
Well...

628
00:36:55,172 --> 00:36:56,381
Would she marry me?

629
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,468
I haven't even graduated yet.

630
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:05,849
How long do you expect her
to wait for you?

631
00:37:08,602 --> 00:37:11,146
Waiting 18 months isn't easy.

632
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:13,273
My wife said

633
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:16,318
if it weren't for our son Ha-yul,

634
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,737
she'd have left me long ago.

635
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:36,922
Our cute Young-man.

636
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:38,924
Shall I get you something?

637
00:37:39,383 --> 00:37:40,884
No need, sir.

638
00:37:40,968 --> 00:37:42,928
They said I could go down next week.

639
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:45,013
Go and have lots of good food.

640
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:46,014
Salute.

641
00:37:46,098 --> 00:37:47,933
There you go, sulking again.

642
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:49,851
-I'll get you a hamburger.
-Six.

643
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,021
-Take care.
-Seven.

644
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:54,147
Bye, sir.

645
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,191
Eight.

646
00:37:57,985 --> 00:37:58,944
Nine.

647
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:01,989
Ten.

648
00:38:02,072 --> 00:38:04,408
Can you stop already? It's distracting.

649
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:06,493
I'll do just one more set.

650
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:10,038
Jae-yoon and In-ho fucking messed up
their reports again yesterday.

651
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:12,332
Once I become squad commander,

652
00:38:12,416 --> 00:38:14,668
I won't let them get away with this.

653
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:15,877
Those bastards.

654
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:19,756
It sounds like you're saying
they get away with it

655
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,591
because I'm a bad squad commander.

656
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:25,429
Why would you take it that way, Sergeant?

657
00:38:25,721 --> 00:38:28,265
You know you're my favorite person here.

658
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:30,100
You're my role model.

659
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:31,351
You're all talk.

660
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:34,730
What should we do with Jae-yoon and In-ho?

661
00:38:35,439 --> 00:38:38,316
Hell if I know.

662
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,694
They're both older than us.

663
00:38:40,777 --> 00:38:42,529
Why can't they do anything right?

664
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,199
If they did half as well
as our Grade-A boy here,

665
00:38:46,283 --> 00:38:47,451
I'd have no worries.

666
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:48,827
Right, Kyung-sik?

667
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,912
That's right, sir.

668
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:52,497
What are you saying?

669
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,166
Jae-yoon's your senior.

670
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:56,334
-Kyung-sik.
-Yes, sir?

671
00:38:56,418 --> 00:38:58,962
Don't let the praise go to your head.
Respect your seniors, okay?

672
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:33,121
Can't I get this done professionally?

673
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:35,665
-It'll be neater and more sanitary.
-No.

674
00:39:35,749 --> 00:39:38,418
I've always wanted to shave
my boyfriend's hair before he enlisted.

675
00:39:38,502 --> 00:39:40,879
I'll make you look prettier
than the other soldiers.

676
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:45,550
Here goes.

677
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:56,311
Oh, no.

678
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:07,989
Do you find this funny?

679
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:10,659
-You look cute.
-Are you laughing?

680
00:40:11,118 --> 00:40:12,285
You're so cute.

681
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,664
That's ugly. Don't do that.

682
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:18,834
Stop it. You look ugly.

683
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:20,585
This ugly thing's your boyfriend.

684
00:40:21,795 --> 00:40:24,214
Keep this to yourself.
Don't show it to anyone.

685
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:25,674
Okay?

686
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:28,093
Keep going.

687
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:33,306
Are you crying?

688
00:40:34,975 --> 00:40:36,059
Seriously?

689
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:39,563
I don't want to do this.

690
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:40,480
Hey.

691
00:40:41,898 --> 00:40:44,609
You can't walk off and leave me like this!

692
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:45,819
Hey...

00:40:52,993 --> 00:40:54,828

698
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,008
Hello.

699
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:10,260
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Why do you sound so down?</font></i>

700
00:41:11,845 --> 00:41:13,555
It's just my morning voice.

701
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:16,266
Why are you calling on a weekend?

702
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:20,020
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">I've had to come uptown</font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">to run some errands for my father,</font></i>

703
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:21,771
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">and I've just finished,</font></i>

704
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,190
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">but I realized</font></i>

705
00:41:23,857 --> 00:41:25,692
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">your neighborhood is right nearby.</font></i>

706
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:28,320
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">So, basically right now...</font></i>

707
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:31,156
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">I'm outside your place.</font></i>

708
00:41:31,907 --> 00:41:32,908
What?

709
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:34,492
You're outside my place?

710
00:41:47,631 --> 00:41:48,757
Young-joo.

711
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:52,093
-Did I make you wait?
-No.

712
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:53,511
I came unannounced,

713
00:41:53,595 --> 00:41:55,722
so I'm just honored
you came out to meet me.

714
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,643
Let's go.
I made a reservation while I was waiting.

715
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:05,649
I come here often
because my friend's a part owner.

716
00:42:06,775 --> 00:42:09,819
But this lunch menu
isn't as good as their dinner options.

717
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:12,239
It's really nice here.

718
00:42:12,322 --> 00:42:14,074
The food's incredible.

719
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:16,868
I'll order the course meal.

720
00:42:16,952 --> 00:42:18,161
Sure.

721
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:20,455
Anyway,

722
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,874
you helped a great deal
when I applied for the job.

723
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:25,126
I get to return the favor at last.

724
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:28,046
I'm sorry, and I'm so very grateful.

725
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:30,173
You can return the favor another time.

726
00:42:30,257 --> 00:42:31,841
This place is expensive, so it's on me.

727
00:42:31,925 --> 00:42:34,135
No, sir. This is my treat.

728
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:36,388
It's fine. Buy me <i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">tteokbokki </font></i>next time.

729
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:38,848
And we've known each other for years.

730
00:42:38,932 --> 00:42:40,225
Why do you still call me "sir"?

731
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:41,810
When we're outside the office,

732
00:42:42,644 --> 00:42:44,020
just call me by my name.

733
00:42:44,104 --> 00:42:45,939
I can be a bit audacious.

734
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:48,108
If I get too comfortable,
I might get too big for my britches.

735
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,401
So, I can't do that.

736
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:50,986
You're smiling at last.

737
00:42:51,444 --> 00:42:53,113
You didn't say a word in the car.

738
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:54,906
Is something wrong?

739
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:57,284
Is it your boyfriend?

740
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:01,538
It is.

741
00:43:09,296 --> 00:43:11,423
MY DARLING YOUNG-JOO

742
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:13,383
At the dinner after our department event,

743
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:16,720
you left early and missed it,
but Jun-ho got wasted

744
00:43:16,803 --> 00:43:19,014
and kicked our dean in the stomach.

745
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:21,516
Our dean was 60 years old then, so...

746
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:24,769
Don't you have to take it?

747
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:29,441
It's my boyfriend,
so the call could take a while.

748
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:31,151
I'll call him back at home.

749
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:32,861
Okay.

750
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:36,656
Anyway, I never imagined
you'd take an office job.

751
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:41,202
It's not every day that you see
such a pretty girl fix machines.

752
00:43:41,286 --> 00:43:44,622
I was the famous Goddess of Engineering.

753
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:50,503
But my mom couldn't stand
watching me get my hands dirty.

754
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:53,548
And I wanted an ordinary life too.

755
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:56,885
That's why
I'm grateful for your help, sir.

756
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:01,348
It's Seo Jin-wook. Say "Jin-wook."

757
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:04,768
I told you I shouldn't cross that line.

758
00:44:04,851 --> 00:44:06,311
Say it. "Jin-wook."

759
00:44:06,603 --> 00:44:07,562
Sir.

760
00:44:07,896 --> 00:44:10,231
-It's not that hard.
-I can't do it.

761
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:22,118
Hand it in for me.

762
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:31,044
He chewed him out the whole day.

763
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:33,713
He cursed out a kid
ten years younger than him.

764
00:44:34,214 --> 00:44:36,966
That team leader is just too crass.

765
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:39,094
-Sir.
-Yes?

766
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,012
I need to use the restroom.

767
00:44:41,304 --> 00:44:42,555
Sure. Go ahead.

768
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:52,107
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">You have one voicemail.</font></i>

769

772
00:45:02,075 --> 00:45:04,202
I thought about it from your perspective.

773
00:45:07,497 --> 00:45:08,998
It really is hopeless.

774
00:45:12,252 --> 00:45:13,878
We're 26 years old,

775
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:17,215
and we'll be 27 when I get out of here.

776
00:45:19,968 --> 00:45:23,805
I still have to graduate from university
and then find a job.

<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">It's one thing to wait for my discharge,</font></i>

781
00:45:38,027 --> 00:45:39,362

782
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:42,490
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">So, it'd be too selfish of me.</font></i>

783
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:46,953
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">I've been trying to brush this all off</font></i>

784

786
00:45:56,045 --> 00:45:57,130
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">It's not fair to you.</font></i>

787
00:45:59,048 --> 00:46:01,217
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">It's not fair to either of us.</font></i>

788

<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Young-joo.</font></i>

<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Let's break up.</font></i>

<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">After the tone, please leave--</font></i>

795
00:46:44,344 --> 00:46:45,970
How will you get there?

796
00:46:46,054 --> 00:46:47,222
I'll take a taxi.

797
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:49,349
See you at work on Monday.

798
00:46:53,102 --> 00:46:54,103
Young-joo.

799
00:46:59,234 --> 00:47:01,110
I'll drive you to the barracks.

800
00:47:02,946 --> 00:47:05,490
Who should I call
about the elevator, then?

801
00:47:05,782 --> 00:47:08,117
I called the machine room
because I was told to.

802
00:47:08,493 --> 00:47:09,661
I get it, okay?

803
00:47:10,078 --> 00:47:12,038
I talked to them over a week ago.

804
00:47:12,872 --> 00:47:13,748
Fine.

805
00:47:14,666 --> 00:47:17,043
They don't give a shit
because it's not their elevator.

806
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:23,466
Do you think they can manage?

807
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:24,509
Especially him.

808
00:47:24,592 --> 00:47:27,136
Yes, sir! I can do it, sir!

809
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:30,139
-I have a bad feeling about this.
-Sergeants Ahn and Yoo

810
00:47:30,223 --> 00:47:31,724
will return this evening.

811
00:47:31,808 --> 00:47:33,476
Until then, the others are on duty.

812
00:47:33,893 --> 00:47:36,521
These two are the only men available
to get the gasoline.

813
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:43,444
If something goes wrong,
it's your job to bring them in.

814
00:47:43,528 --> 00:47:44,862
Yes, sir.

815
00:47:49,576 --> 00:47:50,785
You heard him.

816
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,203
Don't do anything stupid.

817
00:47:52,704 --> 00:47:55,081
Get the gasoline
from the gas station by the intersection

818
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:57,375
and come right back here. Okay?

819
00:47:57,458 --> 00:47:59,210
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

820
00:48:11,055 --> 00:48:12,181
Private First Class Lee.

821
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:14,767
Are you all right?

822
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:21,816
What private wears his beret like this?

823
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:26,112
-Hey.
-Private Ra In-ho, reporting!

824
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:28,740
Don't go overboard. I'm fine.

825
00:48:30,575 --> 00:48:31,618
Then...

826
00:48:32,327 --> 00:48:35,079
Can we spend this on a donut?

827
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:39,876
Something sweet to lift your spirits.

828
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:43,004
I love the way you think.

829
00:48:43,463 --> 00:48:45,340
When did you sneak that in?

830
00:48:48,217 --> 00:48:49,636
Fine, let's get some donuts.

831
00:48:49,719 --> 00:48:51,220
Food always helps.

832
00:49:14,035 --> 00:49:16,412
We're smack in the center of Gangnam.

833
00:49:16,913 --> 00:49:19,374
-There are lots of business--
-Sirs?

834
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:23,836
Hello, Soo-jeong.

835
00:49:24,545 --> 00:49:25,963
Yes, hello.

836
00:49:26,422 --> 00:49:29,217
-Is there a problem?
-What?

837
00:49:29,759 --> 00:49:32,887
No. I think my senior told you last time.

838
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:35,139
Our private elevator's not working.

839
00:49:36,099 --> 00:49:37,934
I know that.

840
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:41,270
But if you keep coming down here...

841
00:49:41,938 --> 00:49:45,525
I'm pretty sure I told your senior.

842
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:46,943
That quack, I mean Kwak...

843
00:49:47,694 --> 00:49:48,695
Kwak Gye-young, was it?

844
00:49:49,696 --> 00:49:50,988
So, you do know his name.

845
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,784
Hello, how can I help...

846
00:49:56,619 --> 00:50:00,373
The Asia Super Star Awards
starts at 4 p.m., right?

847
00:50:00,915 --> 00:50:03,835
When will the CEO
of the sponsoring company arrive?

848
00:50:04,252 --> 00:50:07,797
Why? Do you have business here too?

849
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:10,925
I know the CEO very well.
I'd like to say hi,

850
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:15,096
-ask about changes in the industry--
-What's up with you?

851
00:50:15,847 --> 00:50:17,140
Are you okay?

852
00:50:17,223 --> 00:50:19,434
Don't you know Alex Entertainment?

853
00:50:19,517 --> 00:50:20,393
I know them.

854
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:21,769
I told you last time.

855
00:50:21,853 --> 00:50:23,479
-Yes, you said last time--
-Excuse me!

856
00:50:24,313 --> 00:50:26,190
You two soldiers!

857
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:41,122
IF YOU CAN COME DOWN,
LET'S TALK FACE TO...

858
00:50:46,335 --> 00:50:48,045
I'm just asking out of curiosity.

859
00:50:49,297 --> 00:50:51,048
Are you going there

860
00:50:51,424 --> 00:50:52,508
to break up with him?

861
00:50:55,595 --> 00:50:59,140
How far out are we?

862
00:50:59,932 --> 00:51:00,933
We're almost there.

863
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:06,522
Yes, well...

864
00:51:09,275 --> 00:51:10,193
Young-joo.

865
00:51:12,612 --> 00:51:13,863
Whatever happens,

866
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:17,116
don't forget I'm right here
if you're ever struggling.

867
00:51:18,367 --> 00:51:21,496
As always, I'll be right next to you.

868
00:51:21,788 --> 00:51:23,122
I'll always be waiting

869
00:51:24,165 --> 00:51:25,625
like a big tree

870
00:51:26,709 --> 00:51:27,919
that you can lean on.

871
00:51:34,884 --> 00:51:36,677
Right. Sure.

872
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:38,221
Okay.

873
00:51:57,031 --> 00:51:57,990
Why on earth

874
00:51:58,491 --> 00:52:02,286
must you do this whenever I'm on duty?

875
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:03,204
I'm...

876
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:10,044
Get lost.

877
00:52:15,174 --> 00:52:17,426
Private First Class Lee.
Can I say just one thing?

878
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:18,553
What is it?

879
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:20,096
There's no time to waste.

880
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:22,265
-If we're unable to get the donuts--
-Hey.

881
00:52:23,558 --> 00:52:24,559
What's that?

882
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:28,980
What is that?

883
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:35,444
-They're coming toward us.
-I see that!

884
00:52:35,528 --> 00:52:36,487
-In-ho!
-Yes?

885
00:52:36,571 --> 00:52:38,281
-They're headed straight for us!
-Sir!

886
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:39,907
They're coming!
