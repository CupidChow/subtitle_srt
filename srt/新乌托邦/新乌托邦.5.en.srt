1
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:11,822
Can't we just go home in that?

2
00:01:13,157 --> 00:01:15,326
-Can we?
-Should we ask?

3
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:18,037
-This is Opera. Fish, do you copy?
-Yes, let's ask.

4
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:23,876
-Do choppers usually wobble like that?
-This is Opera. Fish, do you copy?

5
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,795
I've never seen one before,
so I'm not sure.

6
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:28,464
But it is swaying quite a bit, sir.

7
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:32,510
Maybe it's because the wind
is blowing too strongly.

8
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:35,346
This is Opera. Fish, do you copy?

9
00:01:37,807 --> 00:01:40,392
This is Opera. Respond, over.

10
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:43,562
-Kyung-sik!
-Private Hwang Kyung-sik, sir!

11
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:47,316
-Are they responding?
-Negative, sir.

12
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,236
The pilot seems inexperienced,
so stay alert.

13
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,654
-Yes, sir.
-Sir!

14
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:53,364
-Don't do it.
-What is it now?

15
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:54,698
Will you be quiet?

16
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:56,867
You idiot!

17
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:57,952
Hey, you punk!

18
00:01:58,744 --> 00:01:59,745
What's he doing?

19
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:02,039
Don't cross the helipad! Focus, damn it!

20
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:04,250
You piece of shit!

21
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:09,380
You cannot let them land, sir!
Look at this!

22
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:14,218
Shit.

23
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:21,100
What?

24
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:28,983
This is Opera. Fish, do you copy?

25
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,827
Can you please just walk straight?

26
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,454
Hold on. Are there any zombies here?

27
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,707
Let's go in here.

28
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,334
Get in there.

29
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:53,340
-Damn it, go your own way.
-Let me in!

30
00:02:53,424 --> 00:02:54,717
Stop following us.

31
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:01,098
Shit.

32
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:09,481
No zombies?

33
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:11,358
My head is killing me.

34
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:13,819
Look at that.
They have oriental raisin tea.

35
00:03:17,323 --> 00:03:18,490
Let's drink some more.

36
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:20,367
-Drink up, Tripeater.
-Okay.

37
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:21,952
Cheers, Boozer.

38
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:24,413
-Seriously, they're both crazy.
-Drink up.

39
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,293
-What's going on?
-Fire in the hole!

40
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,128
-Zombies.
-It's zombies!

41
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,673
-Fire in the hole!
-That's freaking sick.

42
00:03:34,757 --> 00:03:36,592
-Hey, that's Alex.
-Where?

43
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,594
-Hi, Alex.
-Alex, over here!

44
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:43,349
Oh no.

45
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:49,939
-You killed it!
-That was so dope.

46
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:51,899
-Let's cheers to that.
-Can we replay that?

47
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:53,359
This is ridiculous.

48
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:54,276
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

49
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,362
Lay off the booze, damn it!

50
00:03:56,946 --> 00:03:57,905
You drink this.

51
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:01,116
Gross.

52
00:04:01,742 --> 00:04:02,785
Damn it.

53
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:03,786
-Jin-wook!
-Huh?

54
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:06,080
-Hey, open the door!
-Where's my beer?

55
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,499
-It's Alex.
-What am I? A fucking doormat?

56
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,459
-Fuck.
-I'm coming. Hold on.

57
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:11,669
Hurry up!

58
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:15,089
-Quick!
-Alex, come on!

59
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,882
Alex!

60
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,842
I think I drank too much.

61
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,386
-That was awesome.
-Are you guys okay?

62
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:21,971
Can you do that again?

63
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:23,555
Look, it's zombies.

64
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:26,308
-They're baseball players.
-That's it.

65
00:04:26,392 --> 00:04:27,559
They're fighting again.

66
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:29,561
Go, Twins!

67
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:32,022
No, the Giants are the best.

68
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:33,148
You're wrong.

69
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:35,442
-Get them, Giants!
-Kiwoom Heroes all the way.

70
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:37,903
-Go, Twins! You can do it!
-Go, Giants!

71
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:39,029
Let's go!

72
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:45,411
Raise your rifles!

73
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:47,913
Lock and load on the chopper!

74
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:49,415
Air defense squad, to your positions!

75
00:05:01,677 --> 00:05:02,970
-What?
-What?

76
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:04,638
To your positions!

77
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:06,932
To your positions!

78
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,353
Target approaching at four o'clock!

79
00:05:11,437 --> 00:05:13,188
Target approaching at four o'clock!

80
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:21,864
This is as far as it will go, sir.

81
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:23,157
Prepare to fire!

82
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:25,826
Engage the chopper's tail!

83
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:32,291
-Damn it.
-Get it together!

84
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:34,001
Do you want to go home in a box?

85
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:38,338
Shit.

86
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:40,049
Aim and fire!

87
00:05:40,132 --> 00:05:43,052
-Aim and fire!
-Aim and fire!

88
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:44,261
Aim and fire!

89
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:53,187
Get the tail!

90
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,022
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

91
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,024
Private Ra In-ho, aiming at the tail!

92
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,156
-Is it within range?
-Closing in, sir!

93
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,536
Shoot it down!

94
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,497
Target locked! One, two!

95
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,623
Commencing fire!

96
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,247
I feel like shit.

97
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,921
Hey, what's that?

98
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,344
There's no time for this. Lead the way.

99
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:11,306
They're gone.

100
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:16,228
-Get Young-joo.
-Come here.

101
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,856
-I feel horrible.
-Watch your step.

102
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,816
-Look at that.
-Hang in there, okay?

103
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,818
Damn, I feel like throwing up.

104
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:24,570
Let's hurry.

105
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:28,365
Who cares how much a chopper costs
in this situation?

106
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:31,535
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Did you just yell at me?</font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Are you fucking crazy?</font></i>

107
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:32,911
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Get your head straight!</font></i>

108
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:35,455
I'm sorry, sir.

109
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,836
Battalion Commander,
if you can't send us supplies,

110
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:44,882
please allow us to relocate
to the base camp at Suseo Station.

111
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,343
If we stay here,
we'll run out of food and water.

112
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:50,179
We won't last more than a few days.

113
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:53,765
We'll figure out a way to join the ranks
at Suseo Station's base camp--

114
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:57,186
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Negative. Cut the nonsense</font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">and stand by at your current location.</font></i>

115
00:07:57,728 --> 00:07:58,687
Yes, sir.

116
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,647
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">I'll monitor the situation</font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">and get back to you.</font></i>

117
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:01,815
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Until then, stand by.</font></i>

118
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:03,609
Yes, sir. Understood.

119
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:05,736
Salute.

120
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:09,573
That fucking bastard.

121
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:14,077
Is he telling us to stay holed up
in this fucking place and die?

122
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:17,998
All right, listen up.

123
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,084
Here's the bottom line.

124
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,130
We're leaving this building today.

125
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,174
-What?
-Sir?

126
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:31,345
Is it to get supplies from the brigade?

127
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:34,973
Unfortunately,
there won't be any resupply.

128
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:40,354
We can go a few weeks without food, sir.

129
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,898
That's right, sir.
We still have running water.

130
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:45,525
I know there's enough water
in the hotel water tank.

131
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:48,403
But we'll lose power in a few days.

132
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:52,366
When that happens,
it'll cut off our water supply.

133
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:56,787
If that's the case,
can't we leave when the water is cut off?

134
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,704
Sir?

135
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:03,543
Do you think we can put up a fight
on just water alone?

136
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:04,920
Dang it.

137
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:08,590
It's better to make a move
while we still have the energy left.

138
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:10,842
Since it's come down to this,

139
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:15,639
our only option is to fight like hell
to make it out of here alive.

140
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,018
What is it?

141
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:24,731
May I...

142
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:27,442
have a gun?

143
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:31,822
Given the situation we're in,

144
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,825
I'm really trying to go easy on you
about what happened last night.

145
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,159
So please don't cross the line.

146
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,453
Didn't you see me shoot yesterday?

147
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:43,417
I competed as a shooter in high school
and made it to the national reserve team.

148
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,629
I'm pretty sure I'm a better shooter
than most of the men here.

149
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,132
You can test me if you want.

150
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:52,134
Please let me...

151
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,305
fight for my own life.

152
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:00,934
-Damn.
-Holy shit.

153
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:02,227
-Shit.
-Unbelievable.

154
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:04,021
What the hell?

155
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,275
I can't believe this is Gangnam.

156
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:13,196
This isn't what I expected to see.

157
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:15,907
This place has been wiped out, too.

158
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:21,621
Damn it, what a fucking grand reception.

159
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:23,707
911 EMERGENCY

160
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,710
It seems they called an ambulance.

161
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,754
Are you sure there are soldiers here?

162
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,843
Jae-yoon.

163
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:39,097
Hey, where are you going?
You're not going in there, are you?

164
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:42,100
Are you out of your mind?
Don't you see that?

165
00:10:42,184 --> 00:10:43,685
-Are you trying to get killed?
-Hey.

166
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:46,897
He's right, though.

167
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,024
We'll die if we go in now.

168
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:52,152
Let's go somewhere safe
and wait to hear from your boyfriend.

169
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,654
Okay? I'm sure he'll call you.

170
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:56,531
Let's go down to the parking lot for now.

171
00:10:57,282 --> 00:11:00,535
Yeah, don't worry too much.
Let's just go for now.

172
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:07,250
Come on, let's go.
You can't get through that.

173
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,795
He's right. Come on, Boozer. Let's go.

174
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,505
Come on.

175
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,508
They drove right into the middle.

176
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:17,427
-Jae-yoon.
-It's like a zombie convention, right?

177
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:20,013
Shit, what a mess.

178
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:22,516
-Is this the only way in?
-It's a fucking mess.

179
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,643
It looks like a hiding spot for zombies.

180
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:27,145
-Is there anything in the car?
-Look at all this blood.

181
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:28,438
It's empty.

182
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:31,149
-Are you sure about this?
-Hey, slow down.

183
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,076
Hold on.

184
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:46,373
Let's split up and look for my car.
It's a navy Hummer. Plate number 4574.

185
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:49,251
-Are you sure it's in this zone?
-I don't know.

186
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,002
A navy Hummer. Plate number 4574.

187
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:56,425
How can you not remember
where you parked your own car?

188
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:58,468
I used the valet service
because I'm a VVIP.

189
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:00,345
-About earlier...
-What's a "VVIP"?

190
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:02,639
-"Very, Very Important Person."
-Sorry I lost my temper.

191
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:04,933
But you know...

192
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:08,395
You were in the wrong.
You'd be dead if you went inside.

193
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,605
-Hey, what's that?
-You know that, right?

194
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:11,648
-Young-joo!
-Run!

195
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,067
-Move! Hurry!
-Get out of there!

196
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:17,070
-The zombies are coming!
-Fuck!

197
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:20,532
Run!

198
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:27,747
No.

199
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:29,416
What the fuck?

200
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,627
Get away from me, you piece of shit!

201
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:33,753
Go away!

202
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:52,898
Young-joo!

203
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:20,467
-Alex!
-Hey, stop! That's suicide!

204
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:22,677
Let go, Jin-wook!

205
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,848
Just fucking listen to me, damn it!

206
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,392
No, Alex!

207
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,688
-No.
-Die!

208
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:35,690
No! Alex!

209
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:42,113
Alex!

210
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:45,617
No! Please!

211
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,827
No!

212
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,897
I know you're all scared.

213
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:19,317
But we have to overcome this.

214
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:20,860
Why is that, Hwang Kyung-sik?

215
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,654
Private Hwang Kyung-sik.

216
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:25,156
It's because we serve
the Republic of Korea, sir.

217
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,660
Save that for the president.

218
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:31,871
Yes, sir!

219
00:14:31,955 --> 00:14:33,623
Do you know what true victory is?

220
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:38,670
It's to survive.
Survival is the ultimate victory.

221
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:44,134
"To live, you must be willing to die.
To fear death is to ensure it."

222
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,093
What does that mean?

223
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:55,604
It means we need to fight to survive.
If we hold back in fear, we'll die.

224
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:57,272
Correct.

225
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:04,487
We fight to the death
so we can make it back home.

226
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,364
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

227
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:07,907
That's the spirit.

228
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:13,288
We'll take the stairs to the VIP lounge.

229
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:14,998
From there, we'll take the elevator.

230
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,876
Okay, let's head out.

231
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,591
Kim Young-man, Kwak Gye-young.
Get the door.

232
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:25,884
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

233
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,348
Hold fire until I give the order.
Understood?

234
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:32,432
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

235
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,060
-Selector switch to semi.
-Switching to semi.

236
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:37,479
On the count of three.

237
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:38,396
One.

238
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:40,857
Two.

239
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:43,193
Three.

240
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:50,492
Shit, what's this smell?

241
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,870
What is all this?

242
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:53,555
Hey!

243
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:58,143
I don't think the car's over here!
Go check if it's in another zone!

244
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:04,149
What's he doing?

245
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:10,947
Loser.

246
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:15,118
What the fuck is wrong with you,
you fucking bastard?

247
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,912
I'm going to kill you
when I get my hands on you!

248
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:19,831
You fucking piece of shit!

249
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:23,376
So, what do you want me to do?

250
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,211
Why you little...

251
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:32,594
Just go look for the car.
When you find it, bring it over here.

252
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:33,928
I don't know how to drive.

253
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:36,431
Why the hell didn't you get your license?

254
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,433
I was trying to get into college!

255
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,393
Keep this up, and I'm out of here.

256
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:42,103
Okay, I'm sorry. Just hold on.

257
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:43,188
Hold on, damn it!

258
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,903
Your phone's not dead, right?

259
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:52,405
-Give me your number.
-What?

260
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:53,490
Your phone number.

261
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:02,749
-Keep your guard up.
-Be careful, sir.

262
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:04,375
Are they dead now?

263
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:10,924
Pick up the pace.

264
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:02,600
This is fucked up.

265
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:06,062
We're in the thick of it,
and he's hung up over the chopper's cost?

266
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,232
What about the cost of the chopper, sir?

267
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:12,443
He wants us to pay
for the chopper you shot down.

268
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:14,487
Oh, that supply chopper?

269
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:17,115
You're all accomplices,
so we're splitting the cost.

270
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:19,576
-But...
-Do I have to pay?

271
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:20,910
How much is a chopper?

272
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:23,162
-I don't know, sir.
-We're screwed.

273
00:19:23,246 --> 00:19:25,164
-Shit.
-Do I really have to pay?

274
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:26,332
It was a joke.

275
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:38,469
Before we head down to the lobby,
we'll sweep the lounge in pairs.

276
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:43,224
If the coast is clear,
proceed with weapons maintenance.

277
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:47,520
The condition of your firearms
will dictate how the next fight goes.

278
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:49,939
Once that's done, we'll head to the lobby.

279
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:52,150
-Do you understand?
-Yes, sir.

280
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:55,028
Then start the sweep. Go.

281
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:56,404
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

282
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:57,697
You're with me.

283
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,545
How am I supposed to find it?

284
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:14,631
This is just...

285
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,471
What the hell?

286
00:20:23,681 --> 00:20:25,391
304NO 4574

287
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:27,727
Oh, that's it. That's the car.

288
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:31,981
Plate number 4574. Yes!

289
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:33,858
Oh, god.

290
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:36,778
Sorry, zombies.
Can you get out of the way?

291
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,279
Excuse me.

292
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:42,450
Go away. There's nothing here.

293
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:52,585
BOOZER

294
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:54,212
I have no idea how this works.

295
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:56,839

296

-Yes.

298
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:04,973
No, I told you.
I did nothing but work and study.

299
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:07,976
Seriously?
Press the "engine start" button.

300
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:09,519
The "engine start" button?

301
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:13,189
I don't see it.

302
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:16,234
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">If it's a Hummer, you need the key.</font></i>

Okay.

<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Is the engine running?</font></i>

305
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:24,993

308

You didn't tell me to do that.

309
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:36,713
So, which one is the brake?
There are two pedals.

310
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,131
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">The left one, damn it!</font></i>

311
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:42,677
I swear I'm going to get my license
as soon as this is over.

312
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:46,556
Okay, what's next?

Hang on. I can't hold the phone
and grab the wheel at the same time.

315
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:57,066
There we go.

316
00:21:57,692 --> 00:21:59,736
-Do I put on the seat belt?
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">-Do whatever you want.</font></i>

-Okay.

He's acting so cocky
just because he knows how to drive.

319
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,285
What an asshole.

320
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:08,870
I'll be there soon.

321
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,082
Oh, fuck! Is this going to blow up?

322
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,375

00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:20,631
Fuck.

00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,804
Holy shit! I'm fucking driving.

327
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,475
Sorry, guys! I'm sorry!

328
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:33,311
Oh, shit.

329
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:36,606
This is going too fucking fast!

330
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:38,149
Help!

331
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:41,360
Do something!

332
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:44,906
-Don't jerk the wheel like that!

00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:50,787
Hey, are you listening to me?

336
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,331
-Hey!
-Keep your voice down.

337
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:55,917
Go slow and use the brake.

338
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:20,024
Private Lee, if we find a zombie here--

339
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:21,776
Keep your mouth shut.

340
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:22,860
Yes, sir.

In-ho.

342
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:43,923
Tell the admin supply officer
that the restrooms are clear.

00:23:46,551 --> 00:23:48,386
I have a more pressing matter, sir.

344
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:03,609
-Sir.
-What?

345
00:24:03,693 --> 00:24:06,154
There are food supplies here
and on the other end.

346
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:07,113
Okay.

347
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,291
We don't know how long
we'll be in isolation.

348
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:22,378
Grab food that is light and calorie-dense.

349
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,755
Have everyone put some in their gear
before we head down.

350
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:26,132
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

351
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:29,969
-Oh, nice. I'm taking the nuts.
-Bananas...

352
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:35,391
-Private Lee.
-What?

353
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:37,393
Sir.

354
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:39,854
This is for you.

355
00:24:40,438 --> 00:24:42,607
It was smart of you to
pack these red ginseng extracts.

356
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:45,568
You've got it covered
when it comes to things like this.

357
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:57,413
{\an8}MY WIFE

358
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:00,374
{\an8}-Private Lee.
-What?

359
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:01,584
{\an8}We have Wi-Fi.

360
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:02,835
{\an8}-What?
-We have Wi-Fi.

361
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:04,128
We have Wi-Fi?

362
00:25:06,088 --> 00:25:08,883
The Wi-Fi is working. Hold on.

363
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:12,386
{\an8}MY DARLING YOUNG-JOO

364
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,767
-That's it. Take it slow.
-Take your time.

365
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:21,354
SWEET JAE-YOON

366
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:24,023
What the...

367
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:27,360
Young-joo!

368
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:28,778
Jae-yoon!

369
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,488
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Are you okay? Are you hurt?</font></i>

370
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:32,782
No, I'm okay.

371
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:34,909
-Oh, thank god!
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">-Are you okay?</font></i>

372
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:36,494
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">-Are you hurt?</font></i>
-No, I'm fine.

373
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:38,829
I'm not hurt at all. Look.

374
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,415
-I'm so relieved.
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">-Where are you?</font></i>

375
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:45,127
I'm in the basement of A Tower.
Are you still up there?

376
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:46,170
What?

377
00:25:46,254 --> 00:25:48,714
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">What floor are you on? I'll come up.</font></i>

378
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:51,801
-Wait--
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">-Just tell me, and I'll come to you.</font></i>

379
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:54,387
Why on earth would you come here?

380
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,180
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">I was worried about you.</font></i>

381
00:25:56,264 --> 00:25:59,308
You shouldn't have come here, Young-joo.

382
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:02,019
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Just tell me what floor you're on.</font></i>

383
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:06,357
It's really dangerous here,
so you need to go somewhere safe.

384
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,442
Hey, I can't just leave you here.

385
00:26:08,526 --> 00:26:10,695
-Just wait. I'm coming up.
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">-No, please don't.</font></i>

386
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:13,739
You can't do that.
It's really dangerous here!

387
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:17,994
You have no idea
what I've been through.

388
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:20,621
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">I'm super strong. I'm stronger than you.</font></i>

389
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:22,164
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">I'll protect you.</font></i>

390
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:23,916
-Oh, come on.
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">-I'll come to you.</font></i>

391
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,960
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">So just tell me where you are.</font></i>

392
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:30,673
-Hold on. Hey, Young-joo.
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">-Yes?</font></i>

393
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:32,258
I'm really sorry,

394
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:37,305
but I forgot to tell you
that I'm not at A Tower right now.

395
00:26:38,014 --> 00:26:39,849
-What?
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">-So don't stay here...</font></i>

396
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:43,769
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">-I mean, don't stay there--</font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">-Suseo Station.</font></i>

397
00:26:43,853 --> 00:26:46,147
The Capital Defense Command
is setting up a base camp there.

398
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,607
That's what the first sergeant said
when he was talking to HQ.

399
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:50,943
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">-Jae-yoon?</font></i>
-Go to Suseo Station.

400
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:52,528
Suseo Station?

401
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:55,114
That area is full of soldiers,
so it's the safest place.

402
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:57,575
Head over there,
and I'll be right behind you.

403
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:59,994
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">-Okay? I'll see you there.</font></i>
-Jae-yoon.

404
00:27:00,077 --> 00:27:01,454
{\an8}<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">-Young-joo, Suseo--</font></i>
-Suseo...

405
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:08,336
Fuck!

406
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:13,215
Jae-yoon.

407
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:15,468
What the fuck?

408
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,472
-Private Lee--
-Hold on.

409
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:21,891
YOUNG-JOO, THE CALL GOT CUT...

410
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:24,518
It's a relief nothing bad happened to her.

411
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:28,064
If she's made it this far,

412
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:31,692
doesn't that mean
her chances of survival are good?

413
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,864
You're right, In-ho.
That gives me something to hold on to.

414
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:41,369
I just need to get out of here
and find Young-joo.

415
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:48,959
-What was that?
-Private Lee.

416
00:27:49,043 --> 00:27:49,960
What happened?

417
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:55,383
What the heck? Why is it not connecting?

418
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,218
Was the call disconnected?

419
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:59,011
Hello? Hey!

420
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:01,806
Damn it.

421
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,684
I'm going way too fast.

422
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,562
I need to slow down,
or I'm going to crash.

423
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:11,774
I want to get off.
I can't do this anymore.

424
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:21,742
What was that noise?

425
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:26,580
-Get up, sir!
-What was that, Sergeant Kim?

426
00:28:28,082 --> 00:28:30,418
-What happened?
-Oh, hey.

427
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,296
Kyung-sik and I took out four zombies.

428
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,715
You're the best, Sergeant Kim.

429
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,009
Don't let your guard down.
They jump out of nowhere.

430
00:28:39,093 --> 00:28:41,345
-Yes, sir.
-They just appeared suddenly.

431
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:43,597
-Remember, aim for the head.
-Yes, sir.

432
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:46,183
The zombies came from up there,
but Kyung-sik and I got them all.

433
00:28:46,267 --> 00:28:48,561
-How many did you get?
-That's not important!

434
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,453
-What the fuck?
-We need to move out.

435
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,833
Damn, I must've slipped.

436
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,918
-We should go, sir.
-Okay.

437
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:20,509
-I should take this, too.
-Something light...

438
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:22,887
-Papayas.
-This looks tasty.

439
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:25,931
-Oh, there's bread.
-Stop.

440
00:29:26,015 --> 00:29:27,475
-Stop!
-What?

441
00:29:28,726 --> 00:29:30,728
Hey, wait. Soo-jeong!

442
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:32,646
-Wait.
-Stop, Paolo!

443
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:36,817
What are you doing?
Don't you know soldiers can't be in here?

444
00:29:36,901 --> 00:29:39,111
-Paolo.
-What?

445
00:29:40,154 --> 00:29:41,489
-Paolo?
-Gye-young.

446
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:43,324
-Do not move!
-Sir.

447
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:44,533
Please don't shoot me.

448
00:29:44,617 --> 00:29:45,451
Paolo.

449
00:29:47,286 --> 00:29:48,829
Are you okay? Were you bitten?

450
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:50,623
Bitten?

451
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:01,008
-Tell him I need to check for bite marks.
-Okay.

452
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,015
-Gye-young.
-Yes, sir. Paolo.

453
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:10,351
He looks fine.

454
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,479
Are you here alone?

455
00:30:13,562 --> 00:30:15,231
Yes, I'm alone.

456
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:17,525
People were fighting like crazy.

457
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:21,654
How were you asleep
with all that noise out there?

458
00:30:26,951 --> 00:30:27,785
Are you on drugs?

459
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:32,414
How can a chef
be doing this sort of thing?

460
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:34,291
These aren't drugs.
They're sleeping pills.

461
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:35,417
Sleeping pills?

462
00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:38,212
Hey, First Sergeant, I'm scared.

463
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:40,839
I want to go to the embassy.
Will you take me there?

464
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:42,800
We're not going there.

465
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:45,970
If you rescue a US citizen,
you have to take them to the US embassy.

466
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:48,389
We're not here to rescue you, Paolo.

467
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:52,184
Is this how you treat a US citizen?

Don't you know what's going on out there?

-No, it's fine.
-Stop!

472
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:02,444
Sir, I think he slept through it all.

473
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:05,114
He doesn't seem to know
what's going on, sir.

474

Paolo, what's going on?

475

I want to get off. Get me out of here.

Hey, get out of the way! It's dangerous!

477
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:41,567
Get out of the way.

478
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,485
You guys should be more careful!

479
00:31:58,876 --> 00:31:59,835
Get off me.

00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:08,719
I feel like puking.

I'll take it from here.

Get out of the way, you bastards!

00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:20,648
Die!

484
00:32:23,901 --> 00:32:25,861
Die, you fucking bastards!

485
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,530
-Stop it!
-You fucking zombies!

486
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:30,115
I'm going to puke.

I'm begging you. Stop the car!

490

-Damn you all.
-Stop it!

491
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:42,670
Will you stop?
You're acting like a psycho!

492
00:32:45,881 --> 00:32:48,133
Wouldn't it be better
to live like a psycho?

493
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,886
Well, I want to stay alive
one way or another.

494
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,138
But you need to stop.
It's making her dizzy.

495
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:57,685
Do you want to be acknowledged
for finding this damn car?

we saved your sorry ass from the streets?

Do your parents know
you're out there getting wasted?

That's why you're not in college yet.

500
00:33:13,826 --> 00:33:17,496
I feel sorry for your parents.
To think they raised you.

501
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:21,208
What the fuck, man?
I'm going to kill you if you don't let go.

502
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:25,003
You're the one who's got a death wish.
Should I leave you some teeth marks?

-Go ahead. Just bite him.
-Why you...

504
00:33:28,382 --> 00:33:31,510
You'd better think twice
about the state I'm in.

505
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:36,640
Okay, point taken. Let go, please.

506
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:38,726
I got it.

507
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,895
I should just bite you.

508
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:46,191
I am grateful you kept me around
so I didn't feel lonely.

509
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:49,737
-But watch your language, okay?
-Okay.

510
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,199
Being rich doesn't make up
for being a jerk.

511
00:33:54,283 --> 00:33:55,701
Right, Boozer?

512
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,581
-Fuck.
-Come on, let's go.

513
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:01,582
Sure.

514
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:23,645
Eat up. It might be a long stretch
before we eat again.

515
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:25,272
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir.

516
00:34:29,318 --> 00:34:30,569
JUNG TAE-HWA
MAY 4, 2025

517
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:33,530
I'll charge you for this later.
Nothing's free in here.

518
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:36,575
I really hope I get to pay you later.

519
00:34:37,618 --> 00:34:38,911
Sir.

520
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:41,371
This is a non-smoking hotel, sir.

521
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:43,332
He can fine me.

522
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:48,045
Have a smoke, all of you.

523
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:50,631
-Pass me one, Jae-yoon.
-Hey.

524
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:56,303
You can't smoke
in a Michelin-starred restaurant.

525
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:02,017
Damn it!

526
00:35:05,521 --> 00:35:08,690
You're smoking, too?
Aren't you a staff member?

527
00:35:10,984 --> 00:35:12,778
And you're vaping?

528
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:16,448
-Shit!
-Are you going somewhere, sir?

529
00:35:16,532 --> 00:35:17,991
I'm getting a drink.

530
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:21,036
-I'll get it for you, sir.
-No, I can get it myself.

531
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,871
It's getting worse and worse! Fuck!

532
00:35:24,498 --> 00:35:25,332
Paolo.

533
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:27,793
I'm fucking worried about Korea's future.

534
00:36:10,127 --> 00:36:12,004
-What was that?
-What was that noise?

535
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:15,424
Sergeant Kim.

536
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:17,426
Wait, sir.

537
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:23,140
Sir?

538
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:25,392
Are you all right?

539
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:32,941
Sir, we're going to move in.

540
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:44,620
His legs...

541
00:37:11,605 --> 00:37:13,440
Fuck.

542
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:29,122
-Sir.
-What?

543
00:37:41,051 --> 00:37:41,969
Shit.

544
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:47,265
His nose.

545
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:52,020
The closer the bite is to the head,
the quicker the infection.

546
00:38:28,098 --> 00:38:31,435
We'll head to Seoul Hospital first
then Suseo Station after that.

547
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:32,602
Seoul Hospital?

548
00:38:33,395 --> 00:38:34,438
My mom's there.

549
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:38,984
I see. Is she unwell?

550
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:40,277
Oh, you didn't know?

551
00:38:41,028 --> 00:38:43,697
She owns that hospital.

552
00:38:46,033 --> 00:38:48,910
I have to go to Suseo Station.
Jae-yoon told me to come--

553
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:51,371
Don't you think he needs to get checked?

554
00:38:51,872 --> 00:38:52,831
What?

555
00:38:52,914 --> 00:38:56,168
We'll get you some help at the hospital,
so don't worry.

556
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:58,211
You're pretty banged up, too.

557
00:38:58,295 --> 00:39:00,589
It's close to Suseo Station.

558
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:04,051
I'll drop you off at Suseo Station
after you get treated, okay?

559
00:39:04,134 --> 00:39:05,093
Okay.

560
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:12,184
Hey, do it out the window.

561
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:13,935
I need to use the restroom. Pull over.

562
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:16,188
Where am I supposed to pull over, dumbass?

563
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:18,982
-Stop the car before I bite you!
-Okay, fine!

564
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:21,109
I'm pulling over. Shit.

565
00:39:21,902 --> 00:39:25,530
-Damn it, he's fucking crazy.
-Hey.

566
00:39:32,954 --> 00:39:35,832
Is there a restroom nearby?

567
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:40,170
Does it matter? I can puke anywhere.

568
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:42,839
That's gross. We're not friends anymore.

569
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:47,594
I want to go home and eat <i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">ramyeon</font></i>
loaded with black pepper.

570
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:51,681
You eat it like that, too?
It's the best hangover cure.

571
00:39:51,765 --> 00:39:55,644
You bet I do.
You know what's good, Boozer.

572
00:39:56,228 --> 00:39:58,772
Don't call me Boozer.
I'm totally sober now.

573
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:01,608
I'm starting to sober up, too.

574
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,402
-I'm going to go home.
-What?

575
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:11,284
You should come with us
and get your leg checked.

576
00:40:11,368 --> 00:40:13,912
-And Suseo Station--
-No, I'm scared of hospitals.

577
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:15,163
I hate them.

578
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:17,124
I'd rather go home and study.

579
00:40:17,207 --> 00:40:19,376
You're going to study?
You're fucking crazy.

580
00:40:19,459 --> 00:40:22,546
The world might recover from this
surprisingly quickly.

581
00:40:22,629 --> 00:40:26,174
If I study while they're distracted,
I'll get ahead of them.

582
00:40:32,514 --> 00:40:35,225
Go before it gets too dangerous.
I'll find my way home.

583
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:37,936
Okay, take care.
Let's head to the hospital.

584
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:41,106
Are you sure you'll be okay on your own?

585
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:42,858
Come on, Boozer.

586
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,113
It's "don't worry," you idiot.

587
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:51,533
You'd better go home and study hard.
Seems like you need it.

588
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,665
I will, so just get out of here, punk!

589
00:40:58,748 --> 00:40:59,708
What, punk?

590
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:03,211
Step on the gas, you moron.

591
00:41:07,174 --> 00:41:08,258
Wait.

592
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:11,386
-Hey, be careful.
-I will.

593
00:41:12,262 --> 00:41:13,471
Be careful out there.

594
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:18,685
No! Leave them alone!

595
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,369
Will he be okay?

596
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:46,671
By the way, what was his name?

597
00:41:50,217 --> 00:41:52,552
I should've gotten his name.

598
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:57,057
He was turning into a zombie.

599
00:41:57,891 --> 00:42:00,769
He couldn't have stayed
with us much longer.

600
00:42:02,771 --> 00:42:04,648
It's time we went our separate ways.

601
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,864
What an idiot.

602
00:42:20,497 --> 00:42:22,874
It's time we went our separate ways.

603
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:29,339
Hey, stop it. Stay back, damn it!

604
00:42:32,509 --> 00:42:33,760
You fuckers!

605
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:40,392
Damn, this is way easier than studying.
