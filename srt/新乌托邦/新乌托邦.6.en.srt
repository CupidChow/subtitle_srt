Please pull yourself together.

26
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:53,651

You're right.

-Yes?

30
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:17,216
What's the quickest way downstairs?

31
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:21,095
The elevator by the VIP lounge
is the quickest way down.

32
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:22,429
Okay.

33
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:24,848
And, sir...

34
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:29,395
I think you should hold on to these.

35
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,283
This weight is a lot to carry.

36
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:48,622

-Yes, sir.

41
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:05,305
Take it if you want to survive.

42
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,268
You have to fight for your own life now.

43
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:16,108

Hey, what are you doing?

143
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,936
-What?
-Wait.

144
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:51,646
Hold on.

145
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:56,193
Let's not jump to conclusions.
He might just be hurt.

146
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,527
What happened?

147
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,696
Isn't it obvious? I got bitten.

148
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,615
-What?
-Oh no.

149
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,367
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

150
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:05,702
-Hey!
-Calm down.

151
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,704
He said he was bitten.

152
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,499
We have to neutralize the threat
before he turns into a zombie.

153
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:11,708
He hasn't turned yet.

154
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,710
He didn't even attack us,
so lower your rifle!

155
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:17,380
-He's right. You should lower your rifle.
-Asshole.

156
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:20,759
Just focus on making it downstairs, okay?
Go ahead and put it down.

157
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:26,306
You know, I don't think
he should ride this elevator, either.

158
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,141
Let's just go down without him.

159
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:29,726
Hold on a second.

160
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,938
He did get bitten,
but he's perfectly fine.

161
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:35,148
So there's a chance he may not turn.

162
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:37,400
How long has it been?
Why don't you come with us--

163
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:39,694
I can't allow that. It's too risky.

164
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,741
Please let him. Can't we just...

165
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,911
-Please...
-It's fine.

166
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,664
Soo-jeong, I'm fine. Go on ahead.

167
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:53,708
It's just...

168
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,795
If you cry...

169
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,091
it'll make me really sad.

170
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:04,594
Don't cry, all right?

171
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:12,102
Wait, give me a second.

172

-Oh, god.

-Please, one more person!

183

190

You're joking, right?

260

-Open the door!

261
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,391

Come on, it's yummy.

269

Why did you do that?

270
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,013
We had plenty of time to let him in.

271
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:34,348
He was bitten, so he's a lost cause.

272
00:24:35,183 --> 00:24:37,768
And who knows
when he'll turn and attack us?

273
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:40,396
-Just pull yourself--
-Hold on.

274
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:41,480

277

These punks won't bite me.

278
00:24:56,621 --> 00:24:59,540
So, I don't think
I'll be dying anytime soon.

-I'm sorry, Mr. Park.
-No, you're fine.

328
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,591
We could deploy grenades

329

then make our escape
through the emergency stairs.

330

Not a good idea, sir.

331
00:30:47,263 --> 00:30:51,100

from the other floors.

332

00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:06,008
But if you promise me a date,
it might give me a reason to stay alive.

350
00:32:06,467 --> 00:32:09,094
If I had that to look forward to...

351
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:14,642
then maybe I'd find a way to survive.

352
00:32:25,361 --> 00:32:27,321
Okay, fine.

353
00:32:27,905 --> 00:32:31,200
I'll make sure
to make it out of here alive,

354
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:32,117
and then...

355
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,746
we'll go on that date.

356
00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:39,291
Wait, really? You can't take it back.

357
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,711
No matter what happens,
I'm going to stay alive.

358
00:32:44,088 --> 00:32:45,339
I swear.

359
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:49,551
You're silly.

360
00:32:57,851 --> 00:32:58,852
What the heck?

361
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:04,733
Okay.

362
00:33:08,946 --> 00:33:10,614
Why isn't this working?

363
00:33:11,115 --> 00:33:12,991
DEFECTIVE

364
00:33:13,367 --> 00:33:14,952
I can't catch a break today.

365
00:33:16,537 --> 00:33:17,663
<i>Young-joo.</i>

366
00:33:31,969 --> 00:33:34,263
I never thought it would come in handy,

367
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:37,015
but here I am,
putting my engineering degree to use.

368
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:39,268
<i>Young-joo.</i>

369
00:33:40,102 --> 00:33:44,148
Seriously, what?
Why do you keep saying my name?

370
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,555
MY NAME IS KANG YOUNG-JOO,
AND I'M BORROWING SOME EQUIPMENT

371
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:18,098
P.S. I HAD THE SOJU, NOODLES, AND CHIPS

372
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:32,154
I don't think we can go out there.

373
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:33,947
-Right?
-Huh?

374
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:35,741
Hey.

375
00:34:50,214 --> 00:34:52,007
-Private Lee.
-What?

376
00:34:53,801 --> 00:34:55,302
-Private Lee.
-What is it?

377
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:57,971
-I think we can escape through--
-Who's that?

378
00:34:58,472 --> 00:35:01,016
Hey, why is he out there?

379
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:02,559
Arron Park.

380
00:35:03,185 --> 00:35:05,312
-Hold on, I'll get the door.
<i>-No, stop!</i>

381
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,484
-What the...
<i>-The zombies don't bite me.</i>

382
00:35:11,235 --> 00:35:14,905
<i>Don't open the door.</i>
<i>You'll just be putting yourself at risk.</i>

383
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:17,032
What do you mean they don't bite you?

384
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,284
<i>I don't know. They just don't.</i>

385
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:23,789
There must be a reason
he hasn't turned yet.

386
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:27,584
<i>Anyway, I came to let you know</i>

387
00:35:27,668 --> 00:35:31,171
<i>there's a way to get downstairs</i>
<i>without going through the hallways.</i>

388
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:33,090
How?

389
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:35,133
<i>There should be a vent</i>
<i>in the middle of the room.</i>

390
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:40,472
<i>If you crawl through the ducts,</i>
<i>it'll take you downstairs.</i>

391
00:35:43,684 --> 00:35:46,144
<i>It's brilliant, isn't it?</i>

392
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:49,731
That's exactly what I was trying to say.

393
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:56,113
This is Private Lee Jae-yoon.
Sergeant Kim, Corporal Kwak, do you copy?

394
00:35:56,196 --> 00:35:58,365
This is Corporal Kwak.
Loud and clear, over.

395
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:01,577
Copy, I hear you.

396
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:07,082
<i>Allow me to brief you on the escape plan</i>
<i>that was discussed with Arron Park.</i>

397
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,668
You should see a vent
in the middle of your room.

398
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:14,631
Remove the grille and enlarge the opening
to allow a person to crawl through.

399
00:36:19,636 --> 00:36:22,973
Once the entrance is wide enough,
proceed through the vent.

400
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:27,352
The vents should be clear of zombies.

401
00:36:27,436 --> 00:36:31,356
<i>But just to be safe,</i>
<i>please proceed with caution.</i>

402
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:36,320
<i>The ducts will lead you to the main vent,</i>
<i>which will serve as our route down.</i>

403
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:39,114
<i>We'll use the ladder there</i>
<i>to get downstairs.</i>

404
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:43,827
<i>Based on the situation in the hallway,</i>
<i>this seems to be our best option.</i>

405
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:48,206
Roger that. We'll move out in 30 minutes.

406
00:36:49,082 --> 00:36:51,585
<i>Copy that. Removing the grille now.</i>

407
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:03,347
Sorry. Excuse me.

408
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:08,769
Coming through.

409
00:37:28,372 --> 00:37:33,251
I've warned Mrs. Kim time and time again
not to drink on the job.

410
00:37:39,967 --> 00:37:42,511
But she still stashed away three bottles.

411
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:19,339
<i>Do we just follow the ducts?</i>
<i>How do we know which way to go?</i>

412
00:38:19,423 --> 00:38:22,676
<i>Arron Park will be providing us</i>
<i>with the directions.</i>

413
00:38:23,343 --> 00:38:26,555
<i>He was there when they installed it,</i>
<i>so he knows his way around.</i>

414
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:30,809
<i>He will mark the direction with arrows,</i>

415
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:33,729
<i>so keep an eye out for them</i>
<i>and follow the markings.</i>

416
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:42,154
This is Private Lee Jae-yoon.
Message complete, over.

417
00:38:45,866 --> 00:38:49,578
Sergeant Kim, Corporal Kwak,
are you ready to proceed?

418
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:52,122
We're good to go.

419
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:54,082
This is Corporal Kwak. We're all set.

420
00:38:54,166 --> 00:38:57,669
I'll see you all on the other side!

421
00:38:59,463 --> 00:39:01,631
-That was good, right?
<i>-Roger that.</i>

422
00:39:01,715 --> 00:39:06,303
As Gye-young just said,
I'll see you all on the other side.

423
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:09,389
Consider that an order.

424
00:39:09,473 --> 00:39:10,807
<i>-Roger that!</i>
<i>-Roger that!</i>

425
00:39:10,891 --> 00:39:12,017
<i>Roger that!</i>

426
00:39:12,434 --> 00:39:13,518
Fucking idiots.

427
00:39:13,602 --> 00:39:17,147
All units, proceed to enter the vents.

428
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,658
Paolo, grab my hand!

429
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:39,252
Be careful.

430
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:42,756
Are you worried about me?

431
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,758
Quit messing around.

432
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:53,850
Kyung-sik, do you see any arrows?

433
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:57,020
Damn it.

434
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:00,774
Slow down, buddy. Wait for me.

435
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:05,278
Shit.

436
00:40:13,787 --> 00:40:16,164
Turn left.

437
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:31,763
You're all dead meat.

438
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:54,054
Young-joo!

439
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:57,682
Young-joo!

440
00:42:02,646 --> 00:42:03,647
Oh, no. It's blank.

441
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:06,191
There's no arrow.

442
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:09,486
You guys made it.

443
00:42:11,488 --> 00:42:12,822
Well done.

444
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:20,455
Go. Let's get out of here. It's so stuffy.

445
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:23,541
How much longer do we need to go?

446
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:25,126
Five minutes.

447
00:42:25,669 --> 00:42:28,046
We can do this. Now, let's move.

448
00:42:28,505 --> 00:42:30,215
Okay, let's push through.

449
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:33,301
My legs.

450
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:37,597
Go.

451
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:48,566
I don't see any arrows.

452
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:56,491
-Wait, Soo-jeong.
-What?

453
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:59,703
You're too tense right now.

454
00:42:59,786 --> 00:43:02,205
If you keep going like that,
you'll tire out quickly.

455
00:43:02,289 --> 00:43:04,124
So try to relax your body

456
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:08,753
and use your arms
to pull your body forward.

457
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:10,505
Like this.

458
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:12,090
Okay.

459
00:43:13,216 --> 00:43:14,217
Like this?

460
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:17,470
This is so much easier.

461
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:20,598
Right?

462
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:23,310
-Like this.
-Like this.

463
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:25,186
Like this.

464
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:30,025
You know, back at boot camp,
no one could beat me in the combat crawl.

465
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,276
Oh, my god.

466
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:34,237
-You need to relax your lower body.
-My lower body?

467
00:43:34,321 --> 00:43:38,199
Like this.

468
00:43:38,283 --> 00:43:39,659
What do you call this?

469
00:43:39,743 --> 00:43:41,745
-This is called the back crawl.
-I see.

470
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:43,913
You lie on your back...

471
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:45,790
What the...

472
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:14,736
Gye-young, snap out of it!
You said you'd take me out on a date!

473
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:18,907
Go that way! Now!

474
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:36,007
Don't stop! Keep going!

475
00:44:51,398 --> 00:44:55,402
-Young-joo!
-Young-joo!

476
00:44:57,529 --> 00:44:59,906
Oh, my god! Help!

477
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:03,993
Young-joo!

478
00:45:06,496 --> 00:45:09,207
Young-joo!

479
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:18,133
Oh, my god!
