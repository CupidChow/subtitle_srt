1
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:08,235
I can do this.

2
00:01:10,029 --> 00:01:11,322
I've got this.

3
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:14,116
Here I come!

4
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:22,166
Young-joo!

5
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:43,020
I made it.

6
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:47,066
I'm still alive!

7
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,292
Sergeant Ahn.

8
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,582
Hold on.

9
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:48,210
Hey, stop!

10
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:50,546
You're dead if we catch you!

11
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:56,427
Where did she go?

12
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,808
Where the hell is she?

13
00:03:06,145 --> 00:03:07,146
Damn, she's quick.

14
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:10,900
You're the one that's fucking slow.

15
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:11,859
Wait, over there.

16
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:13,569
I just saw her.

17
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,905
She's over there.

18
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:20,618
Come on out.
We'll just chop your head off.

19
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,828
I'm too tired for this, you fucking bitch!

20
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:25,497
Do we have to come and find you?

21
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:29,710
Just come out!

22
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:32,504
Oh, man.

23
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:39,845
Look, she's over there.

24
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:41,805
-There she is.
-She's right there.

25
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:45,309
I wonder where she is.

26
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:51,273
I can't find her!

27
00:03:51,357 --> 00:03:54,068
I guess we're screwed.

28
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:57,613
Where the fuck is she hiding?

29
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:00,032
Fine, let's go home!

30
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,369
Yeah, we should head back.

31
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:09,166
-Hey, I said we're going home!
-We're leaving!

32
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,172
There you are.

33
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,341
Get over here, you fucking bitch!

34
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,385
-Hey!
-Get her!

35
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,136
-Don't let her get away!
-Hurry!

36
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,763
Get over here, you bitch!

37
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:25,808
You fucking bitch,
I'm going to skin you alive!

38
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:29,228
You damn bitch!

39
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,067
That damn weasel.

40
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:52,292
Where are you?

41
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:56,255
She's in the last car. Let's box her in.

42
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:07,808
Get off me!

43
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,351
Soo-jeong!

44
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:13,897
Push them out the window!

45
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:22,031
-Arron Park!
-Private.

46
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,997
Send them this way!

47
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:31,206
Private Lee.

48
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,168
Over here!

49
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,545
-That's Private Lee!
-Lee Jae-yoon!

50
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:41,216
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Ra In-ho, Arron Park, I'm still alive!</font></i>

51
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:44,386
Is everyone okay?

52
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:48,390
Private Lee is alive and well down there!

53
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:49,808
We need to focus!

54
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:02,279
Shit.

55
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,887
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">I need all of you</font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">to listen to me carefully.</font></i>

56
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,682
Just think of it as a zip line.

57
00:06:32,101 --> 00:06:36,271
You're going to use your combat vests
to glide down the cable.

58
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:37,397
Hold on tight.

59
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:39,525
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">The first thing you need to do</font></i>

60
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:43,112
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">is to bring over the swing stage cable</font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">and secure it to the window frame.</font></i>

61
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,783
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Once it is secured,</font></i>

62
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:52,162
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">I'll detach the cable from the swing stage</font></i>

63
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:56,583
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">and drag it over to the truck</font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">across the intersection.</font></i>

64
00:06:57,376 --> 00:07:00,879
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Then, I'll secure the cable to the truck.</font></i>

65
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:04,842
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">This will create a zip line</font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">from the eighth floor to the ground.</font></i>

66
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:09,012
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">I'll also use the mattresses</font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">that are in the truck</font></i>

67
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:12,099
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">to create a safe landing spot.</font></i>

68
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:17,896
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">The mattresses will absorb the impact,</font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">so you have nothing to worry about.</font></i>

69
00:07:19,148 --> 00:07:22,401
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">As of now,</font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">this seems to be the safest way down.</font></i>

70
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,657
Come on down. Hurry!

71
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:32,244
What if our combat vests rip and we fall?

72
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:34,413
Our safety can't be guaranteed.

73
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:35,664
Hey, jackass.

74
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:39,084
If you want to deal with the zombies
outside that door, be my guest.

75
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:40,419
Come on down!

76
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:44,131
Fucking dumbass.

77
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,055
You've got it!

78
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:53,807
That's it!

79
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:58,854
There you go. That was excellent!

80
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:00,230
Good job.

81
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:05,903
-That punk is something else.
-It's safe. Come on down!

82
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,571
-Hey.
-Private Ra In-ho.

83
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:11,909
You've got this, In-ho!

84
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:15,037
-Ra In-ho!
-I don't think...

85
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,789
-You can do this!
-I don't think I can do this.

86
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:19,833
We don't have time for this.

87
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:24,588
Come on, let's go!

88
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,757
I just need a moment
to mentally prepare myself.

89
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,883
Hold on tight.

90
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:30,052
Oh, for god's sake.

91
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:32,846
Look at him go.

92
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,646
In-ho!

93
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:43,941
There you go. That's it!

94
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:55,452
I'm so happy to see you again, sir!

95
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,664
It's such a relief
to see that you're all right!

96
00:08:58,747 --> 00:08:59,998
Thank goodness!

97
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,961
What a fucking bromance.

98
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:07,214
That little bitch is so damn fast.

99
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:12,094
Hey, we're in the last car now!

100
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,263
Open the door.

101
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,056
Hell yeah, that's mine now.

102
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:23,730
Open the damn door, you bastard.

103
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:25,899
Shit.

104
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,953
You motherfuckers, get away from me!

105
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,248
Stay the fuck away! Back off!

106
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,022
Hey, over here.

107
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:08,984
Hurry, come this way.

108
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,040
This way.

109
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:30,714
-Next up!
-It's our turn now.

110
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,174
-Yeah, let's go.
-Okay.

111
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:33,884
-You're up, Soo-jeong.
-Okay.

112
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:34,968
You've got this.

113
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,765
-Mr. Park, are you okay?
-Hurry up!

114
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:41,725
Corporal Kwak!

115
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:45,312
-Go on.
-Okay.

116
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,522
-I've got your back.
-All right.

117
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:53,528
-Hold on.
-It's Soo-jeong.

118
00:10:53,612 --> 00:10:55,864
We don't have much time. Hurry!

119
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:00,911
Don't worry, Soo-jeong.
I've got your back.

120
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,539
I'm right behind you,
so just trust me and go.

121
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:05,874
What the hell?

122
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,586
Why are you acting all cheesy?

123
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,589
Oh, I guess this isn't your thing.

124
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:15,008
I'll try to cheese it down a bit.

125
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:16,426
Seriously?

126
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,138
Okay, fine. I appreciate it.

127
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,307
Keep me safe.

128
00:11:23,392 --> 00:11:25,477
-Yes, ma'am!
-Oh, my god.

129
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:30,941
Go!

130
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:35,320
Please.

131
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:38,698
You're doing great, Soo-jeong!

132
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:42,828
Soo-jeong.

133
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,288
-I did it.
-Are you okay?

134
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:46,998
Well done!

135
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:49,251
-That was great!
-Kwak Gye-young!

136
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,086
She's a real badass.

137
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:54,506
I'll be down in a sec, Soo-jeong!

138
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:04,182
You can go first.
I'll be right behind you.

139
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:06,393
Sure, I'll go first.

140
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,187
Okay.

141
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:12,774
-Wait, do you have a vest?
-See you down there.

142
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:19,448
You're almost here.

143
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:26,079
We're almost done.

144
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:28,540
Sergeant Kim, come on down.
It's not as bad as it looks!

145
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:32,627
-Hold on, whose vest is this?
-It's Sergeant Kim's.

146
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:33,545
What?

147
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:37,841
-Then...
-Sergeant Kim.

148
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:44,473
Sergeant Kim, how are you getting down?

149
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:47,934
-Sergeant Kim, hurry down!
-What are you waiting for?

150
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:52,898
-You've got this, sir!
-No, stop.

151
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,524
Hold up.

152
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:56,526
That knucklehead...

153
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:08,205
I don't have much time left.

154
00:13:08,872 --> 00:13:10,874
-What?
-What's he talking about?

155
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:13,460
I think...

156
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:18,465
it'd be better for me
to just stay up here.

157
00:13:25,597 --> 00:13:27,599
-Sergeant Kim!
-Sergeant...

158
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:31,019
Sergeant, just get down here first.

159
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:32,437
Just come down and...

160
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:34,606
-We need alcohol.
-Oh, right.

161
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:39,027
You'll be fine if you drink some alcohol.
That's how I'm still human.

162
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,571
-I promise we'll figure it out.
-Listen to him.

163
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:45,700
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Alcohol? Come on now.</font></i>

164
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:47,536
Wait, allow me.

165
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:52,624
You saw how Arron Park didn't turn,
and I promise you won't, either.

166
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:55,001
Please, just trust me on this.

167
00:13:56,628 --> 00:14:01,550
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">In-ho, I absolutely believe you,</font></i>

168
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:07,806

No, wait, Sergeant Kim.

172
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:40,922
Goddamnit.

173
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:49,306
It's safe here.

174
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:54,311
Be careful. Watch your step.

175
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:08,825
This way.

176
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,749
It's this way.

177
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:19,336
We're almost there.

178
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:27,719
Were they human when they died?

179
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:31,139
They must have been,
considering the amount of blood.

180
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:34,225
Those psychos from earlier
must have done it.

181
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,731
I feel terrible for them.

182
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:46,821
-Are you okay?
-What?

183
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:49,157
I'm sorry.

184
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:55,497
Come here.

185
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:02,379
Don't worry. It's safe in here.

186
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:11,554
We can take cover here for a bit
and go to Suseo Station together.

187
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:16,351
-Any luck, In-ho?
-I'll continue searching, sir.

188
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:19,437
-Oh, come on.
-I'm coming up with nothing.

189
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:37,706
I found it!

190
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:39,040
-You did?
-Really?

191
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:41,042
-Nice work!
-Good job!

192
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:46,131
I can take that.

193
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:49,384
-Let's get going.
-Hold on.

194
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:52,971
Where's Kyung-sik? He's not here.

195
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:55,849
Well...

196
00:16:56,975 --> 00:17:00,186
He just took off
without saying anything earlier.

197
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,148
Why are you telling me this now?

198
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,026
Shit.

199
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:14,492
We've already lost a lot of time,
so let's go to Suseo Station for now.

200
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:16,119
All right, let's go.

201
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:33,404
This kid got an award at boot camp.
He's top-tier.

202
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:38,326
-His name is...
-Private Hwang Kyung-sik!

203
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:41,913
You can't have a son who's also an ace.
That'd be too unfair.

204
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:44,916
I have a feeling
I'm going to end up with a geezer son.

205
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,919
You better knock on wood
before you jinx yourself, sir.

206
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:51,464
-Kyung-sik, right?
-Private Hwang Kyung-sik!

207
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:55,051
He's my son now.
You'd better not mess with him.

208
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,679
Listen, son. I'll be your pops in here.

209
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:00,807
Private Hwang Kyung-sik. Yes, sir!

210
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:11,484
Private Hwang Kyung-sik. Thank you, sir!

211
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:13,278
Eat up, son.

212
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:19,284
There you go. You're all set.

213
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:21,160
Private Hwang Kyung-sik.

214
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:24,706
-Thank you, sir.
-You don't need to thank me.

215
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:28,126
I wanted to polish your boots
before you went on your first leave.

216
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:31,796
I'll iron your uniform later
so it has the sharpest creases.

217
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:34,340
Oh, one more thing.

218
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:37,802
-Here you go.
-That's all right, sir.

219
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:41,139
Go on and take it.
Your birthday is coming up.

220
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:44,434
-So get yourself a snack.
-I'm okay, sir.

221
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:47,312
-Come on, just take it already.
-No, sir...

222
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:48,563
You punk.

223
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:55,153
Thank you.

224
00:19:58,865 --> 00:19:59,782
Pops.

225
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:09,727
Damn it.

226
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:37,630
Please pick up.

227
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:40,591

-Mom!

228
00:21:40,675 --> 00:21:43,511
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">-Young-joo!</font></i>
-Are you okay?

229
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:45,138
You're safe, right?

230
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:51,602
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Are you okay? Are you safe?</font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Where are you right now?</font></i>

231
00:21:51,686 --> 00:21:54,939
I'm at the Express Bus Terminal Station.

232
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:57,984
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Young-joo, is it safe over there?</font></i>

233
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,361
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">You're safe, right?</font></i>

234
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:04,490
Yes, I'm all right,
so don't worry about me.

235
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:08,453
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">-Why didn't you go to Jae-yoon?</font></i>
-It's a long story.

236
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:12,498
But a station attendant is helping me,
and I'm safe now.

237
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,293
So just stay home
and don't go anywhere, okay?

238
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,129
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Why in the world did you go there?</font></i>

239
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:21,507
I went to meet Jae-yoon,

240
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:23,968
but some things happened,
so I ended up here.

241
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:26,971
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">How are you going to come home?</font></i>

242
00:22:27,597 --> 00:22:29,307
It's too dark outside right now.

243
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,602
I'll go to Suseo Station in the morning
then head straight home.

244
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:33,686
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Where?</font></i>

245

248
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:43,529
Mom, I'll call you back later,
so please stay home.

249
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:44,781
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Okay.</font></i>

250
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,699

<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">-Be careful.</font></i>

251
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:47,617
I will.

252
00:22:50,244 --> 00:22:52,997
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

253
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:57,251
By the way, the phone is working.
You should call your family.

254
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:02,799
I'm okay. I'll call them later.

255
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:09,263
-Park Eun-chae?
-Pardon?

256
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:15,269
You saved my life,
so I feel like I should know your name.

257
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:16,562
SEOUL METRO
PARK EUN-CHAE

258
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,231
Right.

259
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,651
My name is Park Eun-chae.

260
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:22,652
Park Eun-chae.

261
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:23,778
What about you?

262
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:25,947
I'm Kang Young-joo.

263
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:29,075
-Nice to meet you, Young-joo.
-You too.

264
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,844
-I think it's blocked off.
-What?

265
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:50,304
-You should make a U-turn.
-Watch out.

266
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:52,014
-Corporal Kwak.
-Make a U-turn.

267
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:55,226
Damn, we can't go this way, either.

268
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:59,313
I'm sorry. I may not look it,
but I'm a country boy.

269
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:00,648
-Stop.
-Huh?

270
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:04,402
I should get off here.

271
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:05,987
-What?
-What?

272
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:09,115
I don't think
I can hold off for much longer.

273
00:24:10,324 --> 00:24:12,285
-Mr. Park.
-Are you sober?

274
00:24:15,997 --> 00:24:19,667
-What do we do now?
-We just need to get him some alcohol.

275
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:22,920
-We should find a convenience store...
-Right.

276
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:24,630
JIN PALACE

277
00:24:24,714 --> 00:24:26,132
That's a Chinese restaurant.

278
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:30,094
-They should have alcohol.
-Let's go in.

279
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:31,512
-Let's go.
-Get out.

280
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:36,392
I need alcohol.

281
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,318
Arron Park.

282
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:48,154
Are you okay?

283
00:24:55,286 --> 00:24:56,954
I think this place is safe.

284
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:13,554
Young-joo, please pick up.

285
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:25,858
Soo-jeong.

286
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:29,237
Look, it's sweet and sour pork.

287
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:32,615
-It's meat!
-Dig in.

288
00:25:37,245 --> 00:25:38,371
-Damn.
-It's so good.

289
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:39,664
-Look.
-It's the sauce.

290
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:41,624
-Do you dip or pour?
-I definitely dip.

291
00:25:41,707 --> 00:25:43,668
-Me too.
-Go ahead and dip it.

292
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:46,045
This is our first date
at a Chinese restaurant.

293
00:25:47,672 --> 00:25:51,008
How could you even say that
in a situation like this?

294
00:25:51,092 --> 00:25:54,637
Well, with everything going on,
everyone is just so serious.

295
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,640
I just wanted to ease the tension a bit.

296
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:00,351
Fine.

297
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:03,396
You have my permission.

298
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:07,984
You can keep the jokes coming
until this is all over.

299
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,068
Permission granted.

300
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:14,824
Hey, it's spicy seafood broth.
Heck yeah, score!

301
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,828
-Hey.
-What?

302
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:23,040
What's this?

303
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:26,252
Oh, my god! What is this?

304
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:29,046
Lower your voice. What's wrong with you?

305
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:33,551
-Is this your handle, Ms. Oh?
-What did you just call me?

306
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:36,429
Don't call me that. Just use my name.

307
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:37,596
Okay, Soo-jeong.

308
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,806
You got it, Soo-jeong!

309
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:43,561
You're unbelievable.
You don't waste any time, do you?

310
00:26:43,644 --> 00:26:45,104
Thank you so much for this.

311
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:53,404

drinking like this.

HANGOVER REMEDY

313
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:06,334
You're Arron Park, the man of legend.
You've got to stay strong.

314
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:08,294
You must stay alive.

315
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:12,173
You can never give up.

316
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:16,677
Okay.

317
00:27:18,012 --> 00:27:19,221
Thanks, Private.

318
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:23,392
I don't want to die, either.

319
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:34,779
It's a mix of liquor and red ginseng,
called "red liquor."

320
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:36,030
We're invincible now.

321
00:27:36,447 --> 00:27:37,448
Red liquor.

322
00:27:57,343 --> 00:27:58,719
I'll be there soon.

-Express Bus Terminal...

338
00:28:48,686 --> 00:28:49,687
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Jae-yoon?</font></i>

339
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:52,940
I'm here, ma'am.
Don't worry about Young-joo.

340
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:56,402
I'm going to find her,
and we'll come straight to you.

341
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:59,530
So don't go anywhere
and wait for us at home, okay?

342
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:03,284
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Okay. You stay safe, too.</font></i>

343
00:29:03,868 --> 00:29:06,454
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">-Be careful.</font></i>
-I'm a soldier.

344
00:29:06,537 --> 00:29:10,499
-I'll be fine, so don't worry.
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">-Okay.</font></i>

345
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:14,462
Just hang in there. We'll be there soon.

346
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,297
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Okay, bye.</font></i>

347
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:22,970
Hey, there's a kid outside.

348
00:29:23,471 --> 00:29:24,638
We need to help...

349
00:29:55,753 --> 00:29:57,922
I think things have quieted down now.

350
00:29:58,756 --> 00:30:00,758
Should we try going outside?

351
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,053
-Now?
-Yes.

352
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:06,889
We just need to lift the shutters.

353
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,183
The machine room is that way.

354
00:30:09,266 --> 00:30:13,020
I need to go over there
and turn the power back on to lift them.

355
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:16,106
There's always backup power
in case of emergencies.

356
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:21,362
-I'll go and check it out.
-Wait, I'll come with you.

357
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:25,866
Young-joo.

358
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:31,121
Do you know why co-pilots
don't eat the same meal?

359
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:33,249
What?

360
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:38,379
I'm saying it's safer to go alone.

361
00:30:40,256 --> 00:30:43,342
I'll be right back.
I just need to press the shutter button.

362
00:30:48,222 --> 00:30:51,976
I'm turning everything on,
so all the lights should come back on.

363
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:54,812
-Do you see the shutters over there?
-Yes.

364
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:57,022
Our mission is to go up that way.

365
00:30:57,398 --> 00:30:58,399
Got that?

366
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:06,907
I need a weapon. Let's see.

367
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:09,577
This will have to do.

368
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:18,752
Just wait a bit. I'll be right back.

369
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:40,858
Sir, get in.

370
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:43,777
You should go see your family as well.

371
00:31:50,451 --> 00:31:52,369
Instead of going to Suseo Station...

372
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,123
we should split up here.

373
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:01,086
It's been a privilege
to have you all as my companions,

374
00:32:02,004 --> 00:32:06,133
but I think it's time
for everyone to go home now.

375
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:11,221
Let's each go and protect...

376
00:32:14,475 --> 00:32:15,684
our loved ones.

377
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:21,523
JIN PALACE

378
00:34:08,464 --> 00:34:10,591
Damn zombie head!

379
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:24,021
Young-joo.

380
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:25,981
Kang Young-joo.

381
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:30,611
Young-joo.

382
00:34:31,195 --> 00:34:32,321
Damn it.

383
00:34:53,801 --> 00:34:57,346
No, stop. Don't come this way!

384
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,613
Young-joo!

385
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:19,868
Kang Young-joo!

386
00:35:24,164 --> 00:35:25,582
Young-joo!

387
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:28,794
Kang Young-joo!

388
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,090
Young-joo!

389
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:36,635
I'm here, Young-joo!

390
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:40,305
Kang Young-joo!

391
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:45,310

Jae-yoon!

393
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:56,446
Young-joo!

394
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:02,578
Young-joo!

395
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:07,416
Jae-yoon, I'm over here!

396
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:10,544
Young-joo.

397
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,761
Jae-yoon!

398
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:23,432
Jae-yoon!

399
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:26,894
Young-joo...

400
00:36:28,979 --> 00:36:29,980
Young-joo!

401
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:33,859
Young-joo.

402
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,580
Young-joo.

403
00:36:55,672 --> 00:37:00,093
Let go of me!
Let go, you fucking bastards!

404
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:11,021
Jae-yoon!

405
00:37:18,362 --> 00:37:19,613
Jae-yoon!

406
00:37:22,324 --> 00:37:25,077
Jae-yoon!

407
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:31,750
Young-joo.

408
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:33,752
Jae-yoon!

409
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:36,838
Young-joo.

410
00:37:39,508 --> 00:37:40,842
Jae-yoon!

411
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:42,344
Young-joo!

412
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:46,598
Young-joo.

413
00:37:51,228 --> 00:37:53,772
Young-joo!

414
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,193
Young-joo!

415
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:21,216
Young-joo.

416
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,638
Jae-yoon.

417
00:38:28,682 --> 00:38:29,599
Young-joo.

418
00:38:32,102 --> 00:38:33,103
Young-joo.

419
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,155
Jae-yoon.

420
00:38:49,745 --> 00:38:50,579
Young-joo.

421
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:58,503
Are you okay?

422
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:04,926
It's been a while
since we've seen each other,

423
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:08,305
and I look terrible, don't I?

424
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,350
You're beautiful.

425
00:39:20,442 --> 00:39:22,569
Even when you're covered in blood,
you're pretty.

426
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:25,447
Jae-yoon.

427
00:39:31,453 --> 00:39:33,914
What took you so long?

428
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,540
I'm sorry.

429
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,251
I'm sorry I took so long.

430
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:49,888
You're okay. You're with me now.

431
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:56,520
Come on.

432
00:39:59,523 --> 00:40:03,360
-Stick right by my side, okay?
-Okay, I will.

433
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:04,444
Damn it.

434
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:12,536
Shit.

435
00:40:14,121 --> 00:40:17,666
Hold on. I have one, too.

436
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:21,253
-What's that?
-It's my weapon.

437
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:32,180
What just happened?

438
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:07,591
-We did it.
-Yes, we did.

439
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:19,477
What's going on?

440
00:41:20,437 --> 00:41:22,731
What are you all doing here?

441
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,900
We're here to help you, sir.

442
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:28,195
We couldn't leave you behind
when you were in danger.

443
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:30,197
What about your families?

444
00:41:30,614 --> 00:41:32,365
Fortunately, they're all safe.

445
00:41:33,575 --> 00:41:37,454
Instead of splitting up,
we should move as a group.

446
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:42,292
Using the teamwork we've built,
we can visit our families one by one.

447
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:45,170
That seems to be our best option for now.

448
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:49,132
Who are all these people?

449
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:54,763
They're my friends.

450
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:04,105
Hello.

451
00:42:05,941 --> 00:42:08,235
You've got quite a lot on you.

452
00:42:09,069 --> 00:42:11,863
Now that we've regrouped,
we should head out.

453
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:14,032
-Young-joo.
-Yes?

454
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:15,075
Should we head out?

455
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:20,163
Let's wait a little longer for Eun-chae.
She should be back soon.

456
00:42:22,499 --> 00:42:24,542
We scouted the area but found no one.

457
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:26,503
Did she go off by herself?

458
00:42:26,586 --> 00:42:29,881
Yes, she said she'd be back
as soon as she lifted the shutters.

459
00:42:30,632 --> 00:42:32,175
I packed up all the food.

460
00:42:32,926 --> 00:42:36,388
If you don't mind me asking,
how did you get in here?

461
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:38,139
Eun-chae saved me.

462
00:42:38,223 --> 00:42:40,850
I came in here
because she said it was safe.

463
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:46,606
So you're saying
Ms. Park left to lift the shutters?

464
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:47,899
Yes, that's right.

465
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:52,279
Then, for how long
have those bodies been out there?

466
00:42:52,654 --> 00:42:57,200
Well, they were already there
when I first got here.

467
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,411
Oh, I see.

468
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:04,541
May I have a word with you, Private Lee?

469
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:06,334
What?

470
00:43:08,003 --> 00:43:09,462
What's wrong with you?

471
00:43:16,177 --> 00:43:17,804
SEOUL METRO
PARK EUN-CHAE

472
00:43:18,263 --> 00:43:19,222
Park Eun-chae?

473
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,192
-Maybe they just got her.
-No, sir.

474
00:43:31,276 --> 00:43:34,070
I am certain she's been dead
for at least ten hours.

475
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:36,573
-Then Young-joo--
-What's up?

476
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:42,203
-What is it?
-It's nothing. Don't worry about it.

477
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:44,372
I just remembered.

478
00:43:44,456 --> 00:43:48,376
I saw a lady in a uniform
sprint out of the station earlier.

479
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:50,170
That must've been Ms. Park.

480
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:53,298
-What's going on?
-Really? Thank goodness.

481
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:54,466
Right.

482
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:56,634
Why didn't you say so earlier?

483
00:43:56,718 --> 00:43:58,595
-Thank goodness.
-My apologies, sir.

484
00:43:59,179 --> 00:44:00,388
-Young-joo.
-Yes?

485
00:44:00,472 --> 00:44:03,099
-We should also get out of here.
-Okay.

486
00:44:08,355 --> 00:44:09,773
-It'll be okay.
-This way.

487
00:44:09,856 --> 00:44:11,107
-Stick close.
-Whatever.

488
00:44:11,191 --> 00:44:12,400
We need to go left.

489
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:18,198
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">My name is Park Eun-chae.</font></i>

490
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:39,988
I bet you can't even imagine
what I've been through.

491
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:44,075
It all feels like a dream.

This is for you.

495
00:45:59,466 --> 00:46:00,425
What is this?

496
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:04,304
Where did you get this?

497
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:09,392
-It's even autographed.
-I got this in person.

498
00:46:11,019 --> 00:46:14,314
That's ridiculous. Stop messing with me.

499
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:17,650
-I'm not. Your name is right there.
-Stop lying to me.

500
00:46:17,734 --> 00:46:20,028
Where would you meet him right now?

501
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:23,531
He's at Express Bus Terminal now.
I even heard him sing live.

502
00:46:25,408 --> 00:46:27,327

-I swear.

00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:40,548
-Look, it's Yoon Jong-shin's autograph.
-Cool.

508
00:46:40,632 --> 00:46:43,301
-Look at it carefully.
-That's cool.

512
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,022
It's Han River!

513
00:46:56,105 --> 00:46:58,566
-It's so pretty.
-Should we make a quick stop?

514
00:46:58,650 --> 00:46:59,734
-Yes.
-Let's get off.

515
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:00,652
Here?

516
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:02,403
Okay, let's take in the view.

517
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:04,614
-Let's step out.
-Wait, Young-joo.

518
00:47:04,697 --> 00:47:08,409
-Be careful.
-Worry about yourself.

519
00:47:08,493 --> 00:47:11,329
-The air feels fresh.
-It's beautiful.

520
00:47:12,539 --> 00:47:14,123
-It's nice.
-Look at the sun.

521
00:47:14,207 --> 00:47:15,833
-Soo-jeong.
-Yes?

522
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:20,255
Jeez, this area is also a mess.

523
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:44,112
We're not breaking up, are we?

524
00:47:54,581 --> 00:47:56,708
We don't have a reason
to break up anymore.

525
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:02,088
There's no more military service,
graduation, or employment.

526
00:48:04,132 --> 00:48:05,383
That's true.

527
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:09,095
But you know...

528
00:48:11,431 --> 00:48:13,725
even if things were
the way they were before,

529
00:48:15,727 --> 00:48:17,478
I'd never break up with you.

530
00:48:20,523 --> 00:48:22,150
No matter what happens,

531
00:48:23,151 --> 00:48:26,904
I promise to keep you safe.

532
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:33,953
No, I'm going to keep you safe.

533
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:37,373
Whatever.

534
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:47,383
That scared me.

535
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:53,306
We should get going now.
It's not over yet.

536
00:48:53,389 --> 00:48:54,474
Look at this guy.

537
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:56,476
-Let's go.
-Move it.

538
00:48:57,602 --> 00:48:59,395
-Come on, Jae-yoon.
-Hurry up.

539
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:04,442
Hurry up.

540
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:05,818
What was that?

541
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:08,404
-Drive!
-Hurry!

542
00:49:08,488 --> 00:49:09,822
Here we go!

543
00:49:09,906 --> 00:49:12,367
-Off to Ra In-ho's house!
-Sounds good to me.

544
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:15,036
-Let's go!
-Ha-yul, Daddy's coming home!
