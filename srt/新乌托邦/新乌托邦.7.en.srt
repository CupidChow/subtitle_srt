1
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:20,706
Hurry!

2
00:01:25,503 --> 00:01:28,464
-Soo-jeong.
-Hurry up.

3
00:01:29,298 --> 00:01:30,424
Keep going.

4
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:32,259
Soo-jeong!

5
00:01:32,343 --> 00:01:34,678
Go! Hurry!

6
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:36,096
Fuck!

7
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:38,432
What the hell?

8
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:40,434
The zombies!

9
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,186
Get moving!

10
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,021
-Go back!
-Damn it, move!

11
00:01:46,357 --> 00:01:49,318
Why are you doubling back?

12
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:51,111
-Zombies!
-What?

13
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:54,031
-It's the zombies!
-Move!

14
00:01:56,075 --> 00:01:57,618
Which way do we go?

15
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,286
Let's go this way.

16
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:04,583
Be careful.

17
00:02:08,254 --> 00:02:10,047
Why did you stop?

18
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,509
It's a dead end.

19
00:02:20,558 --> 00:02:21,433
Shit.

20
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,603
Kyung-sik, where are you going?

21
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:29,191
What's he doing?

22
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:31,777
AUTO

23
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:33,696
Get down!

24
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:45,332
Hold on. What was that?

25
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,543
Requesting status, over.

26
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:51,171
What's happening, Sergeant Kim?
Corporal Kwak?

27
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:56,468
-Those were gunshots, right?
-It sounded like it, sir.

28
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:58,262
-We need to go help them.
-Stop.

29
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:03,225
-Going there won't change anything.
-He's right.

30
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:06,270
It's too dangerous to go back,
and it'll lower our chances of survival.

31
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,731
We have to trust
they'll make it out alive.

32
00:03:12,902 --> 00:03:15,654
-Hey.
-Let's go! It's our asses on the line.

33
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:18,490
There's no time to waste, you morons.

34
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,577
Paolo.

35
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:37,843
Oh, my god!

36
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:44,850
Fuck!

37
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:50,230
{\an8}This isn't a fair fight!

38
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:52,650
I don't care if this isn't fair!

39
00:03:55,653 --> 00:03:57,863
Young-joo!

40
00:03:59,657 --> 00:04:02,952
{\an8}Tools are a no-no!

41
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:05,454
Don't get cute with me,
or I swear I'll kill you.

42
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,876
Young-joo!

43
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,606
Young-joo!

44
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:39,655
-Damn it!
-Young-joo!

45
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:42,157
Stop following me, you zombie freaks!

46
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,921
Oh, my god.

47
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,852
Young-joo!

48
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:31,457
I'm okay.

49
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,002
I just need a little break.

50
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:38,338
Ten minutes.

51
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:40,799
Just ten minutes.

52
00:05:47,056 --> 00:05:47,973
Hey.

53
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,657
-Paolo!
-Help me!

54
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:08,869
Paolo!

55
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,215
My ear!

56
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:24,885
{\an8}Could things get any worse?

57
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:31,517
Paolo.

58
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:35,395
-Are you all right?
-Help me.

59
00:06:37,106 --> 00:06:38,524
Hold on.

60
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:42,194
-He was bitten too close to the head.
-I get it.

61
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:46,073
But Arron Park hasn't turned yet,
so maybe he won't either.

62
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,157
Just hold your fire.

63
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,077
-There's no time.
-Wait.

64
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:53,372
Please help me.

65
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:55,207
-I have an idea.
-Help me.

66
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,002
Hold on to him!

67
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:02,297
Paolo, if you drink this,
you'll be fine like me.

68
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:05,008
But he was bitten too close to the head.

69
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,885
We can't just give up on him.

70
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:10,973
-Paolo.
-Paolo.

71
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:13,016
-Is he okay?
-Hey!

72
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,101
Paolo...

73
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,271
Paolo.

74
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:19,565
Push him!

75
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,944
-I'm sorry!
-I'm sorry!

76
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:28,073
-Paolo!
-Paolo!

77
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:35,789
Damn it.

78
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:42,629
Shit.

79
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,938
-Zombies?
-Fuck.

80
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,410
Fuck.

81
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,251
Shit.

82
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,717
Fall back, Kyung-sik!

83
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,348
For fuck's sake.

84
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,203
Fucking hell.

85
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,545
Dear valued guests, come this way!

86
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:09,091
I'm the chief manager of Eden Hotel,
and I will personally assist all of you.

87
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,761
Welcome.

88
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:56,596
Jae-yoon!

89
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,985
I was so scared.

90
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:12,612
I had to take on the zombies by myself.

91
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:16,491
What about you?
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

92
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:22,039
What's wrong? You're acting weird.

93
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,671
Young-joo.

94
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,512
You have to kill me. There's no time.

95
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:40,682
How am I supposed to kill you?

96
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,440
Hurry up and kill me.

97
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,151
Do it, Young-joo.

98
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,183
We're over here.

99
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:30,524
Good to see you guys.

100
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:33,110
Hey, where's Paolo?

101
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,421
There are zombies below,
so we can't go any farther.

102
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:53,922
-Come to where I am.
-Okay.

103
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,674
Watch your step as you go down.

104
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,843
Arron Park, lend me a hand.

105
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:01,221
-Please move faster.
-Be careful.

106
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:02,973
-Turn the corner and head out.
-Okay.

107
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,524
No zombies. All clear.

108
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,432
-Soo-jeong.
-Be careful.

109
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,311
I got it.

110
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:51,480
Thank you.

111
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,154
What happened to your arm?

112
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:02,657
It's nothing. It's just a small scratch.

113
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:04,659
It looks like a gunshot wound.

114
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:06,995
Yeah, but it's fine. Seriously, I'm okay.

115
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,080
Come here.

116
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:11,875
For fuck's sake.

117
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:18,924
You fucking psycho.
Why'd you open fire in a confined area?

118
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:22,844
Gye-young, that's enough.
We'd all be dead if it weren't for him.

119
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,972
Still, he took it too far.

120
00:13:26,056 --> 00:13:28,850
He's lucky the bullet only grazed her,
but what if it hit her?

121
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:31,269
She could've died, sir!

122
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:34,231
Fucking bastard,
you just won't shut up, will you?

123
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,148
Hey.

124
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:37,067
What did you say?

125
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,030
Are you fucking deaf?

126
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,909
I said you won't shut the fuck up,
you bastard.

127
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,702
Are you fucking begging to die?

128
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:49,246
-Hey.
-So what?

129
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,456
-What are you going to do?
-Knock it off.

130
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,584
-What's gotten into you, son?
-Don't fucking call me that!

131
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:57,629
I'm not your fucking son!

132
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,173
Hey.

133
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:02,968
What's wrong with you?

134
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:07,806
Screw this!

135
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:16,273
Don't you get it?

136
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:22,487
This isn't fucking boot camp,
so stop acting like it is.

137
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:25,532
None of this crap matters anymore!

138
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:28,827
The world's going down in flames,
you dumb fucks!

139
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:33,748
Fucking asshole.

140
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:39,296
Kwak Gye-young, do you want to die?

141
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,966
How about I put a bullet
in that fucking brain of yours?

142
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,302
-That's enough, Hwang Kyung-sik!
-Or what, fucker?

143
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:47,262
If you want to live, shut the fuck up.

144
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:48,972
No, you put that down if you want to live.

145
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:55,854
You'd better put that down
before I put a hole through your skull!

146
00:14:57,772 --> 00:14:59,232
Relax, Soo-jeong.

147
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:01,776
I was just kidding.

148
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,571
It was a joke.

149
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:19,044
Can't you guys just take a joke?

150
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:21,755
-Huh?
-You fucking psycho.

151
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,173
Corporal Kwak, hold on.

152
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,513
Hey, you.

153
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:35,560
You can ignore our ranks if you want.

154
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,188
I just won't consider you my subordinate.

155
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:42,651
Whatever.

156
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:48,823
Hey, guys.

157
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:52,786
We have no time to waste here.

158
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:55,163
We have to get out of here
as soon as possible.

159
00:15:56,081 --> 00:16:00,293
There's a cargo elevator
for transporting construction materials.

160
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:02,754
It's directly connected
to the basement parking.

161
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:05,090
So if we find that, we can go downstairs.

162
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,802
Let's spread out and find that elevator.

163
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:11,137
All right. Spread out.

164
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:13,181
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

165
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:08,319
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">I feel as if I were born again</font></i>

00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,658

-Who is she?

175
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,542
Yoon Jong-shin!

176
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:07,545
Are you safe?

177
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:15,929
So...

178
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,265
What are we supposed to do now?

179
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:33,404
Private Lee, you need to see this.

180
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:35,615
What is it this time?

181
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:37,367
What?

182
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:43,706
It's a swing stage.

183
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,918
Look, even the lights are on.

184
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:49,420
-It looks like it's working.
-I see that.

185
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:51,840
We can take that down to the first floor.

186
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:53,174
Yes, I think so.

187
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:56,427
If one of us could climb down there,

188
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:59,931
we could get it to work
and go downstairs in no time.

189
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:01,683
And who will?

190
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:03,560
Who will climb down?

191
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,438
Who?

192
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:09,566
I mean...

193
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:13,152
Who's going to do it?

194
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,280
Any volunteers?

195
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:21,995
I knew it.

196
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:29,294
Thank you.

197
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:32,088
I drank too much.

198
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,551
Shit.

199
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,596
What? "Are you safe?"

200
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:43,016
That's how we greet one another.
"Are you safe?"

201
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:45,435
Oh, are you safe?

202
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:48,563
What are you doing here, Mr. Yoon?

203
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:51,441
If you want to die, die on your own.

204
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:54,527
-I'm sorry.
-What she means is, keep the doors shut.

205
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:56,321
I see.

206
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:58,698
I was on my way to an award ceremony.

207
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:02,201
-I must look a bit silly.
-No, you look fine.

208
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,245
You're welcome here.

209
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:07,790
Shall we have another drink?

210
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:12,670
Don't get any ideas and just stay here.
It's the only way you'll survive.

211
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:16,799
What shall I sing next?

212
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,198
Wait. Hold on.

213
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:04,889
Oh no!

214
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:06,683
Are you okay, Jae-yoon?

215
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,184
-Jae-yoon!
-Are you okay?

216
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,561
-Are you all right, sir?
-Is everything okay?

217
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:12,271
-Are you okay?
-Say something!

218
00:21:12,355 --> 00:21:15,233
Talk to me! I need a response!

219
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:18,778
This is Private Lee Jae-yoon. I'm fine.

220
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:20,863
Thank goodness.

221
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:51,477

00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:51,662
Young-joo.

234
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:56,209
Young-joo, I...

235
00:22:58,503 --> 00:23:02,006
I really want to ask you to wait for me
until I finish my service in the army.

236
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,345
But I don't have the guts to.

237
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:14,102
If for some reason...

238
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:17,480
we end up breaking up...

239
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:23,152
I won't blame you.

240
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:29,867
If you're happy, that's enough for me.

241
00:23:35,123 --> 00:23:36,874
Whatever happens between us...

242
00:23:44,382 --> 00:23:46,384
just know that you mean the most to me.

243
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,264
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">That will never change.</font></i>

248
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:16,789
Private Lee, flip the switch upwards.

249
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:18,791
-Take your time.
-Flip the switch.

250
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:20,501
Please.

251
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,213
Please work.

252
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:31,596
It's working!

253
00:24:34,182 --> 00:24:36,100
-Yes!
-It's working!

254
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:43,399
Thank you!

255
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,527
Private Lee, you're our hero!

256
00:24:50,281 --> 00:24:51,991
A strap for the chainsaw.

257
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:01,083
Nice, I got a scooter.

258
00:25:11,886 --> 00:25:13,054
I'm ready.

259
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:17,600
Hey.

260
00:25:21,938 --> 00:25:24,357
I hope you're happy wherever you are.

261
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:26,025
And stay safe.

262
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:30,071
I hope you all stay safe.

263
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:32,198
-Take care.
-Stay safe.

264
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:33,324
Stay safe.

-Jae-yoon.

267
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,126
It's okay.

268
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,254
We're almost there.

269
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:35,636
That's it.

270
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,140
-In-ho, I can see the ground.
-I see it, too.

271
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:40,891
-Take deep breaths.
-We're here.

272
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,394
We're almost there.

273
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:46,230
-We're nearly at the bottom.
-Take deep breaths.

274
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:50,985
-Mr. Park.
-What's happening?

275
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:52,820
Is this safe? Will we be okay?

276
00:26:53,863 --> 00:26:55,364
They said they would fix it.

277
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:57,700
-What? When?
-Shit.

278
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:00,911
Today.

279
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:03,622
-Come on, man.
-Are you serious?

280
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:06,292
Hold on tight.

281
00:27:07,335 --> 00:27:08,711
We're almost there.

282
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:12,465
Look down. We're almost there.

283
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,593
There we go. We're so close!

284
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:18,137
-Please, just a bit more.
-Please.

285
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:22,892
-What happened?
-What's going on?

286
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:25,061
-Why did it stop?
-What the fuck?

287
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:26,312
What do we do?

288
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:29,148
-What's wrong with this?
-Don't move unless you must.

289
00:27:29,231 --> 00:27:31,025
-Why did it stop?
-Private Lee, do something.

290
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:32,109
Hold up!

291
00:27:32,902 --> 00:27:34,070
I studied engineering.

292
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,572
-You did?
-That's right. He did.

293
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,199
-Can he fix it?
-Of course.

294
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:39,533
-I knew it.
-Nice.

295
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:42,828
-What is it?
-It should work in a bit.

296
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:43,871
Are you serious?

297
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:45,331
This is bad.

298
00:27:46,624 --> 00:27:48,626
-Engineering, my ass.
-What now?

299
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:49,877
Fucking fix it.

300
00:27:51,045 --> 00:27:52,505
We're almost there, though!

301
00:27:58,427 --> 00:27:59,345
What the hell?

302
00:28:01,806 --> 00:28:03,099
Hey, don't.

303
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:06,060
Go away. This son of a...

304
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,855
-Go away.
-Is he trying to break the window?

305
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:10,898
Go away, asshole.

306
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:26,747
The other zombies are coming.

307
00:28:27,415 --> 00:28:29,083
There's no time!

308
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:31,710
-Get it to work now!
-Private Lee!

309
00:28:31,794 --> 00:28:33,712
-Fix it!
-Work, damn it!

310
00:28:37,466 --> 00:28:39,385
-What?
-It's working!

311
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:40,970
-Yes, it worked!
-You did it!

312
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:45,224
-You fixed it!
-Hurray for mechanical engineering!

313
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:47,601
We're almost there! A bit more to go!

314
00:28:47,685 --> 00:28:49,854
I'm so relieved.

315
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:56,026
What the hell?

316
00:28:57,278 --> 00:28:58,446

-Toss him over!

Ra In-ho, flip him!

329

-Soo-jeong!
-Throw him over!

330

Will you fucking let go?

331
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:28,095
Let go, asshole.

332
00:31:35,019 --> 00:31:36,228
Watch out!

333
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:53,037
Get off the lift!

334
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,164
-Hurry!
-Move it!

335
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:58,834
-Get moving!
-Private Lee, sir!

336
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,711
-Climb up.
-Be quick.

337
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:04,048
-Hurry up.
-Jump over.

338
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:05,591
Be careful.

339
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:10,179
No!

354
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:44,142
There's no way he survived the fall!

355
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:47,396
-So quit acting all dramatic.
-You son of a bitch.

356
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:50,899
Is this a joke to you?

357
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:52,025
He...

358
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:55,195
He ended up like that, trying to save us!

359
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:58,365
He's not the only one that died.

360
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:02,953
You didn't say anything then,
so why are you worked up now?

361
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:04,746
Stop it, Hwang Kyung-sik!

362
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:25,100
Lee Jae-yoon?

363
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:28,812
He's dead.

364
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:32,441
-He's dead!
-Hey.

365
00:36:44,453 --> 00:36:45,537
Don't cause a scene.

366
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:49,917
Our priority is to get out of here alive
as fast as we can.

367
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:58,008
Don't even think of doing anything stupid
because of a dead person!

368
00:37:03,347 --> 00:37:06,433
-That piece of shit.
-Let it go.

369
00:37:09,937 --> 00:37:10,896
That's enough.

370
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:47,641
Hey, who are you?

371
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:50,352
What the fuck are you doing?

372
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:53,021
Stop it. What do you want?

373
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:56,400
Will you fucking stop? Who are you?

374
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,779
Crazy bastard. What was that for?

375
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:03,824
Who are you?

376
00:38:04,408 --> 00:38:05,450
Damn you.

377
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:09,746
Fuck.

378
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:23,760
Where did it go?

379
00:38:34,855 --> 00:38:35,856
{\an8}Young-joo.

380
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:50,388
Hold on. I'm not a monster.

381
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:51,723
I'm human.

382
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:57,813
I'm sorry if I startled you.

383
00:39:58,355 --> 00:39:59,689
It's okay.

384
00:40:01,691 --> 00:40:04,486
What are you doing here all by yourself?

385
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:07,614
Well...

386
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:11,743
I lost my daughter.

387
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:13,370
What?

388
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,372
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Young-joo.</font></i>

389
00:40:19,376 --> 00:40:20,585
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Run away.</font></i>

390
00:40:22,379 --> 00:40:25,048
-We're done on this side.
-We cut off all the heads.

391
00:40:25,132 --> 00:40:27,217
They're so fucking hard to cut off.

392
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:30,137
-Who is that?
-What's that?

393
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,597
-Are you all right, sir?
-What do we have here?

394
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:35,433
-Are you alone? It's just a girl.
-Who is she?

395
00:40:35,517 --> 00:40:38,311
-Is that a real person?
-Where are you going?

396
00:40:40,522 --> 00:40:42,482
-Strike!
-Nice one.

397
00:40:42,566 --> 00:40:43,942
It was a bull's-eye.

398
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:46,778
-What is she doing over here?
-She's squirming.

399
00:40:48,989 --> 00:40:50,323
Shit, look what she's got.

400
00:40:50,407 --> 00:40:53,076
-Is this for real?
-No way.

401
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,370
What do you think you're doing?

402
00:40:55,453 --> 00:41:00,333
I see a lot of blood but no wounds.

403
00:41:00,417 --> 00:41:02,127
What should we do with her, sir?

404
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:06,089
There's no way she's okay
with that much blood on her.

405
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:09,342
We saw many others turn like that.

406
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:12,554
Do what needs to be done.

407
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:15,265
Yes, sir. You heard him.

408
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:19,227
-Chop it off.
-Yes, sir.

409
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:22,105
Fuck, that damn movie
about Texas and a chainsaw.

410
00:41:22,189 --> 00:41:24,524
I've always fucking wanted to try this.

411
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:29,654
Here goes.

412
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:39,539
Did you throw this?
We'll give you ten seconds.

413
00:41:39,623 --> 00:41:41,208
Ten, nine...

414
00:41:41,291 --> 00:41:43,376
-Fuck it, just get on with it.
-Damn it.

415
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:50,217
Ra In-ho!

416
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:54,721
Sergeant Kim Young-man!
Corporal Kwak Gye-young!

417
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:30,317
I can do this.

418
00:43:32,068 --> 00:43:33,403
I've got this.

419
00:43:34,195 --> 00:43:36,197
Here I come!

420
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:42,203
Young-joo!
