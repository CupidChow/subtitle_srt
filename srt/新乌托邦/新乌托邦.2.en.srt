{\an8}BASED ON THE NOVEL "INFLUENZA"
BY HAN SANG-WOON

2
00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:07,943
Corporal Jeon!

3
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:10,070
Shouldn't we do something about that?

4
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:14,950
Put that down!

5
00:01:15,034 --> 00:01:17,119
The admin officer will give us hell
if you fire that.

6
00:01:17,203 --> 00:01:19,413
But we're soldiers.
We have to do something!

7
00:01:19,497 --> 00:01:20,664
I know. Just hold on a sec.

8
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:21,916
-I can shoot it.
-You can't!

9
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,125
I'm going to shoot it!

10
00:01:25,628 --> 00:01:27,463
-Lower your rifle!
-How can I?

11
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:29,423
-We have to do something!
-Do not fire!

12
00:01:29,507 --> 00:01:30,382
What do we do?

13
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,009
They're coming this way.

14
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,719
-They're coming toward us.
-I see that!

15
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:34,720
-In-ho!
-Yes?

16
00:01:34,804 --> 00:01:36,514
-They're headed straight for us!
-Sir!

17
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:53,072
No!

18
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:54,949
They need to stop!

19
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:34,321
What is that? What the fuck?

20
00:02:34,405 --> 00:02:35,906
Is it a terrorist attack?

21
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,033
What the heck was that?

22
00:02:38,117 --> 00:02:40,286
What about the people down there?

23
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:41,620
-Damn it.
-Really?

24
00:02:41,704 --> 00:02:43,205
-Sir!
-This is an emergency!

25
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:44,248
Hey.

26
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:47,042
We should go back, right?
This is a state of emergency.

27
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:51,005
If we're facing a state of emergency,

28
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:53,632
we should buy gas first
before returning to base.

29
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:55,801
-You just want the donuts, don't you?
-No, sir!

30
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,094
Okay, fine.

31
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,721
Let's get that gas and head back.

32
00:02:58,804 --> 00:02:59,763
-Excuse us!
-Move!

33
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:01,390
-It's a state or emergency!
-Move it!

34
00:03:18,616 --> 00:03:21,327
He popped up out of nowhere.
We're not even at a crosswalk.

35
00:03:23,704 --> 00:03:24,580
Sir...

36
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,418
Do something about this.

37
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:30,836
Hey, don't give that to me!

38
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,005
Get that thing away from me!

39
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:40,137
Why did you do that?

40
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:54,485
Hold on a second.

41
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,528
Insurance...

42
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,448
I need to call the insurance...

43
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,996
Hey, are you okay?

44
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,414
He's still alive, right?

45
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:10,793
Damn it.

46
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:15,506
GOOD AFTERNOON BAKERY

47
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:39,029
Hurry, get out.

48
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:40,072
Me?

49
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:40,990
Why?

50
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:43,283
Seriously? We can't just leave him here.

51
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:45,160
Hurry up. Help me pull him out.

52
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:48,205
Just give me a second.
I need to call the insurance company.

53
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:49,623
Damn it.

54
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,512
-Hey, press the lobby button.
-Yes, sir.

55
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:05,389
Excuse me. Please hold the elevator.

56
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:09,101
Close it. Enemy aircraft, nine o'clock.

57
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:10,144
What the heck?

58
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:14,606
Damn it!

59
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,858
I'm sorry, sir.

60
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,234
We're screwed.

61
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,341
Did you see that plane crash?

62
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:43,302
Yes, we did.

63
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,597
Then you must know
we're in a state of emergency.

64
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,350
Shouldn't you return to base
instead of lounging around in the hotel?

65
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:52,561
Actually,

66
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:54,855
we're in the middle of a mission.

67
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,233
If so, shouldn't you be more discreet?

68
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:01,153
Your station here is classified intel.

69
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:04,448
But you're using the guest elevator
as if you want to be seen.

70
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:10,871
From what I've seen,
there is no sense of protocol.

71
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:14,541
Then, get our elevator fixed already.
This is stressful for us as well.

72
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,960
We can only make the call.
We're not repairmen.

73
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,964
Until then, shouldn't you use
the emergency stairs?

74
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:25,594
Has eating the hotel food made you soft?

75
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:27,179
I just can't believe

76
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,140
-how sluggish you all are.
-Hold on.

77
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:33,435
We only eat the hotel food
because you won't let us cook.

78
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,561
Of course.

79
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:36,980
What if there's a fire?
Who will take responsibility?

80
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,941
Do you think we're here
to play around with fire...

81
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:42,569
or something?

82
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:45,489
What's going on?

83
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:52,204
-Breathe.
-Central elevator two is down.

84
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:53,705
This is Arron Park speaking.

85
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,210
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">We're checking it now.</font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Please wait a moment.</font></i>

86
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,546
Please take care of it
as swiftly as possible.

87
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:13,684
Let's avoid
causing each other discomfort...

88
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:17,062
by sticking to the protocol.

89
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:20,357
Damn you!

90
00:07:27,156 --> 00:07:28,323
It's working again!

91
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:29,616
Thank goodness.

92
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:32,870
That was so scary.

93
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,134
Watch out!

94
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:48,427
Get away!

95
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:51,638
What's going on?

96
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,140
-Sir?
-Private Lee?

97
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:57,269
What is going on?

98
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,025
What the heck?

99
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,536
Hey, lady!

100
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,413
Please give me a hand!

101
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:20,334
Hey, red car! Help me pull him out!

102
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:23,879
You with the black hat and a corn dog!

103
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,881
Mr. Corn Dog! Help me!

104
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:27,257
-Go on and help her.
-Hurry.

105
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:28,884
Please help me!

106
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,429
What do you want me to do?

107
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,390
How did such a big accident happen?

108
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:36,391
You're Alex.

109
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:37,893
Aren't you Sung Tae-shik?

110
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:38,977
No, I'm not.

111
00:08:39,478 --> 00:08:41,521
I'm sorry,
but I have an appointment to get to.

112
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,942
It's Alex, the CEO!

113
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,653
-It is him!
-The rich and famous Alex!

114
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,780
What? It's really Alex?

115
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,573
He's so good-looking!

116
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:52,741
Look at his butt!

117
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:55,285
-Alex, look here for the camera!
-Smile for the picture.

118
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:57,788
Let's see some teeth. Smile.

119
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,123
-Cheese!
-Show us those pearly whites!

120
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:01,250
Will you help me?

121
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,168
-Help her already.
-Please, hurry.

122
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:04,503
Fine. Okay.

123
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:05,921
I'm going to help her.

124
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:07,381
All right. I hear you.

125
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:09,925
-Pull him out.
-Yes, I'll help her out.

126
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,468
Please hurry.

127
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,511
I got it.

128
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,346
I will help her. Okay.

129
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:16,265
Let's put this down and help that guy.

130
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:18,225
Look! It's Alex!

131
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:20,143
What a hero!

132
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:22,354
You crazy bastard.
What are you doing? Get down!

133
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:23,522
What the heck?

134
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:24,439
What should I do?

135
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:26,275
Just ignore him and help this man.

136
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,777
-I'll get his torso. You grab his legs.
-Okay, I got it.

137
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,904
-Young-joo, what are you doing?
-One, two, three.

138
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:32,823
-Hey, mister. Get off!
-One, two...

139
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:36,243
-One, two, three.
-Young-joo, stop that!

140
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:39,413
You have to preserve
the scene of the accident!

141
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,790
This is Arron Park,
Chief Manager of Eden Hotel.

142
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:44,376
People are injured on the 53rd floor.
Please hurry.

143
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:51,842
Was he bitten by a dog?

144
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:55,679
If I may chime in,
that doesn't seem like a dog bite.

145
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,222
It looks more like a lion bit him.

146
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:58,765
-Get a closer look.
-Pardon?

147
00:09:58,849 --> 00:09:59,683
Go on!

148
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,311
He is a guest!

149
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:03,478
My heart just dropped.

150
00:10:03,562 --> 00:10:05,272
Do not lay a finger on him!

151
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,568
Help is on the way.

152
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:27,753
What the hell is going on here?

153
00:10:38,055 --> 00:10:40,265
What's going on here?

154
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,314
I pinched myself
to see if this was a dream.

155
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:48,857
This isn't a dream.

156
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:58,408
It stinks.

157
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,162
What the...

158
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:05,207
-What's wrong with you?
-Hey, Private!

159
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:07,376
Are you okay?

160
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:11,588
What is that?

161
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:14,049
What the fuck is that?

162
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:28,271
What the heck!

163
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,026
Get up. Come on!

164
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:38,115
Stop it! Calm down!

165
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:43,412
What the hell is happening?

166
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:46,790
How is that possible?

167
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:53,296
Arron Park.

168
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,132
Arron Park!

169
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,342
Arron Park!

170
00:12:01,012 --> 00:12:02,848
-Flip him over.
-Okay.

171
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:03,807
One, two.

172
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:11,982
How is this possible? This makes no sense.

173
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:15,235
-What do you mean?
-He should be spewing blood.

174
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,404
-You're right.
-Hold on.

175
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:21,116
Hello? Sir?

176
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:22,868
Did you call 911?

177
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:23,952
Yes, I did.

178
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:25,787
Why aren't they coming?

179
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:27,038
Let's clear his airway.

180
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,332
I'll start CPR.

181
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:30,959
Right hand on top.

182
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:34,129
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine...

183
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,131
Go easy! He just got hit by a car.

184
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,925
You're supposed to do it like this.

185
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:40,051
Here we go again.

186
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:42,637
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight,

187
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:43,930
nine...

188
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:53,815
Wait, is that a hole in his body?

189
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:55,358
There's a hole in his body?

190
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,401
That's not right.

191
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:58,945
Sung Tae-shik just killed a man.

192
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:01,948
My goodness, how could he?

193
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:03,575
Oh, my god, Alex!

194
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:05,619
GB PER MILE INSURANCE COMPANY

195
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:09,247
Those fucking morons...

196
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:10,874
Didn't I tell them?

197
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:13,084
They should've just sat their asses down.

198
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:16,379
He just recklessly jumped in there.

199
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,507
But Alex was just trying to save him.

200
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,841
You call that saving?

201
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:20,967
Yeah, that's not...

202
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:23,678
It's a misunderstanding.
I didn't do this to him.

203
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:25,680
-Misunderstanding?
-No, we saw it.

204
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:27,849
-You did that to him.
-I didn't kill him.

205
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:29,226
Move aside. I'll save him.

206
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:30,393
-That's right.
-Step back.

207
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:31,561
-Move it.
-But I...

208
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,688
Now, I'll grab him here.

209
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:35,023
You grab him there.

210
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,405
Arron Park!

211
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,159
Fuck!

212
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:47,661
Arron Park!

213
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:52,040
What do we do?

214
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:55,835
Help me!

215
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:04,636
You assaulted a civilian!

216
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,556
Does that look like a civilian to you?

217
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:09,849
Push!

218
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,065
It's working.

219
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,322
Where are you going? Hey!

220
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:26,324
Shit!

221
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,620
Private Lee, can I borrow that lighter
from your girlfriend?

222
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:31,830
Why?

223
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,123
Hurry, sir!

224
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,457
Damn it...

225
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,962
There's no time to explain!

226
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:46,636
What are you doing?

227
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,180
-Don't start a fire.
-I'm not playing with it!

228
00:14:49,264 --> 00:14:50,724
Get me some strong alcohol now!

229
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,726
-Strong what?
-Okay, I got you.

230
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:54,936
Take over for me. I'll get it.

231
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:58,023
There are too many choices.

232
00:14:58,106 --> 00:14:58,940
Hey, Arron Park!

233
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,443
-Which one's the strongest?
-What?

234
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,445
Which drink is the strongest?

235
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,656
RonDiaz 151!

236
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,741
Hang on!

237
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,414
It contains 75.5 percent alcohol.

238
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,001
Don't move! Damn it!

239
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:18,960
No!

240
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:21,671
Hurry up!

241
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,215
In-ho, catch!

242
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,189
Step aside, Private!

243
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,942
Do it now!

244
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,444
Private!

245
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:12,889
-Hurry. Help us.
-Grab his legs.

246
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,057
Damn it.

247
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,267
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

248
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:17,394
Hold on.

249
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:18,812
Be careful.

250
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:20,313
Maybe bring him this way...

251
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,444
What are you doing?

252
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:27,987
What do you mean?

253
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:30,699
You just hit someone with your car!

254
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,242
How can you just sit there...

255
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:33,743
What's wrong?

256
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:37,789
Are you hurt anywhere?

257
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,042
What the...

258
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,214
That's not good.

259
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:49,426
That seat is completely ruined.

260
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:54,931
Wait, what's that?

261
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,683
-Over there!
-What is it?

262
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:10,280
Get out now!

263
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:12,365
Hurry up. You're in danger!

264
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,660
Get out now!

265
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:20,498
Come on!

266
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:38,057
Someone, call 911!

267
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:39,768
Call 911!

268
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:44,397
Someone, call an ambulance!

269
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:45,899
There's been a car crash.

270
00:17:46,649 --> 00:17:47,734
What is happening?

271
00:17:57,452 --> 00:18:00,663
Oh, no. Mom!

272
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,165
Mommy...

288
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:04,686
I was so worried because I thought
our base was being attacked.

289
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:10,191
But Corporal Jeon and I
were prepared to counterattack.

290
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:13,361
How dare you act
without the CO's permission?

291
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:16,114
What did I tell you?

292
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:17,699
Yes. I understand, sir.

293
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:20,326
What did he say?

294
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,579
Are we to be dispatched to the scene?

295
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:25,915
It seems the plane crash
is the least of our problems.

296
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:27,333
Pardon?

297
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:30,420
A state of national emergency
has been declared,

298
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:33,047
and martial law has been imposed.

299
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:34,007
Martial...

300
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:36,134
Martial law?

301
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:37,260
Yes, that's right.

302
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,888
Arm all units
and have them on a five-minute standby.

303
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:41,180
Yes, sir.

304
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:45,476
Sergeants Ahn and Yoo haven't returned
from their lunch downstairs, right?

305
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,728
I'll call them in.

306
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:47,812
Thank you.

307
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:49,898
Thank you.

308
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:58,656

309
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:14,756
DISABLE SPRINKLERS?
YES

310
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:36,069
SECURITY MANAGER KIM SEON-YONG

311
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,404
You've reached Arron Park.

312
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:42,659
Where are you? The 53rd floor
is a freaking mess right now.

313
00:20:45,328 --> 00:20:46,829
Hey, light the lighter.

314
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:48,581
What did you say?

315
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,000
Are you kidding me?

316
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:52,502
Okay, it works.

317
00:20:52,961 --> 00:20:54,045
I'll take that.

318
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:00,885
Then, just stay there. I'll come to you.

319
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,096
What did he say?

320
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:04,305
Tell us.

321
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:07,684
Everyone on his team
has been ripped apart.

322
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:10,561
What will you two do?

323
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:15,817
He's the only one I managed
to reach on the security team.

324
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,611
The whole building has been taken over.

325
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,156
Avoid the lower floors if you can.

326
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:30,456
If you turn right,
you'll see the west emergency stairs.

327
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:32,250
Can we take the elevator?

328
00:21:33,167 --> 00:21:35,420
Stairs are safer in an emergency.

329
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:38,965
Okay. We'll return to our base, then.

330
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:40,842
We should, right?

331
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,051
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

332
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:45,847
But what about this man of legend?

333
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:48,182
Don't mind me.

334
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,560
I have to wait for the rescue team anyway.

335
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:53,896
Hey, why don't you just come with us?

336
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:55,857
We may be sluggish and all,

337
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,401
but the military is
the safest option right now.

338
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,738
I am the chief manager here.

339
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:02,864
Pardon?

340
00:22:03,865 --> 00:22:06,868
In these situations,
I need to stand my ground until the end.

341
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:09,871
Off you go!

342
00:22:11,748 --> 00:22:13,041
By the way,

343
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,919
-what did you mean by "man of legend"?
-Pardon?

344
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:19,047
Is that my nickname?

345
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:24,552
It's nothing. Take care of yourself.

346
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:31,517
-He should be fine, right?
-He's dead meat.

347
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:32,977
I don't know, man. Let's head out.

348
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:37,398
What is wrong with you?

349
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:39,067
Get up!

350
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:45,990
That was my car!

351
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:47,950
What's wrong?

352
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:49,827
Seo Jin-wook!

353
00:22:49,911 --> 00:22:51,287
Hey!

354
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,081
-Hey!
-Hold on. I'll get him.

355
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:54,415
Stay right there!

356
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:56,459
-Come on!
-Just come with us!

357
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:57,960
Come on already!

358
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:00,713
I'm not going anywhere.
My car is fucking wrecked!

359
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:03,466
Split up!

360
00:23:03,758 --> 00:23:05,468
You go that way. I'll go this way!

361
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:13,476
What the...

362
00:23:16,187 --> 00:23:17,063
What the fuck?

363
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:19,107
Alex!

364
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,734
Go that way! Run!

365
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:24,904
Run!

366
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:31,869
Damn it!

367
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:36,749
Move out of the way!

368
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:39,001
Where do we go?

369
00:23:41,379 --> 00:23:42,463
What the heck is this?

370
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:46,175
Seriously!

371
00:23:58,312 --> 00:23:59,772
Why is this door not closing?

372
00:24:04,986 --> 00:24:06,320
What the fuck is going on?

373
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:07,947
Sir.

374
00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:10,199
I think it's pretty serious.

375
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:13,327
Let's report back first.

376
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:14,954
Yes, sir.

377
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:17,039
1ST PLATOON DUTY ROSTER

378
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:26,674
Sung-gyu and Byung-joon, these bastards.

379
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:30,136
-Any word from Lee and Ra?
-Not yet, sir.

380
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:31,429
How long has it been?

381
00:24:31,721 --> 00:24:33,181
It's been a bit over an hour.

382
00:24:36,726 --> 00:24:38,394
Maybe I should go downstairs...

383
00:24:39,103 --> 00:24:41,314
All units are to be
on a five-minute standby.

384
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:43,024
The squad commander can't leave.

385
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:44,317
Yes, sir.

386
00:24:46,027 --> 00:24:48,446
Let's maintain our position
for a little longer.

387
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,866
Head to the barracks and be on standby.

388
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:52,950
Yes, sir.

389
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:55,286
En route to standby, sir.

390
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:06,130
Are you all right, sir?

391
00:25:11,052 --> 00:25:12,303
Do you have a cigarette?

392
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,438
First Sergeant.

393
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:24,232
Yes?

394
00:25:25,775 --> 00:25:27,568
You've experienced
battle firsthand, right?

395
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:29,487
Yes, sir. I've been deployed.

396
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:31,989
What about martial law?

397
00:25:33,908 --> 00:25:35,117
It's my first time, sir.

398
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:48,965
Hey, are you okay?

399
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:50,925
Come here.

400
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:52,510
Hurry!

401
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:11,696
Kang Young-joo!

402
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:13,281
Where are you?

403
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:18,369
Kang Young-joo!

404
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:19,287
Hurry up!

405
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:51,819
Shit. Damn it.

406
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:56,365
Damn it...

407
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:01,329
That hurt.

408
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:20,348
Wait. Give me a sec.

409
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:45,581
What the hell is going on?

410
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:49,210
Private Lee, sir.

411
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:52,338
I hope our families are safe.

412
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,386
Wait. Where's my lighter?

413
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:06,644
Hey.

414
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:09,647
-Private Ra In-ho.
-Let's go.

415
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:12,066
-Let's head up.
-Yes, sir.

416
00:28:27,623 --> 00:28:30,167
Damn it. We're fucked.

417
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:32,002
What do we do now?

418
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:34,755
The north.

419
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:37,049
Let's go to the north stairs.

420
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:40,010
Then, we need to walk through the hotel.

421
00:28:40,094 --> 00:28:41,053
That's right.

422
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:45,224
It'll be filled with people.
Will we be okay?

423
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:46,517
Probably not.

424
00:28:48,102 --> 00:28:49,270
We need to stay alert.

425
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:50,938
Let's go.

426
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:07,079
Wait!

427
00:29:07,163 --> 00:29:09,081
-For fuck's sake!
-Wait.

428
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,214
One.

429
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:19,300
Two.

430
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:20,593
Three.

431
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:21,844
Damn it.

432
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:24,096
Last week,
a Kim Cheol's Salon opened up next door.

433
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,973
And this week, it's zombies?

434
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:29,059
It's a conspiracy
to bleed small businesses dry.

435
00:29:29,143 --> 00:29:30,060
Damn it.

436
00:29:32,146 --> 00:29:34,356
-Mom.
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">-Where are you?</font></i>

437
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,941
I'm in Gangnam.

438

<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Did you go there to see Jae-yoon?</font></i>

439
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,571
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Why in the world would you go there?</font></i>

440
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:43,115
Don't worry about me. I'll be home soon.

441
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:46,076
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">How could I not worry about you?</font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Hurry up and get home!</font></i>

442
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:47,536
Damn it.

443
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:51,790
-But I'm right near his base.

445
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,711

-Oh, Mom.

448
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:01,842
I'll figure it out.

449
00:30:01,926 --> 00:30:05,387
Don't worry about me
and stay inside the house.

450
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:06,972
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Call me as soon as you arrive.</font></i>

451
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:08,265
Okay.

452
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:10,059
-Mom!
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">-Yes?</font></i>

453
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:11,602
Don't leave the house.

454
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:14,230
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Okay. Get going, Young-joo!</font></i>

455
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:16,815
I'd be better off dead.

456
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:20,402
Why is this my cross to bear?

457
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:21,779
Oh, dear God, Buddha...

458
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:23,489

What the heck?

466
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:12,621
-Who's there?
-It's you two!

467
00:31:14,707 --> 00:31:16,125
What was that for?

468
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:21,338
What is with you?

469
00:31:22,172 --> 00:31:23,716
Say something.

470
00:31:24,592 --> 00:31:26,051
"Say something"? Like what?

471
00:31:26,135 --> 00:31:29,138
Just say something
to convince me you're normal.

472
00:31:34,143 --> 00:31:37,688
I am an artilleryman
in the First Air Defense Brigade--

473
00:31:37,771 --> 00:31:38,689
Lower your voice.

474
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,900
Private Ra In-ho at your service.

475
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:44,320
My ID number is 25-0060778.

476
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:46,363
I have no idea when I'll be discharged.

477
00:31:48,616 --> 00:31:50,784
And I'm his senior officer
who led him here.

478
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:52,494
Isn't that enough?

479
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:55,873
You're definitely not zombies, right?

480
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:57,333
We told you we're not. Jeez.

481
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:00,502
Get up.

482
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:03,881
Let me take a look.

483
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:06,800
Sorry about that.

484
00:32:06,884 --> 00:32:07,968
Sorry.

485
00:32:08,052 --> 00:32:09,637

495

I'm sure you've seen the news on TV.

Truth be told,

511
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:37,015
we are not up against terrorism or war.

512
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:41,228
However, our national security
is still certainly at stake

513

It is our duty to prioritize air defense,

But keep in mind that under martial law,
orders may be subject to change.

00:34:25,481 --> 00:34:27,441
Keep your dog tags safe

524
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:30,486
if you don't want to end up
as an unidentified body.

525
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:36,825
Why the fuck would you say that?

526
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:38,535
Corporal Jeon Hyung-bae.

527
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:39,995
Rifle number 237080.

528
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,663
Private Choi Chul-woo.

529
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:43,707
Rifle number 237031.

530
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,794
Private Hwang Kyung-sik.
Rifle number 237084.

531
00:34:46,877 --> 00:34:49,505
Due to the risk of accidental discharge,

532
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:52,049
live ammo will be issued
when the situation escalates.

533
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:55,010
Okay, get the rest of your gear ready

534
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:57,179
and take your positions.

535
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:58,430
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

536
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:28,377
This damn prick.

537
00:35:29,503 --> 00:35:31,129
What a spoiled jerk.

538
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:34,800
Where is he hiding it?

539
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:37,803
I found it.

540
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:39,429
And the watch...

541
00:35:40,097 --> 00:35:42,516
-Rolex...
-Hey, punk!

542
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:44,685
How can you steal at a time like this?

543
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:47,271
-I hope you get torn apart by zombies!
-Shit!

544
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:50,691
-Jin-wook!
-Unbelievable. Look at him run.

545
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:53,402
-Hey, Seo Jin-wook!
-Do you know him?

546
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:54,862
-Is he okay?
-I think so.

547
00:35:55,696 --> 00:35:57,781
EMERGENCY PHONE

548
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:00,993
Hey.

549
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:03,412
That doesn't work.

550
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:04,329
What?

551
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:08,166
Would I be here if it worked?

552
00:36:10,586 --> 00:36:13,297
Then, by chance, do you have
a cell phone I can borrow?

553
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:15,591
I need to make an important call.

554
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:18,218
Would I be here if I did?

555
00:36:20,888 --> 00:36:24,433
Then, by chance,
is there a landline on this floor?

556
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:26,268
Well...

557
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:28,687
There is one by the restaurant counter.

558
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:29,646
Okay.

559
00:36:31,023 --> 00:36:32,691
But it's crawling with zombies.

560
00:36:40,991 --> 00:36:42,576
PAINT THINNER

561
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:46,246
SANITIZER

562
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:47,915
-Private Lee, sir.
-Yeah?

563
00:36:48,498 --> 00:36:50,000
Permission to speak, sir?

564
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:52,878
What is it now?

565
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:57,674
I'd like to propose an idea.

566
00:37:14,942 --> 00:37:15,776
Hey.

567
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:19,613
-Hey.
-Private Ra In-ho.

568
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,281
Where did everyone go?

569
00:37:21,949 --> 00:37:24,660
I believe that works in our favor.

570
00:37:25,661 --> 00:37:26,495
Hey.

571
00:37:27,621 --> 00:37:28,455
Look over there.

572
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:29,706
-What?
-Where?

573
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:32,334
-Sir?
-No, hold up.

574
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,294
Where did he go?

575
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:42,678
Wait, that guy is...

576
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:45,389
He's not responding, sir.

577
00:37:55,232 --> 00:37:56,358
Don't come any closer.

578
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,188
Wait!

579
00:38:43,363 --> 00:38:44,197
Ra In-ho!

580
00:39:02,591 --> 00:39:05,343
-Soo-jeong, stand up.
-His head...

581
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:06,720
Help her up.

582
00:39:07,596 --> 00:39:08,555
Yes, sir.

583
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:11,016
Are you okay, Soo-jeong?

584
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:26,031
Are Sung-gyu and Byung-joon
still out of comms?

585
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,200
Yes, sir.

586
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,327
And the ones who went to buy gas

587
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,621
haven't returned?

588
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:38,502
No, sir. They took my card,
but I haven't received a payment alert.

589
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:42,547
That means they're
still on their way to the gas station,

590
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,175
or they're stuck
somewhere in the building.

591
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:48,845
By the smallest chance,

592
00:39:50,347 --> 00:39:52,015
if the worst-case scenario happens...

593
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:57,145
We will make sure to collect their bodies.

594
00:39:58,688 --> 00:39:59,523
Sergeant Kim.

595
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,483
Yes, sir.

596
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:07,280
You and I will go down together
to search and assess the situation.

597
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:11,409
Are you afraid?

598
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:15,622
No, sir. I understand, sir.

599
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:17,207
-Damn it.
-Oh, no.

600
00:40:17,666 --> 00:40:19,042
Fuck, that scared me.

601
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:21,002
That's mine.

602
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:23,213
Hey, can you pick that up for me?

603
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:28,760
Is your head okay?

604
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:30,720
No, it still hurts.

605
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,722
Let's go, Young-joo.

606
00:40:32,806 --> 00:40:34,224
-But...
-Yeah?

607
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:36,935
Do you think going to a police station
will do us any good?

608
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:41,022
It's common sense to go
to the nearest station at times like this.

609
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:44,359
Then, I'll follow you there
before heading over to A Tower.

610
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,612
How do you plan to get there all alone?

611
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:50,574
I'll figure it out. Don't worry about me.

612
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:53,243
Forget it.

613
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:54,536
Let's just get going.

614
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:58,582
You should come with us.

615
00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:02,085
-No. I can't leave my shop.
-That damn bastard.

616
00:41:02,169 --> 00:41:05,297
In case we don't see each other again,
take care of yourself.

617
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,506
You too.

618
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:10,302
What are you doing, Young-joo?
Hurry up. We don't have time.

619
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:12,804
He's definitely not worth your time.

620
00:41:13,346 --> 00:41:14,472
Go and find your boyfriend.

621
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:16,266
-Thanks for everything.
-No problem.

622
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:18,185
Fuck!

623
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:19,769
That asshole took my phone.

624
00:41:19,853 --> 00:41:22,939
-Goodbye.
-He's dead if I ever see him again.

625
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:25,108
Hurry up already.

626
00:41:38,413 --> 00:41:39,915
-Hey.
-Yes?

627
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:41,416
I don't think anyone's here.

628
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,752
But we must stay vigilant.

629
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:46,838
In zombie movies,
this is when something pops out.

630
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:51,843
Do you hear that?

631
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,138
They're zombie sounds!

632
00:41:55,222 --> 00:41:56,932
This way! We need to go this way!

633
00:41:57,015 --> 00:41:58,141
-This way.
-Hurry up.

634
00:42:01,561 --> 00:42:03,605
-Chef Jung?
-Chef Jung!

635
00:42:15,575 --> 00:42:16,576
Chef Jung!

636
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:18,411
Private Lee Jae-yoon.

637
00:42:18,787 --> 00:42:20,205
Is it dinnertime already?

638
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:21,623
Are you hurt anywhere?

639
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:25,293
I feel like I might be soon.

640
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:35,303
These glass doors
won't hold for much longer!

641
00:42:36,805 --> 00:42:38,932
Do something!

642
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:41,768
Hold on! Let me think!
