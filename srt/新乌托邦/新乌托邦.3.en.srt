1
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:11,280
Help me.

2
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:14,784
Oh, please help me, sir!

3
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:18,329
Private First Class Lee!

4
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:24,835
Private First Class Lee!

5
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,516
Stand back on the count of three!

6
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,059
Private First Class Lee.

7
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:42,686
Do it, quick!

8
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:44,188
One!

9
00:01:44,647 --> 00:01:45,606
Two!

10
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:47,858
Three!

11
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,870
In-ho, get to the emergency exit!

12
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,290
-Let's go.
-Hurry.

13
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:05,501
-Take a scraper.
-Okay.

14
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:22,560
This is a five-star hotel, Private Lee.

15
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,563
Our fire safety protocol is top-notch.

16
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:33,946
Run!

17
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:36,198
Damn it!

18
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:42,872
Hurry!

19
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:49,712
Shut the door!

20
00:02:58,888 --> 00:02:59,805
Lock it.

21
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:09,231
-Chef Jung?
-Chef Jung!

22
00:03:09,315 --> 00:03:10,357
-Chef!
-Get up.

23
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:11,775
-Come on, Chef.
-Hold on.

24
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:14,153
Hey, In-ho.

25
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:17,573
I'll take him upstairs.
Go and ask for help.

26
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:18,699
Yes, sir.

27
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,910
-Let's go, Soo-jeong!
-Hurry up, okay?

28
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:22,828
-Can you manage, Chef Jung?
-Yes.

29
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:24,830
Let's go.

30
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:26,874
Hurry!

31
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,751
-Soo-jeong!
-Wait for me!

32
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:30,461
Hurry up!

33
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:32,338
I said, wait for me.

34
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:35,716
I'm hungry.

35
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,181
How far do we have to go?

36
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:44,308
How much farther?

37
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:48,604
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Gimbap </font></i>for sale.

38
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:49,939
₩10,000 for <i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">gimbap</font></i>.

39
00:03:50,022 --> 00:03:51,899
Only ₩10,000.

40
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:53,525
₩10,000 for <i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">gimbap</font></i>.

41
00:03:58,322 --> 00:03:59,615
Come this way.

42
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:04,370
I'll take two.

43
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:08,582
There are way too many people here.

44
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,085
Let's wait. We need to stay here.

45
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,252
SEOUL NONHEON POLICE STATION

46
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,047
What are they doing in there?
Where are the officers?

47
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,966
-I'd buy it if I were you.
-No.

48
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:18,884
Hey, Alex!

49
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:23,138
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:25,641
Are you really Alex?

51
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:28,477
-Alex!
-Be quiet, will you?

52
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,980
-You've got the wrong person.
-Keep it down.

53
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:32,731
-I think it's him.
-No, I'm not.

54
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:38,028
Alex, I'm glad you're safe.

55
00:04:38,988 --> 00:04:39,905
Are you okay?

56
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:41,615
I thought my legs would explode.

57
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:44,159
How about you?

58
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:45,536
I'm fine.

59
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:46,787
But why are you wearing...

60
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:48,706
Well...

61
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:51,291
I see.

62
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,586
Are there no officers
inside the police station?

63
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:55,963
Yeah, it's empty.

64
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,298
I've been waiting for a while,

65
00:04:58,382 --> 00:05:01,802
but they haven't shown up,
and this crowd keeps getting bigger.

66
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:05,222
I was worried things could get dangerous,
so I came outside.

67
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:09,893
You could've gone around it, you know.

68
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:11,103
What will you do?

69
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:13,605
What do you mean? Just be on your way.

70
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:15,482
We're going to wait for the police.

71
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:18,485
Alex, why don't you wait with us
for ten more minutes?

72
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,196
-All right, then.
-Why should he wait with us?

73
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:24,992
By the way, why is everyone so quiet?

74
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:26,243
Because of the zombies.

75
00:05:26,702 --> 00:05:28,787
A fight broke out earlier
because someone's phone rang.

76
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:30,122
So turn your phone off.

77
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:31,040
Yours, too.

78
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:32,916
It was stolen a while ago.

79
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:37,880
{\an8}JAE-YOON, I'M TURNING
MY PHONE OFF FOR A WHILE

80
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:45,179
SLIDE TO POWER OFF

81
00:05:54,772 --> 00:05:56,106
Are you scared, Young-man?

82
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,817
No, sir.

83
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:00,444
I'm fine, sir.

84
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,156
Just do what you've been trained to do.

85
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,327
And everything will be fine.

86
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:10,954
Yes, sir.

87
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:22,883
WARNING
RESTRICTED MILITARY ZONE

88
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,344
Shit!

89
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:27,805
-Sergeant Kim.
-Ra In-ho.

90
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,056
Ra In-ho.

91
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,599
Salute!

92
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,523
Oh, come on. We're not zombies!

93
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:38,899
What happened, Ra In-ho?

94
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:39,817
She's...

95
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:42,986
She's normal. I can vouch for her.

96
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,571
-I swear.
-Lower your rifles.

97
00:06:45,114 --> 00:06:47,116
Hey, Soo-jeong.

98
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,534
What happened to you?

99
00:06:48,617 --> 00:06:51,453
You moron, why are you not at your post?

100
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:53,622
-Well--
-In-ho, where's Jae-yoon?

101
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:59,336
Private First Class Lee, get up here fast!

102
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,338
The door's open!

103
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,423
Private First Class Lee!

104
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:06,301
-Chef Jung.
-Jae-yoon!

105
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:08,345
We did it. We finally made it!

106
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:10,430
-What's wrong?
-Are you okay?

107
00:07:10,514 --> 00:07:12,641
-Jae-yoon!
-Get out of the way, Chul-woo.

108
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:13,934
We made it.

109
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,019
-Private Lee.
-What's going on?

110
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,314
Who said you could let civilians
into the barracks?

111
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:22,025
Are we running a shelter?

112
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,320
Young-joo.

113
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:30,784
I looked it up earlier,
and this isn't just happening in Korea.

114
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:33,370
The US and Europe
have already been in chaos for days.

115
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,331
It seems like the whole world
is spiraling out of control.

116
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,667
Do you know why this is happening?

117
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,128
There are some theories going around.

118
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:44,590
Some say it started with someone
who ate a Komodo dragon,

119
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,717
others say it started in a lab in China,

120
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,094
or that it's a North Korean
biochemical weapon.

121
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:52,347
Some even think this is happening
because of global warming.

122
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:53,724
How so?

123
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:55,601
Because of global warming,

124
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:59,605
they claim an ancient life form
was uncovered in the Antarctic permafrost.

125
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:02,983
And it released an ancient virus,
or so they say.

126
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:06,195
Anyway, no one really knows
how it all started.

127
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:07,946
But I think--

128
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,156
-Move!
-Get out of the way!

129
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,116
-What's going on?
-Oh, come on.

130
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,327
Why are you just standing around

131
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:15,537
and blocking the way?

132
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:18,665
-Get the fuck out of my way!
-Get your hands on a weapon!

133
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,792
Who are those people?

134
00:08:20,876 --> 00:08:23,837
-They're awfully rude.
-What the hell are you looking at?

135
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:26,006
-They look like hunters.
-Go grab your guns!

136
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:28,217
-I think they're here for their guns.
-Hurry up!

137
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,178
Why would they look for their guns
at the police station?

138
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:34,056
All firearms must be kept
at the nearby police station.

139
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,432
It's illegal otherwise.

140
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,851
Oh, is that a thing?

141
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:42,689
Having a gun would be ideal
in this kind of situation.

142
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:47,402
Police, hunters, soldiers.
They're all armed.

143
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:50,697
Soldiers...

144
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:56,036
Young-joo.

145
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:57,704
On your feet, Lee!

146
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:00,958
You brought civilians in
without clearance.

147
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,626
-What were you thinking?
-Sir.

148
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:04,628
That's not the issue right now.

149
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,213
Sir, it's...

150
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:07,673
This is an emergency.

151
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:11,134
-Give me my phone, sir.
-Get a grip, Lee!

152
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:12,636
Listen.

153
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:17,099
We all need to contact our families!

154
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,810
And we have a civilian here.

155
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:20,978
Sir?

156
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,438
This is Ms. Oh Soo-jeong
from the VIP lounge--

157
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:24,815
Get it together, Kwak!

158
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:26,275
My goodness.

159
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,278
You must work at the hotel.

160
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:33,699
But this is a classified military base,
and civilians are strictly prohibited--

161
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:39,204
What was that?

162
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,790
There's no time for this!

163
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,584
The zombies broke down the door!

164
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,423
We have to shut the door, sir!

165
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:50,507
Sir!

166
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:53,760
Jeon Hyung-bae, Choi Chul-woo.
Lock the door!

167
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:55,387
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

168
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:00,892
Hurry!

169
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:04,021
Hurry up!

170
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:07,399
What were those?

171
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:12,362
-Chef Jung!
-What's wrong with him?

172
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:15,741
-Are you okay, Chef?
-Explain what happened, Lee.

173
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,367
Yes, sir.

174
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,829
Well, what happened was...

175
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:28,211
If that door opens,
we're all going to die, sir!

176
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:29,212
What are they?

177
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,966
They're zombies, sir.

178
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:35,552
Are you fucking kidding me?

179
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,012
Private Ra In-ho!

180
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:40,724
Hey, army guy.
Does it look like we're kidding?

181
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:45,395
Why would we joke
about something like this?

182
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:59,117
Escort the two civilians to the barracks.

183
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:00,327
Yes, sir.

184
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:03,830
Here, Chef. Come with me.

185
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,751
-Chef Jung!
-What's up with him?

186
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,795
What's the matter?

187
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:12,547
Is he okay?

188
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:20,597
He's not breathing.

189
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,478
Watch out for accidental discharge.

190
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:29,189
Even blanks can be dangerous
at close range.

191
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,569
What? Chef Jung?

192
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:36,988
Chef?

193
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:42,536
Chef, are you all right?

194
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,748
What the heck?

195
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:52,254
SEOUL NONHEON POLICE STATION

196
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:56,633
I think we should just go.

197
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:00,011
Go where? Do you know of a safer place?

198
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:04,141
It might be better to be somewhere
that's less crowded in times like this.

199
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:06,935
Alex is right.

200
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,938
It's pointless to wait
when the cops aren't even here.

201
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,567
I don't even know what to think.

202
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,570
-What was that?
-What happened?

203
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:17,529
Die, you bastard!

204
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,114
What's going on?

205
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,158
Hey, asshole!

206
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:24,077
Oh, for fuck's sake.
I knew this would happen.

207
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:25,328
What is going on?

208
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:27,873
Let's get out of here!

209
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,710
Young-joo, get in front of me.

210
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:33,462
Shit!

211
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:37,507
You're lucky we're here.

212
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,093
Be grateful, damn it!

213
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,058
Die!

214
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,979
-You fuckers!
-What the fuck?

215
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:55,859
What's happening?

216
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,749
Sir, look at his calf.

217
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:24,429
Soo-jeong!

218
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:29,643
Don't move, civilian!

219
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:38,735
Soo-jeong.

220
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,115
What is that?

221
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:52,207
-What the hell?
-Sir.

222
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,625
Sir!

223
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:56,753
Those are blanks!

224
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:58,880
Sir!

225
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,967
I lift 500kg on the Big Three!

226
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:05,345
Everyone, get out of the way!
Don't get too close!

227
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:07,347
I'll take him out!

228
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:09,683
No, Chul-woo!

229
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:11,476
-What the hell?
-What is that thing?

230
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,356
-No, sir!
-Let go!

231
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:19,609
Get the live rounds! Now, damn it!

232
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,403
Yes, sir! Let's go!

233
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:22,529
Yes, sir.

234
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,907
-Young-man...
-Out of the way, sir!

235
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,331
You son of a bitch!

236
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,376
-I got a hold of him!
-Chul-woo!

237
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:38,670
Do a guillotine choke!

238
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:40,213
A guillotine choke! Yes, sir!

239
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:41,798
-No!
-No, stop!

240
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:43,466
Stop it.

241
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:45,218
You piece of shit!

242
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,929
-You son of a bitch!
-No, step away!

243
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,056
Damn you!

244
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,809
How dare you attack a soldier
when martial law is in effect?

245
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,144
You little piece of shit!

246
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:55,770
"Little"?

247
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:57,188
Hey, hurry up!

248
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:58,189
Yes, sir!

249
00:14:58,273 --> 00:15:00,400
Please calm down, sir.

250
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:03,236
-This asshole always towered over us!
-Calm down, sir!

251
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,988
-You didn't even serve!
-Sir!

252
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,073
-Please, sir!
-Let go of me!

253
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:08,825
-Ra In-ho!
-You scumbag.

254
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,952
The line is secure. Yes, sir.

255
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:12,329
We have a situation, sir.

256
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:15,332
We're under martial law, sir!

257
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:17,292
We need backup, sir.

258
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:21,463
Civilians have entered the compound.

259
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,342
What should we do, sir?

260
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,179
What the heck?

261
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:36,978
Hey, let him go!

262
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,903
His neck just snapped.

263
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:50,575
-This is crazy.
-Chul-woo!

264
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,245
Pull him off, now!

265
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:55,163
Chul-woo!

266
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,515
Step aside, sir!

267
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:26,945
Chul-woo.

268
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,279
Chul-woo!

269
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,283
Yoo Byung-joon, give him first aid!

270
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:34,577
Sergeant Yoo's not back yet.

271
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,707
-Move over.
-I've been trained in first aid!

272
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,833
Chul-woo.

273
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,793
Hang on, Chul-woo.

274
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:53,346
Ra In-ho!

275
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:56,266
Put that down.

276
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:59,185
Put it down, now!

277
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,657
You crazy little...

278
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:14,409
You dumbass!

279
00:17:18,747 --> 00:17:20,373
-Sir!
-Freeze, Ra In-ho!

280
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:22,167
Sir, that's loaded with live ammo.

281
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,960
Sir!

282
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,420
Not you, too, Lee Jae-yoon!

283
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,630
I'm sorry, sir. But it had to be done.

284
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:32,761
Otherwise, everyone else will get hurt,
just like Private Choi.

285
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:44,189
Kim Young-man, Hwang Kyung-sik.

286
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:45,440
Get Lee and Ra out of here.

287
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:46,483
As of this moment,

288
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,068
any insubordination
will be dealt with immediately.

289
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:50,278
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

290
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:52,906
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

291
00:17:57,494 --> 00:17:58,953
Hey, get up.

292
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:07,879
What should we do?

293
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,007
Try this.

294
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,383
Okay.

295
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:21,392
Chul-woo!

296
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:22,894
Hyung-bae, step outside.

297
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:25,063
Sir, please be careful.

298
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:28,817
How is he doing?

299
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,152
The bleeding won't stop.

300
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:40,286
Chul-woo!

301
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:43,581
Choi Chul-woo.

302
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:45,583
Get it together.

303
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:47,544
Chul-woo.

304
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,260
What are you doing?
Put pressure on his wound!

305
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,970
Yes, sir.

306
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,769
INFIRMARY

307
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,022
Hey, Hyung-bae.

308
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,066
How is Chul-woo holding up?

309
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:18,741
Chul-woo!

310
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:20,410
Sir.

311
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:28,084
I shouldn't have told him
to do the guillotine choke.

312
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,961
It's all my fault.

313
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:31,546
I'm sorry.

314
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,298
I apologize.

315
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:35,300
It's not your fault. Get back up.

316
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,135
On your feet.

317
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:39,929
-You bastards.
-Hey, it's not your fault.

318
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:42,265
I told you to stand guard at your posts!

319
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,770
-Squad Commander.
-Yes, sir.

320
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,105
Help wrap things up inside.

321
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,982
-Jeon Hyung-bae!
-Yes, sir.

322
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:53,318
-Take the civilian to the barracks.
-Yes, sir.

323
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:54,402
And...

324
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:57,155
Lee Jae-yoon, Ra In-ho.

325
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:59,866
-Private Lee Jae-yoon.
-Private Ra In-ho!

326
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,201
Follow me to the control room.

327
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:03,578
First Sergeant.

328
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:05,705
What about me?

329
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,800
You should also be
in the control room, sir.

330
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:26,976
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

331
00:20:31,606 --> 00:20:34,067
The Military Police
are definitely going to look into this.

332
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,861
This is going to screw
my promotion evaluation. Shit!

333
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:40,990
First Sergeant, I need a smoke.

334
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,242
Commanding Officer, sir.

335
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:45,787
Considering this is an emergency,

336
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:48,998
I really think
we should contact our families.

337
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:51,125
What's with you and your damn phone call?

338
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:52,418
We're under martial law!

339
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:55,755
But shouldn't we at least call
Chul-woo's family?

340
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:03,012
Please report this to the brigade.
I'll notify his family.

341
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:05,807
Shouldn't all the men
call their families, too?

342
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,519
First Sergeant?

343
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:11,980
Take it.

344
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:15,066
Private Lee Jae-yoon. Thank you, sir!

345
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:18,736
Call your families when you can.

346
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:20,655
-Shit, finally.
-Wipe it, sir.

347
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:22,156
Soo-jeong, you can sit here.

348
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,491
-Oh, thanks.
-Sure.

349
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:26,494
Salute.

350
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,581
This message is from the CO.

351
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:31,916
First of all, Chul-woo...

352
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:34,961
The deceased private

353
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:37,714
will be handed over
to the brigade medical corps.

354
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:40,049
-The medical corps?
-Can they even make it here?

355
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:41,050
-Maybe I--
-All of you...

356
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:43,511
-No, be quiet for now.
-...are to keep your live ammo.

357
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:46,931
However, to account for firearm safety,

358
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:50,852
remove your magazines from your rifles
and keep them close to you.

359
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:52,520
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir.

360
00:21:52,937 --> 00:21:55,606
-Kwak Gye-young.
-Corporal Kwak Gye-young.

361
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,234
Replace all the bloodstained gear.

362
00:21:58,609 --> 00:21:59,444
Yes, sir.

363
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:02,113
And since a civilian is present
under unavoidable circumstances,

364
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,615
remember to stay disciplined as soldiers.

365
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:05,658
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

366
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:06,743
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

367
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:07,827
-At ease.
-At ease.

368
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:08,953
Excuse me, mister.

369
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:12,749
-What?
-"Mister"?

370
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:14,542
What is it, ma'am?

371
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:17,879
Can I borrow a phone?

372
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:19,464
-Don't you have yours?
-No.

373
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:22,467
I will lend her mine, sir.

374
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:23,801
Okay, do that.

375
00:22:23,885 --> 00:22:26,262
-Stay sharp and maintain order.
-Yes, sir.

376
00:22:28,598 --> 00:22:29,640
-Salute.
-Thanks.

377
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:31,517
By the way, Soo-jeong.

378
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:35,813
You can't call him "mister."
He's the admin supply officer.

379
00:22:35,897 --> 00:22:38,941
-I see. What a long title.
-I know.

380
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:40,693
{\an8}That's why we call him "sir."

381
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:42,153
MY WIFE

382
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:43,946
Please pick up.

383
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:47,742
-Anything else you want to ask?
-No, thank you.

384
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:49,577
MY DARLING YOUNG-JOO:
LET'S TALK FACE-TO-FACE

385
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,995
I'M NEAR GANGNAM STATION
PEOPLE ARE ACTING WEIRD

386
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:56,751
I'M SCARED, PLEASE CALL ME

387
00:22:56,834 --> 00:22:58,127
YOU'RE SAFE, RIGHT?
I'M RIGHT BY THE TOWER

388
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:06,344
-What?
-What is it?

389
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:07,470
You scared me.

390
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:10,681
Damn it.

391
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:59,647
Oh, right. Are your phones off?

392
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:01,190
Yes.

393
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:03,317
I already told you mine got stolen.

394
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:12,535
-Are you hungry?
-Yes.

395
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,495
There might be something to eat here.

396
00:24:14,996 --> 00:24:16,789
Let me go check.

397
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:22,503
What would we have done without him?

398
00:24:24,881 --> 00:24:25,965
Hey, Kang Young-joo.

399
00:24:26,591 --> 00:24:29,677
We're in this mess
because I was giving you a ride.

400
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:34,807
Sorry.

401
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:42,857
Well, I didn't mean to make you apologize.

402
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:46,569
Oh, look.

403
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:54,368
FOR SALE, ₩10,000 EACH

404
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,580
This is it.

405
00:24:58,331 --> 00:25:01,209
Jae-yoon wanted this album so badly.

406
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:03,669
Do you even know what that is?

407
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:06,797
It's a cassette tape.

408
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:09,008
That's right. So, you know.

409
00:25:11,052 --> 00:25:14,764
{\an8}YOON JONG-SHIN
A GUIDEBOOK FOR BROKENHEARTED PEOPLE LIVE

410
00:25:30,238 --> 00:25:33,407
JAE-YOON'S PLAYLIST, 572 SONGS

411
00:25:34,242 --> 00:25:36,744
Why do you always listen
to Yoon Jong-shin's songs?

412
00:25:38,955 --> 00:25:41,082
Because they're awesome.

413
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:47,171
I get it, but I might memorize
all the lyrics at this rate.

414
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:49,840
Sing along if you can, then.

415
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:57,014
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Hey, you fool</font></i>

416
00:25:57,098 --> 00:25:58,849
That's not how you sing it.

417
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:03,521
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">-I'm in love with you</font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">-I'm in love with you</font></i>

418
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:05,147
Oh, my gosh. Seriously?

419
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:12,280
{\an8}<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">-You don't know how much you comforted me</font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">-You don't know how much you comforted me</font></i>

420
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:15,866
{\an8}<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">-You ended my pain</font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">-You ended my pain</font></i>

421
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:19,537
{\an8}<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">-And made me laugh again</font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">-Laugh again</font></i>

422
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,122
{\an8}All together now.

423
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:31,549
The owner is probably dead by now.

424
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:34,135
Why the hell would you
borrow money to pay for it?

425
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:37,763
They could still be alive,
and just taking it would be stealing.

426
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:40,308
I'm the idiot for giving you the cash.

427
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:41,684
You're so frustrating.

{\an8}MY DEAR GRANDMA

432
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:16,427
Look after yourself.

433
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:18,429
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">No, you should look after yourself.</font></i>

434
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:20,014
Okay, I will. Bye.

00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:23,476

-You startled me.
-I'm sorry.

437
00:27:25,728 --> 00:27:26,645
Here you go.

438
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:29,940
Are you okay?

439
00:27:30,358 --> 00:27:31,400
You're fine.

440
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,528
By the way, Soo-jeong.

441
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:37,990
Was that your boyfriend?

442
00:27:38,074 --> 00:27:41,118
-No, it was my brother.
-I see.

443
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:43,704
So, it was my future brother-in-law.

444
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:47,333
Why do you keep calling me by my name?

445
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,252
Right, of course.

446
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:53,839
Shall we ditch the honorifics?

447
00:27:56,217 --> 00:27:57,551
How old are you?

448
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:01,013
How old do you want me to be?

449
00:28:01,764 --> 00:28:06,644
When you visited me during <i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Chuseok,</font></i>
you and the aunties brought <i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">galbijjim.</font></i>

450
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:12,024
Do you remember the guy
who only ate veggies for his diet?

451
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,693
Yes, him.

452
00:28:15,236 --> 00:28:19,031
He enlisted after finishing a semester
in sports science at Chung-Ang University.

453
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:24,203
He's dead.

00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:28,809
-No, you shouldn't worry about me.
-What am I going to do?

468
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:32,021
Honey, how is Ha-yul?

469
00:29:32,897 --> 00:29:33,731
Is he okay?

470
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:35,900
What about your parents?

471
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,110
That's good.

472
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:42,781
Just remember,
don't take a single step outside.

473
00:29:42,865 --> 00:29:44,742
I need you to stay home.

474
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:45,659
Yes.

475
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:48,662
Is there enough food for the baby?

476
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:51,207
Okay.

477
00:29:51,749 --> 00:29:52,666
You did well.

478
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:57,338
But just to be safe,
ration it so you don't run out.

479
00:29:57,421 --> 00:29:58,506
Okay.

480
00:29:59,215 --> 00:30:00,341
Oh, and honey.

481
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:04,762
Water will be more important
than food from now on.

482
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:07,515
So try to store as much water as possible.

483
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,062
Private Ra In-ho.

484
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:14,605
-What was that?
-I was on the phone.

485
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:17,399
I'm sorry, sir,
but could you give me some privacy?

486
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:19,902
Oh, sure.

487
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:21,487
I'm sorry. Carry on.

488
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:22,571
Thank you.

489
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:27,159
Hello?

490
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:30,955
Hey, honey.

491
00:30:32,206 --> 00:30:33,541
What about my voice?

492
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:36,710
No, I must've had something in my throat.

493
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,679
The punk's still the man of the house.

494
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:48,347
Jae-yoon?

495
00:30:49,932 --> 00:30:51,100
Private Lee Jae-yoon.

496
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:53,394
What's with the voice?
Where's your bravado?

497
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:54,979
-Sorry, sir.
-That's better.

498
00:30:58,107 --> 00:31:00,276
Goodness, did you talk to your parents?

499
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:03,320
No, sir. My parents are abroad,
and I couldn't reach them.

500
00:31:03,404 --> 00:31:04,530
Where are they?

501
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:06,240
They went to Africa.

502
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:07,866
-Africa?
-Yes, sir.

503
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:11,453
What are they doing over there?
Are they diplomats or something?

504
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:13,831
No, sir. They're just traveling.

505
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:16,417
They retired and went to see things
they'd never seen before.

506
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,335
"Things they'd never seen before"?

507
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,505
Like giraffes and rhinos?

508
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:24,174
-They like elephants, sir.
-I see.

509
00:31:24,842 --> 00:31:28,262
-That sounds awesome.
-Yes, sir.

510
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:34,643
It might be okay in Africa.

511
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:42,234
This is so sweet.

512
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:45,404
I'm glad we found something to eat.

513
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,489
Didn't they have any <i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">ramyeon?</font></i>

514
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,243
You said you live in Nowon.
And you're in Dogok?

515
00:31:51,327 --> 00:31:53,037
Yes, that's right. What about you?

516
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,165
I live in Hong Kong, but I'm staying
at a hotel nearby on business.

517
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:57,875
A hotel?

518
00:31:57,958 --> 00:31:59,251
Which one? Eden Hotel?

519
00:31:59,335 --> 00:32:01,211
Yes, how do you know that place?

520
00:32:01,712 --> 00:32:04,715
My boyfriend works
on top of the hotel.

521
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:06,550
Is there something above the hotel?

522
00:32:06,884 --> 00:32:09,720
It's more like serving than working.

523
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:11,305
-He's serving?
-He's stationed there

524
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:13,390
at the air defense unit
on the hotel rooftop.

525
00:32:13,474 --> 00:32:15,601
I was driving her there
because she insisted on going--

526
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:16,894
Hang on a minute.

527
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:19,188
Is it these guys?

528
00:32:19,897 --> 00:32:22,483
You told us to turn off our phones.

529
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:24,943
-Sorry, mine was on.
-Hey!

530
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:27,446
That's Jae-yoon.

531
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:29,657
What? Hold on.

532
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,617
-This is your boyfriend?
-No way.

533
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:34,161
-Hey--
-Is this Eden Hotel?

534
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:35,454
When did you take this?

535
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:37,998
I took it around lunchtime yesterday.

536
00:32:38,082 --> 00:32:40,918
It was funny how two soldiers
were carrying a steel delivery box.

537
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:42,461
Is this your boyfriend?

538
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,421
You can tell from this photo?

539
00:32:44,505 --> 00:32:46,215
-Yes.
-How can you tell it's him?

540
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:51,637
Jae-yoon...

541
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:01,855
JAE-YOON, THERE'S NO SIGNAL FOR CALLS
WE'RE DOING FINE, SO DON'T WORRY

542
00:33:01,939 --> 00:33:03,941
THINGS ARE QUIET IN AFRICA
HOW ARE THINGS OVER THERE?

543
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:05,359
KOREA'S NOT DOING SO WELL, MOM

544
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:07,569
IF THINGS START TO GET WEIRD,
DON'T LEAVE YOUR HOTEL

545
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:09,071
{\an8}STAY INSIDE THE BARRACKS

546
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:10,948
{\an8}DAD WANTS YOU TO STAY THERE
UNTIL THINGS DIE DOWN

547
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:13,450
{\an8}OKAY, MOM. DON'T WORRY

548
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,768
Did you talk to your grandmother?

549
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,520
She didn't pick up.

550
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:45,566
Don't worry too much. She'll be fine.

551
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:50,112
-Your family's in Busan, right?
-They're in Seoul, sir.

552
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:52,698
-They're not in Busan?
-They're in Gaepo-dong.

553
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:55,576
Then, what's with your accent?

554
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:57,244
What do you mean, sir?

555
00:33:58,579 --> 00:34:00,581
"What do you mean, sir?"

556
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:06,754
Where is Gaepo-dong?

557
00:34:09,882 --> 00:34:11,091
It's over there.

558
00:34:11,175 --> 00:34:13,093
You're wrong. Gaepo-dong's over there.

559
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,728
You need to stop imagining the worst.

560
00:34:24,021 --> 00:34:25,147
Yes, sir.

561
00:34:26,482 --> 00:34:27,941
I'll go back inside, sir.

562
00:34:38,327 --> 00:34:41,747
Did you talk to your wife, First Sergeant?

563
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:44,291
My wife? Well...

564
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,710
I don't know what to call her now.

565
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,629
"Ex-wife" might be better, sir.

566
00:34:50,047 --> 00:34:52,591
Well, either way...

567
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:59,848
You should check on your family.

568
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:02,768
Sure, sir.

569
00:35:04,436 --> 00:35:05,854
Could I have a smoke?

570
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:09,233
I don't have any.

571
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:16,198
Someone keeps taking my cigarettes.

572
00:35:20,202 --> 00:35:21,662
Do you think he's okay there?

573
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:23,789
Don't worry.

574
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:26,083
Soldiers are way safer in times like this.

575
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:28,794
-Yes, the soldiers are safe.
-I'm worried about us.

576
00:35:35,676 --> 00:35:37,803
{\an8}-Are you turning on your phone?
-Are you?

577
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:39,763
{\an8}SWEET JAE-YOON

578
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:42,015
It's Jae-yoon.

579
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:44,101
-Did he get back to you?
-Did he?

580
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:45,644
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Are you okay, Young-joo?</font></i>

581
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:47,104
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">You're safe, right?</font></i>

582
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:50,983
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">I'm doing fine now.</font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Don't be silly and come looking for me.</font></i>

583
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:54,278
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Go and hide somewhere safe.</font></i>

584
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:57,030
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">If you tell me where you are,</font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">I'll come get you, okay?</font></i>

585
00:35:58,365 --> 00:35:59,575
He's okay.

586
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:02,369
I told you not to worry, didn't I?

587
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:04,246
-I'm glad.
-I'm glad.

588
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:07,165
-Are you an echo?
-No.

589
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:14,464
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Our apologies.</font></i>

590
00:36:14,548 --> 00:36:18,385
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">We're unable to connect your call</font></i>
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">due to an influx of calls on the network.</font></i>

591
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:19,595
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">Please try again...</font></i>

592
00:36:22,598 --> 00:36:26,602
There are too many calls,
so I can't get through to him.

593
00:36:26,894 --> 00:36:28,353
Don't worry.

594
00:36:28,437 --> 00:36:31,440
-If you wait, you'll get through.
-Yes, you'll get through.

595
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:33,775
-Hey, Jin-wook.
-What?

596
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:36,778
I think I should get to A Tower now.

597
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:38,614
Are you out of your mind?

598
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:40,699
You can't go anywhere in this situation.

599
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:44,328
Thanks for everything.
I'll never forget what you've done for me.

600
00:36:44,745 --> 00:36:46,914
Alex, I'm very grateful to you, too.

601
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:48,749
I should get going.

602
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:50,334
Hey.

603
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:52,169
-What...
-Young-joo.

604
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,212
I'll go with you.

605
00:36:57,299 --> 00:36:58,425
What for?

606
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:01,511
My car's parked at the tower,
so I need to get there anyway.

607
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:03,513
Let's go to the hotel together.

608
00:37:04,348 --> 00:37:06,767
Two is better than one,
and better than two is...

609
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:11,939
What will you do?

610
00:37:17,194 --> 00:37:18,403
Fuck.

611
00:37:18,946 --> 00:37:20,364
Is this all the <i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">ramyeon </font></i>we have?

612
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:22,115
Yes, sir. Last night...

613
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:25,202
Those jerks on night duty
ate most of it as a midnight snack.

614
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:26,954
How long will this last us?

615
00:37:27,037 --> 00:37:28,246
About two days, sir.

616
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,752
What is this?

617
00:37:35,212 --> 00:37:37,255
These are combat rations.

618
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:38,340
I see.

619
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:43,512
-It looks disgusting.
-It actually is disgusting.

620
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:44,721
Before we eat...

621
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:48,517
Well, here's the bottom line.

622
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,227
We're short on rations.

623
00:37:54,106 --> 00:37:55,273
Is it a blackout?

624
00:37:56,817 --> 00:37:57,776
Black ops?

625
00:37:58,568 --> 00:37:59,569
"Black ops"?

626
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:02,197
-"Blackout."
-Oh, I see.

627
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:06,076
Don't pick your nose
at the table, you little shit.

628
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:08,912
-Get it together.
-Private Ra In-ho. Sorry, sir.

629
00:38:08,996 --> 00:38:09,913
That's disgusting.

630
00:38:11,373 --> 00:38:12,874
-Oh, come on!
-Don't do that.

631
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,918
What the heck are you doing?

632
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:20,966
{\an8}The rations we currently have

633
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:24,177
will only last us for two days
if we eat the usual amount.

634
00:38:24,553 --> 00:38:26,346
-Phone services are down.
-What?

635
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:28,223
We'll have to cut back on rations.

636
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,474
The supply schedule...

637
00:38:29,558 --> 00:38:30,767
We're fucked.

638
00:38:30,851 --> 00:38:32,561
We'll lose power soon, too.

639
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:36,023
-A building this size should have an ATS.
-Keep it down, dumbass.

640
00:38:36,106 --> 00:38:39,484
The ATS is usually installed between
an external power source and generator.

641
00:38:39,568 --> 00:38:41,903
-Quit your yapping!
-Sorry, sir!

642
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:44,239
Anyway,

643
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:48,493
we must share during these hard times

644
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:50,954
and stick together in comradeship.

645
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:52,748
This isn't much,

646
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:55,417
but enjoy the food.

647
00:38:56,293 --> 00:38:57,669
I want cup noodles.

648
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:03,341
Let's share some cup noodles.

649
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,928
The boys have been through a lot.

650
00:39:07,596 --> 00:39:09,639
Seeing them eat this with no soup...

651
00:39:11,183 --> 00:39:12,976
It weighs heavily on my heart.

652
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,396
-Gye-young.
-Yes, sir.

653
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,564
Boil some water.

654
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:18,648
Yes, sir.

655
00:39:19,316 --> 00:39:20,692
It's fine. Dig in.

656
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,073
Let's eat.

657
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:27,657
-Enjoy your meal.
-Enjoy your meal.

658
00:39:27,741 --> 00:39:29,242
Thanks for the food.

659
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:32,829
Eat, Hyung-bae.

660
00:39:32,913 --> 00:39:34,039
Yes, sir.

661
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:48,220
-Right side.
-This way.

662
00:39:58,730 --> 00:39:59,898
This way.

663
00:40:07,197 --> 00:40:08,323
-Hurry.
-What's that?

664
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,241
Watch your step.

665
00:40:21,211 --> 00:40:23,088
Is A Tower through this way?

666
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:24,965
Yes, I think so.

667
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:26,842
Did you turn your phones off?

668
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:29,427
There's no need if it's on silent.

669
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:30,971
You told us to turn ours off.

670
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:34,057
-Come on, just keep going.
-But his phone...

671
00:40:35,392 --> 00:40:37,185
He's doing that
because he doesn't have a phone.

672
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,281
Hey.

673
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:51,283
You're so clumsy.

674
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:53,869
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

675
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,620
Your shoelaces are untied.

676
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,009
You do this.

677
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:11,845
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">And then, you...</font></i>

678
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:13,763
<i><font face="sansSerif" color="white">After that...</font></i>

679
00:41:22,731 --> 00:41:23,607
Dang it.

680
00:41:30,071 --> 00:41:31,448
Jeez...

681
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:40,707
-Something's not right, sir.
-What now?

682
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:44,711
After Private Choi got bitten,
he died without turning into a zombie.

683
00:41:44,794 --> 00:41:45,795
So what?

684
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:47,088
Good point.

685
00:41:47,881 --> 00:41:52,677
I think Chef Jung turned into a zombie
not long after he was bitten.

686
00:42:03,063 --> 00:42:04,272
What the hell is that?

687
00:42:07,067 --> 00:42:08,693
Did you secure the door?

688
00:42:08,777 --> 00:42:11,238
We secured the north and west
access points, sir.

689
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:21,665
They don't turn right away.
There's a delay.

690
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:22,582
How come?

691
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:36,596
Choi...

692
00:42:37,305 --> 00:42:39,140
Choi Chul-woo?

693
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:40,767
-Chul-woo!
-Don't go near him!

694
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:43,186
-Chul-woo.
-You can't get close to him.

695
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:44,187
Stop him!

696
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:48,233
Chul-woo.

697
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:57,075
What are you doing?

698
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:15,760
-Hyung-bae.
-What's happening?

699
00:43:21,308 --> 00:43:22,267
Chul-woo.

700
00:43:24,227 --> 00:43:26,688
I'm sorry for making you
do the guillotine choke.

701
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:28,231
Hyung-bae!

702
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:29,858
Sir!

703
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:38,616
Get a blanket and a rifle.

704
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,118
-Kyung-sik.
-Yes, sir.

705
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:42,162
Corporal Jeon, can you hear me?

706
00:43:42,245 --> 00:43:43,663
Are you okay, Corporal Jeon?

707
00:43:43,747 --> 00:43:45,457
-Corporal Jeon.
-Take him inside!

708
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:57,844
-First Sergeant!
-First Sergeant!

709
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:06,644
-Let go.
-Private Choi.

710
00:44:08,355 --> 00:44:09,272
Are you all right?

711
00:44:09,356 --> 00:44:10,398
-Chul-woo!
-It's Hyung-bae.

712
00:44:10,482 --> 00:44:11,608
Hyung-bae!

713
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:17,697
I'll administer CPR.
Clear his airway, sir.

714
00:44:18,073 --> 00:44:20,658
-Clear his hair?
-For CPR...

715
00:44:20,742 --> 00:44:22,202
Fucking hell.

716
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:24,412
We can't let him die.

717
00:44:24,496 --> 00:44:25,872
He'll turn into a zombie.

718
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:32,837
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

719
00:44:32,921 --> 00:44:36,508
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

720
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:39,135
Stop the bleeding, damn it!

721
00:44:39,219 --> 00:44:40,387
Get a towel!

722
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:42,639
-Get me a rifle!
-Who, me?

723
00:44:42,722 --> 00:44:43,765
Hurry, sir!

724
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:45,392
Get a rifle!

725
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:54,901
Get out of the way!

726
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:57,320
-Are you ready?
-I'm ready, sir.

727
00:44:57,404 --> 00:44:58,488
Fire!

728
00:45:08,665 --> 00:45:10,125
-The head.
-What?

729
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:11,584
You have to shoot the head!

730
00:45:11,668 --> 00:45:12,627
Fire!
