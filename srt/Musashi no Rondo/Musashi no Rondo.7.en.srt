(Musashihara Bunta)〈My parents

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
They were a huge couple who were well-known in the neighborhood.

I thought that would happen to me too, but →

<Being united and being together

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's actually a very difficult task.

There's nothing I can do

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I liked him

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
(Kingougasa Yasu) If we could call ourselves lovers →

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's going to kill the jealousy of my neighbors

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I thought so.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I was surrendering my house to my ex-wife →

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Just complain about things that are convenient for you

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That's not good.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
(Voice of Bunta) Ex-wife stays at home

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I say I can't go home →

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So why not stay at home for a while?

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That's what happened...

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
good night.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
(Musashihara Tamaki) I'm worried.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I can't imagine how they were together...

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Even after breaking up

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You can accept your ex-wife's pampering... →

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I wonder what it means.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
This is because I am confident that I will not be able to return.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What I want to date now is

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000

Ignore his advice

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
There's nothing you can't step right away.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
but…

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The reason why we have not been able to settle relationships that cannot be explained is →

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I think it's Tamaki-san's.

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What...

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
If your anxiety is unraveled

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Please let me know again.

good night.

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It hasn't been settled...

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Certainly that's true...

It's not just that.

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
If I were to be Ryuhei

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Maybe it's a little easier.

51

(Agawa Ryuhei) What...

52
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I've never told anyone this time... →

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'll tell you about a special fishing spot!

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
ah…. Hahaha.

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
If you do what you love

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It makes you feel lighter, isn't it?

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yeah. I just talked to Yoriko today

58
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's become much easier.

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What... I'm honored. Ahaha.

60
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Reporters' job is to open up people's hearts.

Don't be fooled

Why are you leaving?

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What happened? So early.

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I told you I'd come back.

71
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
For now, go inside.

72
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The residents are moving the landlord.

73
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
What about the ring?

74
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm going jogging now.

You guys love to meet up.

81
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Wasn't he in the tent?

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm sure I'll go to work though.

83
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Well, the two there.

84
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I thought I was in the tent

85
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I guess he's not doing anything strange.

86
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Because I haven't done it.

87
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
(Bunta) Well, that's fine though.

88
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
What more? This suit.

89
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's decided today too.

As usual, it was strange.

Hey, Yube, really with Kinugasa-san...

101
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000

I want you to tell me exactly.

(Yamanouchi Marina) Hey.

118
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It seems like I was at my limit in tent life for two days.

119
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Since then, what is Kinugasa-san?

120
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I haven't spoken about it properly. As usual, I'm back late.

121
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
(Marina) Who is Agawa-kun?

122
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I haven't seen you lately.

123
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Helping out at the store seems busy.

124
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It was in a store, it was in a magazine.

125
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
That means that neither of these has progressed.

126
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's boring.

127
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I think it's a matter of people.

128
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's all about people.

129
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'll enjoy having this.

130
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Oh, that's tasty. Bow tie?

131
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
That's the one that Bunta gave me.

132
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's a brand called BUN-CHAN.

133
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Wow...

134
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What about Bunta? What are you doing?

135
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
He's brightening up, but I'm probably trying too hard.

136
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I've been wearing red socks all these days.

137
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Red socks?

138
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Defensive instinct.

139
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
When it's tough, it's always a pain, it's a long time.

140
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Maybe I understand.

141
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Bunta-kun, you see, it's delicate →

142
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Don't show people weaknesses

143
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You're going to try hard, right?

144
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
In middle school

00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Even when he was removed from the regular soccer club →

146
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I was secretly crying on my own.

147
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Marina: That's what I remember.

148
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Of course... I've been watching it for a long time.

149
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
The microwave is also strangely attached to Bunta.

150
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Yeah. Bunta is a kind person.

151
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
That's what kids are like

152
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You know exactly.

153
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Marina. Perhaps...

154
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
No... there isn't. No way, that's not it.

155
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I love Bunta.

156
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Oh!?

157
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Actually, Tamaki is really dull.

158
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Seriously? Since when!? What are you going to do?

159
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I won't do anything.

160
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm currently working as a mother and have lots of work

161
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I don't want to bother you.

162
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
If you enjoy life with your favorite

163
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
That's enough.

164
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
That guy is Marina's favorite...

165
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
And isn't it scary to come to a conclusion?

166
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I agree….

167
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
The answer should be revealed

168
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I can't come to a conclusion and it's squealing.

169
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
About Agawa-kun?

170
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It feels like an unidentified attachment is getting in the way...

171
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You really can't speak anything.

172
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Hehe... sorry.

173
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
When I came to the fishing spot, I couldn't help but feel the same.

174
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's totally OK. It's actually easier.

175
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Ah, shall we eat plums?

176
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Ah, eat. thank you.

Ah...

179
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
(Voice of Agawa) This towel from Tamaki

180
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's my favorite pink one.

181
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Was it pink? I don't remember.

182
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
(Yoriko) Does anyone know?

183
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
...Ugh.

00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:30,000
♬〜

185
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
The last day...

186
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Ah...!

187
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
(Isahaya Miu) Thank you. It was really helpful.

188
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
you're welcome.

189
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'll make this the last one

190
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I think it's a relief.

191
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
That's right. Ah, that's right.

192
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
This is the promised reward.

193
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Thank you.

194
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
A present for a girlfriend who is in a serious attack?

195
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'll hear some gross things.

196
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Because I don't learn

197
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
He may try to be pampered by Yasushi again.

198
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
At that time, be sure to completely refuse.

199
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I should have refused this time too.

200
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Tehe. That's right.

201
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Next time I'll refuse properly.

202
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I don't want to make him sad.

203
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Yeah. That's it.

204
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Me, more than anyone in the world

205
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I want Yasu to be happy.

206
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Really. From the bottom of my heart.

207
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'll try my best to meet your expectations.

208
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
That too is fine.

209
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Thin.

210
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
♬〜

211
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
(Nagamine Sayoko) Yeah.

212
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I missed this.

213
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
The present I've received so far.

214
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
If I leave it in my room

215
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Because she's going to care.

216
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Dispose yourself.

217
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Do whatever you want, just put it out in the garbage.

218
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I brought it because I couldn't do that.

219
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
yes.

220
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's really selfish.

221
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Hey Bunta.

222
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I thought we had a lot of discussions, but →

223
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
More than I imagined

224
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I wonder if Bunta's side hadn't finished.

225
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I love Bunta.

226
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:52,000
But she's with me now

227
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I love you about it just as much.

228
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I can't choose.

229
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
There is no concept of choosing.

230
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
That's how I am.

231
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
...It's getting smaller.

232
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Thanks to you.

233
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
The 500 yen coin has now become about 10 yen coins.

234
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Sayoko...

235
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
yeah?

236
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I like it.

237
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yeah.

238
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
So... we're going to break up.

239
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:56,000
♬〜

240
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Thank you. It's been fun for the last 10 years.

241
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Have you gone already?

242
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Go that way.

243
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:22,000
♬〜

244
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
(Marina) What do you want to eat today?

245
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
(Renge) Hmm... Hamburger!

246
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Hamburger... Also?

247
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Ah...

248
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
(Sobbing)

249
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Ah, Fumi-chan!

250
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
range…!

251
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Oh... a range?

252
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Fumi-chan.

253
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
what up?

254
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
yeah?

255
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Customer How about this?

256
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Yes... That's good. I like it.

257
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
As expected from the customer, your eyes are so clear!

258
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
this is

259
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It's the kind of thing called "Renji."

260
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Your eyes are so sharp...

261
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
This means that BUN-CHAN has to work hard too.

262
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Renji will overtake sales.

263
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
(Renge) There are also different colors.

264
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
please wait a moment.

265
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:32,000

266
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
thank you.

267
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I'm nothing...

268
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It's growing up to be a good-sized child

269
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I guess Marina is doing her best.

270
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Ah! Look at Fumi-chan. tie!

271
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Oh! It's true.

272
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
this is? copper? Does it suit you? Hahaha.

273
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Ah, that's right. Dinner isn't there yet, right?

274
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Yeah. I'm going shopping now.

275
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
So, maybe the three of us go to a family restaurant together.

276
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
What...?

277
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
(Renge) I did it! I eat hamburger!

278
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Right. What kind of hamburger would you like?

279
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Thank you so much for your help.

280
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
…home.

281
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Um... could you accept this?

282
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm thinking about Tamaki-san

283
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
This is my first time designing it.

284
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I'll help, but... there's one condition.

285
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
This cloth is a piece

286
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I want you to make it the way I like.

287
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
That's fine. I'll give it to you.

288
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Take a glance at this fabric and creates an image of Tamaki-san.

289
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I thought it was perfect.

290
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
(Miu)That dress

291
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It looks great on you.

292
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Unfortunately, it's not for sale.

293
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
That's right...

294
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
picture?

295
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
...No, thank you very much.

Driving Thank you.

298
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
(Yoriko) Not at all. I like to drive.

299
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Ah, wait, gas bill.

300
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
That's fine.

301
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
What...

302
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Ah, that's the place

303
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Can I get the photos I took today?

304
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Eh... Ah, that's fine.

305
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
(Yoriko)Thank you.

306
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Yeah. As expected, every angle is interesting.

307
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
What... Is it weird?

308
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Yes. It's so good.

309
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
good.

310
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Next time, thank you for your stay

311
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Let me feast.

312
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
please.

313
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I will contact you again.

314
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
yes.

315
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
...That's it.

316
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
…good night.

317
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You should just stop by.

318
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Have a drink of tea too.

319
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I'll do it again next time.

320
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It's also possible to meet the old guys dressed like this.

321
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Even though I don't care.

322
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Good luck to the uncle and aunt.

323
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Yeah. So, be careful on the way home.

324
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
(Yoriko)Thank you.

325
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
ring?

326
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Ah... sorry.

327
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
What, why are you apologizing?

328
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
no….

329
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
fishing?

330
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Ah, yes.

331
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
it was fun?

332
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Yes, it's been a while since I last visited.

333
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Oh, she too... Oh, Yoriko... too

334
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I'm a serious fan of fishing.

335
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I see.

336
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Agawa-kun: When talking to a child of the same age

337
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It's like that. Something fresh.

338
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Isn't it the same as usual?

339
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
What about the ring? what have you been up to?

340
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Kinugasa-san I sent it that far.

341
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Because I was going to go back home.

342
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
ah~. It's finally out!

343
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
…Yeah.

344
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Ah, just now at a fishing spot →

345
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Tamaki used it in high school

346
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I saw someone holding the same towel.

347
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
That pink one.

348
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I don't remember that.

349
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
What? You really don't remember?

350
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
That checkered pattern...

351
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Well then. good night.

352
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Ah...

353
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
good night.

354
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I see. Old man, did you leave?

355
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Okay! Okay!

356
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's getting more and more confused...

357
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
(Sigh)

(Women) Yes.

370
00:19:34,066 --> 00:19:36,066
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

371
00:19:41,066 --> 00:19:45,066
Um sorry.

372
00:19:41,066 --> 00:19:45,066
Do you know where to go to the soba restaurant?

373
00:19:45,066 --> 00:19:47,066
It's here though.

374
00:19:45,066 --> 00:19:47,066
yes.

375
00:19:47,066 --> 00:19:50,066
Ah, but today

376
00:19:47,066 --> 00:19:50,066
Maybe it's just closed.

377
00:19:50,066 --> 00:19:52,066
What? Is that so...?

378
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:55,066
thank you very much.

379
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:55,066
thank you.

380
00:19:55,066 --> 00:19:57,066
There's nothing I can do. Is it going to start again?

381
00:19:57,066 --> 00:19:59,066
Is there always a son who looks like a model?

382
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:02,066
It looks like there is.

383
00:19:59,066 --> 00:20:02,066
There are rumors that the actual product is cooler than the magazine.

384
00:20:02,066 --> 00:20:04,066
Your neighbor is very popular.

385
00:20:04,066 --> 00:20:07,066
...That's right.

386
00:20:07,066 --> 00:20:10,066
That's dinner... →

387
00:20:10,066 --> 00:20:13,066
If you're interested, why not come to our house?

388
00:20:13,066 --> 00:20:15,066
What...

389
00:20:20,066 --> 00:20:26,066
My boring regrets

390
00:20:20,066 --> 00:20:26,066
The dismantling was successfully carried out.

391
00:20:27,066 --> 00:20:32,066
This loom too

392
00:20:27,066 --> 00:20:32,066
With the owner, they have planned to cross the sea.

393
00:20:32,066 --> 00:20:35,066
So... that's it...

394
00:20:37,066 --> 00:20:45,066
Anyway... we try

395
00:20:37,066 --> 00:20:45,066
Why not try dating properly?

396
00:20:47,066 --> 00:20:52,066
It's properly... But is it a "try"?

397
00:20:52,066 --> 00:20:54,066
Ah, no... So...

398
00:20:57,066 --> 00:21:03,066
I'm desperate.

399
00:20:57,066 --> 00:21:03,066
For now, I can't be refused.

400
00:21:05,066 --> 00:21:10,066
Certainly it would be better to settle it once

401
00:21:05,066 --> 00:21:10,066
Maybe the story is quick.

402
00:21:12,066 --> 00:21:14,066
yes….

403
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:22,066
Well then... thank you.

404
00:21:24,066 --> 00:21:28,066
What!? Is it okay?

405
00:21:24,066 --> 00:21:28,066
yes.

406
00:21:31,066 --> 00:21:33,066
good!

407
00:21:33,066 --> 00:21:39,066
♬〜

408
00:21:39,066 --> 00:21:45,066
That's what I've always wanted to do

409
00:21:39,066 --> 00:21:45,066
It feels like I'm getting to understand it quickly.

412
00:22:24,066 --> 00:22:28,066
Shall we do it for dinner?

413
00:22:24,066 --> 00:22:28,066
I'm ready now.

414
00:22:28,066 --> 00:22:30,066
yes….

415
00:22:30,066 --> 00:22:39,066
♬〜

416
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:42,066
There's no one there.

417
00:22:42,066 --> 00:22:45,066
Carbonara was excellent.

418
00:22:42,066 --> 00:22:45,066
good.

419
00:22:45,066 --> 00:22:50,066
I really wanted him to stay

420
00:22:45,066 --> 00:22:50,066
The loom hasn't been tidyed up yet.

421
00:22:50,066 --> 00:22:52,066
Ah...

422
00:22:53,066 --> 00:22:56,066
Agawa-kun...

423
00:22:53,066 --> 00:22:56,066
Good evening.

424
00:22:56,066 --> 00:23:01,066
why…?

425
00:22:56,066 --> 00:23:01,066
Kinugasa-san: Wasn't he out?

426
00:23:02,066 --> 00:23:04,066
ah….

427
00:23:02,066 --> 00:23:04,066
Agawa-kun.

428
00:23:07,066 --> 00:23:11,066
We're going out. Starting today.

429
00:23:11,066 --> 00:23:22,066
