In the first place, I'm not so bad!

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So what did you come for?

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
(Bunta) I guess he's just returning to his parents' house.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Huh?

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That's fine.

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Ah, Marina.

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Come.

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Huh? Range Have you stretched out again?

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
(Renge) Yes.

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Oh! long time no see.

What!? Bunta-kun! why?

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Sayoko-san has lost her affection

49
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I heard that the apartment was kicked out.

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
We've been with you for 10 years.

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Is that so...?

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Well, go for it! The bat hit!

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000

54
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I don't come and give them any incense sticks.

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Poor thing if I said that.

56
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Ah! Maybe it's still on the roots?

57
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I wondered if Bunta took his British boyfriend

58
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It was years ago.

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Seriously?

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
(Bunta) I haven't taken it!

61
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
To this guy

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm not so uncomfortable that I mess with you!

63
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The other side has used the colour without permission

65
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's tough to be accused of being neglected for years!

66
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I wonder if Bunta has that in mind

67
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's not a problem.

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It is true that Bunta caused the loss!

69
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Ah, ok... They're both huh.

70
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Divorce is deep.

71
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
How many years have you broken up?

72
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Maybe four years.

73
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
But thanks

74
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000

76
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,000
(Renge) Hey.

77
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Congratulations!

78
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
There's a microwave cake.

79
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yay!

80
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
If you have a cake

81
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You should eat it right away!

82
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The cake is probably after meals!

83
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Really, there's no common sense.

84
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What kind of cake? Show me a little!

85
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
a little bit!

86
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's no good! already!

87
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
(Bunta) That's good! Stingy!

88
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Sisters are nice.

89
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Once the distance is opened

90
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Normally, you can't get used to it.

91
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Even if it's just someone else, even if it's just a small mistake

92
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It can become impossible to repair in an instant.

93
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I understand.

94
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I don't want to fail anymore.

95
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Don't sting with the flesh of returning.

96
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Ah... sorry.

97
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Is Agawa-kun also there? The person you don't want to fail.

98
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
…oh dear.

99
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But if you don't feel like that over there

100
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm going to try not to want anything anymore.

101
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's not good to expect.

102
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
(Marina) I see...

103
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's not possible, life.

104
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Don't eat it!

105
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That's fine! About one.

106
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000

I did it, a cut-off suit.

115
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
A cut-off suit...

116
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Don't say it! In front of my sister.

117
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Ah... Was it your sister?

118
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
…yes.

119
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000

What are you going to do?

130
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
(Bunta) Do you say that?

131
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
In front of the person who made it.

132
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
No, that's what I mean...

133
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Bunta-san, you're so cool!

134
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Ryu-kun is also one, what do you think?

135
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What if you make it in our store?

136
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
But I don't have a place to wear it

137
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000

Yeah. I'm customer service.

141
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000

Next door...

146
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Maybe it's Agawa soba restaurant?

147
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
yes. Do you know about our store?

148
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yeah. It's a very popular shop.

149
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Unfortunately, I'm allergic to soba noodles.

150
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I can't get it...

151
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Kinugasa I live in this neighborhood.

Oh but

157
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Main dish: soba noodles...

158
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Are you okay! I'll make something.

159
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Take your time.

160
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Is it okay...?

161
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
There's no problem at all.

162
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Isn't it nice to have a range too?

163
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
(Renge) Yes!

164
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
In other words, I'll order you a custom-made one

165
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Please break up?

166
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Bunta: Did you say that to Sayoko?

167
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
The fee was also left in advance.

168
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That's fine now!

169
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Sayoko-san, you have such a trait!

170
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I mean, what did you do to Sayoko?

171
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
(Bunta) So insane!

172
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I can't understand that I'm late in my life at home

173
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
There's something subtle!

174
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
law…. Will you use that word in Reiwa?

175
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Or rather, only in times like this

176
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's so unfair to mention married and unmarried people.

177
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
When you want to get married or love

178
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Shouldn't you be the person you want to do?

179
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Hey~.

180
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
(Renge) Ah!

181
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000

183
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000

00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You're a sibling.

185
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
yes?

186
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
They look very similar.

187
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Especially in places with long necks and beautiful ones.

188
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
is that so?

189
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
(Marina) That's true.

190
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
(Bunta) They don't look similar! Scary!

191
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:30,000
♬〜

192
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
(Marina) Thank you so much for today.

193
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
(Renge) Bye bye!

194
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Vivai!

195
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
(Marina) Again.

196
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I've been in the middle of the day.

197
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Fried rice was delicious.

198
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
good.

199
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
(Bunta) Ah! I don't drink enough at all!

200
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Kinugasa, go out.

201
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Huh? ah….

202
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Hey.

203
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Why can't you date me?

204
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
What...?

205
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
What...!?

206
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Wow... it came out unconsciously.

207
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That...

208
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The first time I heard that, the teacher...!

209
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That... Tamaki and me

210
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I feel like we're the same age...

211
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Ah... I guess that's what happened.

212
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And now

213
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Did you say that you just remembered something?

214
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
…yes.

215
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
That would have been fine.

216
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
If you ask me that now, what should I do?

217
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I was quite anxious.

218
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Well then, good night.

219
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
(Door opening and closing sound)

220
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
panic?

221
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
panic? What is impatient?

222
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Ah already! I don't want to fail!

223
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
(Sigh)

224
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
(Kingugasa's voice) He looks very similar.

225
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Especially in places with long necks and beautiful ones.

226
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
is that so?

227
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
(Sigh)

228
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
(Agawa Kohei) Hey.

229
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Yes, this is from Fumi-chan.

230
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Delivery? Two tempura...

231
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Who are Bunta-san and Tamaki?

232
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
(Kohei) One is the dragon.

233
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It's me? I'll bring it with me during lunch break.

234
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
ah. Ryuhei.

235
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Hmm?

236
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
If you try to incorporate your worries, you'll end up with soba noodles.

237
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Uii.

238
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
(Sigh)

239
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
(Agawa Namie) Oh, Ryuhei.

240
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
what? A concern?

241
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's not!

242
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Hehe... That's fine.

243
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
A life of worries is proof that you are fulfilled.

244
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Children

245
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Cry a lot and laugh a lot.

246
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Hehehehe...

247
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I wonder if it would be easier if I could cry...

248
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Ah! Ryuhei.

249
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
what? what happened?

250
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Musashihara's couple

251
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
He got involved in an accident at high speed.

252
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'll take a look at the neighbors.

253
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
What...!?

254
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
As for the end of a couple

255
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Maybe it's a good idea to prepare.

256
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
(Sobbing)

257
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
The two of them together

258
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I could drive to hell or heaven.

259
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
In a way, maybe I'm happy.

260
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
(Sighing sound)

261
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:08,000
♬〜

262
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
(Kohei) Yes.

263
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I haven't finished preparing it yet.

264
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
And I'll do it

265
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Come with your dad.

266
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Come on! yes.

267
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Huh? No, ah...

268
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
If you do this, you'll be sharpened.

269
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What?

270
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Various things.

271
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
(Sound of sharpening a knife)

272
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Wow...

273
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
(Sound of sharpening a knife)

274
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Wait a minute.

275
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Tamaki lessons are almost over.

276
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Marina-san, are you going back to part-time?

277
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
(Marina) That's right.

278
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Huh? What about Renji?

279
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Ah! School? Was he a first year student?

280
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
yes. Finally got used to it.

281
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
(Bunta) Isn't that cute, Renji-kun?

282
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
What is a child?

283
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It smells sniffy.

284
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
That seems to like me.

285
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It's like a day.

286
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
What's the day? ah~.

287
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I wonder if something would have been different if I had children.

288
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I had a desire to get married.

289
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Because it's that person, but

290
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I felt like it was impossible because I was with that person.

291
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Well, when you fall in love with someone who is difficult

292
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's going to be a pain.

293
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
(Vibration sound from mobile phone)

294
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Hello! Good luck.

295
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Agawa-kun. Delivery?

296
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Yeah. Bunta and me.

297
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
What!? Bunta: Did you go out?

298
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Yeah. Maybe it's a difficult person?

299
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Ah... Sayoko-san.

300
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I forgot I got it and went out

301
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Do you really want to make up?

302
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Have you even picked up a cut-off suit?

303
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Hey.

304
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Hey, what do you do about this?

305
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'll eat it. Agawa-kun eats it too.

306
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Ou.

307
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I bought a lunch box.

308
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Let's all have lunch together.

309
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Well then...

310
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
what? this.

311
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
A hobby club that you can do at a community center.

312
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I thought I'd go with Marina after this.

313
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
"Lecturer Kinugasa Yasu"

314
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
If you call directly, please come and check it out.

315
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
What!? We exchanged contact details!?

316
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Yeah.

317
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
(Marina) I'm looking forward to it.

318
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
This is

319
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Can I apply on the day?

320
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
...Huh?

321
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
No, me too

322
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I've been a bit interested for a while...

323
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
This tool called a spindle

324
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Rotate it like a small hole →

325
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'll pour out the wool.

326
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It looks like this.

327
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Try to pull it straight up as much as possible.

328
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Please give it a try too.

329
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Ah... I'm not interested.

330
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
♬〜

331
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
oh~! That tone.

332
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Um... I've suddenly heard something strange.

333
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
question? Anything please.

334
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Is Kinugasa married?

335
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,000
♬〜

336
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Yeah. Well, that's what it is.

337
00:15:43,000 --> 00:16:00,000
♬〜

338
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
(Bunta) If I return this →

339
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It's really over...

340
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I think I'll stop by the bookstore.

341
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'll go ahead.

342
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm swimming in the microwave now.

343
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Agawa-kun too

344
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Soba restaurant I have to go back, right?

345
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Ah... yes.

346
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
(Marina) Let's go together.

347
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You're tired.

348
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
(Marina) You're tired.

349
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Shall we help you anything?

350
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's okay.

351
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Um... Tamaki-san.

352
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
yes.

353
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Actually, that... →

354
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
This is camouflage.

355
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
camouflage….

356
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
To be precise, there is one tuck attached →

357
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
When you run a classroom with a lot of women like this

358
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I guess it's common for problems to occur...

359
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I'd go out of my way to tell me about it

360
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:20,000
There is also the possibility that you will get into trouble again.

361
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
We just met

362
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You'd think he's a light guy, but

363
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,000
To Tamaki, I have my honest personality

364
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I would like you to be aware of this...

365
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Why?

366
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
He's a mean person.

367
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I was advised the other day.

368
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Be careful of the ring.

369
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
He's definitely interested in you.

370
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
That guy...!

371
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Ah... Even if that's totally misplaced

372
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It doesn't matter.

373
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Just being told that

374
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I've become a little conscious about this problem.

375
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
home….

376
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
That sensibility is generally correct.

377
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
This shop is well-received by students.

378
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I've been interested in this place for a while.

You can go up now.

387

Ou. I'll do it I'll do it.

396
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I agree.

397
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I might be in the same direction...!

398
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
So I have a place to stop by, so please come first.

399
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
(Female) See you later! be careful.

Hey, teacher

I'm not even going to find out he's having fun...

410

Let's put it a little.

Men and women in their mid-30s

412

The conversation is quick and the effort is quick.

413

Let the two go well like this

414
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
You should shut up and watch?

No more, that's it. Impossible.

That's why I decided.

419
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
More than this

420
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I'll stop repeating my broken heart with Tamaki.

421
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
That's...

What are you declaring to Pon-chan? Me.

424

Welcome home.

425
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It was late.

426
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Yeah. I ate dinner with Kinugasa and the others.

427
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
What?!?

428
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Pon-chan's walk now?

429
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Yeah. Come along with Tamaki too.

00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It's fine but...

431
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Okay.

Tamaki Hasa About Kinugasa

433
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
You think it's fine, right?

434
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
So what?

435
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
That's time to stop.

436
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It's going to become an affair.

ah. That ring is a fake

Eh... eat

440
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
That excuse I asked →

441
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Are you going to date the two?

442
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
still

443
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Yes, it's not decided clearly...

444
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Do you want to date?

445
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:47,000
If you haven't made that clear yet

446
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Think about it this way.

447
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
...Huh?

448
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Oh... too about me →

Once again as a potential boyfriend

450
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I want it to be included as an option.

451
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Don't decide on this spot

452
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
At least take it home and consider it.

453
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Like before

454
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Don't pretend you didn't forget right away.

456

00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I wonder if he's thinking...

458
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
For those who approach me

459
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I'd be happy if I could respond, but →

460
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
In the end, everything didn't work.

461

But me

462
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I held baby Agawa...

463
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
What is that?

464
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Can't I do the same for the person I am now?!

465
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Of course, the difference between 10 years

466
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I'll never shrink forever though →

467
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
But when you reach 90 and 100 years old

468
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It won't be a big difference!
