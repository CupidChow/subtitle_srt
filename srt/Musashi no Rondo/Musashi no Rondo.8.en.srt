00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Haa...

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
What an ominous dream...

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
...Not at all.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
<I was really dumped>

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
<3 times to the same person>

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
My unrequited love that began 10 years ago →

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I was stirred up and shaken by that man who suddenly appeared

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's over

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:16,000

Ah... That's right.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
...Okay, shall we go, Pon-chan?

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
well.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It ended more peaceful than I thought.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
...Are you finished?

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Good morning, Agawa-kun.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Shop has been booming lately.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I was asked about the location yesterday too...

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
ring.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Don't talk to me for a while. I'll ask.

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Ten years isn't that easy.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
If it's okay

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'll call you from here.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
No, not particularly.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's the first time I've seen her wearing a cut-off suit.

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Well, it's finally time for a while.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It suits you.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Navy type

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I haven't worn it much lately but...

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Sayoko told me

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
"It definitely suits you, so try it."

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
ah….

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Chicken nanban...

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Homemade tartar sauce was delicious...

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I see Sayoko is also good at cooking.

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The last Christmas is →

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It was a handmade carrot cake.

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I want to eat again...

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's not shaking at all...

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
(Yamanouchi Marina) 35-year-old love reality show

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's settled in a way that fits.

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Thanks to you.

53
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
That means

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It means that you've organized a lot.

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What...

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Something like Agawa-kun.

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
...I'm being avoided so much now.

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Well, that's what happens.

59
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Honestly, I feel incredible.

60
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Poor thing but

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
If you decide to date Kinugasa-san →

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I have to confront him somewhere.

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
…Yeah. That's right.

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Ah, the microwave, that's the material for the costume.

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What is an outfit?

66
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The one that Range wears at the study presentation.

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I have to sew it.

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I think it would be expensive if I asked Kinugasa-san.

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I think there are two different digits.

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That's right. So enjoy your date.

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
(Agawa Namie) Thank you very much.

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

(Numata Yoriko) Hello.

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
(Namie) Come, Yoriko!

75
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Come!

76
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
No... that's amazing.

77
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The influence of magazines is amazing.

78
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Thank you, Yoriko!

79
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
you're welcome.

80
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I was happy to be able to interview him.

81
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Ah. Yoriko's seat over here.

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Ah, thank you.

83
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
(Female) Sorry.

84
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
yes.

85
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
(Female) Order OK?

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yes, I understand.

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
(Tamaki's voice) "Now, I'm looking forward to it later!"

88
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Kinugasa - Let's go drink.

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Ah, today a bit...

90
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
overtime?

91
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
no….

92
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Don't call it a date.

93
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
teeth? With who?

94
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
wait a minute. It's impossible...

95
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
With Tamaki

96
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
We ended up dating properly.

97
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Seriously...

98
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What is that tartar sauce?

99
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Carrot cake: Who eats it?

100
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That's not true...

101
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Wow, stop it.

102
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Me about you

103
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Will you end up calling me "brother-in-law"?

104
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That's not too far. But for me...

105
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Ah, ah, I can't hear it!

106
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I really don't want to let my colleagues and sister go on a fuss.

107
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Ah, no no. I'm going back. Well then.

He was really stylish.

111
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Spanish food They said they made a reservation.

112
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
That dress looks familiar.

113
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
...Does it suit you?

114
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Very. It's the best.

115
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
here you are.

116
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000

thank you.

120
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Sorry, let me help.

122
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
yeah?

123
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Are you tired somehow?

124
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
ah…. I haven't been able to sleep properly lately.

125
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
(Bunta) Oh! Ryu-kun!

126
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Bunta-san.

127
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It was just right. Do you go to karaoke?

128
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I feel like I want to sing today.

129
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
karaoke…?

130
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What, even if I'm told that suddenly.

131
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Ah... what is this?

132
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Is she?

133
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
No, that's not the case.

134
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Yoriko, Numata's niece.

135
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
ah….

136
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Bunta is next to me.

137
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Next door... Ah, Tamaki's younger brother.

138
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
nice to meet you.

139
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Thank you.

140
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
So...

141
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Let's go with Yoriko too.

142
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
No no no no no...

143
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
(Yoriko) What!

144
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Is it okay to join us?

145
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
What?!

146
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's Mochi no Ron! Get rid of it quickly.

147
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Bunta: Did you wear that cut-off suit?

148
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Apparently it was to get through

149
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Rather, by putting it on

150
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It seems like regrets have flooded me with.

151
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Was it counterproductive?

152
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's been 10 years since we've been together...

153
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Ten years isn't that easy.

154
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
For me

155
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You can wear your own clothes →

156
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's a happy thing though.

157
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
That dress too.

158
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Why is Kinugasa-san a tailor?

159
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Maybe it's because I liked making it.

160
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I majored in clothing design at an art university.

161
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So you could have become what you wanted to be.

162
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Hmm... I wonder what it is.

163
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
When asked if I was the person I wanted to be

164
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's a difficult part.

What...?

168
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I have to eat dessert soon.

169
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
If someone like me doesn't like me

170
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
He's the kind of guy that's shaky.

171
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
…sorry. I got carried away.

172
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,000
home.

173
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm sure I should be more attuned.

What!? What, why?

179
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Something... I'm getting excited...

181
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000

185
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'll buy it then.

186
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What? Can you listen to someone's songs?

187
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'll listen to it during the encore.

188
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What is it? An encore...

189
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Ah...

190
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
People involved

191
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
A broken heart karaoke party...

192
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Well, but... if you say it

193
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It makes you feel a little more relaxed. Hehe.

194
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:35,000
♬~「Tweet it silly

195
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm woken up and walking."

196
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Would you like to drink another place somewhere?

197
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Or will you drink it again at home?

198
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Haha...

199
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Is that the face of you saying, "That's the default route?"

200
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I get nervous when I'm invited after setting up the set.

201
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Ahahaha.

202
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
(Bunta) It's not "Ahaha"!

203
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Bunta!?

204
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
What are you flirting without Fumi-chan?

205
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Kishoi! It's too darn cool! Seriously I'll forgive you!

206
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Voice is loud!

207
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Within Fumi-chan's territory

208
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'll do my best →

209
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I was wrong in the first place.

210
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'll take you guys along! come!

211
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
a little bit….

212
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000

214
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Yes.

215
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Bunta-san, you're late.

216
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Let's go for another song at a time.

217
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Yeah.

218
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
(Bunta) Hahahaha...

219
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Finally I'm back...

220
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
(Bunta) I'm here!

221
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
(Bunta) Chikama found.

222
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Oh, these guys in town

223
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Frat, let's flirt →

224
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I took him away.

225
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I haven't done it!

226
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
(Bunta) That's bad

227
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
The couple who are starting to date are not intelligent.

228
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Alright, let's sing!

229
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:00,000
♬~ "I've always loved you

230
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It's still as beautiful as ever."

231
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Is that being forced by Bunta too?

232
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Ah, no...

233
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
If you keep going like this

234
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It's definitely the course until the morning.

235
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm going to be a decoy so everyone can watch the time

236
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Please leave nicely.

237
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
teeth? Follow me

238
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
What are you pretending to be a victim?

239
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
What? No way

240
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Are you trying to keep singing in this order?

241
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
If so, then

242
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's just too delicate.

243
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Sorry Yoriko. After all, I'm going to leave.

244
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Agawa-kun...

245
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Excuse me.

246
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Should I lend you my shoulder?

247
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
...I want to rent it for a moment. Only 5 seconds.

248
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Yeah.

249
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Has Yoriko ever had a broken heart?

250
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Of course there is.

251
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
...Thank you.

252
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
you're welcome.

253
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I wonder how everyone will get back on their feet.

254
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Hmm...

255
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:50,000
In my case, I think I did my best at my favorite job.

256
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
While I was immersed in and working hard

257

258
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I've regained confidence.

259
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Confidence...

260
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Yeah.

261
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
When you're broken, you say you have no value

262
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I don't think so.

263
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
That's why I said, "I'm glad I had work."

264
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I don't have that kind of thing...

265
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
What about soba noodles?

266
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Yeah…

267
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Well, I don't hate helping...

268
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Like my dad

269
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
There's a huge amount of attention to detail →

270
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You really like it

271
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I don't think so.

272
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Yeah.

273
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Yeah….

274
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Hey Ryuhei

275
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Model: Why not give it a try?

276
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
...Model?

277
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I read the shop article

278
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
An acquaintance of a fashion magazine →

279
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It seems he was curious about Ryuhei.

280
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It was a terrible first date.

281
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Where Bunta might appear

282
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I have to avoid it in the future.

283
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
The area of ​​activity is almost the same.

284
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
The house is also nearby.

285
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Would you like to go on a long trip? Like hot springs.

286
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
hot spring…. Are you traveling?

287
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Whether you're on a day trip or staying overnight

288
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It will be tailored to Tamaki's wishes.

289
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,000
♬〜

290
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
A hot spring? It's pretty quick to unfold.

291
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
oh dear. I'm an adult.

292
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Thanks to Bunta.

293
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
In the end, it's true

294
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
He's a really troublesome guy.

295
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's not a hassle

296
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's delicate.

297
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It's out. Bunta fully agrees.

298
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000

It's about time I have to go and prepare for the lesson!

303
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
What, lessons will be starting in the afternoon...

308
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000

314
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Apparently that's it.

315
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It's a cover...

316
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
OK. I'm going to change clothes a little.

317
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000

(Morimoto) That's good. That's good. Just as you imagined!

321
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I wonder if a completely amateur is okay...

322
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Who do you think will take a picture? It's me, right?

323

350
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I might have been here when I was a kid.

351
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Ah, maybe there is.

352
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Musashihara also used it a lot.

353
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
(Camera shutter sound)

372
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
(Numata) Yes, that's fine.

373
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Ah. He came.

374
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Because I invited you.

375
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
(Yoriko) Wow...

376
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Which reaction?

377
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Of course... cool.

378
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
The expression is natural too

379
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
The balance with Wham is also very good.

380
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
good.

381
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
How about filming?

382
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
get nervous. But it's fun.

383
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It felt like I was in a nostalgic place.

384
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
A nostalgic place...?

385
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
(Numata) Ryu-kun.

386
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
yes!

387
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Sorry I'm off.

388
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Yeah.

389
00:19:37,066 --> 00:19:43,066
Hey Marina. Unlike Kinugasa, I'm serving customers

390
00:19:37,066 --> 00:19:43,066
I'm not a sewer.

391
00:19:43,066 --> 00:19:45,066
But...

392
00:19:45,066 --> 00:19:48,066
Isn't it really a belly? Isn't it the best?

393
00:19:48,066 --> 00:19:51,066
Bunta-kun... As expected!

394
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:55,066
Ahaha! I want to show it in the range soon.

395
00:19:55,066 --> 00:19:59,066
I'll definitely be happy. Looking forward to the presentation!

396
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:05,066
I really did something a shame...

397
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:05,066
(Marina) What?

398
00:20:05,066 --> 00:20:08,066
Ah no... Marina's ex-husband.

399
00:20:08,066 --> 00:20:14,066
Spending time with Marina and the microwave

400
00:20:08,066 --> 00:20:14,066
I think I've let it go. It's so fun though.

401
00:20:16,066 --> 00:20:20,066
Ah, sorry! My sister gets mad

402
00:20:16,066 --> 00:20:20,066
Delicacy is hey.

403
00:20:20,066 --> 00:20:22,066
...That's not the case.

404
00:20:25,066 --> 00:20:30,066
I'm so happy to hear you say that.

405
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:37,066
Thank you Bunta-kun.

406
00:20:40,066 --> 00:20:42,066
I'm going to make coffee.

407
00:20:42,066 --> 00:20:47,066
Ah... I'll put it in.

408
00:20:42,066 --> 00:20:47,066
Special blend of Fumichan. Wait a minute.

409
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:55,066
Come to think of it, what does that mean?

410
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:55,066
A nostalgic place.

411
00:20:55,066 --> 00:21:00,066
ah. Since I was a kid

412
00:20:55,066 --> 00:21:00,066
I guess he liked cameras.

413
00:21:00,066 --> 00:21:03,066
Ah, I'm not the one who gets photographed, I'm the one who gets photographed.

414
00:21:00,066 --> 00:21:03,066
Yeah.

415
00:21:05,066 --> 00:21:08,066
Maybe I understand. When I saw Ryuhei's photo →

416
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:12,066
Even the things deep inside the subject

417
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:12,066
It felt like I was trying to take a picture.

418
00:21:12,066 --> 00:21:15,066
No, I'm not that conscious of it.

419
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:21,066
If you're doing it unconsciously

420
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:21,066
Maybe he's more suited to being a photographer.

421
00:21:21,066 --> 00:21:24,066
If you get praised like that, you'll feel like that.

422
00:21:25,066 --> 00:21:27,066
I think it's fine to keep going.

423
00:21:29,066 --> 00:21:33,066
Ryuhei is

424
00:21:29,066 --> 00:21:33,066
I think I should be more confident.

425
00:21:37,066 --> 00:21:39,066
Haa...

426
00:21:39,066 --> 00:21:44,066
Hot spring... Maybe it was too early after all...

427
00:21:44,066 --> 00:21:49,066
No, this speed is fine

428
00:21:44,066 --> 00:21:49,066
surely.

429
00:21:49,066 --> 00:21:51,066
It's already a good year.

430
00:21:51,066 --> 00:21:58,066
♬〜

431
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:02,066
Thank you. Today was fun.

432
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:02,066
(Yoriko) That's good.

433
00:22:02,066 --> 00:22:07,066
Ryuhei looks like a sponge.

434
00:22:07,066 --> 00:22:09,066
sponge?

435
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:15,066
Honest and flexible

436
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:15,066
I absorb anything quickly.

437
00:22:15,066 --> 00:22:19,066
It's tough and fun

438
00:22:15,066 --> 00:22:19,066
I'll suck it all in well.

439
00:22:20,066 --> 00:22:22,066
That's what I was told for the first time.

440
00:22:25,066 --> 00:22:32,066
About Ryuhei-san

441
00:22:25,066 --> 00:22:32,066
I thought I'd want to watch next to me forever. today.

442
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:43,066
When I inhale something good, I want to be happy together.

443
00:22:43,066 --> 00:22:49,066
If you inhale something ugly

444
00:22:43,066 --> 00:22:49,066
I want to lend my shoulders again...

445
00:22:51,066 --> 00:22:55,066
I've also understood it.

446
00:22:57,066 --> 00:23:01,066
It's the most fun thing to be around Ryuhei.

447
00:23:06,066 --> 00:23:08,066
Ryuhei.

448
00:23:10,066 --> 00:23:14,066
Would you like to date me?

449
00:23:14,066 --> 00:23:30,066
♬〜
