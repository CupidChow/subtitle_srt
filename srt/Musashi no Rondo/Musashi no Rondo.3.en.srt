00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
(Musashihara Tamaki) Kinugasa-san!?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
(Musashihara Bunta) Starting tonight

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
This guy decided to stay at our house.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Huh?!

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
(Bunta) Oh...!

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Slightly... what?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
(Kingugasa Yasu) <I want to measure, dress up, take off →

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That kind of person has appeared

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
"People who want to dress my clothes"

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
<People I want to meet more than today>

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
<Place 10 guard dogs below me next to me

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Someone who smiles

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
<But I have a string that I can't glare at the guard dog...>

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Kinugasa-san!

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
<It's still clinging to me>

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Kinugasa-san...!

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
(chime)

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes!

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
(chime)

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
(Isahaya Miu) Chao!

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
oh~! My best Rokuro style!

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Even though I've left it alone for years.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Hey, I'll have a consultation right away.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Until the exhibition and during the event →

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
3,000 yen per night for just 60,000 yen What do you think?

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Huh?!

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What... Maybe you're going to live here?

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So it's 3,200 yen per night!

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
(Sigh)

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
please!

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Looking at you

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It really makes me realize that people can't change.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Ah... That's right.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm not growing at all.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So it's 4,000 yen!

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
How about 5,000 yen?

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Preserve...! Please!

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Hmm...

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
ᗕ(Birds' Tweets)

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Ah...

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Oh! You woke up.

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Do you remember? That was yesterday.

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yes... about half of it...

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Haha...

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Ah... What about Tamaki?

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Ah, I usually dance early in the morning.

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Then prepare for the lesson

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Go jogging, take a shower, have dinner.

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
A routine to determine your longevity!

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I see. ah….

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
(Agawa Ryuhei) Hey Pon-chan

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What should I wear on a date?

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Haa... What do you think Tamaki will wear?

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
(cry)

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's not decided...

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
(Tamaki's voice) Kinugasa-san...!

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What does that mean?

58
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I picked it up at the bar.

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
My ex-wife has been staying at home

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I say I can't go home →

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So why not stay at home for a while?

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
That's what happened...

63
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
That's just how it is...!

64
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Kinugasa-san! Kinugasa-san...!

65
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Huh... Shall I bring you some water?

66
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
♬〜

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I see….

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yes... I see. I see...

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Sorry for this night.

70
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So, I'm sorry about this...

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Have a wonderful night everyone!

72
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Hahaha...!

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
(Falling sound)

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
(Sound of falling down the stairs)

75
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
(Crushing sound)

76
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Oh! Hahaha...!

77
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
OK!?

78
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
(Bunta) I'll bring you water. Hahaha...!

79
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What is it? This person...

80
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
He's too cute...!

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
ᗒ (Bunta): How long will Miu stay at home?

82
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's bad when we meet, me...

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What's wrong?

84
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Something like fire, like fire?

85
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The other side will also show it to you.

86
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I know I can't refuse.

87
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Once you start drinking, it won't be useful

88
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I wonder if Miu will give up too...

89
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Does that mean you're shaking with your ex-wife?

90
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
(Tamaki's voice) That's what happened in that state...

91
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I don't like it.

92
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
...Medical services?

93
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
(cry)

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Ah already...!

95
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Teacher Good morning.

96
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
good morning.

97
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
good morning.

98
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
good morning.

99
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
(Yamanouchi Marina) Teacher.

100
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
good morning. Oh, come to the range.

101
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
who? visit?

102
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
yes. Renji-kun. Everyone please.

103
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
(Students) Thank you!

104
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
(Marina) Hmm...? range!

105
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Come on, come on. keep it up.

106
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So I'll come and pick you up before noon.

107
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yeah.

108
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Thank you very much.

109
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's okay to take it easy.

110
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
thank you.

111
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
(Agawa Namie) Oh! good morning.

112
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
(Tamaki Marina) Good morning.

113
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Good morning Pon-chan! That's cute.

114
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
good morning!

115
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Oh! What? What?

116
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
We were gathering all over the place from the morning...

117
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
(Marina) Bunta-kun Good morning.

118
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
(Bunta) Good morning.

119
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
(Namie) Oh? teacher?

120
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Ah... Hello.

121
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Ah, I see. Did you do dyed items together?

122
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
(Namie) Yes.

123
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Auntie this guy for a while

124
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
We've decided to surround ourselves with us, so please look forward to it.

125
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What?!?

126
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
No, that's not decided yet...

127
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
(Bunta)

128
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Even if you see it on our property →

129
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Don't report it.

130
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I won't! already….

131
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
teacher! Thank you for the other day.

132
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Ah, no...

133
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
(Namie) Pon-chan!

134
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
yes. I know that...

135
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What a sudden turn of events...!?

136
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I don't even know. I'll report it later.

137
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Understood!

138
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
(Namie) Well then. Take care.

139
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Well, I'll go!

140
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I have to go too. So later.

141
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
(Marina) Tamaki and Kinugasa are under the same roof...!

142
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Now, what should we do? Agawa-kun!

143
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
ah…!

144
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's not decided...

145
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
♬〜

146
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
(Student) Teacher Thank you for your hard work!

147
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
(Students) Thank you for your hard work!

148
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Yes, goodbye.

149
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
(Students) Goodbye!

150
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
how was it? Watch everyone dance.

151
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
(Yamanouchi Range) That was cool!

152
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It was amazing, round and round!

153
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Pirouette round.

154
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
With practice you will be able to range too.

155
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
(Renge) Is it true?

156
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Yeah. Take a good look.

157
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Wow...!

158
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
The range has a nice reaction.

159
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
When Agawa was about the same time...

160
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Stretch your hind legs. The neck is long.

161
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Huh... Huh...

162
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
(Tamaki's voice) It was kind of a nihil...

163
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
ᗒ(Footsteps)

164
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Okay!

165
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
What's "good"?

166
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I thought I didn't put it on.

167
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So where are you going?

168
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Well, I've thought about a lot...

169
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Tamaki: You don't want to walk around with me in the neighborhood, holding hands, right?

170
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Huh?

171
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You'll connect it, about your hands. It's a date.

172
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
So I'll go a little further away

173
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
For now, rent a car.

174
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
this!?

175
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
yes. this.

176
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
♬〜

177
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Agawa-kun, when did you get your license?

178
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I've had it since 18.

179
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I used to ride it a lot even at part-time jobs.

180
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I didn't know...

181
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Or rather, just to go out half a day

182
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Did you choose this car? why?

183
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Because it's a camper van

184
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Didn't you want to live there?

185
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Huh?

186
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It was written in the essay when I was in the first year of junior high school.

187
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I don't remember at all.

188
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
When did you read it? That essay.

189
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I was shown it to Tamaki's mother.

190
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
When I was in the first year of junior high school.

191
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
To your mother?

192
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Yeah.

193
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Essay It seems he's been taking good care of it for a long time.

194
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Wow... Surprising.

195
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Agawa-kun said he got his license at 18.

196
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yeah.

197
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
The year before that, my parents had a traffic accident...

198
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Ah... Will that happen now?

199
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
When did it disappear?

200
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I wanted to live in a camper van...

201
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
yeah?

202
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yes.

203
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Is there somewhere you want to go?

204
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I want to take Tamaki with me

205
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Can I go?

206
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Leave it to me.

207
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
ᗒ (sound of weaving a machine)

208
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
(Sound of weaving a machine)

209
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
(Miu) Ah already...! On this date

210
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
There's no way we can just complete the test!

211
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Too reckless.

212
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You'll be taking orders without your permission.

213
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
(Orisaka Yoshino) So sorry!

214
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Haa... We have to somehow secure personnel.

215
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
(Yoshino) But can you find someone now?

216
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
There's a snack. The landlord here.

217
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
A landlord...

218
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
If this happens, no matter what...

219
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Ah!

220
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:42,000
♬〜

221
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Preserve! This is what it is!

222
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Please lend me one arm!

223
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
No, me

224
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I just stopped by to get my charger and change of clothes.

225
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
(Yoshino) I know you're busy with your main job, but →

226
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Please a few hours a day

227
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Could you please help us?

228
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Ah... me

229
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I run a company in collaboration with Miu →

230
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
My name is Orisaka.

231
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Orisaka-san...

232
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
The situation is yesterday

233
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I've been hearing mostly from her.

234
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
On top of that, for me

235
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I politely refused.

236
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
(Yoshino) Without saying that, I managed to...

237
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Here's what I would like to help.

238
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
A total of 27 items including a bag, blouse, dress, and more.

239
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
The other five are scrolls

240
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It would be enough for Miu to weave freely...

241
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
♬〜

242
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Save~!

243
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Because I'm getting out of work.

244
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
(Door opening and closing sound)

245
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
That's a bit confusing.

246
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
What... is that so?

247
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Because I love making it.

248
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Haa...forget it.

249
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Put in alcohol and get a body that can't touch the sewing machine.

250
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
The efforts he had escaped were spurred.

251
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It's now Miu's seamstress...

252
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
ah….

253
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It feels good!

254
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Ah I wanted to bring a yoga mat.

255
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
There is!

256
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Yay! ...What is that?

257
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Wherever you go

258
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I had the impression that I was doing gymnastics or meditation.

259
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'll call you if you have tea.

260
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
thank you.

261
00:12:50,000 --> 00:13:03,000
♬〜

262
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Is this on a proper date?

263
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
(Bunta) Oh! Hahaha...!

264
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
OK!?

265
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
(Bunta) I'll bring you water.

266
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
What is it? This person...

267
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
He's too cute...!

268
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
♬〜

269
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
No good. Evil despair, leave!

270
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It's amazing... so much fun!

271
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
(Camera shutter sound)

272
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Hehe...

273
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
The gap between the sky and the land

274
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's not like you'll ever feel this strong.

275
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Yes, hold on.

276
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I don't want to refuse something like this today.

277
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Oh...!

278
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
There's zero cautiousness

279
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Every time I get annoyed.

280
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Because what I hate

281
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Agawa-kun probably won't do that.

282
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
What I want to do

283
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It might be something Tamaki dislikes.

284
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Slowly...!

285
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Good job!

286
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Hey...!

287
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Today, I'm thinking about the possibilities

288
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Please spend your time.

289
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It's scary... Hey, it's scary!

290
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Haha...!

291
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Finally, I saw a face that was upset.

292
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
♬〜

293
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
After drinking tea, let's walk a little.

294
00:15:03,066 --> 00:15:06,066
Pon-chan's walk and

295
00:15:03,066 --> 00:15:06,066
What you're doing isn't much different.

296
00:15:06,066 --> 00:15:08,066
It's not!

297
00:15:08,066 --> 00:15:11,066
I'm in the neighborhood

298
00:15:08,066 --> 00:15:11,066
I monopolize the time of the ring →

299
00:15:11,066 --> 00:15:13,066
Probably the first time I've ever lived.

300
00:15:14,066 --> 00:15:16,066
Hmm!

301
00:15:17,066 --> 00:15:20,066
Does that mean you want to put your hands on it?

302
00:15:20,066 --> 00:15:22,066
It's a date.

303
00:15:28,066 --> 00:15:33,066
Tamaki holds my hand →

304
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:36,066
I don't like it or I'm happy →

305
00:15:36,066 --> 00:15:40,066
It's not that kind of problem

306
00:15:36,066 --> 00:15:40,066
Feelings.

307
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:44,066
I wonder... It's not that I don't like it.

308
00:15:44,066 --> 00:15:47,066
But it's not that I'm happy either.

309
00:15:50,066 --> 00:15:54,066
So next. Because it's a date.

310
00:15:57,066 --> 00:15:59,066
this is?

311
00:16:01,066 --> 00:16:03,066
Don't brush it off for now.

312
00:16:05,066 --> 00:16:09,066
Please see what you think and let me know.

313
00:16:09,066 --> 00:16:15,066
♬〜

314
00:16:15,066 --> 00:16:17,066
Usually, it's not good.

315
00:16:17,066 --> 00:16:19,066
...What?!?

316
00:16:19,066 --> 00:16:22,066
Ah... not just with my boyfriend →

317
00:16:22,066 --> 00:16:26,066
From outside in the middle of the day

318
00:16:22,066 --> 00:16:26,066
It means "No."

319
00:16:26,066 --> 00:16:28,066
ah….

320
00:16:28,066 --> 00:16:31,066
Now it's →

321
00:16:31,066 --> 00:16:36,066
Where am I drawing Agawa-kun?

322
00:16:31,066 --> 00:16:36,066
You're talking about wanting to know, right?

323
00:16:36,066 --> 00:16:38,066
Yeah….

324
00:16:38,066 --> 00:16:45,066
What caught me so much

325
00:16:38,066 --> 00:16:45,066
Can't you just go easy on Agawa-kun? →

326
00:16:45,066 --> 00:16:49,066
Honestly, I might have been a bit interested.

327
00:16:53,066 --> 00:16:57,066
(Bunta) Did you end up going home?

328
00:16:53,066 --> 00:16:57,066
Just for a moment.

329
00:16:57,066 --> 00:17:01,066
Did you meet Miu? Can you revert it back?

330
00:17:01,066 --> 00:17:03,066
Is it going back, stupid?

331
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:06,066
Huh?

332
00:17:08,066 --> 00:17:11,066
The exhibition is pretty quick!

333
00:17:11,066 --> 00:17:14,066
I like Sayoko

334
00:17:11,066 --> 00:17:14,066
A work by Miu.

335
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:17,066
Are you going?

336
00:17:17,066 --> 00:17:20,066
What I want to go back

337
00:17:17,066 --> 00:17:20,066
Isn't it yours?

338
00:17:20,066 --> 00:17:23,066
Of course, it's my first setback in my life.

339
00:17:23,066 --> 00:17:26,066
I'm not used to being dumped by a woman.

340
00:17:26,066 --> 00:17:28,066
Wow... I'm annoyed.

341
00:17:28,066 --> 00:17:33,066
But in fact, someone I haven't seen in years

342
00:17:28,066 --> 00:17:33,066
How does it feel to be tumbling into the house?

343
00:17:35,066 --> 00:17:38,066
Only confusion.

344
00:17:38,066 --> 00:17:41,066
Maybe it's okay to get troublesome for a while after all?

345
00:17:41,066 --> 00:17:44,066
So do that

346
00:17:41,066 --> 00:17:44,066
I've been saying it since yesterday!

347
00:17:44,066 --> 00:17:47,066
thank you. I'll give you a favor.

348
00:17:44,066 --> 00:17:47,066
Today I'm going to make dinner.

349
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:50,066
Seriously!? Yay!

350
00:17:50,066 --> 00:17:53,066
What does Tamaki like?

351
00:17:53,066 --> 00:17:58,066
Ah... sister

352
00:17:53,066 --> 00:17:58,066
Maybe it's a little late tonight.

353
00:18:00,066 --> 00:18:03,066
Tamaki-san Where are you going today?

354
00:18:03,066 --> 00:18:05,066
(Bunta) Now...

355
00:18:15,132 --> 00:18:17,132
It's a bit interesting.

356
00:18:17,132 --> 00:18:19,132
What?

357
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:24,132
Sometimes I'm talking about Agawa-kun

358
00:18:19,132 --> 00:18:24,132
It turns out, "Who? This person."

359
00:18:24,132 --> 00:18:28,132
Also, to be able to be easily swayed

360
00:18:24,132 --> 00:18:28,132
I was scared...

361
00:18:28,132 --> 00:18:31,132
Does that mean a good thing? Is it a bad idea?

362
00:18:31,132 --> 00:18:33,132
What's going on?

363
00:18:33,132 --> 00:18:39,132
A gradation of emotions towards Agawa-kun

364
00:18:33,132 --> 00:18:39,132
Is there or not...

365
00:18:39,132 --> 00:18:41,132
Grade?

366
00:18:42,132 --> 00:18:45,132
Usually

367
00:18:42,132 --> 00:18:45,132
I fell in love, I want to get closer, I want to touch →

368
00:18:45,132 --> 00:18:48,132
It's going to come in order, right?

369
00:18:48,132 --> 00:18:51,132
That's what you want to be a lover.

370
00:18:51,132 --> 00:18:55,132
Maybe that's true?

371
00:18:51,132 --> 00:18:55,132
I've always thought that to Tamaki.

372
00:18:57,132 --> 00:19:00,132
What Tamaki calls gradients →

373
00:19:00,132 --> 00:19:03,132
How much can I forgive

374
00:19:00,132 --> 00:19:03,132
Does that mean you can't judge?

375
00:19:04,132 --> 00:19:07,132
That's what I say clearly →

376
00:19:07,132 --> 00:19:11,132
To meet childish problems

377
00:19:07,132 --> 00:19:11,132
I feel sorry but...

378
00:19:13,132 --> 00:19:18,132
Why not give it a try? With skinship.

379
00:19:21,132 --> 00:19:25,132
Is it interesting or boring →

380
00:19:25,132 --> 00:19:28,132
It's the quickest way to experience it.

381
00:19:30,132 --> 00:19:33,132
Is it fun to be doing something like this?

382
00:19:33,132 --> 00:19:36,132
I'm sure I'll be fun.

383
00:19:36,132 --> 00:19:40,132
I see. That's right….

386
00:20:19,132 --> 00:20:23,132
sorry. Get angry...?

387
00:20:24,132 --> 00:20:27,132
No, I'm not angry.

388
00:20:27,132 --> 00:20:31,132
What about the ring? Have you not been able to do it yet?

389
00:20:33,132 --> 00:20:37,132
I guess it's impossible... I feel a lot of guilt.

390
00:20:40,132 --> 00:20:42,132
What does it mean?

391
00:20:42,132 --> 00:20:46,132
Something... just my curiosity →

392
00:20:46,132 --> 00:20:50,132
Young boy probably toyed

393
00:20:46,132 --> 00:20:50,132
Like...

394
00:20:50,132 --> 00:20:52,132
what? that.

395
00:20:56,132 --> 00:20:58,132
Is it a one-sided cause?

396
00:21:01,132 --> 00:21:03,132
Then this time, it's me...

397
00:21:04,132 --> 00:21:07,132
...Whoa, don't be blatantly scared.

398
00:21:12,132 --> 00:21:16,132
Kiss... Can I do it?

399
00:21:20,132 --> 00:21:23,132
Other than the mouth...

400
00:21:26,132 --> 00:21:30,132
So...except for the mouth.

402
00:21:57,132 --> 00:22:00,132
I'm 25.

403
00:22:00,132 --> 00:22:03,132
What was Tamaki doing when he was my age now?

404
00:22:03,132 --> 00:22:06,132
I'm sure he had a boyfriend too →

405
00:22:06,132 --> 00:22:10,132
Life in your 30s now

406
00:22:06,132 --> 00:22:10,132
What you're doing won't change that way, right?

407
00:22:10,132 --> 00:22:12,132
But why is it just me?

408
00:22:12,132 --> 00:22:15,132
Are you locked in a kid's frame forever?

409
00:22:18,132 --> 00:22:20,132
…ring?

410
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:24,132
Ryu-kun. Grandma!

412
00:22:33,132 --> 00:22:35,132
different….

413
00:22:36,132 --> 00:22:38,132
What...?

If you arouse Agawa-kun, you'll get hurt...

417
00:22:58,132 --> 00:23:04,132
When I was a child, I was.

419
00:23:09,132 --> 00:23:11,132
Agawa-kun.

420
00:23:11,132 --> 00:23:14,132
Instead of having sex here now

421
00:23:11,132 --> 00:23:14,132
To break up →

422
00:23:14,132 --> 00:23:17,132
Continuing like this with neighbors

423
00:23:14,132 --> 00:23:17,132
I'm going to go home right away →

424
00:23:17,132 --> 00:23:19,132
Which is better?
