1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
(Musashihara Tamaki) Ryu-kun, bare!

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Ah, I laughed!

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
<Agawa-kun, 10 years younger than him,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Before I knew it, I had grown up.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Agawa-kun a little more

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Shall I try to straighten my spine? yes.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
<Even when you don't notice it>

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Agawa liked me.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
<but…>

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
<Agawa-kun, no matter how old he is →

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
10 Dragons below

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
(Agawa Ryuhei) Me too →

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Once again as a potential boyfriend

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I want it to be included as an option.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So try it all at once.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
That thought stops crack it →

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Think about whether it is or not from scratch.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
♬〜

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
If you don't like it, hit it. I won't apologize though.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
♬〜

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Did you eat cilantro?

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
(Pitching sound)

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Ah! It's it!

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Ah! ah…!

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Oh...! Pon-chan!

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Why not now?

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Even I have a family

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
If you go far →

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I think he'd given up on it.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But I couldn't leave from me.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's quite dull me.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Did you notice it just now? It's late.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
(Sigh)

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And with that old man

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
If you just ate dinner, then →

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Does that mean you're looking at them after all?

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Is it different?

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Even if you don't come across that kind of thing...

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
This is Shimizu's final stage.

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
How silent I remained so far

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I think I've been backing down!

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
it is….

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Anyway, before I get serious about it over there →

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
That I'm the person I want to date Tamaki

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Just know once more.

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Then, weigh it down.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Me too

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I want to start the race.

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
but….

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
what?

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm probably going to Kinugasa-san's house this Sunday.

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
They go out of their way to meet one-on-one.

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I have a feeling that I'll fall in love with it.

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I can't stop it just because I have a feeling.

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
This age is so cute.

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Let it get in the way at once.

57
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:14,000
♬〜

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Did it come to light? My seriousness.

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'll try to think about it anyway.

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Be aware once again.

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But at this stage →

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I have an attachment that cannot be called love...

63
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Well, think about it slowly.

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Lie! stomatitis!?

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Only for today...

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Because of Agawa

67
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I was unconsciously touching it around my mouth.

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
(Sigh)

69
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

70
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Sorry for coming here.

71
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
(Kingugasa Yasu) No, it's a neighborhood.

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Shall we go?

73
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
yes.

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
(Musashihara Bunta) What? Seriously?

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The other day I went to my house →

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
After that

77
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'll invite you to our house right away.

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Suddenly, they'll be in each other's territory

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I thought I was stepping too far...

80
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
We've been around since ancient times

81
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
People used to come and go often →

82
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Visiting other homes too

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Maybe you don't have much resistance.

84
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
If so →

85
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
If you feel like you're misleading the distance

86
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
sorry.

87
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
That's right.

88
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm asking you here

89
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Isn't it a bit uncautious?

90
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's not like he'll follow you no matter who he is.

91
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
If so, it's a relief and an honor.

92
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
This is also where you can enter women other than your family.

93
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
This is Tamaki's first time.

94
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The loom...

95
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Was Kinugasa a crane?

96
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Anyway, I'm ready for the meal

97
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
please.

98
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
♬〜

99
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yeah! It's tasty.

100
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
good.

101
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's a bit tingling but...

102
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
That loom, the person I was married to

103
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It was something I used before.

104
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Haa...

105
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
My ex-wife was originally domestically

106
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I was active as a textile artist.

107
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I currently run a company overseas...

108
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I put the rent for the space I left behind.

109
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'll transfer it.

110
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
10,000 yen per month.

111
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Is it rent?

112
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I returned to Japan to hold a solo exhibition once a year.

113
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I would like to use it depending on what I want to make at that time

114
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
That's what it seems.

115
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So, when your ex-wife returns to Japan, will you go here?

116
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
home. After breaking up

117
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I've never been there yet.

118
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
But I'll stop making the transfer

119
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I've never asked.

120
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
This is my

121
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's a visualized, obvious regret.

122
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
If you know how to use it →

123
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
already

124
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Wouldn't it be better if you made it your own?

125
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's so good that you forget about your former owner

126
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Is it not possible?

127
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Maybe I'll try putting on thread.

128
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
That's good.

129
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:12,000
♬〜

130
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
What...

131
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
sorry.

132
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Actually, I only developed mouth ulcers this morning...

133
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What is it?

134
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I guess he was just too brave.

135
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm sorry I can't get the same thing back.

136
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
(Sigh)

137
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Welcome home.

138
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm home.

139
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
That's it...

140
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
(Numata Hisashi) Here it is! long time no see.

141
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Numata-san!

142
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
(bell)

143
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
(Numata) He has a nice face.

144
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
The photographer and his family

145
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
There's no trouble choosing a memorial photograph.

146
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's ironic.

147
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
If you come here

148
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Every time I am swallowed by a huge flood of memories.

149
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Agawa and this shop are built on the Musashihara grounds.

150
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You were born...

151
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Ah!

152
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
This is the one that was asked to do.

153
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
thank you.

154
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
what? that.

155
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It was still not developed

156
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Dad's film →

157
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I had them baked two bottles.

158
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Wow.

159
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Please come slowly this time.

160
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Please stop by the store again.

161
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
ah. but

162
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Ryu-kun becomes handsome every time he sees it.

163
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
No no no no...

164
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
(Numata) Isn't he popular?

165
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
That's not the case.

166
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
(Numata) Hahahaha...!

167
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Well then. Please also Bunta.

168
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
yes.

169
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
(Door opening and closing sound)

170
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Can I look at that photo too?

171
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yeah.

172
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Photos show the personality of the person who took them.

173
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
See, Uncle was kind.

174
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
The photos are also gentle.

175
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Ah... Maybe so.

176
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Ah! Agawa-kun is there. cute!

177
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
uncle

178
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
When did you photograph that?

179
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Ah! This towel from the ring

180
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's my favorite pink one.

181
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Was it pink? I don't remember.

182
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I was thinking of buying it too.

183
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I wanted something that was matching with Tamaki.

184
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
♬〜

185
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I really love ballet.

186
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Even if you look at this crying face, you say you love ballet

187
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's about Agawa-kun.

188
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
But you love it so much that you're so frustrated that you'll cry, right?

189
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
…Yeah.

190
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
When I'm dancing, I'll turn it back.

191
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
For mom and dad

192
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I feel like I can say "welcome back."

193
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Tamaki is even though Auntie is alive

194
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Have you been here forever?

195
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I don't know but →

196
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,000
That ballet class

197
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I think it's the place I want to dance the most...

198
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I see. Auntie is happy.

199
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
ᗕ(Bunta) Now!

200
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
welcome home.

201
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
(Bunta) Yes.

202
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Sister

203
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
He'd come and pick him up in Kinugasa since morning.

204
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Because I don't meet

205
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Don't put on my colleague!

206
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
How to say it!

207
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
(Vibration sound from mobile phone)

208
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Thank you.

209
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Thank you very much for now.

210
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
(Bunta) Oh! If you make rumors.

211
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Regarding the dyeing I mentioned earlier

212
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
How about the next Saturday?

213
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
yes. but

214
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Will it defile your home's balcony?

215
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Ah, you'll dye it in the bathroom.

216
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Veranda? Bathroom?

217
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
What is it?! What's the story?

218
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Hey, what? Hey.

219
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It's noisy!

220
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I was told to be dyed.

221
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Sorry. Well, on Saturday.

222
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
yes.

223
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Dyed foods are dried, right?

224
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
So it's not inside the house

225
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Wouldn't it be good to do it in my garden?

226
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
📞I want to learn about dyeing too.

227
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
📞In between

228
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Um... the one that spins the yarn was also interesting.

229
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
📞Eh, but...

230
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Is that voice Agawa-kun? Next door.

231
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
📞Yes...

232
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
(Sigh)

233
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Please come along with us.

234
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
They also want to rent a garden.

235
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Understood. It's Saturday.

236
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
(Bunta) I'm steadily getting closer.

237
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
(Mobile phone ringtone)

238
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,000
♬〜

239
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
(The voice of Nagamine Sayoko) "When will you come back to me?"

240
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
The lemon eucalyptus is iron mordant and grey.

241
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Copper mordant gives off a dark brown.

242
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
All that's left to do is rinse and dry it and you're done.

243
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Make sure you can swim in the tub

244
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Rinse.

245
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
yes.

246
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
(Agawa Namie) Hey, sensei

247
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
What about this scarf design?

248
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
He's genius. It's hard to believe it's the first time.

249
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Oh, no! He's good.

250
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Hehehehe...

251
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Why are you taking part in Natural?

252
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's good.

253
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
(Namie) Ah! teacher.

254
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Hey, what happens when you dye it with soba husks?

255
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I wonder if soba noodles are no good?

256
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Well... it's fine.

257
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
(Namie) You can get a lot of soba husks

258
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
How about the teacher together?

259
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Let's say it's obvious that we can't date you.

260
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
(Namie) Oh no. Teacher: Soba noodles are not good?

261
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
ring.

262
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I know why I'm angry but

263
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I won't apologize.

264
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm not particularly angry.

265
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Either way, I hate myself.

266
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It's like I'm in the way of Tamaki

267
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I might see it but →

268
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Conclusion: Don't say it even if you think you're coming up, you know.

269
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
why?

270
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Tamaki still about me

271
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You didn't really imagine it seriously.

272
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I have an interest that's going to be towards him

273
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Why doesn't it come over here? Have you thought about it?

274
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Even once after that Pon-chan's walk.

275
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Pon-chan's walk?

276
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
(Namie) Oh! Marina-chan.

277
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
(Yamanouchi Marina) Auntie, what's wrong?

278
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
That stole.

279
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
(Namie) Isn't it okay?

280
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I was praised by Kinugasa-sensei.

281
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Pon-chan! fine?

282
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Marina. Right now

283
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I was thinking of making tea!

284
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Let's go, let's go!

285
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
(Marina) Slowly...

286
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:32,000
♬〜

287
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Is this Pon-chan?

288
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Sometimes even the ring and the others

289
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'll have him go out for a walk.

290
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I came today and understood →

291
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Rather than just a neighbor

292
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It almost feels like a two-family home.

293
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
My childhood friend

294
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Maybe he was raised like a sibling?

295
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I've never thought of Tamaki as my older sister though.

296
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Hmm...

297
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Seriously, I'll give you a favor.

298
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Marina was very grateful that you came.

299
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Huh? What?

300
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Me Now →

301
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I just met

302
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I think Kinugasa is good...

303
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Yeah~! Seriously?!

304
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Huh? but

305
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I'm sure Kinugasa is married...

306
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
He's actually divorced.

307
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
oh~! A good guy with a slut?

308
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
That's good, that's good!

309
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
No way! When?

310
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
But last week, Agawa-kun confessed his feelings to me...

311
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Huh?

312
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
What?!

313
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Which Agawa-kun is that?

314
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Shee!

315
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
No way...! Huh? Slowly...

316
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
why? why? why?

317
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
The Musashihara family is essentially three siblings

318
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Isn't it like that?

319
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Yes... why?

320
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Is it a taboo like Korean drama?

321
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
After all, it's hard to imagine from Marina's perspective.

322
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
So me too

323
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I think I have to turn it off properly early.

324
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Yeah…. Well →

325
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
For someone you've thought you were family for over 20 years

326
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Even if you come suddenly.

327
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
If you've been thinking of me for a long time, it's fine.

328
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
What if it was forever...?

329
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
What?!?

330
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Even if you don't think you're your sister, Tamaki-san is

331
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,000
You're petting you like your younger brother, right?

332
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
About my real brother Bunta

333
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'm not particularly fond of Tamaki though.

334
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
When Kinugasa comes here

335
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
You haven't been wearing a wedding ring.

336
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
ah…. I think there's a lot of water work today.

337
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You are the one who dyes plants on your precious holiday

338
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Wasn't it boring?

339
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
not at all! I was really interested.

340
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
For that reason, I just dyed a T-shirt

341
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
The rest was a bit vague though...

342
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
My mother was so noisy... I'm just tired.

343
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I haven't been wearing my uniform yet.

344
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
With the appearance of Kinugasa

345
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Agawa-kun, did you get serious?

346
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Well, I know how I feel though.

347
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Unrequited love is tough.

348
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Are you feeling something?

349
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
What!? Ah... General.

350
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Even so

351
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
A love triangle between younger and the same generation →

352
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It's like a trendy Showa drama.

353
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
No matter where I cut it out, my heart is pounding.

354
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Everything in your brain is a drama!

355
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Hahaha...

356
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Tea has arrived!

357
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Shall I add some coffee?

358
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
(Sayoko) What?

359
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Sayoko's favorite food too. See.

360
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's just one drink.

361
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Yeah! This brownie is delicious! Which?

362
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I baked it.

363
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Seriously? Amazing!

364
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
this is….

365
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It's a love reality show!

366
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
(Sayoko) That's not so sloppy

367
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Isn't it not good?

368
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
...I mean, I'm not saying that.

369
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Lately... how about it?

370
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It's bad for Bunta, but it's fulfilling.

371
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I have nothing but regrets right now...

372
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:35,000
♬〜

373
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
If you say that

374
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You'll accidentally become a sex friend?

375
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Don't spend time with the other guys.

376
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
If you don't want to be together

377
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Don't come here anymore.

378
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
(Sayoko) And I have a promise after this.

379
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I couldn't be excited right now.

380
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
(Bunta) What is a promise?

381
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Should I talk?

382
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
No, I won't listen. I'm going back.

383
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I'm home~!

384
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Ah... Bunta-kun!

385
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,000
The garden is going to be amazing.

386
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Soy Dyeing Seriously did it.

387
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Oh!

388
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Hmm? Sister

389
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Isn't this a bit sweet enough?

390
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
So, bake it yourself!

391
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
oh! Kinugasa! This bag is great!

392
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Show me, show me!

393
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Hey, isn't this handmade?

394
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Wow! Amazing!

395
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Bunta-san today

396
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Isn't it really high?

397
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Not particularly? That's normal.

398
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Oh no! Amazing.

399
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
(Vibration sound from mobile phone)

400
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Turn back.

401
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
But isn't it from your previous wife?

402
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
(Vibration sound from mobile phone)

403
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
rude. I'll go back soon.

404
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
(Bunta) I wonder if he will return to Japan again at a solo exhibition.

405
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I like that person's stole.

406
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Actually, just now →

407
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
My ex-wife contacted me and asked me to use that loom.

408
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I wonder what's going on now

409
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm a little confused...

410
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
In other words, his wife is returning to Japan →

411
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
At Kinugasa's house

412
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It's about making it.

413
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Thank you for your trouble of reporting.

414
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
In the future, including that loom →

415
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
With Kinugasa-san and that person

416
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Until it's settled again →

417
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
From me to Kinugasa's house

418
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I don't think I'll be able to come.

419
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
...That's right.

420
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
The crane that I missed has returned...?

421
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Agawa-kun.

422
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Let's walk circle.

423
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Today is not Pon-chan's walk.

424
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
In the end, that's an excuse...

425
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I'm that... →

426
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It's a pain to get an answer right away, though →

427
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I wonder if it's not going to be muddled.

428
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,000
So... Kinugasa-san

429
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I don't know what's going on now but →

430
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Before I could clearly say about me... that's it.

431
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It's fine to be nearby

432
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Would you like to go out somewhere together? and.

433
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Huh?

434
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Half a day, could you lend me a seat next to Tamaki?

435
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It's not about Pon-chan's walks or something →

436
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Even in films, exhibitions, and plays

437
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Anything is fine though...

438
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Let's go.

439
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It's a date somewhere, right?

440
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Seriously?!

441
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
So before I change my mind

442
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Plan now!

443
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
If Tamaki thinks it's fun, I'll win.

444
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
What kind of battle is it?

445
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:24,000
♬〜

446
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
(Sigh)

447
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
A date promise that is so exciting

448
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Was it okay if I did?

449
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
♬〜

450
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
(Bunta's voice) Isn't it from the previous wife?

451
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
rude. I'll go back soon.

452
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
(Tamaki's voice) Are you revengeful to Kinugasa-san...?

453
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It shouldn't be. Because...

454
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
(Tamaki's voice) Agawa looks happy →

455
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I'm happy too.

456
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
ah~! I don't know anymore!

457
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
ᗒ(Bunta) Hahahaha...! That's too dangerous!

458
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
(Bunta) Hahahaha...!

459
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
It's noisy! Bunta. What time would it be...

460
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Kinugasa-san!?

461
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
From tonight

462
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
This guy decided to stay at our house.

463
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Huh?!

464
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
(Bunta) Oh...!

465
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Slightly... what?

466
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:30,000
♬〜
