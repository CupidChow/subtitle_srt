(Kingugasa Yasu)

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Why not leave that town and live together?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
(Musashihara Tamaki) What...

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Reply is not necessary now

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I hope you take your time to think about it.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
…yes.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
(Agawa Namie) leaving the house...

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
(Agawa Ryuhei) How far can I do

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I want to try it.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
(Agawa Kohei) I understand. Try it.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Living alone? Agawa-kun?

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Oh, didn't you hear it?

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I didn't know...

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It feels like this day has finally arrived.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:41,000
♬〜

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Tamaki-san?

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What should you do? drink.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Ah... Then I had iced tea.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Sorry.

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Iced tea and iced coffee.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
(Shop clerk) I'm in a good mood.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
That this...

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm not ahead of the curve though.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
22nd floor...

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The night view seems to be very beautiful.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The floor plan is also very good...

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That's lovely.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But... I live in a high-rise apartment

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Maybe I can't imagine it.

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I've been living close to the ground for a long time.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
ah….

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
(Shop clerk) Sorry for keeping you waiting.

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
a….

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
A bit good?

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I received an order shirt.

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
thank you.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
If you're looking for a thank you, please contact Bunta.

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's completely different from ready-made products. I was surprised.

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You're a proper adult

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I understand well.

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Thank you for your honor.

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
There's something I want to say to you.

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I see, but I'm not good at lying.

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm not good at fake laughing either

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Sometimes I get annoyed, but →

49
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's not that I'm angry.

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
But when it comes to Bunta-san

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's pretty annoying.

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
ah….

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Also, Pon-chan's walk

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
He was always with me, but →

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
But that's because I love walking.

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Actually, I prefer cats to dogs.

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
That's my first time hearing.

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And... if there's something painful

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm staying in a ballet class, but...

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
At that time... I'll ask.

61
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Ah but

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Don't force yourself to leave the classroom.

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's probably... →

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Because Tamaki can return to himself.

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
...An important place.

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
yes.

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Sorry if it's unnecessary.

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
no….

69
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
About Tamaki... I'm sure I'll make you cry.

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
(Numata Hisashi) What do you think? Preparation for the solo exhibition. Are you going well?

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
(Ozawa Makoto) No, I'm already in a hurry.

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
(Numata) Huh? this is?

75
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
(Ozawa) Yeah.

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
That's Agawa

77
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I brought it to you to see it.

78
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm busy and haven't seen it yet.

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
(Numata) Wow.

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Is that guy a bit helpful?

81
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yeah. I'm getting used to it a lot.

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's tasty. It's comparable to the store.

83
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I did my best.

84
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
When we first met

85
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
He made fried rice for you.

86
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
That was also excellent.

87
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
ah. It was during the microwave birthday party.

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The soba noodles that Agawa brought

89
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm allergic to eat.

90
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
...That's right.

91
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
(Shutter sound)

92
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
(Numata Yoriko) What...!?

93
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Ah.

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Ryuhei-san, why are you there?

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
No... when I came before

96
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I thought it was a view that would be worth taking pictures.

97
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
ah~. Ah, when he sent my uncle.

98
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Yeah.

99
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yoriko-san is your day off today?

100
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Ah... well, as you can see.

101
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's a day when I slept with ice cream.

102
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What? You're probably buying too much.

103
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Ah...

104
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Ryuhei-san: The camera is doing well.

105
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yeah.

106
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
...If that's fine though.

107
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Are you okay?

108
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
What...?

109
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Didn't you say this the other day?

110
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
(Yoriko) Can you really give up on Tamaki?

111
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Even now, your feelings haven't changed, right?

112
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Yeah…. I love it so scary.

113
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So from now on

114
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Tamaki's happiness: I have to think first.

115
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I've been here

116
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Because I only thought about myself.

117
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:43,000
But... someone I've loved for 10 years

118
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I don't think it's easy to get over it...

119
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Of course, well...

120
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's a time of trial.

121
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I see...

122
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
There are a lot of things, but let's do our best.

123
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yeah…. thank you.

124
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
(Numata) That's bad. Suddenly, I went in a nuisance.

125
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Today I came to give this to Ryu-kun.

126
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Because I was away →

127
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I was thinking of showing it to Tamaki-chan first.

128
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
This is...

129
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
A photo taken by Ryu-kun during his practice.

130
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
All still there was still

131
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
This was just amazing.

132
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:34,000
♬〜

133
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
(Musashihara Bunta) I'm here.

134
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Welcome home.

135
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What? this. Who took the photo?

136
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Agawa-kun.

137
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
(Bunta) Wow. My sister and mother look alike.

138
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It doesn't look similar.

139
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
They look similar.

140
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
The genes of ballet fools are leaking.

141
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Don't call yourself stupid.

142
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Mom and sister take on ballet class

143
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm definitely happy about it.

144
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I've been saved quite a bit too.

145
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
What...?

146
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:16,000
My sister is always

147
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's proof that my family was here... what do you mean?

148
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
He's protecting me...

149
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I keep the clock stopped

150
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I just can't proceed.

151
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
That's not fine either.

152
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
At my sister's pace

153
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You should do it slowly.

154
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Bunta... I'm an adult.

155
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Huh? I've been an adult for a long time.

156
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Hehehe.

157
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

158
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Today I thought about going on a walk around the neighborhood.

159
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
yes.

160
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Wow, it's beautiful.

161
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
To make each flower look the most beautiful

162
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's thoughtfully done, isn't it?

163
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
ah. That's right.

164
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I like beautiful and balanced things.

165
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I understand.

166
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Tamaki is the most beautiful thing:

167
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's not next to me.

168
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
picture…?

169
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Do you remember what you asked before?

170
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Tamaki's feelings have not been settled

171
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I think there may be one.

172
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
...Maybe that's true.

173
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
That's right.

174
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Tamaki-san... →

175
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Starting tomorrow, we'll take separate paths.

♬〜

177
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
sorry…. It's my fault, isn't it?

178
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
home.

179
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:18,000
this is

180
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I want you to be beautiful forever →

181
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It's my selfishness.

182
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
thank you. I'm glad we met.

183
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I was sorry to Kinugasa-san

184
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I was somehow relieved... →

185
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm feeling guilty and feeling like this is already stiff...

186
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
(Yamanouchi Marina) What made you feel relieved?

187
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
...Agawa-kun?

188
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
An unidentified attachment.

189
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's true that

190
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You don't know now?

191
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I think it's unfair.

192
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:09,000
That's right. Everyone, to the Tamaki's feelings

193
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:09,000
He hit me straight at me.

194
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
…Yeah.

195
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Next is my turn...

196
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
do your best.

197
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Ah, that's right. Would you like to bring a little rice?

198
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
it's okay.

199
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'll take a little bit. Wait a minute. Right.

200
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
That's fine.

201
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Agawa-kun.

202
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
ring…. what happened?

203
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I have something I want to tell you before I move.

204
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Actually, I was thinking of contacting him too.

205
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So... first of all Agawa-kun.

206
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Me... a photographer who looks like Tamaki's father

207
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I want to be.

208
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
For the first time I've set my goals for life.

209
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Dad will surely be happy.

210
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Yeah. I'll do my best, thinking it's starting here.

211
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So... Tamaki is happy.

212
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yeah….

213
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
What about Tamaki?

214
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I just wanted to say good luck.

215
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I see. thank you.

216
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Yeah…. well.

217
00:12:51,000 --> 00:13:16,000
♬〜

218
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
If you don't know, ask.

219
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
(Yamanouchi Range) It's fine! Because I'm good at math.

220
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Oh, it's reliable!

221
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
(Marina) Tamaki I'm staying in my house again today...

222
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
(Bunta) Yes... Forever here and there.

223
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Feeling like I'm left alone

224
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I wonder if it's become...

225
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
The damage of parting

226
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's slowly coming...

227
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
(天天)

228
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Perhaps Agawa-kun moving forward was dazzling.

229
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I guess that's why I couldn't tell him...

230
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What...?

231
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Huh?

232
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Yes, OK. So then a set change.

233
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
(Everyone) Yes.

234
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
(Noma) Agawa...

235
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
yes.

236
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Oh! I'm here!

237
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Bunta-san!?

238
00:14:16,924 --> 00:14:19,924
(Bunta) Will you stay up all night?

239
00:14:16,924 --> 00:14:19,924
Of course, thank you for your hard work.

240
00:14:19,924 --> 00:14:21,924
But it's not painful at all.

241
00:14:21,924 --> 00:14:25,924
Is Ryu-kun going well?

242
00:14:25,924 --> 00:14:29,924
My sister is no good anymore.

243
00:14:25,924 --> 00:14:29,924
What...?

244
00:14:29,924 --> 00:14:34,924
I have no temper with my sharp tongue

245
00:14:29,924 --> 00:14:34,924
I was so dazzled, I didn't even listen to other people's stories.

246
00:14:34,924 --> 00:14:38,924
Ryu-kun, come and see me once in a while.

247
00:14:38,924 --> 00:14:40,924
no….

248
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:46,924
But I can't believe Ryu-kun

249
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:46,924
I never thought I was in love with my sister.

250
00:14:48,924 --> 00:14:52,924
I'm already

251
00:14:48,924 --> 00:14:52,924
I decided to graduate from Tamaki.

252
00:14:54,924 --> 00:14:56,924
Why?

253
00:14:56,924 --> 00:15:00,924
Because... Tamaki already has one.

254
00:15:02,924 --> 00:15:06,924
That's... it doesn't seem to be that way.

255
00:15:08,924 --> 00:15:13,924
It seems that Anegami-kun has just returned to freelance.

256
00:15:13,924 --> 00:15:15,924
What...?

257
00:15:18,924 --> 00:15:23,924
But me...

258
00:15:18,924 --> 00:15:23,924
I've decided to concentrate on the camera from now on.

259
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:25,924
Ah... that's a hassle.

260
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:29,924
That camera too

261
00:15:25,924 --> 00:15:29,924
I'm sure he's chasing her sister.

262
00:15:29,924 --> 00:15:32,924
What... why…?

263
00:15:32,924 --> 00:15:36,924
This is something only Ryu-kun can take.

264
00:15:39,924 --> 00:15:42,924
Lunch break is over. Well then.

(Agawa's voice) I was relieved.

272
00:16:39,924 --> 00:16:43,924
Even if I'm not there, Tamaki is fine.

273
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:50,924
(Agawa's voice) Tamaki is happy.

Agawa-kun...!?

276
00:17:10,924 --> 00:17:12,924
what happened?

277
00:17:12,924 --> 00:17:16,924
Why didn't you say it?

278
00:17:12,924 --> 00:17:16,924
I broke up with Kinugasa.

279
00:17:16,924 --> 00:17:20,924
That too

280
00:17:16,924 --> 00:17:20,924
Moving in, you kept quiet!

281
00:17:20,924 --> 00:17:22,924
Why is it that you are not there without your consent?

282
00:17:22,924 --> 00:17:27,924
it is…

283
00:17:22,924 --> 00:17:27,924
If I was nearby, I won't forget Tamaki!

284
00:17:27,924 --> 00:17:31,924
What is that... Why do you need to forget?

285
00:17:31,924 --> 00:17:34,924
Tamaki's happiness: There's no way to get in the way!

286
00:17:34,924 --> 00:17:37,924
Don't assume my happiness!

287
00:17:48,924 --> 00:17:50,924
a….

288
00:17:50,924 --> 00:17:52,924
Bunta brought it to me.

289
00:17:54,924 --> 00:18:01,924
why…. What is it...

290
00:18:05,924 --> 00:18:11,924
When I see this photo... I cry.

291
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:18,924
My life is fine

292
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:18,924
I was so happy that he said it...

293
00:18:21,924 --> 00:18:27,924
But... →

294
00:18:27,924 --> 00:18:33,924
Agawa-kun, who always watched me... →

295
00:18:33,924 --> 00:18:36,924
I'm not next to you anymore...

296
00:18:38,924 --> 00:18:40,924
I'm lonely...

297
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:47,924
If so, stay next to you.

298
00:18:49,924 --> 00:18:51,924
That's true for me too.

299
00:18:51,924 --> 00:18:54,924
I can't get rid of Tamaki from my mind.

300
00:18:54,924 --> 00:19:01,924
Wherever I go, no matter what I look...

301

Whether you're taking a bath or sleeping →

302
00:19:01,924 --> 00:19:04,924
I remember everything about Tamaki.

Me... I'll take even better photos.

304
00:19:11,924 --> 00:19:14,924
