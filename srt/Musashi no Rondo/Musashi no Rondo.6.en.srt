What...?

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Because I've been watching for a long time ago.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
…yes. It was instantly captivated.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That would suit you very well.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Unfortunately, it's not for sale.

Are you an actor?

Someone who stands in the boardroom...

00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
At first glance, I could smell the stage.

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I couldn't even dive from Shimizu.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The one who escaped...

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
fault. So you're still on the run?

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Maybe so...

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
That person is Kinugasa's ex-wife...

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
What are you talking about? Something thrilling.

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Please drink water.

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
More than that, Agawa-kun, wasn't it on a date?

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Date?

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
From the cute girl

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I was invited to fish.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Ah... there's a sudden job coming over there

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's gone without.

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So I was curious about Tamaki and came here.

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
...Not particularly. I just passed by.

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000

79

With the energy of the exhibition

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It feels like it's been revived.

81
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I thought I'd learnt the joy of dancing in my own way

82
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
After all, I can't meet my mother.

83

I've been receiving lots of awards since I was young →

84

But I can't get used to...

88
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
There's also comforting that there's no need to panic

89
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Sometimes I became extremely miserable.

90
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
…Yeah.

91
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
But I really like this place.

92
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Mom said that.

93
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's said that you'll always find a dance that only Tamaki can dance to...

94
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So I'm going to continue dancing here.

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
If you look, you'll understand.

96
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
This is the most important place for Tamaki.

Sister? What are you doing?

193
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
...Not particularly.

194
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm home….

195
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Ah... Welcome back.

196
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
That's what I say though.

197
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's early today.

198
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's been morning every day these days.

199
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Exhibition Starting today, right?

200
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Has Miu's help finished?

201
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
no. There's still something to be done during the event.

202
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I see.

203
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So, get some good care with special okonomiyaki.

204
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I was planning to have stew today.

205
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
In times like this, okonomiyaki is

206
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
The market price has been decided!

207
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
(Bunta) Oh my gosh!

208
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
The best and strongest in my history

209
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's beautiful and well-defined →

210
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Fumi-chan's taste has exploded!

211
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It looks like a normal okonomiyaki though.

212
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
The pitch is fast...

213
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
(The sound of the door opening)

214
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Agawa-kun.

215
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
(Bunta) Oh, go up and go up!

216
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's just about to be cooked now.

217
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
what happened?

218
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
No, Bunta-san invited me.

219
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It's more fun to have cute kids.

220
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Good evening.

221
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
…Thank you.

222
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000

Right? I'm too genius.

226
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
please.

227
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Sorry.

228
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
(Bunta)Oh oh oh oh

229
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Looks like they're in good condition.

230
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I just took mayonnaise.

231
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'll tell you because I think it'll be discovered soon

232
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
These guys are probably good.

233
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000

234
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
...Stop that's what it is.

235
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
yes! I really want you to stop.

236
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
A reality show near me

237
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It's going to unfold.

238
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Instead, Bunta-san said he should stop.

239
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Huh?

240
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
That's not decided yet.

241
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Ah, that's tough, Kinugasa.

242
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Ryu-kun is a sister-in-law for a long time

243
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Come on.

244
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
This small jug is tougher than me.

245
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Bunta: Seriously blows it away...

246
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
yeah?

247
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
He's a really unfortunate guy.

248
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Who? Me?

249
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Who else is there?

250
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You're in your mother's tummy

251
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I was born with a delicate matter left behind.

252
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
That's how it is

253
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm being dumped by the girlfriend I've dated for 10 years!

254
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
No matter how much you look at it, I've set it up...

255
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Bunta...?

256
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Me... as it is now

257
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Is there any point in being told that?

258
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Bunta-san...?

259
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Ryu-kun, lend me camping equipment.

260
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
What...?

261
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
The other day I went to camp.

262
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
(Peg-hitting sound)

263
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
He really sleeps in the garden?

264
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
He wants to go back and get recuperated.

265
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It's a very close place.

266
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
(Mobile phone ringtone)

267
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
yeah~?

268
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
What happened?

269
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
No, from Bunta.

270
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Thank you for setting up a tent →

271
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
To Agawa-kun

272
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
They want to treat you to a custom-made shirt.

273
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I received a request for measurements.

274
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
You haven't done that much, have you?

275
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
That's about the extent for him now

276
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Isn't that what you needed that place?

277
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I wonder if I want to take it on.

278
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
📞 (Sayoko) Yes, Bunta.

279
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
📞Bunta?

280
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Stupid Sayoko. A liar woman.

281
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
📞Yes, yes.

282
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You didn't want to marry him.

283
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
📞What is a man?

284
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
(Sayoko) You knew it was Bunta.

285
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It's not like trying to fit it in.

286
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
nevertheless…

287
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Even if I try to force myself, I'll stay with you forever...

288
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
📞I know.

289
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Me too

290
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Of all the guys, Bunta was my favorite.

291
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
...Go to hell.

292
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Right.

293
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Bunta wants to make something for you

294
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I think I understand.

295
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
The posture is good.

296
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Ah... I guess it's because I used to do ballet.

297
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I see.

298
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Just measure it

299
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Do you know what sports you were playing?

300
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I think the tendency is to build muscle.

301
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Raise your arm a little.

302
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Made to order

303
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
How long will it take?

304
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Um... budget, delivery time, etc.

305
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It takes 3 to 4 weeks for a shirt.

306
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
The price is... Bunta's company discount is more advantageous

307
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I think it can go in the 10,000 yen range.

308
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
That's right...!

309
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It's too expensive to give a reward.

310
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Because Bunta says he wants to do that

311
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
It's not good.

312
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
But this

313
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You'll be taking on the contract.

314
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Probably.

315
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Then you'll get even more friends discounts...

316
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It's not too bad for a pain.

317
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I don't wear it anyway, so it's a waste of fabric.

318
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
My arms squeal.

319
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Why are you ignoring it?

320
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm really looking at it as hostile.

321
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm so annoyed that I can't afford it!

322
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
And... I'll keep that attitude

323
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I thought he was quietly taking up the Tamaki... →

324
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
You sewed it and made it

325
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I want to squeal from nearby!

326
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Tamaki-san is not your property, right?

327
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I know that!!

328
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
You don't have to bother to tell me...

329
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Agawa-kun...?

330
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I'll tell you, but I'll come back.

331
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I think there's no one there

332
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Don't let out any loose work.

welcome.

341
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Isn't it amazing here?

342
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Certainly interesting.

yeah…?

346
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Yes. Let's drink!

347
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Yeah.

348
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Umm...

349
00:19:31,066 --> 00:19:36,066
(Yoriko) Hmm... Ryuhei's fishing master

350
00:19:31,066 --> 00:19:36,066
Is it Tamaki's father?

351
00:19:36,066 --> 00:19:40,066
Yeah. When I was a kid, I was often taken with me.

352
00:19:40,066 --> 00:19:44,066
He even told me about the photos.

353
00:19:40,066 --> 00:19:44,066
It was fun.

354
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:46,066
My fishing master is my uncle.

355
00:19:46,066 --> 00:19:48,066
That's right.

356
00:19:48,066 --> 00:19:51,066
Numata-san: Isn't it quiet when fishing?

357
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:53,066
oh yeah. Hehehe...!

358
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:58,066
I can't speak at all either

359
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:58,066
There was a time when we were silent for about five hours.

360
00:19:58,066 --> 00:20:01,066
Yoriko is also the type to become silent.

361
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:04,066
You're getting too focused

362
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:04,066
When you fall in love.

363
00:20:04,066 --> 00:20:06,066
Well, I understand.

364
00:20:08,066 --> 00:20:10,066
Master.

365
00:20:08,066 --> 00:20:10,066
(Master) Yes.

366
00:20:10,066 --> 00:20:13,066
I would like another drink of the same one.

367
00:20:10,066 --> 00:20:13,066
(Master) Yes.

368
00:20:14,066 --> 00:20:16,066
What is that?

369
00:20:16,066 --> 00:20:19,066
Stingray. It was very tasty.

370
00:20:19,066 --> 00:20:21,066
Stingray...

371
00:20:21,066 --> 00:20:23,066
It's about a stingray.

372
00:20:23,066 --> 00:20:26,066
Our original cocktail is

373
00:20:23,066 --> 00:20:26,066

Wow, that's interesting!

375
00:20:29,066 --> 00:20:33,066
What is that!

376
00:20:29,066 --> 00:20:33,066
Is this a direct confrontation between Agawa-kun and Kinugasa?

377
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:35,066
📞(Marina) What... And what happened?

378
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:39,066
I don't know...

379
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:39,066
Agawa-kun came out.

380
00:20:39,066 --> 00:20:42,066
Truly, Tamaki is a sinful woman.

381
00:20:42,066 --> 00:20:48,066
If my close interviews were to be heard

382
00:20:42,066 --> 00:20:48,066
He is aware that he will be beaten up.

383
00:20:48,066 --> 00:20:50,066
Hehe...! It's a blazing thing.

384
00:20:50,066 --> 00:20:54,066
But in the meantime

385
00:20:50,066 --> 00:20:54,066
Either way, you might be left with a blow.

386
00:20:54,066 --> 00:20:57,066
Today was a day too busy.

387
00:20:57,066 --> 00:21:01,066
Bunta remains in a tent in the garden.

388
00:21:01,066 --> 00:21:03,066
tent? what? that.

389
00:21:03,066 --> 00:21:05,066
📞It seems like something happened with Sayoko →

390
00:21:05,066 --> 00:21:07,066
It's a recuperation of a new field.

391
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:11,066
📞I see. The wounds still haven't healed...

392
00:21:11,066 --> 00:21:13,066
Ah... that's probably →

393
00:21:13,066 --> 00:21:18,066
Tonight is Tamaki and Kinugasa

394
00:21:13,066 --> 00:21:18,066
Under one roof, you two people?

395
00:21:18,066 --> 00:21:22,066
picture…. Well... yes.

396
00:21:22,066 --> 00:21:24,066
📞Noooo!

397
00:21:25,066 --> 00:21:29,066
I thought I had finally made it to the starting line.

398
00:21:30,066 --> 00:21:33,066
But maybe it was completely wrong.

399
00:21:37,066 --> 00:21:44,066
I'd always wanted to be by my side...

400
00:21:37,066 --> 00:21:44,066
This time I might go far.

401
00:21:45,066 --> 00:21:49,066
He's a dedicated man, but he's attractive.

402
00:21:49,066 --> 00:21:52,066
Just being devoted can't be helped.

403
00:21:54,066 --> 00:21:59,066
If it's so painful

404
00:21:54,066 --> 00:21:59,066
Maybe I'll take a slightly easier path.

405
00:22:00,066 --> 00:22:02,066
An easy road...?

406
00:22:03,066 --> 00:22:08,066
Do you know? Women in the world →

407
00:22:08,066 --> 00:22:14,066
Tamaki-san or anything else...

408
00:22:08,066 --> 00:22:14,066
It's not just that.

Ah... Hello.

412
00:22:26,066 --> 00:22:30,066
That measurement...

413
00:22:30,066 --> 00:22:32,066
It's still on the way.

414
00:22:32,066 --> 00:22:35,066
...That's right.

415
00:22:35,066 --> 00:22:38,066

picture?

417
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:44,066
No... if we could call ourselves lovers →

418
00:22:44,066 --> 00:22:48,066
It's going to kill the jealousy of my neighbors

419
00:22:44,066 --> 00:22:48,066
I thought so.

Just complain about things that are convenient for you

423
00:22:55,066 --> 00:22:58,066
That's not good.

424
00:22:58,066 --> 00:23:01,066
good night.

Maybe it's a little easier.
