Is this?

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The way you apply contrast is important.

74

The key is where you turn on the light.

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Wow.

76
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Are you more interested in taking pictures than being photographed?

yes.

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
If you have experience in Kinugasa

189
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
With rough measurements, you can manage.

190
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Try wearing it.

191
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
No... Then later...

192
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Huh? what?

193
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Fumi-chan's present feels like it's going to be a waste?

194
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
No no, that's the case...

195
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
(Ring) Wear it! I want to see it!

196
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
(Bunta) Hey. I want to see it.

197
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I understand...

198
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:51,000
♬〜

199
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
(Marina) Wow. Perfect fit. It suits you.

200
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
That's fine! Perfect!

201
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
cool!

202
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
thank you….

203
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Hey, it's fine now.

204
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
See... If it gets dirty, that's because...

205
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
As expected of Kinugasa.

206
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I only have my number one tailor.

207
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What is a tailor?

208
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
yeah? The person who makes clothes.

209
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Wow. I want to be a tailor too!

210
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
How can you become a tailor?

211
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Ah... First, study at school

212
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Also, I think there are more patterns of training in the store.

213
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Before you can become a full-fledged person

214
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It is said to take 10 years.

215
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
so….

216
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I think Kinugasa's technology is at the top level, but →

217
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Personally,

218
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It seems I'm not completely satisfied.

219
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Actually, it's like Miu

220
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I think he wanted to be a creator.

221
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
From my perspective →

222
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Just playing with just one arm

223
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I think it's a big deal though.

224
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
(Bunta) Let's eat dumplings.

225
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
(Renge) Yes.

226
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Here as a child, on the way to a walk

227
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
My dad brought me along well.

228
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It's a good shop.

229
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
My parents love the dumplings here.

230
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
My mother was busy

231
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
My dad always bought it as a souvenir.

232
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
They're such a wonderful couple.

233
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I have memories of my parents all over this city.

234
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Sometimes I think so.

235
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Why aren't there two of them...?

236
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Early that morning →

237
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
My father and mother took a poster photo for the next performance

238
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I drive to the sea...

239
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I haven't returned yet.

240
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I didn't cry at that time.

241
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
After that, I still couldn't cry.

242
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Still a lot

243
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Maybe it's not digested.

244
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Ah... sorry.

245
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
home….

246
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
for example….

247
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm leaving a place close to my memories... that's because

248
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It could be one way.

249
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Sorry, I'm not offering it...

250
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000

253
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
no…. sorry

254
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I haven't been able to help out at the store lately.

255
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Don't worry.

256
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
You just have to do what you want to do.

257
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Craftsmen are cool.

258
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Dad is cool too.

259
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Hehe...

260
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
My dad's soba noodles are delicious.

261
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
What is it? Suddenly.

262
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
…no.

263
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
What I want to do is to work in a very good way →

264
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
So it's useful to someone else

265
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I thought it was amazing.

266
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
For example, but →

267
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Are you not aiming to become a professional now?

268
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Do you want to do a photo?

269
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
...I have a desire to try it.

270
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Of course it's not that easy

271
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Maybe it's too late now...

272
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I quit my job and started a soba restaurant

273
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It's 30.

274
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I guess it's not too late.

275
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,000
When you quit your job and start from scratch

276
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Wasn't you scared?

277
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I have to take a step

278
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Because nothing will start.

279
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
...I see.

280
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
My life is only once.

281
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Do whatever you like.

Sorry, come in without permission.

287
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It's been like that for a long time.

288
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Just now to the uncle and aunt

289
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I gave them incense sticks.

290
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Thank you for not forgetting every year.

291
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Did you go to the grave? With Kinugasa-san.

292
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
…Yeah.

293
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
good.

294
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It's really Tamaki. That person.

295
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I felt relieved.

296
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Even if I'm not there, Tamaki is fine.

297
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Have you started a new job?

298
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Have you got used to it already?

299
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Every day is exhausted...

300
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
But it's really fun.

301
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Agawa-kun: It changed before I saw it.

302
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
What? Where?

303
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I've become more mature.

304
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Of course, you'll become an adult too.

305
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
If I had such a big heartbreak.

306
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I was hoping that he would be able to speak up any more.

307
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
...Why?

308
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
We're your neighbors, right?

309
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
My neighbor...

310
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Yeah.

Ryu-kun, you wonder if you're tired.

351
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:14,066
Studio workers are physically labour.

It's somehow on.

353
00:19:14,066 --> 00:19:17,066
Because I have the strength.

354
00:19:17,066 --> 00:19:22,066
Ryuhei is also a bit of a guts.

355

Do I see that way?

356
00:19:22,066 --> 00:19:26,066
I can see it. At first glance, it looks so soft.

357
00:19:26,066 --> 00:19:28,066
That's something that's said sometimes.

Me... I was thinking of trying my best to take the photos.

359
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:42,066
nice. Ryuhei-san, I think he's suited to it.

360
00:19:42,066 --> 00:19:47,066
Thanks to Yoriko's inspiration for making this.

I'm grateful.

It's not a bit.

It's really fun talking to Yoriko.

But...

00:20:18,066 --> 00:20:20,066
After all, I can't date him.

372
00:20:26,066 --> 00:20:29,066
sorry.

373
00:20:29,066 --> 00:20:34,066
There's nothing to apologize. As expected.

374
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,066
I've also heard about Tamaki.

375
00:20:37,066 --> 00:20:40,066
Regarding Tamaki... I give up.

376
00:20:40,066 --> 00:20:42,066
picture…?

377
00:20:44,066 --> 00:20:46,066
I see...

378
00:20:47,066 --> 00:20:49,066
Yeah.

379
00:20:49,066 --> 00:20:56,066
But Ryuhei

380
00:20:49,066 --> 00:20:56,066
To forget about it, dating another child →

381
00:20:56,066 --> 00:20:58,066
He's someone who can't.

382
00:20:59,066 --> 00:21:01,066
…Yeah.

383
00:21:05,066 --> 00:21:10,066
thank you. Think about it properly.

384
00:21:10,066 --> 00:21:12,066
you're welcome.

385
00:21:12,066 --> 00:21:15,066
Thank you for falling in love with me.

386
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:28,066

387
00:21:28,066 --> 00:21:31,066
Ah, I'm full. It looks like it's going to burst.

388
00:21:31,066 --> 00:21:33,066
It's been a while since I've eaten that much.

389
00:21:33,066 --> 00:21:36,066
Cooking someone makes is great, isn't it?

390
00:21:36,066 --> 00:21:41,066
Tamaki eats it so deliciously

391
00:21:36,066 --> 00:21:41,066
I was also stumped.

392
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:43,066
What, is it my fault?

393
00:21:43,066 --> 00:21:51,066
♬〜

394
00:21:51,066 --> 00:21:54,066
I'm happy.

395
00:21:54,066 --> 00:21:58,066
We could be together for such a long time.

396
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:02,066
This year

397
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:02,066
I've also met someone who thinks that way.

398
00:22:05,066 --> 00:22:09,066
Honestly, I fell in love at first sight.

399
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:12,066
What a beautiful person he is.

400
00:22:13,066 --> 00:22:17,066
What kind of face should I ask about that...

401
00:22:17,066 --> 00:22:20,066
Tamaki's expression is beautiful.

402
00:22:20,066 --> 00:22:23,066
I think every time I meet.

403
00:22:24,066 --> 00:22:31,066
Even ahead

404
00:22:24,066 --> 00:22:31,066
I don't want to miss Tamaki's beautiful moments.

405
00:22:31,066 --> 00:22:43,066

406
00:22:43,066 --> 00:22:45,066
(Agawa Namie) Ryuhei.

407
00:22:45,066 --> 00:22:47,066
(Namie) Huh? what up?

408
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:50,066
Can you talk a little?

409
00:22:51,066 --> 00:22:53,066
Tamaki-san.

410
00:22:53,066 --> 00:22:58,066
Why not leave that town and live together?

411
00:23:03,066 --> 00:23:08,066
I'm thinking of leaving this house.

412
00:23:08,066 --> 00:23:10,066
Huh?
