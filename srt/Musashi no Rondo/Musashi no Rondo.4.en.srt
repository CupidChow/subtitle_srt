1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
(Agawa Ryuhei) Kiss... Can I do it?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
(Musashihara Tamaki)Other than the entrance...

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So...except for the mouth.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:22,000
♬〜

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
"My heart was bitten"

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
<Ring Wandering in the Forest>

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
♬〜

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm 25.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
But why is it just me

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Are you locked in a kid's frame forever?

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
In front of Agawa-kun, who is growing up

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I've always been a girl

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
…ring?

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
"The lost child left behind is me."

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:04,000
♬〜

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
If you arouse Agawa-kun, you'll get hurt...

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
When I was a child, I was.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Agawa-kun.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Instead of having sex here now

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
To break up →

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Continuing like this with neighbors

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm going to go home right away →

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Which is better?

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What!? What...?

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
What in the first place? Those two options.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I wonder what it is...

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Tamaki Hasa instead of winning overseas competitions

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Stop ballet →

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Condition of toast shoes that you don't even wear

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
A life that will last forever →

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Which one do you choose?

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Huh?

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The question earlier

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I wonder if that's how it is for Tamaki.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Isn't it a mess...

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
When teaching ballet, "Don't panic, don't let your guard down."

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Even though he is on the side of soothing.

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm very confused right now...

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
sorry.

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Then Tamaki is confused.

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
As expected, we'll continue like this today for a night together... →

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Going to auto camping

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What do you think?

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
...Huh?

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Jean!

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Wow...

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Forest bathing, bonfire, delicious air, delicious rice →

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Shower and flush toilet are available!

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You can choose any bank bed or double bed when you go to sleep.

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Because I understand.

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Can be used with indoor air conditioning, sinks and gas stoves.

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Comes with an electric refrigerator.

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
If you understand.

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
If you could get this perfectly matched

55
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I felt like I wanted to stay there normally.

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Seriously?!

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So, it's a date extension.

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
ᗒAlright!

59
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:19,000
♬〜

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
(chime)

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
(Musashihara Bunta) Huh? Marina... The microwave too.

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
what happened?

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
(Yamanouchi Marina) Sorry. For ballet classes

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It seems that the microwave forgot his gym clothes →

65
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Even if I contacted Tamaki, I couldn't get it.

66
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
(Kingugasa Yasu)

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Tamaki-san It was faster than I thought...

68
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Ah...excuse me.

69
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
No, Tamaki-san: I heard it would be late...

70
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Ah, Tamaki: Have you gone somewhere?

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
here we go….

72
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
More than that, that apron...

73
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Ah...

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
(Bunta) He made dinner.

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Special fried chicken made by Kinugasa!

76
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
(Yamanouchi Range)

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Huh? Fried Chicken? That's good! i want to eat!

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
(Bunta) Shall we eat the microwave too?

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yeah!

80
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
No, no, that's not it...

81
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
There are so many, so please come and see if you like.

82
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
(Mobile phone ringtone)

83
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
(Marina) Ah... I'm a bit sorry.

84
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
(Tamaki's voice) "I stayed overnight with Agawa-kun"

85
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm going to camp...! ”

86
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Huh?

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I think I'll just be pampered by your words.

88
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
(Renge)Yeah!

89
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
(Bunta) Okay, decided! I'll eat a lot!

90
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
(Renji) Let's eat it! Good luck.

91
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
(Marina's voice) "Leave it."

92
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's getting more interesting!

93
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Uhh... just a few meters apart

94
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It has an unusually delicious scent...

95
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Tamaki is an extra time for my date with me

96
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Because you shouldn't forget.

97
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
…Yeah.

98
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The meaning of what I did earlier

99
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I have to ruminate each time.

100
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
(Renji) Delicious!

101
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
(Bunta) Hmm! Hehe...

102
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I see. So I'll stay with you...

103
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
(Bunta) Kinugasa's ex-wife

104
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It means they're so close that they can rent out a house.

105
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Don't call us like we're good friends!

106
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What? Is it different?

107
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
What... do you feel that way?

108
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I felt it.

109
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm also adorned though.

110
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Ah, that's right.

111
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
yes. Four years ago.

112
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
If my ex-husband asks if I can rent a house

113
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I might refuse.

114
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
That's right...

115
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm so excited...

116
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
What about Bunta?

117
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
(Bunta) Huh? What?

118
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,000
For example. For example, for someone who is difficult

119
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:41,000
What if you asked me if I wanted you to rent a house?

120
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
it is….

121
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I might not refuse...

122
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I see...

123
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
(Renge) Get well.

124
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Oh! thank you.

125
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
(Bunta) Range! That's so kind!

126
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's a mom's gift. this~!

127
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
(Renge) Hahaha...!

128
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Hehe...

129
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Okay...

130
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'll come again with water →

131
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Ring Vegetables Please.

132
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Yes.

133
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
ᗒ (The sound of the dish falling)

134
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
ᗒAh...

135
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
…ring?

136
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Agawa-kun...

137
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Oops…! It's dangerous! What are you doing...

138
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Onions... Onions, Eyes...!

139
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
yeah?

140
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Ah... onion.

141
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,000

142
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Stab me quickly.

143
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
What...?

144
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
If it's like the onion makes me cry

145
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You should quickly rely on me.

146
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Tamaki's crying face was the first time I've seen this.

147
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Is that so?

148
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yeah.

149
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
(Vibration sound from mobile phone)

150
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Oh...

151
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
📞Teacher! I'm at the teacher's house now!

152
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What? Is that so?

153
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What are you doing in the microwave? Don't get in the way!

154
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
(Ring) Is it in the way?

155
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
📞Range!

156
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
(Renge) Now everyone →

157
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm eating a special fried chicken made by the chef.

158
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
yeah? chef? Bunta?

159
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
📞(Renge) Yes. Umm...

160
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Ahhh, it's about to run out!

161
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
see you~!

162
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
see you~!

163
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Yeah. see you.

164
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
📞Ren-kun has orange juice...

165
00:07:51,000 --> 00:08:04,000
♬〜

166
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Ah... do you have grilled marshmallows?

167
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Ah, but is there a sausage available too?

168
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
But there's curry too...

169
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's Kinugasa-san, right?

170
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Yeah….

171
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Why the Ring

172
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Are you wearing an apron and a chef?

173
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:28,000
♬〜

174
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
In fact, Kinugasa-san at home

175
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Apparently my ex-wife is rolling in...

176
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
What...? So are you at the Ring?

177
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Apparently it's a limited time only due to work.

178
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's kind of shaking when we're together

179
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It seems like that.

180
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
what? that….

181
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Well, I'm not in a position to say anything.

182
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
That's what you've reported.

183
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Come on, let's grill marshmallows!

184
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Marshmallow Marshmallow...

185
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
(Sigh)

186
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Tamaki-san just now

187
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Where did you call?

188
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
here we go….

189
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
(Renji)S!

190
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Was it alone?

191
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
here we go….

192
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
(Bunta) Customers look good on you!

193
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
(Marina) What?

194
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
How about this colour too? wonderful!

195
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Who looks good on a bow tie like this

196
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
That's not true!

197
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Which colour would you choose?

198
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
(Renge) Hmm, this one!

199
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Your eyes are high!

200
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Here is our original brand

201
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's from BUN-CHAN.

202
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Have such a great sense

203
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
For Range...

204
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
(Bunta) I'll also put on a bag! here you are.

205
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
thank you! Bunchan.

206
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
(Bunta) Oh! no.

207
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Yes, let's put it in. Let's put it in.

208
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
(Marina) Kinugasa-san Thank you for the meal.

209
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Ah, no no.

210
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
(Renge)Thank you for the meal!

211
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
no.

212
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Then I'll send you a little.

213
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Yeah.

214
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
(Bunta) Let's go.

215
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:15,000
♬〜

216
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Ah, that's fine.

217
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'll enjoy having this.

218
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,000
(Vibration sound from mobile phone)

219
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's coming out.

220
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
(Vibration sound from mobile phone)

221
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
📞 Have you had dinner already?

222
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Um... just now...

223
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
📞This is...

224
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I felt a little wanting to hear my voice...

225
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Was that so...

226
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Huh? Ah...

227
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Tamaki-san?

228
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Ah... sorry. So, why did it?

229
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Ah, um... I'm going to go back late today

230
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I've visited...

231
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
📞If you like

232
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Shall we come to the station to pick you up?

233
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
What...

234
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
📞Ah, no, it's dangerous if it's dark.

235
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
📞If that's the case, invite Buntta too

236
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
To be hit by the night breeze... what?

237
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
If it's the same with anyone, it's a different story...

238
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
📞Today, I'm in a bit of an urgent matter

239
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm going to go far →

240
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I think I'll be able to go back home tomorrow...

241
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Ah, it's not possible to go on a day trip

242
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It was a case...

243
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Do you have any plans tomorrow night?

244
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
📞No...

245
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
📞Let's have dinner together.

246
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
yes. please.

247
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
📞So, again.

248
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
yes.

249
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
good night.

250
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
📞Good night.

251
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:07,000
♬〜

252
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Are you angry?

253
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
If you want to ask, why do you do it?

254
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I wonder if I'll be able to brush it off because I don't like it.

255
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Just today, skinship is basically no refusal

256
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
That's what you said, right?

257
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I understand how gorillas feel...

258
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
What's the story?

259
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Gorillas are not related by blood →

260
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Females and males who have been paired since they were little

261
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:39,000
The chances of becoming a pair have been reduced dramatically.

262
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Personal space: Please forgive me so much

263
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,000
That kind of thing is seriously demonic.

264
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
(A belly sound)

265
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Huh... Huhh...

266
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
eat?

267
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Yeah! If the atmosphere is different

268
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
The same recipe is 30% more delicious.

269
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It's been a long time

270
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
We made it together though.

271
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's not about the gorilla from earlier, but →

272
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
About half the taste of the home

273
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I guess they match up.

274
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
surely.

275
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I've been in the upper grades of elementary school

276
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I was learning about cooking from the man from the Ranchi.

277
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I agree. Our father is

278
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Because I was fully taking on nutritional management.

279
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Auntie, it was just a ballet.

280
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Mom's was an athlete already.

281
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It was cool, wasn't it?

282
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Yeah. cool. Really….

283
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
♬〜

284
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Hmm.

285
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:55,000
♬〜

286
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Tamaki and me And then I'll just go home when I go to sleep and wake up.

287
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Yeah.

288
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:11,000
So I have to cut this story out

289
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'm really feeling lame...

290
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
The place where I sleep is a double bed in the back

291
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Bank bed above the driver's seat.

292
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Also fold this table and connect it to the chair

293
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It can also be used as a living bed.

294
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
oh….

295
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
So, where do you want to sleep?

296
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:39,000
My hope is that no matter where Tamaki chooses

297
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:39,000
There was a desire to take a position next to it...

298
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Well, but if that happens

299
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Can I stay still? Or →

300
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
That's what

301
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I don't know anything at all right now.

302
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
They only pose such irresponsible requests.

303
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It's not. That's mine.

304
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
...Huh?

305
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Who is the romantic feelings I know suited to?

306
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I was right, but I was swept away...

307
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Truly irresponsible.

308
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
But no more...

309
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Don't shake it yet!

310
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I like Kinugasa-san's kind of thing

311
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's something I've been really aware of for many years...

312
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
So now... I'll have to go for two more at this time...

313
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Not good. I don't like it.

314
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
sorry….

315
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
But don't decide on this one date

316
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Try sleeping together for now.

317
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Why does that happen?

318
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It might just hurt.

319
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I want to increase the number of opportunities to become aware of it.

320
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
So, don't touch one finger

321
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
If I could sleep next to me until morning →

322
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'll go home with a reply pending...

323
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Is that so?

324
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,000
♬〜

325
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Haa...! ah….

326
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
ring.

327
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Can you hear it?

328
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
If you don't wake up, I won't kiss you.

329
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Are you really sleeping?

330
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Because I advised you.

331
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I haven't touched a single finger either.

332
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
(Door opening and closing sound)

333
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:24,000
♬〜

334
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'd give those conditions...

335
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
That's right. Pretend to be unconscious →

336
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You really wanted to try this, right?

337
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:43,000
♬〜

338
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:49,000
But I was so swept away like this... →

339
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It's not sloppy, isn't it?

340
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
(Crushing sound)

341
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Tsu...

342
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
What a terrible dream...

343
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
what happened?

344
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Ahh!

345
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Hahaha...

346
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
"Ahhh!" Is that a sleepy cat?

347
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Agawa-kun is getting up early.

348
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I couldn't sleep at all.

349
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Well, that's the case, I was able to see Tamaki's sleeping face a lot.

350
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
That's fine though.

351
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
(The sound of tearing coffee beans)

352

353
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
ring!

00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
…yes!

355
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I made coffee.

356
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Ah...it feels good!

357
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
This is what I mean by what's refreshing.

358
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Tamaki is so relieved to me

359
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It's not that I'm not annoyed, but →

360
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Well, I know that there's nothing I can do about it.

361
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:27,000
But there's no point in going back this morning

362
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:27,000
The reply will remain on hold.

363
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Yeah….

I want to increase the number of opportunities to become aware of it.

(Kingugasa's voice) "I'll be back at around 7pm today."

00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
"Even in this situation

378
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Being able to go back to where Tamaki is is →

379
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It's a great success."

380
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
What a shady thing I am...!

384
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
welcome home?

385
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Hello, I'm coming right now...

386
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Hehe...

387
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It feels strange.

388
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I agree.

389
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Ah... What about Bunta?

390
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Ah, I'll go home after I've done my business

391
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I'll prepare dinner first so get the key.

392
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
But Tamaki-san has returned.

393
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Well, first dinner and bath

394
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Which one would you like?

395
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Maybe Tamaki-san

396
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Isn't it done a bit?

397
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Sorry.

398
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I thought Kinugasa was going back here

399
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'm getting nervous...

400
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
How do you greet me at times like this?

401
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Is that correct?

402
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
For me, it's a great welcome.

403
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
So let's ask first.

404
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Who and who were you going last night?

405
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
What...

406
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Because you said you would be staying overnight for an urgent matter

407
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm curious.

408
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
If it's a difficult question to answer

409
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
You can pass it.

410
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Ah... uh... →

411
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Ah... I'm going to camp a little with Agawa...

412
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
is that so. With Agawa...

413
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Even if something like that makes you say something

414
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Was there?

415
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
What...?

417
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Tamaki-san...

418
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Would you like to stick it to me a little?
