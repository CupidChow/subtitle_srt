3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,960
The Seventh Prince,

4
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:19,640
what's your talent?

5
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:20,640
I...

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,670
I'm good at eating food.

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,000
Prince,

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,960
what did you say

9
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,000
you were good at?

10
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:32,390
Eating food.

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,350
So you're an eating machine.

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,110
No wonder father

13
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,960
hasn't allowed us to see him all these years.

14
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,320
Yeah.

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,320
It's very embarrassing.

16
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,110
Si,

17
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,710
looks like I had a bad idea.

18
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,200
I got it.

19
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,240
It's said that

20
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,470
the old King of Xiling is a lecherous man.

21
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:01,920
He has so many sons,

22
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:03,790
including

23
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:04,790
the Seventh Prince

24
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,870
who always stays indoors
and refuses any visitors.

25
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,430
The other princes

26
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,950
rarely see him.

27
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,350
We can do something

28
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:17,790
so that the real Seventh Prince
can't make it to Donglan,

29
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,560
and then find someone

30
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,310
to impersonate him.

31
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:25,510
Mother,

32
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,480
what he means is that he's good at

33
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,920
eating in a unique,

34
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,430
sophisticated,

35
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,070
professional kind of way.

36
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,040
Yes.

37
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,200
Since Si said so,

38
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,000
let him perform

39
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,790
a professional level of eating.

40
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,790
Please.

41
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,710
So,

42
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,710
I'll get started.

43
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,000
Is this a performance?

44
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,470
An idiot trying to get first place.

45
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,400
He's making a fool of himself.

46
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:18,910
Shut up.

47
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,560
Do you have a say in this?

48
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,800
That's enough, the Seventh Prince.

49
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,800
I think your talent is very

50
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,030
impressive.

51
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,360
You can step aside now.

52
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:42,590
All right.

53
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,280
I'll leave you then.

54
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,960
Wait.

55
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,630
Mother,

56
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,560
I've picked out my future husband.

57
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,190
Is it the Second Prince or the Third Prince?

58
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,310
Neither.

59
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,910
The man I want to marry,

60
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,910
it's him.

61
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,430
No way.

62
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,080
The husband of the princess
represents the honor of Donglan.

63
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,030
It's not a trifling matter.

64
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:10,750
Good point!

65
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,360
A person like me

66
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,030
can't be presentable.

67
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,430
I'd be a disgrace to the Princess.

68
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,310
I've made up my mind.

69
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,840
You have no right to refuse.

70
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:20,680
Father.

71
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,240
If she likes him, let them get married.

72
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,470
It's your fault for indulging her.

73
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,190
You want him to be your husband,

74
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,470
I won't allow it.

75
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,400
Father.

76
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,430
Is the princess blind?

77
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,680
Instead of choosing us
who are both talented and charming,

78
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,080
she chose a fool!

79
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,310
I'm telling you,

80
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,710
the throne of the King of Xiling

81
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,800
has almost been taken by our elder brother.

82
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,080
I thought I'd come to Donglan
and become the husband of the princess

83
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,630
but I didn't expect to lose to an idiot.

84
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,120
What a bummer.

85
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,360
Who knows.

86
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,630
Cang Xiaoqi,

87
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,560
you can't run away from me.

88
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,070
What on earth do you want?

89
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,680
Be my husband.

90
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,390
No.

91
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,190
No?

92
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,360
Then you're not leaving today.

93
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,510
Princess, you're a beautiful woman

94
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,920
with a high status,

95
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,040
aren't you?

96
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,920
Why did you marry a nobody like me?

97
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,120
You're good at talking,

98
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,830
so your brain is working well.

99
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:49,750
Okay.

100
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,720
I'm very satisfied.

101
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,190
What are you up to now?

102
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:01,480
Take a guess.

103
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,240
It's in the light of day...

104
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:04,870
Be a good boy.

105
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,360
I'll be back.

106
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:10,480
Where are you going?

107
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,800
Greetings, Mother.

108
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,270
Mother,

109
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,750
please don't be mad at me.

110
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,070
I've thought about it,

111
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,830
and I think you're right.

112
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,360
I do have to think about our country.

113
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,310
You've finally come to your senses
to marry someone else?

114
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:33,870
No,

115
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,680
but yes.

116
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,040
Just tell me what you want.

117
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,720
I'm giving him a special training program.

118
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,560
He must learn music, chess, painting,

119
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,310
sewing, cooking,

120
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,160
football, riding and archery.

121
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,160
What if he can't?

122
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,950
Then I will marry someone else.

123
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,000
Okay.

124
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,750
I'll give you a month.

125
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,310
If the Seventh Prince still hasn't improved,

126
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,190
I'll marry you to the Second Prince of Xiling.

127
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,390
Okay.

128
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,720
Deal.

129
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:13,480
I'm back.

130
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,310
Why are you so sweaty?

131
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,750
Are you sick?

132
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:19,920
I'll go get the imperial physician.

133
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,950
You're the sick one.

134
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,630
Try holding a position

135
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,040
for a long time

136
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,750
and see

137
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,800
if you sweat?

138
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:29,720
Nan Si had three husbands,

139
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,950
all of whom died,

140
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,800
and she was known as a cursed woman,
destined to be alone.

141
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,720
Does her fate

142
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,800
bring misfortune to Cang Hanyu too?

143
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:37,720
Are you dumb?

144
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,120
I'm telling you,

145
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,920
I'm not sick.

146
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,750
Don't try to take advantage of me.

147
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,240
Listen to me.

148
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,160
You're sick.

149
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,680
Your Majesty.

150
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,070
Counselor,

151
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,120
what do you think

152
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,390
of the Seventh Prince?

153
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,560
I

154
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:05,310
think he's behaving oddly

155
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,720
and not a good match for the Princess.

156
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,310
The Princess is gifted and intelligent.

157
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,160
She made that choice,

158
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,070
and I think

159
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,950
she must have had her own reasons for it.

160
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:17,920
By the way,

161
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,800
I've just heard that there's a new commander

162
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:21,950
of the imperial guards.

163
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,510
I was just about to report

164
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,920
that General Liu, the former commander,
who was corrupt and broke the law,

165
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,240
has now been in custody.

166
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,630
I can't believe it.

167
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,120
The evidence is overwhelming

168
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,560
and he has confessed.

169
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,830
The commander of the imperial guards
has a great responsibility,

170
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,310
so we need to carefully
select the right person for the job.

171
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,600
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

172
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,430
The new commander, General Li,
is an old friend of mine.

173
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:49,240
He won't disappoint you.

174
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,270
If so,

175
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,630
