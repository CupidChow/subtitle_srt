I thought you liked it when I got wild.

4
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:43,710
Hanyu.

5
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,640
Hurry.

6
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,600
I can't wait anymore.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You brazen palace maid!

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,280
How dare you break into my bed chamber!

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,280
Why did you push me so hard?

10
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,240
What are you talking about?

11
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,600
I don't get it.

12
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:15,840
Young Master,

13
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:18,590
Miss Nan is well-off

14
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,920
and adorable.

15
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:24,200
She is exceptionally beautiful too.

16
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,480
You and she are perfectly matched.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,790
Slowly.

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,710
You're so clumsy.

19
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,840
Even worse, you can't even have a baby.

20
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,150
What else can you do?

21
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,430
Dear, don't be mad.

22
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,480
But the baby thing

23
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,030
can't be done by myself alone.

24
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,310
How dare you sass me?

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,240
You're done.

26
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,870
What...

27
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,710
What are you doing?

28
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,680

29
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,080
Nan Si, I'm sorry.

30
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,960
It's...

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,150
Why did you apologize?

32
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,280
Isn't it right and proper for a man
to have a lot of women?

33
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,680
Tomorrow,

34
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:42,030
I'll marry you.

35
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,030
No way!

36
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,910
I disagree.

37
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,910
Go away!

38
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,310
Dear, you...

39
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,080
You disagree?

40
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,840
Guards.

41
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,280
Take this disrespectful woman down

42
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,910
and lock her up in the woodshed.

43
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,280
(I can't believe
I became a lecherous jerk.)

44
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,400

45

Why are you staring blankly again?

46
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,840
Let's hurry

47
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,910
and get down to business.

48
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,280
Where are you going?

49
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,800
I'll go to meet Si.

50
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,430
No way!

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,750
Our marriage is canceled.

52
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,590
Just go back.

53
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,800
Are you insane?

54
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,190
Why do you want to meet that woman?

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,120
You said she was stupid and clumsy.

56
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,750
She can't even compare with my toe.

57
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,400
I dare you to say it again.

58
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,310
Eat it.

59
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,960
What bad luck!

60
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,120
It's so unlucky for me to do this.

61
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,960
Will you eat it or not?

62
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,590
If you don't eat it,
I'll feed it to pigs.

63
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,910
Take it away.

64

65
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,520

66
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,710
Don't go.

67
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,150
