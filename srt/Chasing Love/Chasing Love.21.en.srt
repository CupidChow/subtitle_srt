3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,280
I'm telling you

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,080
what I hate most is

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,480
when people lie to me.

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,000
I can pamper you,

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,840
but I can also kill you.

8
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,640
You wicked woman,

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,920
you played with my feelings.

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,720
You're right,

11
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,120
I did it.

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,680
It's all me.

13
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,360
I did it all.

14
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,080
I just can't stand the way

15
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,240
you think you're so high and mighty.

16
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:36,920
So what?

17
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,800
Nothing.

18
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,640
It's just when people do something,

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,480
it comes at a price.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,480
This is the price you pay.

21
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,840
to be dragged into the backwoods

22
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,560
and fed to wild dogs.

23
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,960
You all listen to me,

24
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,560
this is what happens

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,640
when you betray me and the empress.

26
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,240
King of Xiling,

27
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,160
I have some good news for you.

28
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,840
Cang Hanyu is dead.

29
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,280
His body was fed to the dogs.

30
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,120
It's true.

31
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,080
I saw it with my own eyes.

32
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,080
Looks like they both
lost their memories this time.

33
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,920
Cang Hanyu,

34
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:35,880
this is what you got this time.

35
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,400
Unfortunately,

36
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,200
I wasn't the one who killed him.

37
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,520
If you want to kill someone,

38
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,120
There's one left.

39
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,440
Nan Si.

40
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,440
Leave her to me.

41
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,360
I will watch her bleed out

42
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,280
little by little.

43
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,320
I'll watch her pretty face

44
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,480
get destroyed by me again and again.

45
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,080
I want her to crawl at my feet

46
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,840
and see with her own eyes

47
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,280
who is the final winner.

48
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,080
Your Majesty,

49
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,400
the State Counselor is here to see you.

50
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,440
Let him in.

51
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,960
Greetings, Your Majesty.

52
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,680
No need to curtsy.

53
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,720
I do have something to report today,

54
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,920
but it's a private matter
of the royal family,

55
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,680
I don't know if it's appropriate to speak.

56
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,120
There are no private matters
in the royal family.

57
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,000
Just tell me please.

58
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,120
The accident
at the blossom viewing banquet before,

59
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,520
the Princess took away Cang Hanyu that thug.

60
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,200
I thought the princess was unsophisticated

61
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,520
and might let him go.

62
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,320
But she had a high sense of her duty

63
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,400
and killed him.

64
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,920
The Princess is resolute and decisive,

65
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,160
and she has a deep sense of justice,

66
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,600
which is a blessing for the people of Donglan.

67
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,160
What are you suggesting?

68
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,600
I would like

69
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,960
to ask Your Majesty

70
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,880
to hold a banquet
for the Princess on her 20th birthday,

71
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,000
hand down the Phoenix Hairpin,

72
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,880
and make her the Crown Princess.

73
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,280
Si,

74
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,080
if you keep slashing like this,

75
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,680
there won't be

76
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,920
a single leaf or flower in your residence.

77
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,760
Who cares?

78
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,880
Since you're in a bad mood,

79
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,640
I'll bring you some good news.

80
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,040
What good news can there be?

81
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,760
The State Counselor proposed

82
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,960
a great banquet for your 20th birthday,

83
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,200
at which

84
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,120
Her Majesty will formally announce

85
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,080
that you

86
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,080
shall inherit the Phoenix Hairpin.
