3
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:17,710
Si.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,800
Si.

5
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:22,320
Si.

6
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,000
Si.

7
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,540
You...

8
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,560
What are you doing?

9
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,110
I'm warning you

10
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,070
don't you dare...

11
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,040
Si,

12
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,790
I'll never let Cang Yunze

13
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,040
hurt you again.

14
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,790
Cang Yunze has been away from
the Cang family for more than ten years

15
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:34,200
and is a stranger to me.

16
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,590
Why would he hurt me?

17
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,790
The one who can hurt me

18
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,590
has always been you,

19
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,310
and only you.

20
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,200
I won't hurt you

21
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,510
ever again.

22
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,120
Nan Si,

23
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,480
you're hitting on Hanyu again.

24
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,470
So what?

25
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,800
Who are you to judge?

26
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,590
You...

27
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,030
You think I am like you,

28
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,120
with no shame?

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,310
Why are you here again?

30
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,520
Hanyu,

31
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,800
Auntie said

32
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,910
that if you insist on keeping Nan Si,

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,080
she must learn to manage the household

34
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,310
and take on the responsibilities
of the madam of the family.

35
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,710
The first thing she is told to do

36
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,120
is to make a deal with Cang Yunze

37
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,470
within the day.

38
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,800
If she accedes to Cang Yunze's request,

39
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,190
she'll offend Auntie.

40
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,400
If not,

41
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,000
she will offend Cang Yunze.

42
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,870
Either way, she will have a tough time here.

43
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,520
I've got two options for you.

44
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,150
A,

45
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,750
bury your mother's ashes
in the Cang's ancestral grave,

46
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,870
and then

47
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,120
you stay there from now on.

48
00:02:59,240 --> 00:02:59,870
B,

49
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,310
you can come back to Cang's Mansion,

50
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,910
but you shall never mention

51
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,240
the burial in Cang's ancestral grave again.

52
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,840
Pick one.

53
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,430
What if I choose neither?

54
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,120
If you keep pushing us,

55
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,470
the one who will suffer

56
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:13,910
is always you.

57
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:16,960
Really?

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,280
The Cang family is the richest
in the State of Baifeng.

59
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,310
To deal with a young man

60
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,120
with no background like you,

61
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,120
it's a piece of cake.

62
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,000
Here's the easiest way.

63
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,400
You say you are Cang Yunze,

64
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,800
but is that true?

65
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,310
In my opinion,

66
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,910
you're just a wild dog on the roadside.

67
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,630
How dare you

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,910
pretend to be the eldest
young master of the Cang family?

69
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:43,800
Do you have any proof?

70
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,030
- Who can testify on your behalf?
- Nonsense.

71
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,120
Nonsense.

72
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,430
I have the Cang family's
ancestral jade pendant.

73
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,710
When I was leaving,

74
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,000
my father gave it to me personally.

75
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,400
A jade pendant,

76
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,910
there are so many fake ones.

77
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,310
What makes you think yours is real?

78
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,430
You...

79
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:02,710
Hanyu,

80
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,910
let me help you.

81
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,710
Letting Si deal with Cang Yunze

82
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,400
was your idea, wasn't it?

83
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,680
How could that be?

84
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,870
It was Auntie who said
she wanted to test Si's abilities,

85
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:15,590
that's why...

86
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,070
Mother is easily persuaded,

87
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,920
but she's not completely confused.

88
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,830
She's all for you now,

89
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,600
but once she finds out what's going on,

90
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,870
she'll never let you get away with it.

91
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,430
What are you talking about?

92
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,680
I don't understand.

93
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,000
You better not understand.

94
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,830
Evil deeds will bring retribution.

95
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,830
You'd better behave yourself.

96
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,870
You've come back this time

97
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,390
making such a big fuss,

98
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,240
isn't it because you want to
take advantage of your mother

99
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,510
and return to the Cang family?

100
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,070
I think you're a smart man.

101
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,310
How to choose

102
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,510
is up to you.

103
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,800
Si,

104
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,430
did he do anything to you?

105
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,310
What could he do to me?

106
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,310
That's right.

107
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,040
What could I do to her?

108
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,920
Cang Yunze,

109
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,430
you've been competitive
since you were little,

110
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,120
fighting for the noble title,

111
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,920
for a lover.

112
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,160
Noble title?

113
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,240
You're just a merchant.

114
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,510
How dare you covet the royal family?

115
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,630
Cang Hanyu,

116
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,390
the master of the Cang family

117
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,480
will be me sooner or later.

118
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,000
Bring it on.

119
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,830
Si,

120
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,430
let's go.

121
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,800
I didn't know

122
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,480
she actually had the guts.

123
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,870
She's a bit like me back in the day.

124
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,750
Auntie,

125
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,390
Nan Si took it upon herself

126
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,120
to let Cang Yunze live in the mansion,

127
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,190
and you're not angry?

128
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,600
Cang Yunze

129
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,920
deliberately made this matter known to all.

130
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,630
If we didn't let him in,

131
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,000
the Cang family

132
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,040
would be maligned by everyone.

133
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,480
It's a compromise to get what you want,

134
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,240
and it's a great way.

135
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,950
Yiyi,

136
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,920
you've got to learn from her.

137
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,000
I understand.

138
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:03,920
So,

139
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,310
please take a rest.

140
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,720
I'll leave now.

141
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,310
Mother is easily persuaded,

142
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,270
but she's not completely confused.

143
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,270
She's all for you now,

144
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,920
but once she finds out what's going on,

145
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,270
she'll never let you get away with it.

146
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,310
Looks like

147
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,680
I'll have to plan ahead.
