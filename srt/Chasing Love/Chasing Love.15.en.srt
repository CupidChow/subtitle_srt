3
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,000
How is he?

4
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,000
Princess,

5
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,280
the Seventh Prince

6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,360
is in good health,

7
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,280
you may rest easy.

8
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,640
Then why is he sweating so much?

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,080
Does it mean

10
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,640
he's feeble?

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,640
Ridiculous.

12
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,760
He's not feeble.

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,480
Princess, if you're still worried,

14
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,120
allow me to prescribe some medicine.

15
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,520
I'll make sure after taking it,

16
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,000
he'll be as vigorous

17
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,240
as a young man.

18
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,720
What do you mean by that?

19
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,640
Are you saying I'm old?

20
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:55,560
Well...

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,680
Off you go now.

22
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,160
Yes.

23
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,280
Leave the prescription to me.

24
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,600
What,

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,000
is your feebleness

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,920
upsetting you?

27
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,480
I'm perfectly strong.

28
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,480
You want to give it a try?

29
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,760
Really?

30
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,280
Can I really have a try?

31
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,320
Yeah.

32
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,920
Release my acupuncture points.

33
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,680
Forget about it,

34
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,720
let's try again next time.

35
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,280
You've got your hands full now.

36
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,280
My hands are empty.

37
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,480
No, you're not.

38
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,600
What's this?

39
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,240
To be a competent husband to a princess,

40
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,600
you must know how to cook and sew.

41
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,120
Today,

42
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,480
you'll spend half the day cooking
and half sewing.

43
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,720
Tomorrow, you'll spend half the day

44
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,280
on horseback riding and half the day
on music, chess, calligraphy and painting.

45
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,840
By rotating through these lessons,

46
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,880
I'm sure you'll make progress soon.

47
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,200
I'm not doing this.

48
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,240
Do as I say. You must learn.

49
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,320
As your wish.

50
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,880
Do not blame me for being unteachable.

51
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,920
The threads are all tangled up.

52
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,080
I can't do it.

53
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,720
It's okay.

54
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,400
I'll show you how to untangle the threads.

55
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,080
Thank you, mammy.

56
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,480
Now you can continue embroidering.

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,800
Continue.

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,200
Is he really sick?

59
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,520
I have seen him,

60
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,520
he's not sick.

61
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,960
Considering that her three previous husbands

62
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,120
had all died unnatural deaths,

63
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,800
the princess was distraught

64
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,320
and overly concerned.

65
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,840
In your opinion,

66
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,440
how does the princess
feel about the Seven Princes?

67
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,200
Well,

68
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,720
I've never seen her

69
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,680
so devoted to any man.

70
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,200
In time,

71
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,720
the one who will be the princess's husband
will be the seventh prince.

72
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,120
That's the man I chose.

73
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,320
It's only been a few days

74
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,000
and he's charmed the princess to death.

75
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,280
The gods are with me.

76
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,400
My great cause will surely come true.

77
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,320
That's the man I chose.

78
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,720
He's so pretty.

79
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,320
That's the parents I chose.

80
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,880
You're so pretty.

81
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,200
Who are you?

82
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,680
It's a secret.

83
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,000
Where did you come from?

84
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,320
I've come from where I came from.

85
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,920
You know smart talking, little kid.

86
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,920
What is smart talking?

87
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,600
When you meet someone

88
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,560
called Donghua,

89
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,800
he'll tell you.

90
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,320
He's going to prick his finger.

91
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,600
Oh no.

92
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,000
You got to be careful

93
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,400
or I'll get worried.

94
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,760
What's wrong?

95
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,240
Are you bashful now?

96
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,920
I'm not.

97
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,920
Cang Xiaoqi,

98
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,800
you're so cute now.

99
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,080
Why are you being so innocent,

100
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,520
acting like a little kid.

101
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,720
Right, that little girl,

102
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,080
where is she?

103
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,720
She was just flirting with me.

104
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,920
Princess, do you always

105
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,640
like to flirt with strange men?

106
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,520
You're no strange man.

107
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,880
You're my husband

108
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,800
and you're going to be the husband
of the future Empress of Donglan.

109
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,920
Are you jealous of yourself?

110
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,000
You've got me wrong.

111
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,880
I have no interest in being your husband.

112
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,040
So what are you interested in?

113
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,400
I want to succeed in an imperial-examination,
become an official and save the world.
