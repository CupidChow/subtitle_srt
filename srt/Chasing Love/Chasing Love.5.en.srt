3
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,960
I heard that Cang's
young lady is truly beautiful.

4
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,190
Today,

5
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,870
I can finally have a taste.

6
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,390
How dare she ruin
the morale of the Cang family?

7
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,790
Yiyi, get some men to come with me.

8
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,670
Yes.

9
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,000
Madam,

10
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,880
please don't get angry.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,240
Don't let it harm your health.

12
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:07,920
Nan Si,

13
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,200
who is he?

14
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,640
He is an infamous pervert
in the State of Baifeng.

15
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,950
He has assaulted
countless women in the past.

16
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,230
He's got a long list of crimes.

17
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:21,790
A pervert.

18
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,560
Cang's Mansion is heavily guarded.

19
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,510
How did he get in?

20
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,120
Young master,

21
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,480
I don't know anything about this.

22
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,790
I was wrong.

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,200
Please spare my life, young master.

24
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,480
Who sent you here?

25
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,230
It is...

26
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,280
It was Lady Si who asked me to come.

27
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,510
When and where did I ask you?

28
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,870
By a spoken or written order?

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,640
Where is the witness and evidence?

30
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,560
It is...

31
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,960
Bai Yiyi.

32
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,840
Lady Bai is so determined.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,800
Why?

34
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:19,870
Are you worried

35
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,870
he might say something against you?

36
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,590
Yiyi.

37
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,750
Auntie,

38
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,400
I was afraid of this despicable person

39
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,190
would say something bad
for the Cang family,

40
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,000
- so I...
- Yiyi, you

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,800
were in such a hurry to kill him,

42
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,590
it's really confusing.

43
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,360
Hanyu,

44
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,840
you don't believe me either.

45
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,710
Auntie,

46
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,190
I did it for the Cang family,

47
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,680
but I'm being suspected for no reason.

48
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,310
Please do me justice.

49
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,030
If you don't believe me either, auntie,

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,630
then I

51
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,080
- will have to die to prove my innocence.
- Yiyi.

52
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,030
Yiyi, what are you doing?

53
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,590
I am wronged.

54
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,710
Yiyi has a point.

55
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,120
The young lady of the Cang family

56
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,750
had been involved with a notorious pervert,

57
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,120
if word got out,
the Cang family would be disgraced.

58
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,030
Mother, how can you be so blind
to the truth?

59
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,120
Si is the victim in this.

60
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,750
Yu,

61
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,430
you are the future successor
of the Cang family.

62
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,750
You can't have a stain on your reputation.

63
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,030
Now that the court's inspection is over,

64
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,360
this woman, Nan Si,

65
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,960
can't stay here any longer.

66
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,590
What if I insist on keeping her?

67
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,520
You fool!

68
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,560
You're so reckless
and have no regard for decency.

69
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,360
Guards,

70
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,630
take him down!

71
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,030
Auntie,

72
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,960
Hanyu just had been confused for a moment.

73
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,080
Harder.

74
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,240
He is the future master of the Cang family.

75
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,840
If he continues
to act the way he wants,

76
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,910
how can he take over
the century-old family business?

77
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,630
What are you looking at me for?

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,400
I'd rather have a letter of divorce.

79
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:13,960
Nan Si,

80
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,430
do you even have a heart?

81
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,600
When you got together

82
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,240
and bullied and betrayed me,

83
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,950
my heart was already gone.

84
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:20,680
You...

85
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,800
That's enough.

86
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,600
Stop.

87
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,920
Cang Hanyu,

88
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,920
Let's end the relationship
between you and me.

89
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,720
You don't have to hold on to it.

90
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,190
Don't worry, Si.

91
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,000
I can stand it.

92
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,270
I'll take this punishment

93
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,240
as atonement for all the things

94
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,120
I've done before.

95
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,390
You still don't get it.

96
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,600
