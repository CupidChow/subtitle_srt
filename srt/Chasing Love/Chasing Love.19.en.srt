3
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,230
Cang Xiaoqi,

4
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,030
why are you wearing a long face?

5
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,070
Give me a smile.

6
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,030
It's worse than crying.

7
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:31,280
What?

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,070
You're still thinking about that killer.

9
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,240
Princess,

10
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:37,920
actually...

11
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,070
Greetings, Your Highness.

12
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,000
No need for courtesy.

13
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,520
State Counselor,
you rarely come to the palace.

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,070
Is something happening?

15
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,520
When I observed the sky at night,

16
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,430
I saw that the Zi Wei star was shining brightly,

17
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,470
but suddenly there was a fatal star beside it.

18
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,520
This was a bad omen
that the king would be in trouble.

19
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,320
I was concerned about Her Majesty's safety,

20
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,920
and I was very worried,

21
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,600
so I came to check.

22
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,950
Seeing that Her Majesty is safe and sound,

23
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,710
now I know I was overly worried.

24
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,480
You're too kind, State Counselor.

25
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,870
You're dedicated to our country.

26
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,920
Mother and I know and appreciate it.

27
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,510
I've persuaded Her Majesty

28
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,120
to host a banquet for the court
in the East Hall in three days.

29
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,510
By then, a good sign will have appeared,

30
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,040
and spring will have arrived.

31
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,590
It's a good way to break the bad omen.

32
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,430
I will leave you then.

33
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,280
Cang Xiaoqi,

34
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:39,000
what did you want to tell me?

35
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,000
You must be careful of the State Counselor.

36
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,120
This man is evil and ambitious.
You must watch out for him.

37
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,400
It is just as the King of Xiling expected.

38
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,710
Greetings, State Counselor.

39
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,480
I'm a messenger sent by the King of Xiling.

40
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,000
King of Xiling?

41
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,710
You mean the newly crowned Cang Yunze?

42
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:05,710
There's an important thing,

43
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,310
the King of the Xiling wants to talk to you.

44
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,470
Please.

45
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,710
The King of Xiling
has traveled so far to see me.

46
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,240
For what purpose?

47
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:35,400
I heard you want the Seventh Prince

48
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,080
to assassinate the Empress.

49
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,080
Nonsense.

50
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,030
I am loyal to the Empress, God knows.

51
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,560
Then I'm sure

52
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,870
you won't care about

53
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,680
the impersonator of the Seventh Prince.

54
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,310
The impersonator of the Seventh Prince?

55
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,710
What do you mean?

56
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,520
The real Seventh Prince

57
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,430
died of a sudden illness

58
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,030
on his way to the state of Donglan.

59
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,710
The one who will marry the princess

60
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,590
is an imposter.

61
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,120
His real name is Cang Hanyu.

62
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,710
You've been writing to the Seventh Prince

63
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:15,910
and never met him.

64
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,400
That's why you fell for it.

65
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,120
An imposter?

66
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,080
No need to worry.

67
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,520
The purpose that I come here

68
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,310
is to help you.

69
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:29,120
King of Xiling,

70
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,910
why are you so kind to help?

71
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,680
Easy,

72
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,080
I want Phoenix Hairpin

73
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,800
and I want Cang Hanyu and Nan Si dead.

74
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,240
As for the throne of Donglan,

75
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,120
I'll let you have it.

76
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:50,840
Mo Hua,

77
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,840
you have no choice but to cooperate

78
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,680
with me.

79
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,800
You can never be sure
that you will be the ultimate winner.

80
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,680
The show is about to begin.

81
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,830
Princess.

82
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,630
Princess,

83
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,310
you go see the Empress.

84
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,270
I need to go to the latrine.

85
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:36,630
Okay.

86
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,390
Hurry up.

87
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,720
Don't keep Mother waiting.

88
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,390
This is from the State Counselor.

89
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,920
How to use it?

90
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,830
Mix it in wine or tea.

91
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,720
It's colorless and tasteless.

92
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,630
If you drink it,

93
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,680
even the Gods can't save you.

94
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,160
State Counselor,

95
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,040
following your orders,

96
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,720
I've given the Seventh Prince
the Qianji poison.

97
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,430
Well done.

98
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,800
Your Majesty.

99
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,920
This is a family lunch.
No need for etiquette.

100
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,270
Just sit with Si.

101
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,800
Thank you, Your Majesty.

102
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,830
Why did it take you so long?

103
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,390
Go make a toast to Mother.

104
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,830
I wish Your Majesty,

105
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,830
to live as long as the Zhongnan Mountains

106
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,120
and to enjoy good health forever.

107
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,920
You're getting good at phrasing things now.

108
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,270
Good for you.

109
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,630
It's all because of the Princess.

110
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,720
State Counselor, why are you doing this?

111
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,630
I can't even have a sip of wine now?

112
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,120
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

113
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,510
I had no choice

114
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,920
because the wine is poisonous.

115
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:38,870
What?

116
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,240
Who have the audacity to poison me?

117
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,000
Please don't be angry, Your Majesty.
I wouldn't dare.

118
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,390
State Counselor,

119
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,310
do you know
who is trying to murder Her Majesty?

120
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,870
The Seven Princes of Xiling is behind this.

121
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,600
State Counselor,

122
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,950
if you don't have no real evidence,

123
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,310
don't falsely accuse the innocent.

124
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,120
State Counselor,

125
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:15,920
are you telling the truth?

126
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,480
What proof do you have?

127
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,830
I have the nerve to accuse him,

128
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,510
I'm certainly sure of it.

129
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,600
If you don't believe me,

130
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,870
you can search him.

131
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,390
Search him.

132
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,310
