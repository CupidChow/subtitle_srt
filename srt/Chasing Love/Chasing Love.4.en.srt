3
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,350
My birthday is in three days.

4
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,960
This is what I'll be wearing that day,

5
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,320
but it's lacking a bit of embroidery.

6
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,760
What do you want?

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,150
Although you're no good at anything,

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,790
your embroidery is barely acceptable.

9
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,470
You'll do the embroidery, of course.

10
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,110
If you don't do as I say,

11
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,320
I'll sell you to a brothel.

12
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:47,390
Be obedient,

13
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,670
and I'll give you
and Hanyu a decent break.

14
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,840
Si,

15
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,870
it's time for dinner.

16
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,230
It's still hot.

17
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:14,760
I want...

18
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,350
Si,

19
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,870
can I sleep back here tonight?

20
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,280
You see, it's been getting colder lately.

21
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,430
If I sleep outside again,
I'll catch a cold.

22
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,230
Si?

23
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,310
Oh my.

24
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,590
You really do care about me.

25
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,950
Then why don't you...

26
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,060
Get lost!

27
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:54,810
All right.

28
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,350
Although the pattern is a bit tacky,

29
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,120
the embroidery is not bad.

30
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,710
I'm glad you like it.

31
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,560
Auntie.

32
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,590
Please sit.

33
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,360
Auntie,

34
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,800
this is a birthday present
from Nan Si.

35
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,560
Is it good-looking?

36
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,030
This pattern suits you very well.

37
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,430
My head hurts so bad.

38
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:32,680
Yiyi,

39
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,750
what's matter with you?

40
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:34,630
Chest,

41
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,910
My chest is tight.

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,120
I can't breathe.

43
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,680
This is...

44
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,430
Why does it have

45
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,680
my birth horoscope written on it?

46
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,800
Why are you looking at me?

47
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,840
Guards,

48
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,470
take this evil witch

49
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,470
who curses her into custody.

50
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:07,960
Si.

51
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,750
Si.

52
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,470
Where did she go?

53
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,520
Search this place carefully.

54
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,680
Don't miss a single corner.

55
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,000
What's the matter, Mother?

56
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,280
Let her speak for herself.

57
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,240
Madam,

58
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,080
I didn't do anything wrong.

59
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,150
What do you want me to say?

60
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:28,870
Nan Si,

61
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,310
if you really hate me,

62
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,960
I can leave here.

63
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,310
Why did you use such despicable tactics?

64
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,870
I remember when

65
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,000
the second madam

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,400
- was...
- what second madam?

67
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,030
That woman didn't deserve it.

68
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,560
Anyway, auntie hates curses and the like,

69
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,560
and forbids it in the Cang's Mansion.

70
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,800
Anyone who disobeys it

71
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,360
will be punished mercilessly.

72
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,960
Madam, we found it.

73
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,560
Nan Si,

74
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,710
now what do you have to say?

75
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,240
This is...

76
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,260
This...

77
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,430
Why are you picking on me?

78
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,360
This is the doll
I pray for to bear children.

79
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,720
Now,

80
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,310
now the Cang family will have no offspring.

81
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:19,680
Husband,

82
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,390
I've wronged you.

83
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,070
It's all my fault.

84
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,040
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,630
This is obviously...

86
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,630
What is it?

87
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,720
Did you, Yiyi

88
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,430
try to frame me

89
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,190
by putting a curse on yourself?

90
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,950
If this is true,

91
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,870
she must be punished.

92
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:40,750
Nonsense.

93
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,600
How could I have done such a thing?

94
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,630
Auntie, you saw it with your own eyes.

95
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,480
I know nothing about it.

96
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,390
I believe in Yiyi.

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,430
This is definitely a frame-up.

98
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,630
Let's just leave it at that.

99
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,480
Mother, I'm afraid

100
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,070
that's not a fair solution.

101
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,480
What do you want?

102
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,390
So many of you have come here
accusing Si of cursing.

103
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,360
Don't you

104
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,240
have to apologize?

105
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,680
Nan Si, I was reckless.

106
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,160
Please forgive me.

107
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,070
Forget it. Such a fuss.

108
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,190
You can leave now.

109
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,190
Thank you.

110
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,190
Nan Si, I'll get back at you.

111
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,430
Yunze.

112
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,560
Yunze.

113
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,040
My son.

114
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,190
Yunze,

115
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,950
come here.

116
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,510
How are you feeling, mom?

117
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,600
I have a tough life.

118
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,040
My death is not worth mourning.

119
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,120
But you must find a way

120
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,950
to bury my ashes in Cang's ancestral grave.

121
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,390
Otherwise,

122
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,360
I won't rest in peace.

123
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,830
Mom.

124
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,390
Mom.

125
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,750
Mom!

126
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,580
(Cang's Mansion)

127
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,160
(Cang's Mansion)

128
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,950
Mom.

129
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,560
I'm gonna get back everything that's ours.

130
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,160
and bury you in the Cang's ancestral grave
in a proper manner.

131
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,510
You're really good at targeting.

132
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,680
But it's better not to throw things around.

133
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,600
Did I let you in?

134
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:11,680
No.

135
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:14,040
But I see the flowers
are in full bloom today,

136
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,510
and I think you must like them,

137
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,560
so I come boldly to bring them here.

138
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,870
You're done. You can piss off now.

139
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,830
I will, in a minute.

140
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:21,830
Because I am going

141
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:24,120
to count the tribute
with the steward today,

142
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,360
you will be alone.

143
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,070
You must remember to eat well.

144
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,000
- Get lost!
- Look at the flower...

145
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,830
All right.

146
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,120
I heard that Cang's
young lady is truly beautiful.

147
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,840
Today,

148
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:52,550
I can finally have a taste.
