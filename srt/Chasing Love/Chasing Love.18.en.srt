3
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,160
Who is it?

4
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,920
It's me.

5
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,480
State Counselor, Mo Hua.

6
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,880
The Seventh Prince,

7
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,560
you're such a good actor.

8
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,000
I came here today

9
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,720
to tell you one thing.

10
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,760
The time has come to assassinate the Empress.

11
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,400
Assassinate the Empress?

12
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,200
Yes.

13
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,400
Prince,

14
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,600
why are you so surprised?

15
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,720
Haven't we planned this all along?

16
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,840
I just

17
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,920
got a little sleepy.

18
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,560
Assassinate the Empress,

19
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,320
is it that time already?

20
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,520
You are now the Princess's future husband

21
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,520
and are deeply trusted by her.

22
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,800
You'll have many opportunities
to see the Empress.

23
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,280
We need to have a solid plan

24
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,520
to kill the Empress

25
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,600
without anyone noticing.

26
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,680
It seems that

27
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,560
Mo Hua and the Seventh Prince of Xiling

28
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,880
have been colluding for a long time.

29
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,160
If I hadn't just happened

30
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,800
to impersonate the Seventh Prince,

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,800
I'm afraid that...

32
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,160
The Seventh Prince,

33
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,240
I killed the Princess's last three husbands

34
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,120
just to pave the way for you.

35
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,120
Do you

36
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,960
want to give up the plan?

37
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,520
How come?

38
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,320
I was just thinking about

39
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,200
that solid plan.

40
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,320
Okay.

41
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,120
After we succeed,

42
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,360
if I become the King of Donglan,

43
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,200
I'll send troops to help you
return to Xiling to become the King.

44
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,920
If so,

45
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,560
I'd like to thank you in advance.

46
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,480
Every time the little phoenix appears,

47
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,720
something seems to happen.

48
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,680
I hope Cang Xiaoqi is alright.

49
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,120
Cang Xiaoqi.

50
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,160
Did you see anyone suspicious?

51
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,320
No.

52
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,560
I just heard a noise outside.

53
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,840
I thought something happened to you,

54
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,920
so I came over.

55
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,360
The assassination has huge implications.

56
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,160
I need time to think it through.

57
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,640
Okay.

58
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,240
The palace has sent the wedding clothes.

59
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,200
Let's try them on.

60
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,600
Let's go.

61
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,400
This one looks much better.

62
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,960
The last time was so rushed,

63
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,080
we didn't even get to dress up.

64
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,120
Last time?

65
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:00,920
Cang Xiaoqi,

66
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,160
you just offended me.

67
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,280
I'm punishing you.

68
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,360
I'm willing to take it.

69
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,200
I'm punishing you

70
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,560
to offend me again.

71
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,760
Your Highness,

72
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,520
the Princess asked me to bring you something.

73
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,440
Come on in.

74
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,440
I've still got some dessert left.

75
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,600
Why did she send it again?

76
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,480
I don't know.

77
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,760
Tell me.

78
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,920
Who sent you to assassinate him?

79
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,600
Cang Xiaoqi,

80
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,560
are you okay?

81
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,440
I'm fine.

82
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,520
Who is this man?

83
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,520
Does he have something to do with Cang Yunze?

84
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,400
Darn it!

85
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,320
Useless trash.

86
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,960
It's all my fault.

87
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,520
Please, Your Majesty, give me another chance.

88
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,960
One failure will put them on their guard.

89
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,760
It won't be easy to infiltrate the palace again.

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,800
I...

91
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,200
I've captured the real Seventh Prince,

92
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,280
and I've learned a secret from him

93
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,680
that will surely help you succeed.

94
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,160
