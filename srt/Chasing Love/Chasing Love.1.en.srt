(Cang Yunze, Prince Qi,)

5
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,600
(colluded with Blue Moon
to rise in rebellion.)

his beloved concubine Nan Si)

10
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,710
(buying time for reinforcements.)

00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,110
(Eventually, they succeeded
in repelling the rebels.)

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,840
(However, Nan Si, who was in labor,)

13
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:36,750
(had a bellyache in the chaos.)

Originally,

77
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,390
there wasn't.

Once the portal of time is opened,

85
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,510
there will be no going back.

86
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,750
Yes, I must do this.

Even if

88
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,270
she may not be able to make it
through 20 years old every time?

89

Even if the short-lived curse is broken,

90
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,310
she still can't wake up.

91

Si.

92
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,360
Just consider me a selfish man.

93
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,070
I just can't live without you.

94
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,480

with this world.

108
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,120
Madam,

109
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,800
she's locked in the woodshed.

110
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,920
I assume she'll be dead soon.

111
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,390
Keep an eye on her.

112
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,000
Don't let her get out

113
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,750
to ruin the big night for my son and Yiyi.

114
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,720
Yes.

Yiyi,

116
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,800
don't let me down.

117
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,560
Have a baby for our family ASAP.

118
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,800
Then you'll be the mistress

119
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,070
of the Cang family.
