3
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,190
What are you looking for?

4
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,120
Are you a human or a ghost?

5
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:29,440
Bai Yiyi,

6
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,640
I trusted you and spoiled you.

7
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,640
I can't believe you wanted to kill me.

8
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,670
If Nan Si hadn't warned me today,

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,390
I'm afraid I'd have been

10
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:38,600
murdered by you.

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,000
Bai Yiyi,

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,430
you won't get away.

13
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,320
Why are you here?

14
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,390
You...

15
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,110
You sneak into my room late at night.

16
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,960
What do you want?

17
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,560
I suspect you're not sick,

18
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,960
but poisoned by Bai Yiyi.

19
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,280
No way.

20
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,590
Yiyi is like my own daughter.

21
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:07,680
If you don't believe me,

22
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,120
you can skip the medicine
she brings every day.

23
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:11,510
Your condition

24
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,590
will gradually improve.

25
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,310
Auntie,

26
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,230
I'm begging you,

27
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,400
forgive me this time.

28
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,230
For the sake of my deceased parents,

29
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,200
forgive me this time, please.

30
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,120
Guards,

31
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,200
lock this evil girl up in the woodshed.

32
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,040
Nan Si.

33
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,230
Cang Hanyu.

34
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,510
Now I know.

35
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:17,840
You...

36
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,520
Why are you always so immature?

37
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,400
I'll do it myself.

38
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,680
Silly.

39
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,120
This is...

40
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,560
Phoenix Hairpin.

41
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,680
Mother told me to give it to you.

42
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,360
She's come to her senses

43
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,190
and is willing to accept you
as her daughter-in-law.

44
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,710
Si,

45
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,360
this hairpin

46
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,750
has special significance to you and me,

47
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,520
you must keep it well.

48
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:24,710
Si,

49
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,840
are you okay?

50
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,520
I've been thinking and dreaming a lot lately.

51
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,910
Cang Hanyu.

52
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,800
There's some memory from nowhere

53
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,560
that floods my mind

54
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,960
and gives me a splitting headache

55
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,520
and a great sorrow.

56
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,840
Don't be afraid. I'm here for you.

57
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,470
Then don't think about it.

58
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,240
Come.

59
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,680
Let's have a rest.

60
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,120
Si,

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,920
tomorrow is your 20th birthday.

62
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,390
Let's have a nice celebration.

63
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,950
No need for that.

64
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,310
It's so tiring.

65
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,160
Yunze,

66
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,800
you come to save me, don't you?

67
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,870
You couldn't even handle a simple task.

68
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,430
What's the point of saving you?

69
00:04:59,360 --> 00:04:59,950
Wait.

70
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,270
I know a secret about the Phoenix Hairpin

71
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,630
that might be useful to you.

72
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,510
A secret?

73
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,000
Tell me.

74
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,750
I can't believe it.

75
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,310
I heard it from my auntie.

76
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,070
It can't be wrong.

77
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,720
Miss Bai,

78
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,310
you're no use to me anymore.

79
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,680
The cooperation between us,

80
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,120
ends now.

81
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,480
Young Master,

82
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,070
please let me do it.

83
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,720
No.

84
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,000
This is the longevity noodles for Si,

85
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,000
I have to make them myself.

86
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,270
No one may help.

87
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,720
But, Young Master,

88
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,630
the water

89
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,920
hasn't even boiled yet.

90
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,480
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

91
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,480
Start over.

92
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,720
What's wrong with me today?

93
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,750
Why am I feeling so uneasy?

94
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,120
Si,

95
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,190
here's your longevity noodles.

96
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,920
Come and eat.

97
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,360
Here.

98
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,800
Is it

99
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,270
cooked by you?

100
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,750
It may not look good,

101
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,920
but it must be delicious.

102
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,000
Have a try.

103
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:02,750
Young Master,

104
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,720
there seems to be a problem
with the tribute sent to the palace.

105
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,120
The officials of the palace come to verify.

106
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,750
Madam wants you to come over.

107
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,480
Si, you stay here and have your noodles.

108
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,600
I'll be right back.

109
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,720
This is not the way to Mother's room.

110
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,680
Where are you taking me?

111
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,510
Young Master, please forgive me.

112
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,560
Madam wants to keep this from getting out,

113
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,310
so she told me to say so.

114
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,000
What's the matter?

115
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,070
Miss Bai

116
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,000
was murdered.

117
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,070
Cang Hanyu,

118
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,310
did you pour a whole jar of salt?

119
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,270
I know he can't do things right.
