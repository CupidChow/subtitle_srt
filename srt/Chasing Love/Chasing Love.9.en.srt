3
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:35,880
Mountain bandits!

4
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,710
Run!

5
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:46,520
What are you looking for?

6
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,470
Who are you?

7
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,520
Why are you attacking us?

8
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:06,680
Take them down.

9
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,400
Si.

10
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,790
Si.

11
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,120
Si.

12
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,120
Hang in there, everybody.

13
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,560
The troops will arrive soon.

14
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,240
Retreat.

15
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,470
Si.

16
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,430
Are you injured?

17
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,280
No.

18
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,750
How about you?

19
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,310
It doesn't matter if I get hurt,

20
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,360
as long as you're fine.

21
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,120
What were those images in my mind?

22
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,520
Why am I feeling so sad?

23
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,030
What is Nan Si's identity?

24
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,150
Why is she so good at kung fu?

25
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,560
Be gentle.

26
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,870
I gave you a chance
and you couldn't even seize it.

27
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,120
I overestimated you.

28
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,870
They were prepared for this.

29
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,310
They weren't even on the wagon.

30
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,960
His entourage were all good at kung fu.

31
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,030
But next time,

32
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,360
he won't be so lucky.

33
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,240
You got them on alert this time.

34
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,710
You still want another chance?

35
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,240
Don't you think

36
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,750
Nan Si is a bit strange?

37
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,470
Now that you mention it,

38
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,280
she does seem like a different person lately.

39
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,280
She used to be such a dork,

40
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,470
but now she's become so sly,

41
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,910
and she has no shame now.

42
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,470
Before she married into the Cang family,

43
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,240
who was she?

44
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,120
She's just a humble girl from a poor family.

45
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,800
Am I

46
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,120
overthinking about it?

47
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,430
Auntie is almost dying.

48
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,750
I'll get the Phoenix Hairpin
as soon as possible.

49
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,120
You must help me get rid of Nan Si quickly.

50
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,630
Miss Bai,

51
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,030
do you really just want Cang Hanyu?

52
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:06,910
Yes.

53
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,750
After you kill Nan Si

54
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,310
and I get Hanyu,

55
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,710
do you think I'll let you

56
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,870
become the master of the Cang family?

57
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,120
That's great.

58
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,480
Well, in that case,

59
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,160
we'll take what we want.

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,830
After I kill Nan Si,

61
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,190
get the Phoenix Hairpin,

62
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,070
and inherit the Cang family's wealth,

63
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,720
do you think

64
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,920
I'll let you and Cang Hanyu live?

65
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,270
Your wound just healed a bit,

66
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,240
but after the fight in the woods today,

67
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,720
it burst open again.

68
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,310
As long as you're all right.

69
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,120
If you don't care for your own body,

70
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,750
how many times can you protect me?

71
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,680
I know how you care about me.

72
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,600
From now on,

73
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,120
I will take care of myself

74
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,310
and be with you forever.

75
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,270
Shame on you.

76
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,870
Who wants to be with you forever?

77
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,120
It hurts!

78
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,040
Then don't mess around with me.

79
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:27,920
Nope.

80
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,160
Then I don't feel it hurts.

81
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,510
You...

82
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,040
Auntie.

83
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,310
Auntie.

84
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:51,310
It's time to take the medicine.

85
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,830
You old hag.

86
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,430
You've finally died.

87
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,680
That's weird.

88
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,270
