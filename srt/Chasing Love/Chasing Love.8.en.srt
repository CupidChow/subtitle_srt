00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:23,960
Who is it?

4
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,920
Yunze, it's me.

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,510
What are you doing in my room at this hour?

6
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:33,150
Yunze,

7
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:39,960
I'm here to help.

8
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:46,710
Didn't you want to be
the successor of the Cang family?

9
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,670
I can help you with that.

10
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,640
Haven't you seen enough of me?

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,790
No,

12
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,470
I can never see enough of you.

13
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,240
You say one thing but do another.

14
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:04,560
If you're being honest,

15
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,120
how could you have...

16
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,200
Never mind.

17
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,350
I don't want to talk about it.

18
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,640
Take the medicine yourself.

19
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,310
Si,

20
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,040
I was so worried about you

21
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,760
that I ran over there in such a hurry

22
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,640
only to have the scabbed wound

23
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,510
split open again.

24
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:27,870
Open your mouth.

25
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,350
It's so bitter.

26
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,920
What do you want?

27
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,680
Give me a kiss to make it sweet.

28
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,920
Cang Hanyu,

29
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:48,310
you're such a big man,

30
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,280
and you're trying to act adorable,

31
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,000
aren't you gross?

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm not trying to act adorable.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,150
I'm adorable, okay?

34
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,280
It's not gross at all.

35
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,710
I think it's gross.

36
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,480
You want to work with me

37
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,040
to help me become the master of the Cang family.

38
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,920
Tell me,

39
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,960
what do you want?

40
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,430
Cang Hanyu.

41
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,310
I only want Cang Hanyu.

42
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,800
From what you said,

43
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,430
you seem to have a plan already.

44
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,240
Easy,

45
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:09,240
next month, Cang family
will send tribute to the palace.

46
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,430
I'll find an excuse

47
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,030
to keep Auntie from going out.

48
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:14,710
At that time,

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,910
this task

50
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,630
will be given to Hanyu and Nan Si.

51
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,240
And then,

52
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,910
you can

53
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,030
take the opportunity
when they are delivering the tribute

54
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,430
to the palace

55
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,400
to take him down.

56
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:49,710
Auntie,

57
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,960
I'm bringing you your medicine.

58
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,310
Come in.

59
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,710
Get up and have your meal.

60
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,150
It's time to eat?

61
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,190
Si,

62
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,360
I'm still in pain.

63
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,470
Will you feed me?

64
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:12,910
Really?

65
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,510
Cang Hanyu,

66
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,950
you lied to me.

67
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,160
I'm not falling for that.

68
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,430
Si,

69
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,560
I'm sorry.

70
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,870
I'm warning you.

71
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,070
I'm counting to three.

72
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,720
If you don't let go of me,

73
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,950
you'll suffer the consequences.

74
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,680
- Well, I didn't mean to.
- One.

75
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,240
Didn't you say to count to three?

76
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,360
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,870
I didn't mean to lie to you.

78
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:46,630
Young Master,

79
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,120
Madam wants to see you right now.

80
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,360
Greetings, Mother.

81
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,750
Hanyu.

82
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:11,950
Mother,

83
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,560
how could you

84
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,920
have gotten so sick?

85
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,120
Maybe I'm getting old.

86
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,800
I had a bit of a cough the first few days.

87
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,070
I took the medication

88
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,480
and it didn't get any better.

89
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,800
Auntie,

90
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,560
you'd better talk less

91
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,240
and take a rest.

92
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,480
Yu,

93
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,430
I'm counting on you

94
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,720
to deliver the tribute to the palace.

95
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,040
Remember,

96
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,430
stay safe.

97
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,240
Mother's always been in good health.

98
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:54,560
How could she be so sick this time?

99
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,750
You mean...

100
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:02,870
Si,

101
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,510
I have a feeling

102
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,720
the trip to the palace won't be smooth.

103
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,720
You mustn't leave my side.

104
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,240
Somebody!

105
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,240
Yiyi.

106
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,070
Why are you here?

107
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:56,380
(Cang's Mansion)

108
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,040
Si,

109
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,040
today is a very special day.

110
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:18,040
You must listen to me.

111
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,800
Is that so?

112
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,950
Are you sure

113
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,680
you don't have other intentions?

114
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,430
No.

115
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,920
What intentions can I have?

116
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,430
Even I do have one,

117
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,720
I just want you

118
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:34,070
to be safe.
