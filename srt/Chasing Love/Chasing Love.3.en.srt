3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,000
What?

4
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:18,280
I can't believe it.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,670
It's true.

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,760
I saw everything.

7
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,120
That slut tricked Hanyu into the woodshed,

8
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:23,860
and she

9
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,440
took off her clothes to seduce him.

10
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:27,480
This slut.

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,390
How dared she?

12
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,280
You liar, go to hell!

13
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:35,520
Si,

14
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,880
I'm your husband.

15
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,520
From the moment you've got a new lover,

16
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,840
you're no longer my husband.

17
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,520
Let go of me.

18
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:50,520
Si.

19
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,280
I will, if you let go of your anger.

20
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,200
In your dreams!

21
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,240
Let go of me.

22
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,790
You bold slut.

23
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,680
How dare you be so intimate here?

24
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:04,280
Mother,

25
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,040
it's not good for you to be out this late.

26
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:07,710
What are you coming here for?

27
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,760
Yu, you're wounded.

28
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:12,590
I'm all right.

29
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,260
I just accidentally hurt myself.

30
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,120
I did it, so what?

31
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,280
Will you just be quiet?

32
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:17,950
No.

33
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:18,710
This is outrageous.

34
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,760
Yu, this woman is intolerable here.

35
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,960
Draw up a letter of divorce now

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
and throw her out of our house.

37
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,590
I can't wait.

38
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:33,590
Mother,

39
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,120
It's very late at night.

40
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,920
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

41
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,790
You must give me
a satisfactory settlement tomorrow.

42
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,280
You're awake.

43
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,640
Why am I here?

44
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,310
What have you done to me?

45
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,280
Everything I'm entitled to.

46
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:05,310
You jerk.

47
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,430
I'm kidding.

48
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,680
Apart from watching you sleep,

49
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,150
I haven't done anything.

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,630
Your clothes were changed by the maid.

51
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,240
Give it to me.

52
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,080
What?

53
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,360
The letter of divorce.

54
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,680
When did I ever say I was divorcing you?

55
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,430
Your mother said it herself yesterday.

56
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,360
I'm the one who married you, not my mother.

57
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,960
I won't write it no matter what.

58
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,910
I will be with you for the rest of my life.

59
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,910
What about this?

60
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,560
Still not writing?

61
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,190
Absolutely not.

62
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,520
Young Master.

63
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,630
You know what to say later, right?

64
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,120
Yes, please don't worry.

65
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,190
Good day, Mother.

66
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,430
What's with the bruises?

67
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,240
Yu,

68
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,910
have you brought the letter of divorce?

69
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,030
The repudiation is not a good idea.

70
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,870
I hope Mother will think twice about it.

71
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,000
Why?

72
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,680
My dear madam,

73
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,680
the Imperial Court

74
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:41,080
is inspecting the character
and qualifications of the royal merchants.

75
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,120
Our rivals have been eyeing us up,

76
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,430
trying to pick on us.

77
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,280
If at this time

78
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,470
there is a scandal that our heir
has left his wife and will marry again...

79
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,710
No more talking.

80
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,080
Let's leave the matter of repudiation

81
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,560
for the time being.

82
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,310
Auntie.

83
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,000
But

84
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,240
you have to promise me two things.

85
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,280
First,

86
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,630
No more daily nonsense.

87
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,360
Learn how to run a family business.

88
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,120
Second, don't treat Yiyi badly.

89
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,560
She's devoted to you.

90
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,430
Don't worry, Mother,

91
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,750
I will treat Yiyi

92
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,070
like my own sister.

93
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,270
I'll take my leave.

94
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,160
Auntie,

95
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,120
are we just going to

96
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,430
let Nan Si go?

97
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,950
There will be time for that.

98
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,480
When the court finishes its inspection,

99
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,310
we'll get rid of her.

100
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,630
That old witch,

101
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,750
she always talks a good game,

102
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,390
but at the end of the day
she's all about the family business,

103
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,600
and doesn't care about me.

104
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,040
No,

105
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,510
I can't let Nan Si get away with this.
