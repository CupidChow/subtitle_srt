3
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,470
Si, you're so gentle.

4
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:41,600
You talk too much.

5
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,750
Even the handkerchief you feed
is delicious.

6
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,920
Is it really delicious?

7
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,070
Really deli...

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,280
What kind of medicine did you give to him?

9
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,760
He has a special constitution
and can't take random medication.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,640
He has to take special medicine.

11
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:06,310
This medicine-feeding thing,
I really don't want to do.

12
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:07,760
Since you're here,

13
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,000
I'll leave it to you.

14
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,070
Hanyu,

15
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:12,840
let me take care of you.

16
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,430
No need.

17
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,200
I hope you won't

18
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,000
step into this room again.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,430
I'm caring about you.

20
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:21,680
- Hanyu, why are you...
- Bai Yiyi,

21
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,310
just consider the former Cang Hanyu dead.

22
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,480
I hope you won't

23
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,760
disturb my life with Si again.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
What magic potion did she

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,200
use to bewitch you?

26
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,400
You're a completely different person now.

27
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,120
Whether it's in the past or present,

28
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,920
in my last life or the next,

29
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,710
I, Cang Hanyu,

30
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,430
will only love Nan Si.

31
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,560
Sooner or later,

32
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,070
I'll let you know who she really is.

33
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,200
Yiyi,

34
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,000
it's not that I don't want to help you,

35
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,870
it's just that Yu is really...

36
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,470
I know you pamper me, Auntie,

37
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,280
but Nan Si is so overbearing now.

38
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,470
If she's in charge of the family,

39
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,240
she'll surely bully us.

40
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:17,870
How dare she?

41
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,630
Don't worry, Yiyi.

42
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,080
Phoenix Hairpin,

43
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,630
it will be yours sooner or later.

44
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,240
Si,

45
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,150
please don't frown.

46
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,240
In this life,

47
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,400
we'll be fine together.

48
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,280
Don't get handsy.

49
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,030
Si,

50
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,710
you don't call me a playboy anymore.

51
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,280
You've changed your view on me?

52
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,870
Compared with a few words that don't hurt,

53
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,030
pain is much more memorable.

54
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,190
You are really cruel, Si.

55
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,800
I don't feel well.

56
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,190
What's wrong?

57
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,280
It hurts right here.

58
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:44,840
Well, I might as well tell you

59
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,380
something that's gonna make you feel
even worse.

60
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,870
Cang Yunze is back.

61
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:06,960
(Cang's Mansion)

62
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,310
Yunze,

63
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,240
do you have to make a scene?

64
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,800
I only have one request.

65
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,120
I hope madam

66
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,040
will let my mother be buried
in Cang's ancestral grave.

67
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,830
Your mother coveted
the position of the principal wife,

68
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,240
and she used a spell,
trying to kill my auntie,

69
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,390
that's why
she was driven out of the Cang family.

70
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,830
She's a sinner who

71
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,300
will never be buried
in our family's grave.

72
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,830
I advise that

73
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,680
you don't be delusional.

74
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,920
Please tell Madam

75
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,000
that Yunze knows she's broad-minded,

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,040
with kindness and forgiveness.

77
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,630
And now the deceased has passed away,

78
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,430
I hope she will not bother with the dead.

79
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,630
The deceased has passed away,
what a word.

80
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,120
Don't bother with the dead.

81
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,040
This is forcing me to give in.

82
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,310
Auntie,

83
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,390
we're going to the palace
on the 15th next month.

84
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,720
If he makes a big deal out of this,

85
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,430
it may not be good for the Cang family.

86
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,600
I do have an idea.

87
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,240
Tell me.

88
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:23,750
Si.

89
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,510
Si.

90
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,190
Si!

91
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:31,870
Si.

92
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,240
Si.

93
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,190
Si!

94
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:38,950
Si.

95
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,120
Cang Xiaoqi.

96
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,560
Si!

97
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,240
Cang Xiaoqi, I'm here.

98
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,720
Si.

99
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,360
Si!

100
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,480
Si.

101
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,950
Si.

102
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,920
Si.

103
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,120

104
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,390
