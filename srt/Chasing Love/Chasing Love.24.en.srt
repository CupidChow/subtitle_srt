You really think I won't kill her?

18
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,160
Two.

19
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,040
Fine.

20
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,440
I'll give it to you.

21
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,200
Now we're talking.

22
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,280
Cang Hanyu,

23
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,920
you've never been as good as me.

24
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,400
You've just been luckier.

25
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,440
Now,

26
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,040
you're at my mercy like a dog.

27
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,040
Cang Hanyu,

28
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,080
don't be silly.

29
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,720
Even if you give him the hairpin,

30
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,440
he'll kill me just the same.

31
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,440
Shut up. You don't get to talk.

32
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,080
Give me the hairpin.

33
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,000
Don't you dare go too far.

34
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,200
Well,

35
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,760
it's fun to beat up on a dog,

36
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,000
especially when that dog

37
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,600
is Cang Hanyu.

38
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,240

without the Phoenix Hairpin,

43
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,400
you're not going back.
