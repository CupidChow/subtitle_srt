3
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,480
I will succeed in an imperial-examination,
become an official and save the world.

4
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,320
Great aspirations.

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,280
But

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,840
there is no conflict between
being an official and a princess's husband.

7
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:33,720
Don't try to fool me, Princess.

8
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,210
Donglan's ancestral rule forbids

9
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,970
the husbands of the royal family
from participating in politics.

10
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,040
The rules can be bent a little bit.

11
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,080
Just like back in the day,

12
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,240
you let me join the court as a minister

13
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,600
and take charge of the government.

14
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:49,760
Back in the day,

15
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:50,920
which day?

16
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,720
Forget about it.

17
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:54,800
Never mind.

18
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,920
We still have a lot of time.

19
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,320
Let's solve the problem at hand.

20
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,240
Mammy,

21
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,880
tell the kitchen to get ready.

22
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,080
He's going to take a cooking lesson.

23
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,360
Yes.

24
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,240
Princess.

25
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,840
When will you be done torturing me?

26
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,960
When you're willing

27
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,840
and capable of being my husband.

28
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,040
Cang Xiaoqi, without his memories,

29
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,320
can be a real pain in the ass.

30
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,120
He is a real pain in the ass.

31
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,600
Why do you always show up out of nowhere?

32
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,640
You scared me.

33
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,120
Luckily I have a strong heart.

34
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,760
I'm so cute,

35
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,440
how can I scare anyone?

36
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,560
You are so young

37
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,720
and yet so self-obsessed.

38
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,880
I got that from my parents.

39
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,680
You know what,

40
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,720
you do look familiar to me.

41
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,200
I think I've seen you somewhere before.

42
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,480
The pot is about to explode.

43
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,000
What, pot?

44
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,200
What happened?

45
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,520
The pot exploded.

46
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,280
How did the pot explode?

47
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,920
There's oil in the pot
and the oil was boiling.

48
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,320
I said: Don't pour any water in it,

49
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,920
- but...
- But he said it too late.

50
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,120
So the pot exploded.

51
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,760
Luckily,

52
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,840
it didn't damage your brain.

53
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,160
Fine.

54
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,240
That's it for today's cooking class.

55
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,600
Tomorrow, we'll practice riding and shooting.

56
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,000
I can't draw the bow.

57
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,880
No worries. I'll teach you.

58
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,680
The bow must be properly opened,

59
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,400
or

60
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,600
the arrow won't go far.

61
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,440
Yeah, just like it now.

62
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,320
It's just drawing the bow.

63
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,640
Why are your ears red?

64
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,120
It's so hot today.

65
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,640
Fine, if you say so.

66
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,920
Try what I tell you.

67
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,920
His hands are all red.

68
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,280
Poor man.

69
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,840
I can't help him with that.

70
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,520
Mother will check him out.

71
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,280
He'll have to be trained.

72
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,920
So miserable.

73
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,240
He'll get better with practice, right?

74
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,200
If I were him,

75
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,120
I'd run away.

76
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,200
Run away?

77
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,520
How?

78
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,400
When I get the chance.

79
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,800
You...

80
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,120
I can't do this anymore.

81
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,120
I have to find a way to get away.

82
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,520
Cang Xiaoqi,

83
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,720
it's a beautiful moon tonight.

84
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,880
Are you here to watch the moon too?

85
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,240
Watch the moon.

86
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,920
Yeah.

87
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,800
I'll find another place.

88
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,120
The years of a lifetime don't reach a century,
yet they contain a thousand years' sorrow.

89
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,920
When days are short and the dull nights long,
why not take a lamp and wander forth?

90
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,360
Since we are both here to watch the moon,

91
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,920
let's take a lamp and wander forth.

92
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,240
This woman is horrible.

93
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,960
Cang Xiaoqi.

94
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,920
Stop running.

95
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,720
You're making me exhausted.

96
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,800
Why don't we just get along?

97
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,920
I'll give up running

98
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,520
if you let me go.

99
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,320
You might as well go get some sleep.
