3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,680
Let's toast, counselors.

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,000
Your Majesty.

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,600
Your Majesty.

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,480
Your Majesty, something big is happening.

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:24,720
Your Majesty,

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,080
the palace gates

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,160
have been breached.

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,080
What did you say?

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,840
Breached by who?

12
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,840
King of Xiling, Cang Yunze.

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,440
That's impossible. Where is the imperial army?

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,720
As I was coming here,

15
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,400
about 3,000 soldiers have mutinied.

16
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,160
I hope Your Majesty will make a plan soon.

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,240
What a load of nonsense.

18
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:46,960
You deserve it.

19
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,400
State Counselor,

20
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,800
what the hell are you doing?

21
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,980
(Cang)

22
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,640
State Counselor,

23
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,360
are you mutinying?

24
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,840
Your Majesty, you're overstating it.

25
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,320
Now here we are at my birth banquet,

26
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,480
and you've killed a man.

27
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,280
What punishment do you deserve?

28
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:25,920
State Counselor,

29
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,640
you've crossed the line.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,800
Crossed the line?

31
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,680
The real crossing the line

32
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,200
is yet to come.

33
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,400
Ya!

34
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,400
Mo Hua,

35
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,720
what the hell do you want?

36
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,480
What do I want?

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,160
I want you,

38
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,200
you,

39
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:09,840
you,

40
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,160
all of you royals go to hell!

41
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,240
If you're really that tough.

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,600
He may be not,

43
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,520
but I am.

44
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,520
Nan Si,

45
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,080
here we are again.

46
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,240
Why do you like

47
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,560
to disrupt the regime wherever you go?

48
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,600
You remember me.

49
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,520
Of course I remember you.

50
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,840
A despicable villain like you

51
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,920
who is always haunting around

52
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,160
is so hard to forget.

53
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,720
Don't provoke me.

54
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,360
Without Cang Hanyu's help,

55
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,880
you're just a captive to be slaughtered.

56
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,400
I wondered why the State Counselor
had changed so much lately.

57
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,040
It turns out you two
have been conspiring against us.

58
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,800
No blabbering.

59
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,720
Hand out the Phoenix Hairpin.

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,560
What a great plan you made.

61
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,000
But do you have any doubt about

62
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,960
why

63
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,520
I killed my future husband in such an haste?

64
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,400
Someone's watching us.

65
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,640
Take my cue.

66
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,720
Impossible.

67
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,400
- I saw him with my own eyes...
- Sometimes,

68
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,120
what you see with your own eyes isn't true.

69
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,440
for example,

70
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,160
I always thought that the State Counselor

71
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,000
was loyal to the State of Donglan.

72
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,280
Who knew you'd want to overthrow the regime?

73
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,960
But luckily I was prepared for that.

74
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,880
Cang Xiaoqi.

75
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,240
Cang Xiaoqi.

76
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,280
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,440
You must feel aggrieved this time.

78
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,000
The evidence is so solid,

79
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,720
but you still want to believe me,

80
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,280
I don't feel aggrieved.

81
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,840
This is...

82
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,360
The national treasure of Donglan,

83
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,360
Phoenix Hairpin.

84
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,640
It's also the key for you and me to go back,

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,840
but

86
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,200
I haven't found a way to use it yet.

87
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,240
Go back?

88
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,760
Back to where?

89
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,280
Cang Hanyu,

90
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,480
you and I weren't meant to be in this world.

91
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,160
In our world,

92
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,600
we have a daughter.

93
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,880
I know

94
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,440
what I'm telling you right now

95
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,680
is a little hard to believe.

96
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,440
I believe you.

97
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,920
In fact, from the first time I met you,

98
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,200
I found you inexplicably
familiar and affectionate

99
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,760
as if we'd known each other for a long time.

100
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,760
Xiaoqi,

101
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,280
most of the guards in the palace

102
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,800
are now under Mo Hua's control,

103
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,200
you take the Phoenix Hairpin

104
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,760
and mobilize the troops to the palace.

105
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,480
Okay.

106
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,040
Remember,

107
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,360
you must be there

108
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,880
on the day of my 20th birthday banquet.

109
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,680
Cang Hanyu,

110
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,840
you live, I live.

111
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,520
You die,

112
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,520
I die with you.

113
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,920
Outrageous!

114
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,080
How dare you

115
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,840
treat me like this!

116
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,560
Even if Cang Hanyu isn't dead, so what?

117
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,720
You're already surrounded.

118
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,520
Even if the gods come down,
they can't save you.

119
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,480
Do you hear the hoofbeats?

120
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,960
The reinforcements of Donglan
will be here soon.

121
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,840
Let's see who wins in the end.

122
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,760
Ya!

123
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,380
(Yingrui)

124
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,160
I don't want to listen to your foolish talk.

125
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,840
Give me the Phoenix Hairpin

126
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,080
otherwise

127
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,920
I'll kill everyone in Donglan Palace.

128
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,280
King of Xiling,

129
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:39,960
it seems to me

130
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,200
that they don't

131
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,960
take you seriously.

132
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,760
Give it to me

133
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,480
or not.

134
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,040
The Phoenix Hairpin, it's here with me.
