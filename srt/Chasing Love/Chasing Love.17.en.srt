3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,000
You might as well go get some sleep.

4
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,800
This is too far.

5
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,600
What's wrong with kissing my man?

6
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,000
I'd better get some sleep.

7
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,240
What's going on?

8
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,760
Are you still mad at me?

9
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,680
All I did was kiss you.

10
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,400
How about this,

11
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,920
I let you kiss me.

12
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,120
Leave me alone.

13
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,160
Cang Hanyu,

14
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,720
ask yourself,

15
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,360
do you really hate me that much?

16
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,560
If that's so,

17
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,720
I'll let you go,

18
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,520
and I won't force you anymore.

19
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,960
Cang Xiaoqi,

20
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,480
although we are

21
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,120
in a different time and space,

22
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,640
and we have such different status.

23
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,640
But ask your heart

24
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,320
the past between you and me,

25
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,160
do you really not remember

26
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,680
or feel anything?

27
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,560
Si.

28
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,560
You finally remember.

29
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,680
Princess,

30
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,080
what are you doing?

31
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,560
Princess, Her Majesty has arrived.

32
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,440
Spare me.

33
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,360
Come out.

34
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,680
Your Majesty.

35
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,960
Mother,

36
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,160
what brings you here?

37
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,280
Si,

38
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,280
I've just received an urgent message.

39
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,640
The old King of Xiling
died of a sudden illness.

40
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,480
The First Prince Cang Yunze has taken over.

41
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,160
Who did you just say?

42
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,960
Xiling has always been
a subordinate state of Donglan.

43
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,320
It's nothing to be afraid of.

44
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,760
But this new king has mobilized

45
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,040
a large number of troops to the border
once he took the throne,

46
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,360
it's really strange.

47
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,840
I guess the death of the former King of Xiling

48
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,360
wasn't that simple.

49
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,400
Do you

50
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,720
know something about it?

51
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,640
I'm...

52
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,160
just guessing.

53
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,000
Mother,

54
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,440
you needn't worry too much.

55
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,240
Donglan is a strong country,

56
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,760
and blessed by the Phoenix Hairpin.

57
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,440
I'm sure

58
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,280
it's hard for anyone to be against us.

59
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,360
Looks like my daughter's finally growing up.

60
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,720
I can trust you with Donglan now.

61
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,320
It's just,

62
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,480
you have a terrible eye for men.

63
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,280
Mother,

64
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,840
I really like Cang Hanyu

65
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,440
so I want to marry him.

66
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,160
Even if he's not a prince,

67
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,560
but a commoner,

68
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,560
I'd only want him.

69
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,640
How's it going?

70
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,760
As Your Majesty commanded,

71
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,720
we have made some progress in Donglan.

72
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,760
The man from the portrait
had already appeared,

73
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,160
but

74
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,160
a group of unknown people took him away.

75
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,840
I've sent someone to follow up,

76
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,160
waiting Your Majesty's instructions.

77
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,640
It seems like she really likes me.

78
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,720
Mother,

79
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,280
I really like Cang Hanyu

80
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,720
so I want to marry him.

81
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,440
Even if he's not a prince,

82
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,920
but a commoner,

83
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,920
I'd only want him.

84
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,360
The Princess's lips

85
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,880
were soft

86
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,640
and a bit sweet.

87
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,360
I have to fall asleep,

88
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,360
so I will stop thinking about her.

89
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,920
I open my eyes,

90
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,320
it's like I can see her.

91
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,160
I close my eyes, she's still in my head.

92
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,360
It's driving me crazy.

93
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,160
Cang Xiaoqi,

94
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,520
I know you won't let me down.

95
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,840
Princess,

96
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:12,960
you're pleased?

97
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,160
Yes!

98
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,360
How about you?

99
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,160
Are you willing to be my husband?

100
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,760
Actually...

101
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,360
Actually,

102
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,760
I have no desire to
have any association with royalty.

103
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,040
But there are things

104
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,360
that can't be controlled.

105
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,360
Jun Nansi.

106
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,080
I think I'm falling for you.

107
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,520
Cang Hanyu,

108
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,120
I know we are meant to be together.

109
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,440
I finally don't have to
make you marry me anymore.

110
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,560
The time is coming.

111
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,720
It's time to get ready.

112
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,640
His embroidery and cooking

113
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,840
have improved a lot.

114
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,360
I heard that he can hit a bull's-eye
from a hundred paces on horseback.

115
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,160
I think he's qualified to be Si's husband.

116
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,360
In my opinion, he's not even close.

117
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,160
Mother.

118
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,840
But Si likes him.

119
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,960
Fine, your wedding is scheduled
for the 15th of next month,

120
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,280
along with your 20th birthday banquet.

121
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,840
The Ministry of Rites

122
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,160
has been preparing for years,

123
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,760
they can't wait for it.

124
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,080
Thank you, Mother.

125
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,240
I

126
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,280
appreciate your blessing, Your Majesty.

127
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,960
Mom, you're so beautiful.

128
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,440
How'd you get here?

129
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,640
I came...

130
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,680
Enough.

131
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,240
I'm feeling good today,
and I don't want your smart talking.

132
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,920
I don't understand what you mean.

133
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,720
But I've noticed that

134
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,440
every time you show up,

135
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,760
something happens to Cang Xiaoqi.

136
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,960
So you're here this time...

137
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,880
If you don't listen to me,

138
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,520
then I won't talk to you.

139
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,160
Anyway, Dad and Mom

140
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,080
are lovebirds now,

141
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,560
so I have become redundant.

142
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,560
Maybe the ones
who shouldn't be there will turn up.

143
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,840
Maybe the ones who are supposed to appear
will be gone.

144
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,760
Little phoenix,

145
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,760
