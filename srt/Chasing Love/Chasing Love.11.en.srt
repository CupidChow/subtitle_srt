=Episode 11=

3
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,800
Yiyi,

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,280
how could you die like this?

5
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,600
I can't believe Yiyi

6
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,520
died like that.

7
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,360
Mother,

8
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,680
do you have any idea

9
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,840
who killed her?

10
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,120
I sent someone to check out
Cang Yunze's residence.

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,080
He's long gone.

12
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,320
Isn't Cang Yunze trying to
take the fortune of the family?

13
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,520
Why did he kill Bai Yiyi?

14
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,520
Could it be...?

15
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,720
Yu!

16
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,200
Darn it.

17
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,200
You're so careless.

18
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,360
It never occurred to me

19
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,520
that Cang Yunze might have his memory back.

20
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,040
Si,

21
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,680
you have to be okay.

22
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,400
Cang Yunze,

23
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,040
you just want to get the fortune,

24
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,040
why do you have to kill?

25
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,000
I guess you still don't remember anything.

26
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,000
Nan Si,

27
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,120
the history between us

28
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,920
is much more than you think.

29
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,160
What do you mean?

30
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,120
Soon you'll see.

31
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,520
Si.

32
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:30,880
Cang Yunze.

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,840
Come out!

34
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,840
It is the middle of the day,

35
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,000
Cang Yunze can't possibly
take a hostage out of the house,

36
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:40,880
unless...

37
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,720
Unless what?

38
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,280
Unless he's gone to the forbidden land
of the Cang family.

39
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,520
It seems

40
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,400
that it was the power of this thing

41
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,920
that brought us here.

42
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,040
What's wrong?

43
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,480
Let go of her!

44
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,080
Cang Hanyu!

45
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,120
How dare you!

46
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,360
Cang Hanyu,

47
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,120
I want you to see

48
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,680
Nan Si die before you.

49
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,560
Si.

50
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,560
Whether it's in the past or present,

51
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,800
in my last life or the next,

52
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,520
I, Cang Hanyu,

53
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,600
only love Nan Si in this life.

54
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,280
Cang,

55
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,920
Cang Xiaoqi.

56
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,140
(The State of Donglan)

57
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,160
Dad, I want to go out and play.

58
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,760
Hurry up and do the laundry!

59
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,520
If you don't finish the laundry,
you won't get to eat tonight.

60
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,760
Do you hear me?

61
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,880
Come on, get up.

62
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,320
Let's go.

63
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,600
Be quick.

64
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,840
Your Majesty,

65
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,960
in three months,

66
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,960
the princess will be 20 years old.

67
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,120
According to the ancestral rule,

68
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,000
the heir to the State of Donglan

69
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,680
has to be married before the age of 20

70
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,880
to be eligible to inherit

71
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,600
the throne and the Phoenix Hairpin.

72
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,600
What can I do with her?

73
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,000
The portraits of young talents you sent

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,320
have presented to her.

75
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,280
I told her to make a selection

76
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,680
and she passed out.

77
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,040
It is...

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,880
Chancellors,

79
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,360
that's all for today's meeting.

80
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,440
Si.

81
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,440
Si.

82
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,200
Si.

83
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,440
Si.

84
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,480
Si.

85
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,680
Si.

86
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,280
I'm Cang Xiaoqi.

87
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,440
We live together,

88
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,360
and die together.

89
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,720
Cang Xiaoqi.

90
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,500
(Portrait of Mr. Bai)

91
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:36,300

96
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,280
Looks like the portal of time
has been activated again.

97
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,320
Princess, you're awake!

98
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,880
Where is Mother?

99
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,520
The State Counselor ends his retreat today.

100
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,400
Her Majesty and her husband

101
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,400
must be discussing the marriage of you.

102
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,520
Her Majesty ordered

103
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,560
that you must see the portraits
before you can leave.

104
