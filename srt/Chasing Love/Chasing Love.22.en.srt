Donglan is a powerful country

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,600
which has been oppressing our Xiling
for a long time.

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,760
Now,

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,200
we've been preparing our army for many years.

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,320
This time, we're going to Donglan,

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,720
we must conquer the state of Donglan

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,120
once and for all.

it's almost time.

Today is your 20th birthday banquet.

17
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,800
Her Majesty and the court

18
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,240
are waiting for you in the Great Hall.

19

Okay, I know.

20
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,160
You may leave me now.

Princess,

22
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,320
we'd better leave it after the wedding...

23
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,320
Never mind.

24
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,920
I know you don't have the guts.

25
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,840
I don't know who taught you that.

26
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,400
You become bashful a lot.

Mom, are you going to be an empress?

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,920
You came.

47
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,120
How is it?

48
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,520
Do you like being an empress?

49
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,240
My mentor said

50
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,320
I'm a phoenix that came to earth,

51
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,440
I was born

52
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,440
to be an empress.

53
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,560
But compared with that,

54
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,280
I prefer

55
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,480
to be with Mom and Dad,

56
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,040
never to be separated.

57
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,520
Sweetheart,

58
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,560
If I had a choice,

59
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,320
I'd do whatever it takes to bring you up.

60
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,360
Thank you, Your Majesty.

61
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,440
I'm here to greet Mother

62
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,760
and Father.

63
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,600
Good day.

64
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,800
Si,

65
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,840
it's a special day of celebration
for us and for the chancellors.

66
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,560
Sit down and enjoy yourself.

67
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,000
No need to be so formal.

68
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,120
Yes.

69
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,800
Chancellors,

70
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,920
today is the Princess's birthday.

71
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,920
I will drink and celebrate

72
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,960
with you all.

73
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,520
Thank you, Your Majesty.

74
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,520
Long live the Princess!

75
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,320
I'd

76
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,120
like to propose three toasts to the Princess.

77
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,600
Only three?

78
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,240
Is the State Counselor

79
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,920
looking down on my drinking?

80
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,240
I don't dare to.

81
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,160
Since you don't dare,

82
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,400
you may leave.

83
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,840
Si, do not be rude

84
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,920
when talking to the State Counselor.

85
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,560
Since you're in a bad mood, Princess,

86
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,640
I apologize

87
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,920
for being inappropriate.

88
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,640
I'm leaving right away.

89
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,880
I'll see how long you can be so arrogant.

90
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,160
General Li,

91
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,760
it's almost time.

92
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,800
Take your men to the palace gates now.

93
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,960
When King of Xiling arrives,

94
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,240
open the palace gates immediately.

95
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,400
Yes.

96
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,520
Phoenix Hairpin.

97
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,240
It's the national treasure of Donglan,

98
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,440
Phoenix Hairpin.

99
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,680
Seeing the Phoenix Hairpin
is like seeing Her Majesty in person.

100
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,600
We are at your service.

102

103
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,720
Greetings to the King of  Xiling.

104
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,240
The State Counselor has been waiting for a long time.

105
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,840
Good.

106
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,720
