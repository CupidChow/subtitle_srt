00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,510
Si,

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,920
are you making it hard for me?

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,190
I don't dare to.

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,440
Si, no need to get all tense.

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,920
The search is also to prove his innocence.

8
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,190
I do have a packet of poison on me.

9
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,000
It's called Qianji poison.

10
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,200
But this poison

11
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,710
was given to me
by a servant of the State Counselor.

12
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,430
Nonsense.

13
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,840
I'm the State Counselor of Donglan,

14
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,350
why would I give you poison for no reason?

15
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,320
Because you want to murder Her Majesty.

16
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:48,600
You...

17
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,320
Your Majesty,

18
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,000
a few days ago,

19
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:56,240
the State Counselor
came to me for cooperation,

20
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,470
wanting to assassinate you.

21
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,320
He promised me that when he gets the throne,

22
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:01,110
he would support me

23
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,320
to be the King of Xiling.

24
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:03,960
State Counselor,

25
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,310
is that true?

26
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,230
Your Majesty,

27
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,920
I'm loyal to Your Majesty,

28
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,230
and I'm faithful to Donglan,
I have no second thoughts.

29
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,710
Since he said my servant gave him the poison,

30
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:16,710
let them confront each other face to face.

31
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,710
Your Majesty,

32
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,790
a body has been found
near the Princess's residence.

33
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,350
This was found

34
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,400
on the dead man's body.

35
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:32,700
(Token)

36
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,840
The token of the spy of Xiling.

37
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,480
Is there really a spy?

38
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,120
Your Majesty,

39
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,510
this man is not
the real Seventh Prince of Xiling,

40
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:48,480
he's a spy planted in Donglan by Xiling.

41
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,710
He used to lurk in the Phoenix Academy,

42
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,070
but now he lurks beside the Princess.

43
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,510
This man is evil and ambitious
and he's up to no good.

44
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,710
We must eliminate him.

45
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,640
You're lying.

46
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,710
State Counselor,

47
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,310
it's not an accusation made out of nothing.

48
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,640
Do you have any proof?

49
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,470
Search it.

50
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,120
Yes.

51
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:23,940
(Yu eyes only)

52
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,900
(Yu eyes only)

53
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,300
(Yu eyes only)

54
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,340
(King of Xiling)

55
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,630
Look at this, Si.

56
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,120
Not only does it have
the handwriting of the King of Xiling,

57
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,430
it also has the Seal of Xiling.

58
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,000
How can this be fake?

59
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,500
(King of Xiling)

60
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,590
Mother, it's...

61
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,360
Your Majesty,

62
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,430
a few days ago, I observed the sky at night.

63
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,240
I saw that the Zi Wei star
was shining brightly,

64
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,120
but suddenly
there was a fatal star beside it.

65
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,120
It's an ominous sign
that the head of state will be in trouble.

66
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,280
Who knew it would come true now?

67
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,520
I have to be bold

68
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,120
to ask Your Majesty
to kill this man without mercy.

69
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:17,710
Guards,

70
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:18,910
take him down.

71
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:19,870
Wait.

72
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,430
Mother, Father,

73
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,310
I don't believe he's a spy.

74
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,360
I beg you, Mother,

75
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,280
don't listen to
the one-sided words of a trickster,

76
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,400
find out the truth.

77
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,560
Si,

78
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,080
don't be silly.

79
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,080
No. This man is dangerous.

80
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,120
Princess, you're delicate and priceless,

81
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,870
how can you risk your life?

82
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,190
Your Majesty,

83
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,840
Si is so insistent,

84
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,400
she must have her reasons.

85
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,630
How about this?

86
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,280
Tie this man up

87
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,590
and give him to Si

88
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,680
for a night's interrogation.

89
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,080
It wouldn't be a bad idea.

90
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:54,120
Mother,

91
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,470
he's the husband I chose for myself.

92
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,030
I just want to find out

93
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,240
if I made the right choice or not.

94
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,400
Si, I hope you know

95
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,910
what you're doing.

96
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,280
Don't worry,

97
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,630
I'll do what I say.

98
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,680
If he is really a spy,

99
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,310
I'll kill him myself

100
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,630
as a warning to others.

101
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:17,920
Guards,

102
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,600
tie him up and take him back to
the Princess's residence

103
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,510
Interrogate him harshly.

104
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,310
Princess,

105
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,920
I...

106
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,390
Did I tell you to speak?

107
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,510
I ask you a question,

108
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,120
you answer me.

109
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,680
Are you really a spy?

110
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,120
Don't you believe me?

111
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,390
Have you forgotten

112
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,190
that it was you who made me
marry you the whole time?

113
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,120
From the moment I met you,

114
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,240
have I ever done a single thing against you?

115
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,310
How would I know

116
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,120
if you're just pretending,

117
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,480
playing an act to fool me?

118
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,800
This is how you seduced me.

119
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,120
What a brilliant way!

120
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,600
If you say so,

121
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,430
I have nothing to argue with.

122
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,240
Do you have nothing to argue with

123
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,920
or do you have nothing to say?

124
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,720
You're right.

125
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,920
To a vicious person like you,

126
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,270
I do have nothing to say.

127
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,120
You...

128
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,720
Ridiculous.

129
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,430
It's so ridiculous.

130
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,120
I was blind

131
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,430
to disobey my mother

132
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,680
for an evil thug like you!

133
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,040
I'll kill you by a thousand cuts today.

134
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,630
Bring it on.

135
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,430
You've got some nerve.

136
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,070
Could it be that Cang Hanyu was really

137
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,480
forced to be the Princess's husband?
