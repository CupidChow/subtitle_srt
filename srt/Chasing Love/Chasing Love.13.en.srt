=Episode 13=

3
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,030
Princess.

4
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,320
Princess, bad news.

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,510
He's escaped.

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,870
Escaped?

7
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,920
There are so many of you
and you can't handle him?

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,470
He's too devious.

9
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:34,520
One minute he said he has a stomach ache,

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,520
the next he said he has a headache,

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,750
and then he said he's hungry.

12
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,430
He really is Cang Xiaoqi.

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,790
He's so smart, even with his memory loss.

14
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,240
Let's go find him.

15
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:43,790
Yes.

16
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,760
How's it going? Did you find him?

17
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,280
We haven't found him yet.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,790
What the hell.

19
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,230
He really escaped from us.

20
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,920
Let's look over there.

21
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,590
Yes.

22
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:36,230
You want to catch me?

23
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,350
The imperial physician came today.

24
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:44,230
The cold poison in the body of
the First Prince seems to be clearing up.

25
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,150
Our Prince has had a hard life.

26
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,040
He's had a cold illness since he was a child.

27
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,310
He has relapses from time to time,

28
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,200
lasting from ten days to half a month.

29
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,640
Yeah.

30
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,760
This time, Princess Nan Si of Donglan

31
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,920
is selecting a husband,

32
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,480
and only the First Prince couldn't go
because he was sick.

33
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,790
What did you just say?

34
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,040
Say it again.

35
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,430
How is it?

36
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,400
Cang Xiaoqi,

37
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,360
do you think it's funny?

38
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm telling you,

39
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,120
we are destined for each other.

40
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,150
You can't run away from it.

41
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,910
Destined?

42
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,630
I think you're desperate.

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,800
Stop right there.

44
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,000
What do you want?

45
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,400
Nan Si is selecting a husband.

46
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,590
She must be looking for Cang Hanyu.

47
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,840
Gather a group of men in Donglan

48
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,560
to closely monitor the Princess's every move.

49
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,470
As soon as you find this man,

50
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,680
report to me.

51
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,000
Yes.

52
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,630
Wait a moment.

53
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,630
Anything else I can do?

54
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,960
How is Father?

55
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,680
Your Majesty is in good health.

56
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,400
Spread the word

57
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,840
that the King's in poor health

58
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,150
and he's not long for this world.

59
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:16,960
I will

60
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,520
take care of him myself.

61
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,150
Yes, Your Highness.

62
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,120
Why don't we make a bet?

63
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,310
If you win, I'll let you go,

64
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,310
and never pester you again.

65
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,590
But,

66
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,840
if I win,

67
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,560
you'll come home with me

68
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,710
and you shouldn't run away again.

69
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,190
How do we bet?

70
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,750
Are you sure

71
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,190
you want to play dice with me?

72
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,590
I'll be the banker.

73
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,280
The smallest point wins.

74
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,470
Okay.

75
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,030
You go first.

76
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,240
Ace.

77
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,510
No wonder those two men
from the school gave you a hard time.

78
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,120
Did you earn a lot of money from them?

79
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,070
It's none of your business.

80
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,510
It's your turn.

81
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm the banker.

82
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,510
So, even if you get ace too,

83
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,040
I'm still winning.

84
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,360
No problem.

85
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,070
I win.

86
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:02,800
You're cheating.

87
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,310
Cang Xiaoqi,

88
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,040
bet is bet.

89
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,190
Don't be a rascal.

90
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,240
Is he the one you want to marry?

91
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,560
Yes, Father.

92
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,360
How is he?

93
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,510
Isn't he handsome

94
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,070
and smart?

95
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,480
The perfect match for me.

96
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,000
But I've heard

97
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,240
he's just a lowly servant.

98
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,190
Father,

99
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,950
humble status doesn't determine humble life.

100
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,600
I like him.

101
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,800
I want him to be my husband.

102
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,600
Father, do something.

103
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:52,600
You always know what to do.

104
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,270
I give in to you.

105
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,360
This is something...

106
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,600
we need to plan for.

107
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,430
- I'm not marrying you.
- Be good.

108
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,160
You have no say in this.

109
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,600
Today we are going to choose one of you

110
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,160
to be the husband of the princess.

111
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,160
If you princes have any talents,

112
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,560
please show them to us.

113
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,390
The one who pleases Si

114
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:14,830
will be her husband.

115
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,680
I'm an expert

116
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,920
in embroidery.

117
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:25,600
When we're married,

118
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,680
the princess's dress

119
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,510
will be made by me.

120
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,360
I'm not a genius.

121
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,920
I'm only good at painting.

122
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,120
But this painting is barely satisfactory,

123
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,680
because I couldn't draw a fraction

124
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,870
of the princess's beauty.

125
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,360
Lofty mountains and flowing water
are destined to meet.

126
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,680
Clouds and the moon are meant to be
soul companions.

127
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,190
I hope the Princess and I
will fall for each other.

128
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,430
The Seventh Prince,

129
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,920
what's your talent?

130
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,600
Yes.

131
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,630
I...

132
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,390
I'm good at eating.
