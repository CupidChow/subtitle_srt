3
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,520
Mentor,

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,440
what's going on here?

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,520
Where's Cang Hanyu?

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,600
This is

7
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,520
a long story.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,480
Make it short, please.

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,640
Is money all you can think about?

10
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,760
This is a critical situation,

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,960
and you're asking me for money.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,320
Have you ever seen a princess
with money on her?

13
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,720
Why hasn't the State Counselor
finished his divination?

14
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,320
Don't get anxious. Wait a moment.

15
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,840
Your Majesty.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,760
State Counselor,

17
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,520
where is Si's marital fate?

18
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,320
Your Majesty,

19
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,040
it's a Qian Hexagram.

20
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,880
Based on this divination symbol,

21
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,720
the Qian Hexagram belongs to
the Five Elements of Metal

22
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,640
and specifically refers to
the northwest direction.

23
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,720
However, the Princess's
palace of marriage destiny

24
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,280
is Shen and You.

25
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,920
Therefore, Princess's marital fate

26
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,760
should be in the west.

27
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,040
In the west.

28
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,120
Isn't that Xiling?

29
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,400
I know what to do.

30
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,680
I will order

31
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,400
the King of Xiling to send
several princes here as candidates

32
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,720
for selecting the Princess's husband.

33
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,920
Are you saying

34
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,560
that because of Cang Yunze's
accidental intrusion,

35
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,720
the entire space-time

36
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,320
had a cascading effect

37
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,120
and an uncontrollable situation arose?

38
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,240
Yes.

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,040
How uncontrollable?

40
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,080
Very uncontrollable.

41
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,520
Can't you say something useful?

42
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,520
Maybe the ones
who shouldn't be there will turn up.

43
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,080
Maybe the ones who are supposed to appear
will be gone.

44
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,480
Maybe the karma that's supposed to be on you

45
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,120
will be on someone else.

46
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,520
Be on someone else?

47
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,520
Do you mean

48
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,360
Cang Hanyu is in danger?

49
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,720
I didn't say that.

50
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,920
You said it yourself.

51
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,320
Tell me

52
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,720
how to use the Phoenix Hairpin

53
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,160
to open the portal of time again.

54
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,840
Well...

55
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,320
I can't say that.

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,880
You can't tell

57
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,640
or you just don't know about it?

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,040
With so little you know,

59
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,160
you still want my money?

60
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,280
Godly secrets must not be revealed.

61
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,040
How it will end

62
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,560
is beyond anyone's prediction,

63
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,480
it's up to you.

64
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,320
Work hard at it.

65
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,320
Remember,

66
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,760
people who don't belong in this time and place

67
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,720
will have a red mole on their shoulder.

68
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,320
If the Phoenix Hairpin is destroyed,

69
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,320
you'll die

70
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,040
and you won't be able
to enter another time and space.

71
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,360
The time-travelling power

72
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,960
will be completely invalidated.

73
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,760
Don't go.

74
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,920
You haven't told me where to find Cang Hanyu.

75
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,200
What can I do

76
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,720
to find Cang Xiaoqi?

77
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,440
I got it.

78
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,120
Too ugly.

79
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,720
Too fat. Next.

80
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,880
Too short.

81
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,720
Your Highness.

82
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,120
Have you found him?

83
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,760
Not yet, Princess.

84
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,160
Take a look over there.

85
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,200
Yes.

86
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,600
Sucker.

87
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,960
I told you to get lost.

88
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,960
Are you deaf?

89
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,320
I was cleaning up here
and you guys came and messed it up.

90
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,320
Who should get lost?

91
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,680
If you want to stay, hand over the money.

92
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,480
I have no money.

93
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,400
You...

94
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,920
Stop kicking and stepping on me.
You are so mean.

95
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,920
I found him.

96
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,280
Leave him alone.

97
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,520
Who the hell are you?

98
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,720
Why should I listen to you?

99
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,960
Cang Xiaoqi,

100
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,720
come back with me.

101
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,040
Young lady, you've...

102
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,240
got the wrong guy.

103
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,680
I'm not Cang Xiaoqi.

104
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,920
I'm a busboy at the Phoenix Academy.

105
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,240
My name is Cang Hanyu.

106
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,640
You don't know me?

107
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,120
I'm Nan Si.

108
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,000
Nan Si?

109
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,360
I don't know you.

110
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,240
Oh, no.

111
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,360
Is it his turn

112
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,520
to lose his memory this time?

113
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,200
What are you doing?

114
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,240
I'm not a frivolous man.

115
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,040
My pretty,

116
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,080
I adore you.

117
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,320
Will you be my husband?

118
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,520
Attendants,

119
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,640
take this beauty back to my residence.

120
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,840
What are you doing?

121
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,520
Are you kidnapping me
