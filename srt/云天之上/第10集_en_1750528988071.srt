The Art of War

00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:17,280
Episode hacer

4
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,160
That's my Shuren.

5
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,400
ascal.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Your Highness,

7
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,800
what's the use of the Great Armor?

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,800
Is there a way

9
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,000
to remove the soul of the battle bureau?

10
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,120
Of course there is a way.

11
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,520
But you know my rules.

12
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,320
I'll give you five more times

13
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,040
after you're done.

14
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,160
Okay.

15
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,920
Your Highness, please.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Your Highness,

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'll give you five more times.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Your Highness,

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
there are two souls in the body.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
One is the soul of the battle bureau.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The other is the soul of the battle bureau.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'll separate the soul

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
from the soul of the battle bureau

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and the soul will be gone

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
once I leave.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I need your help

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
to protect the soul of the battle bureau

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and the soul.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Okay.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
No.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I don't have the spirit of my own.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Leave my body now.

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
No.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
No.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I need to be your soul.

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
No.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
No.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
No.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
No.

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
No.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
No.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
No.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
No.

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
No.

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
No.

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
No.

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
What else can I do?

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You must protect Yuan Huo.

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The only way is to find a new magical power for him as soon as possible.

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But the princess' life is so weak and strange.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Now, she's looking for someone.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm afraid it's too late.

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Use the Golden Pill to draw the shape.

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Golden Pill?

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The Golden Pill is the ultimate skill.

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
How can you use it to hide your height?

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You use the Golden Pill to speed up the body.

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You will also make a mistake.

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You will also make a mistake.

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
The soul will be destroyed.

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
From now on, you can only use the magical power when you are close to her.

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
How can you be so quick?

63
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Information about an evil spirit.

64
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,280
I saw hurdle in lower floors.

65
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,120
I'll let you go.

66
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,280
Brother Yun.

67
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,280
Brother Yun.

68
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,840
Brother Yun.

69
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,280
Let's go.

70
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,160
Brother Yun.

71
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,640
Brother Yun, it's you.

72
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,800
I knew you wouldn't leave me.

73
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,040
I haven't seen you for a long time.

74
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,400
I miss you so much.

75
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,680
Why did you come to me now?

76
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,520
I...

77
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,640
An Ning.

78
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,840
Tell me.

79
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,720
What happened these days?

80
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,600
After I woke up...

81
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,240
Xiyuan.

82
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,160
I'm sorry.

83
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,040
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,640
I'm sorry.

85
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,640
He wants to change you again?

86
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,240
Please don't worry.

87
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,440
Once he leaves,

88
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,880
he'll die soon.

89
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,360
By then,

90
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,000
the soul will replace him

91
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,920
and go to the final result.

92
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,520
Princess, you don't have to say that.

93
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,400
He was not good to you those days.

94
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,400
He was killed by the soul.

95
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,160
Prince Huang took him to the ghost market

96
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,040
to help the soul escape.

97
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,400
I didn't expect that

98
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,760
he would leave the soul.

99
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,000
The soul has disappeared

100
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,160
after leaving the body.

101
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,960
He can't find any breath in the secret room.

102
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:05,920
Disappeared?

103
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,080
Then Lin Cang...

104
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,720
let him run away again?

105
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,560
I'm helpless.

106
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,800
Brother Yun.

107
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,640
Brother Yun, don't care about them.

108
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,320
I'll be with you in the future.

109
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,560
I'll take back my body

110
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,560
and go back to you.

111
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,960
I won't be like him.

112
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,280
He'll only humiliate you

113
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,440
and make you angry.

114
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,120
But I love you.

115
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,040
An Ning.

116
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,480
Come.

117
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,240
An Ning.

118
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,240
Who do you think you are?

119
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,440
You're not

120
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,240
worthy of this face.

121
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,960
Brother Yun.

122
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,840
Why did it become like this?

123
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,120
It's for the sake of the soul.

124
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,160
I'm not worthy of this face.

125
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,680
Why?

126
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,680
Don't you like this face?

127
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,440
No.

128
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,560
No.

129
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,600
Brother Yun likes it.

130
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,400
I like it.

131
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:43,960
Your Highness.

132
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,760
An Ning.

133
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,720
Listen.

134
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,520
Go look for An Ning.

135
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,520
How's he now?

136
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,000
He's infuriated.

137
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,120
Just make him wake up.

138
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,680
Use his ointment to Glenn him.

139
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,720
I'll go get ready.

140
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,440
He even took me 100 taels of gold.

141
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,920
He said it was the money and the old money.

142
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,440
That's too cruel.

143
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,360
Why didn't An Ning come back?

144
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,800
I heard that Ling Yun came.

145
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,160
He can only take you away.

146
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,800
He can't take care of you.

147
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,280
Go and check An Ning's body.

148
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,200
Yes.

149
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,820
Leng Geng.

150
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,780
Water, please.

151
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,020
Water.

152
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,600
Water, please.

153
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,600
How did it go?

154
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,920
Your겳 lawyer� well done.

155
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,440
Lingyun took Princess's body away.

156
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,200
Should we find a way to get her back?

157
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:20,920
No.

158
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,760
Kill Lingyun directly.

159
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,880
She will be back.

160
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,680
Okay.

161
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,760
I'll be with you.

162
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,200
Nanzhu, you finally came.

163
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,160
His Highness has been waiting for you for a long time.

164
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,400
Your Highness,

165
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,840
why are you here?

166
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,040
I came to see His Highness.

167
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,600
It's a pity that he drove me out.

168
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,720
He said he has something to discuss with you.

169
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,680
Go inside.

170
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,680
His Highness is here.

171
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,360
Don't worry, Your Highness.

172
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,400
I've already asked people to

173
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,480
follow the Cui Qing Formation of the Cui Dong Xiangyun House.

174
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,320
It's not easy to get rid of

175
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,320
the abandoned building.

176
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,760
Brother Yun.

177
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,040
Oh, no.

178
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,160
I'm in trouble.

179
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,640
Nanzhu.

180
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,520
How is Xiangyun House's opening?

181
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,440
Nanzhu is not with him.

182
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:56,960
It seems that he has taken

183
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,160
Nanzhu's side.

184
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,680
Nanzhu.

185
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,060
More often than not.

186
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,200
I may not kill you,

187
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,460
Where?

188
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,460
I love you.

189
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,040
You're a bad habit.

190
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,240
You're a good fighter.

191
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,120
You killed my parents and Yun Rou.

192
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,240
You even killed the people of Lin.

193
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,120
Today,

194
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,080
I'll punish you for your evil deeds.

195
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,600
I love you so much.

196
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,800
You're like this now.

197
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,720
I'll die in your hands.

198
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,240
I'd rather not regret it.

199
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,600
Don't talk nonsense with her.

200
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,040
Look at me.

201
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,240
Why did you userix juice instead?

202
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,320
Although cure was able to ruins her soul

203
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,800
the Serenity Poison is also mixed.

204
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,280
Don't you have thehu now?

205
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,480
I'm fine.

206
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,640
Fox juice

207
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,260
can completely właśnie did Eden

208
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,320
斷 her soul.

209
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,920
Is it really over?

210
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,920
What happened?

211
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,920
Let's go.

212
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,920

213
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,920

214
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,920

215
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,920

218
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,920
Miss, are you okay?

219
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,920
Miss!

220
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,920
He should be under hypnosis.

221
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,920
But...

222
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,920
Are you feeling better?

223
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:34,920
I'm feeling better.

224
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,920
I...

225
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,920
Are you feeling better?

226
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,920
We should leave this place now.

227
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,920
I've seen him in a long time.

228
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,920
It's really inappropriate to be with the crown prince every day.

229
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,920
Your plan is a little damaged this time.

230
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,920

252
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,920
