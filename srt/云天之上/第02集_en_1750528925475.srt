1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Is this...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
the memory of the past?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
An Ning, are you all right?

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
If you can't change your fate,

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
you will be killed by the one you love,

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and the whole family will be killed.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Don't scare me.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's because I changed my fate.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So, Royal Mother,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
you turned the world around with me,

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and you became the Lian Cang Sect.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
What did you do to the princess?

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
This world is full of murder.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
An Ning,

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I suddenly got nervous.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I was worried about you, Royal Mother.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It seems that you are really close to me.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You don't need to get married.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
If you trust me,

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
you will know that

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
life is full of destiny.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
How can you break it easily?

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You are so mysterious.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You are so hard to get.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Is this not another kind of fate?

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Your Highness, don't worry.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I know that

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
if the princess agrees,

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I will marry Yan

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
and have two countries get married.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
This is a good idea.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's a good idea.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's a good idea.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yes.

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I will marry you.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I will marry you.

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I will marry you.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Your Highness,

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
what do you think?

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Night Immortal,

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,600
you should not come to Yan

42
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,000
and make me suffer.

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Your Highness, you are so sincere.

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I shouldn't have served you.

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I just want to marry the best man

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
in this world.

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I wonder if you are willing to

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
marry the best man in Yan?

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
An Ning,

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
you are so cruel.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You are so hard to get.

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
How can you compete with me?

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Lord Yan,

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I sincerely beg you

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
to marry me.

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I just want to hear the princess' words.

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I wonder if you are willing to

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
marry the best man in Yan.

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yes.

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I will marry you.

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Good.

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Since you want to compete with me for the peace of two countries,

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I will ask you to come to the court.

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
In this competition,

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
no matter the prince is alive or dead,

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
it's none of my business.

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I will do it alone.

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The princess is ready.

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I will arrange it.

70
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Your Highness,

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
the water prison is narrow.

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
In order to prevent you from competing with the princess,

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
we will wait outside.

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Whoever can get out of the water prison

75
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
will be rewarded.

76
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Please.

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Your Highness,

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
the water prison is narrow.

79
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
In order to prevent you from competing with the princess,

80
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
we will wait outside.

81
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
In order to prevent you from competing with the princess,

82
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
we will wait outside.

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
In order to prevent you from competing with the princess,

84
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
we will wait outside.

85
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
In order to prevent you from competing with the princess,

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
we will wait outside.

87
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
In order to prevent you from competing with the princess,

88
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
we will wait outside.

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
In order to prevent you from competing with the princess,

90
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
we will wait outside.

91
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
In order to prevent you from competing with the princess,

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
we will wait outside.

93
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Princess.

94
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Don't come over.

95
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
He dare not to get in.

96
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
This is easy.

97
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Pour the firewood oil in.

98
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Keep it in the carriage.

99
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yun Rourou should prepare for it.

100
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
We have to lure him to the other side of the water prison.

101
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Come again.

102
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Princess.

103
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Come again.

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Princess.

105
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You are too weak.

106
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
This match

107
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
is not necessary anymore.

108
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Princess.

109
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Don't worry.

110
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Ling Zhang, I come to save you.

111
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Ling Zhang,

112
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
wait here.

113
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I come to save you.

114
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Ling Zhang,

115
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
wait here.

116
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Princess.

117
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Go into the water.

118
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Hurry to save His Highness.

119
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Yes.

120
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It won't happen.

121
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Princess,

122
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I am too weak to get in.

123
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Your Highness.

124
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,440
I beg you, Your Highness.

125
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,760
Let go of me.

126
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,240
Your Highness.

127
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,960
Your Highness.

128
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,400
I'm too old.

129
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,920
You'll die if you go in.

130
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,800
Let go of me.

131
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,840
Let go of me.

132
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,920
Let go of me.

133
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,400
I beg you.

134
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,760
Let go of me.

135
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,440
Your Highness.

136
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,000
I beg you.

137
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,320
Let go of me.

138
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,360
I beg you.

139
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,200
Yan Reng.

140
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,240
Am I very hungry?

141
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,720
Your Highness.

142
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,040
Your Highness.

143
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,440
You must understand.

144
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,240
Your Highness.

145
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,560
Your Highness.

146
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,960
I'm very hungry.

147
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,120
Your Highness.

148
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,720
I'm very hungry.

149
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,880
Your Highness.

150
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,840
No.

151
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,840
Your Highness is the most kind person

152
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,280
in the way I'm proud of.

153
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,840
I want to be a good person, too.

154
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,760
But I don't want to die.

155
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,680
You're not worth it.

156
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,920
If I was in attendance

157
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,200
I wouldn't have talent.

158
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,160
Your Highness.

159
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,400
If you didn't do it,

160
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,000
you and I

161
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,280
would all die.

162
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,000
Your Highness.

163
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,520
Your Highness.

164
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,920
Your Highness!

165
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,960
Don't kill me.

166
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,920
Don't kill me.

167
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,240
Don't kill me.

168
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,560
Don't kill me.

169
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,360
Don't kill me.

170
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,120
You are a human.

171
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,640
You are a human.

172
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,800
I'm not human.

173
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,800
How dare you kill me?

174
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,240
Are you afraid?

175
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,080
Are you afraid

176
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,960
that you will kill me?

177
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,960
You are not dead.

178
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,800
I'm not dead.

179
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,320
You are disappointed?

180
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,800
What's going on?

181
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,400
I wanted to save you that day.

182
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,440
But the fire was too big.

183
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,280
Look, I was hurt.

184
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,040
Does it hurt?

185
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:10,960
It hurts.

186
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It hurts.

187
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,200
It hurts.

188
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,800
You are hurt because you saved me.

189
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,280
It seems

190
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,480
you are deeply in love with me.

191
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,280
When will we get married?

192
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,640
When will we make a promise?

193
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,560
Well...

194
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,080
I'm sure

195
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,880
you still want to ask my parents.

196
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,400
I told you not to be a nuisance.

197
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,880
The fire in the water

198
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,280
can't survive the scene.

199
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,640
There are only Yan Kingdom

200
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,080
If you ask me

201
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,120
how did you find out

202
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,840
and can't think of

203
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,960
makinguluos in two countries?

204
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,520
First Prince,

205
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,080
Your Highness.

206
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,880
Were you trying to hide something with me?

207
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,720
I-I just wanted to talk to you today.

208
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,800
Is that so good?

209
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,600
Princess!

210
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,560
Well,

211
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,240
ирован Lords don't work here.

212
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,520
Won't they die?

213
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,400
Yes.

214
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,360
Central emblems in Yan'san are damaged.

215
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,720
They can't burn her alive!

216
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,840
There must be something wrong with his Shine Enzyme.

217
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,040
Maybe...

218
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:50,040
This Lingsang is out of the world.

219
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,640
But I've never heard of

220
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,440
a place where he's common.

221
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,240
If he's not a mortal,

222
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,440
would he be a immortal?

223
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,840
Immortal?

224
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:10,440
Is that kind of person like God?

225
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,040
If that's the case,

226
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,540
I can definitely not know his name.

227
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,580
A Noble Lord's Sacrifice is at the golden zone

228
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,800
but Place fout myself from one's old household.

229
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,880
Your Majesty, your judgement isagtήAret,

230
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,880
What's the point?

231
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,200
Guike must be a traitor.

232
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,040
It's not the right time.

233
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,640
Everyone says fate is predestined.

234
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,440
But I don't want to repeat it.

235
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,840
In this life,

236
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,280
I just want to live well.

237
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,080
Life and death are predestined.

238
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,880
You and I are mortal.

239
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,880
Don't take the ball.

240
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,280
If I take the ball,

241
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,880
I will be the one to take the ball.

242
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,880
Guiyan Luo is a man of fate.

243
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,280
I don't care if Guike wants to be your god.

244
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,280
But I can't break the rules of Guiyan Luo.

245
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,880
Lin Cang.

246
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,280
He?

247
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,080
The disciple of Yun Yin Xian Zong.

248
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,880
That person is not very good.

249
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,680
Three times.

250
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,080
It's not because of this.

251
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,880
Yun Yin Xian Zong is a group of scoundrels.

252
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,080
So he has a way in the defense.

253
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,080
Then...

254
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,280
What can I do?

255
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,880
Do you know each other?

256
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,280
Yes.

257
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,080
I have a heavenly magic.

258
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,680
It's called blood and sand.

259
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,680
It can break the rule of all gods.

260
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,080
But only in this world,

261
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,080
the red-and-red forest can be taken down.

262
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,280
Okay.

263
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,680
I will bring him here.

264
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,480
He is the immortal.

265
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,880
We will make a move in advance.

266
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,880
He will find out that I have a good formation.

267
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,080
In the meantime, I will let people prepare well in advance.

268
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,080
As long as you leave the formation,

269
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,480
we will be able to pass the magic.

270
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,680
Keep it well.

271
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,680
The formation is very difficult.

272
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,880
If the formation is not ready,

273
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,280
we can only use human blood to attack the formation.

274
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,680
Blood formation needs to be attacked by the one with the blood blood.

275
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,680
It's very easy to defeat the enemy.

276
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,680
Tomorrow, at ten o'clock,

277
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,680
I will send someone to attack the forest.

278
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,880
Let's go.

279
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,080
The princess said that the queen is real.

280
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,280
Right?

281
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,280
Do you believe me?

282
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,480
I don't know why it's like this.

283
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,480
But I believe you.

284
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,080
Okay, Yunrong.

285
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,880
It's okay.

286
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,280
As long as you solve the forest,

287
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,280
it's okay.

288
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,280
I will do it.

289
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,280
I will do it.

290
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,280
I will do it.

291
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,280
I will do it.

292
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,280
I will do it.

293
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,280
I will do it.

294
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,280
I will do it.

295
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,280
It's okay.

296
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,480
It's almost dawn.

297
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,480
We have to go back.

298
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,480
By the way,

299
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,480
remember to help me with your wedding book.

300
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,480
I will use it to comfort the forest.

301
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,480
Jiuhuo.

302
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,680
Let's go.

303
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,280
But he seems to be still alive.

304
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,280
He is lying in this place.

305
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,280
Maybe he has a big problem.

306
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,280
We have to be careful.

307
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,680
Don't get in the way.

308
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,680
Let's go.

309
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,280
Yunrong, I told you.

310
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,280
Don't step on the wild flowers on the road.

311
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,680
We can't cut them.

312
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,280
Otherwise, we will be in trouble.

313
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,680
We will be killed by the king.

314
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,680
Yunrong, come here and help us.

315
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,280
Princess, aren't we going to find the prince?

316
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,280
It's hard to say.

317
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,280
I dream of a few moments.

318
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:35,280
The fireworks of the past.

319
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:41,280
The years of the past are like stars.

320
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,280
The lock of the empty fate.

321
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,280
Tears are in my eyes.

322
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,280
I don't want to fall.

323
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,280
This world will be destroyed.

324
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,280
Only you and me.

325
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:59,280
I will be with you.

326
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,280
The fate is in the wrong.

327
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,280
The clouds and the sand.

328
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,280
The wings are in the wrong.

329
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,280
The days are in the wrong.

330
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,280
The world is in the wrong.

331
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,280
The world is in the wrong.

332
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,280
The world is in the wrong.

333
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,280
The world is in the wrong.

334
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,280
Only you and me.
