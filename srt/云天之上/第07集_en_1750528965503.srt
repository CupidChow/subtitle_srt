1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,060
The nostalgia can go beyond the proof."

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:22,760
The

3
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,540
life you have,

4
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,600
is everything downloaded by the man you love,

5
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,560
Maybe they gotta die in the end

6
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,780
The best way to heal

7
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,200
is to 240 or 40 bunları

8
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:57,560
You believed

9
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,560
You are the most precious thing in the world.

10
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,560
Have you ever done anything that you have done wrong to me?

11
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,560
You are my wife.

12
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,560
How could I do anything that I have done wrong to you?

13
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,560
You shouldn't have let me down.

14
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,560
You are my wife.

15
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,560
I changed my mind.

16
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,560
I lost.

17
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,560
The End

18
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,560
Is this why you are still afraid of me?

19
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,560
You want to kill me?

20
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,560
Is it because you promised me that you won't see me?

21
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,560
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,560
This is not your fault.

23
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,560
I thought you would be fine if you left.

24
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,560
But I didn't expect that

25
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,560
you are going to kill me.

26
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,560
It's Ling Yun.

27
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,560
The reason Ling Yun is here today

28
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,560
is because she can seduce one another's daughter

29
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,560
and let them risk everything to her.

30
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,560
Like Ling Yun,

31
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,560
in the painting,

32
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,560
it's called the main light ring.

33
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,560
She saved you first.

34
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,560
She is a little bit more serious.

35
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,560
Thank you.

36
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,560
No need to thank.

37
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,560
Just thank her.

38
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,560
She is even more scared of you.

39
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,560
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,560
What is the main light ring you mentioned just now?

41
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,560
What does it mean?

42
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,560
The main light ring is like a god's pillar

43
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,560
no matter what you do.

44
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,560
Even if you are a sword or a cliff,

45
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,560
you won't be able to die.

46
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,560
No wonder

47
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,560
I couldn't kill Yanshan last time.

48
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,560
This time, I couldn't kill Ling Yun.

49
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,560
If she is the main light ring,

50
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,560
I will make another role in the painting.

51
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,560
The anti-fans.

52
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,560
What is anti-fans?

53
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,560
Anti-fans are the ones who are against the main light ring.

54
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,560
The only one who is against the main light ring is the anti-fans.

55
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,560
And the anti-fans will die because of all kinds of reasons.

56
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,560
According to what you said,

57
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,560
as long as you follow the main light ring, you can survive.

58
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,560
That's not the point.

59
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,560
The main light ring is not a power.

60
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,560
She can't do anything.

61
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,560
What is it?

62
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,560
For example, the main light ring doesn't like the main light ring.

63
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,560
The main light ring can't enter the story line.

64
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,560
All these problems will be solved.

65
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,560
Since we can't kill Ling Yun directly,

66
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,560
we should try another way.

67
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,560
Are you looking for the account book of Xiangyuan House?

68
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,560
How do you know?

69
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,560
Your Highness,

70
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,560
there is a trace of the cultivator on the building.

71
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,560
Is it the cultivator?

72
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,560
It seems that the current of the cultivator is not like the prince.

73
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,560
I have left the ten-spice gold lock on the account book.

74
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,560
No one can open it.

75
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,560
Please don't let anyone find the account book.

76
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,560
Ten-spice gold lock.

77
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,560
It was created by me, Ling Yunluo.

78
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,560
I'm not a good person in this matter.

79
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,560
But I know what I'm saying.

80
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,560
I can help you break the account book.

81
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,560
I and Your Highness

82
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,560
are going to Xiangyun House to find the account book.

83
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,560
We will record the crime of the prince

84
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,560
using Xiangyun House to harm innocent women

85
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,560
and insult the court.

86
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,560
It's all because of the power.

87
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,560
Thank you, Your Highness.

88
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,560
I said I was useful.

89
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,560
I didn't lie to you.

90
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,560
That is...

91
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,560
what happened.

92
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,560
It's late.

93
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,560
How can you break the account book

94
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,560
as soon as you are taught?

95
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,560
Go to the account book.

96
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,560
You should go to the plot early.

97
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,560
You should go home early to sleep.

98
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,560
I only have one bed.

99
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,560
I can't keep you guys.

100
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,560
Besides, I haven't finished reading my book.

101
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,560
I'm going to the account book.

102
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,560
You should rest.

103
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,560
The break time is very fast.

104
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,560
It's very useful.

105
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,560
You should not use the magic in the future.

106
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,560
Okay.

107
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,560
This is your room in the future.

108
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,560
What do you need?

109
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,560
Tell me.

110
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,560
I came to the Mansion of the Prince of Cangping.

111
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,560
It seems

112
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,560
that the picture I see can be changed.

113
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,560
If I can have this,

114
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,560
I can change the future's prediction ability.

115
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,560
Can you hear me?

116
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,560
Chi Xiao,

117
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,560
do you know how to swim?

118
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,560
Yes.

119
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,560
I swim very fast.

120
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,560
I come to the garden every year.

121
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,560
Then take me to the garden.

122
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,560
Here we are.

123
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,560
But it's raining this year.

124
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,560
The rest are small.

125
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,560
What are you doing?

126
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,560
Please forgive me.

127
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,560
Please.

128
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,560
If I haven't come up

129
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,560
after the half-baked box,

130
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,560
thank you for letting me come up.

131
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,560
If the time is not up,

132
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,560
no matter how I fight,

133
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,560
don't care about it.

134
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,560
No.

135
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,560
The car is coming in.

136
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,560
I want to be a winner.

137
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,560
I also want to be a winner.

138
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,940
Empress!

139
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,860
Your Majesty!

140
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,220
Imperial Affissent!

141
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,640
Imperial Aff possono fare di��o.

142
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,980
Imperial Her candorannya èo noi.

143
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,420
Er Yue Dependente t dropped the sword against his back,

144
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,640
it's my puppy that has the best stone,

145
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,700
wrong on this little jet,

146
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:48,100
you p

147
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,140
Your Highness, who is worried?

148
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,700
I'm sorry.

149
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,260
I'm sorry.

150
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,380
I'm sorry.

151
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:26,700
I'm sorry.

152
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,580
I'm sorry.

153
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,820
I'm sorry.

154
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,780
I'm sorry.

155
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:38,380
I'm sorry.

156
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,540
I'm sorry.

157
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:46,060
I'm sorry.

158
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,580
Who has been

159
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,540
wandering the world for thousands of years?

160
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,460
You and I,

161
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,340
we are in the same world.

162
00:10:54,340 --> 00:11:01,500
We are in the same world.

163
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,060
If you really want to die,

164
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,900
why did I have to save you?

165
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,380
You are so light-hearted.

166
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,140
Do you feel sorry for me?

167
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:14,820
I...

168
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:18,100
The princess I know

169
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,700
is determined and determined.

170
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,780
She doesn't need to be so hard-working.

171
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:27,900
She is not a coward who wants to break the sword.

172
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:43,300
Does it still hurt?

173
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,460
No matter how hard I try,

174
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,420
I will always be able to do it.

175
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:51,780
I have already taken back the book.

176
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,900
There will always be a way.

177
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,820
I...

178
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,780
I didn't want to die.

179
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,140
Really?

180
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,860
Of course.

181
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,100
I just want to try

182
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,220
if I can see a new picture.

183
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,220
What picture?

184
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,780
I...

185
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,980
I didn't see anything.

186
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,700
It's okay.

187
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:33,380
But don't take your own life anymore.

188
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:36,460
I can't always see it in time.

189
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:40,340
That's right. Why are you back so soon?

190
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,300
I...

191
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,660
I heard you call my name.

192
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,740
I...

193
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,780
I...

194
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,180
Did I call you?

195
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,020
I don't remember.

196
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:01,020
Maybe it's because we were together last night.

197
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:04,020
That's why we were able to win.

198
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,620
But this is a reminder.

199
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,620
This is Ling Yanzhou.

200
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,540
If you encounter any danger again,

201
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,060
remember to call my name.

202
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,780
I won't be able to do it.

203
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,060
Okay.

204
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:41,820
Ling Xia多少 Already

205
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,820
gate ist

206
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,360
是

207
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,220
Why are you

208
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,440
Actually, you may need to do something.

209
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,780
I know you still expect from a strange person.

210
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:04,100
Although you had not rescued her yet,

211
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,720
she has course and started to worry

212
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,400
about you.

213
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,040
That's not possible.

214
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,040
I'll kill you!

215
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,040
He can actually hurt me.

216
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,040
As long as you admit your mistake to me,

217
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,040
I can let you go.

218
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:28,040
Let you go back to the day when you were in prison.

219
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,040
I'll tell you the truth.

220
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,040
I'll tell you the truth.

221
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,040
It's strange to say that

222
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,040
they are all so obedient.

223
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,040
But I...

224
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,040
I just like the way you look like a married woman.

225
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,040
Your Highness.

226
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,040
Where's the book?
