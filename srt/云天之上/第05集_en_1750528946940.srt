1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,400
But let the Principal capital龍

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,800
Your Highness, wake up!

3
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,600
If you don't wake up,

4
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,680
the Yan State will be destroyed!

5
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,800
Your Highness, wake up!

6
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,920
Wake up!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,880
Your Highness.

8
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,480
Yirong!

9
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,120
Yirong!

10
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,920
Yirong!

11
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,160
Your Highness, you're back.

12
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,560
I'm back!

13
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,560
I'm back!

14
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,600
Hang in there!

15
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,920
I'll take you to the doctor!

16
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,280
I'll take you to the doctor!

17
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,240
Your Highness.

18
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,160
You can't get up.

19
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,400
It's not my fault.

20
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,840
It's not my fault.

21
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,480
It's my fault.

22
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,320
It's not your fault.

23
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,320
Yirong!

24
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,720
Yirong!

25
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,800
Yirong!

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,880
Yirong!

27
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:32,160
Yirong!

28
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,880
I'm going to kill you!

29
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,600
I'm going to kill you!

30
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,720
All this is

31
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,400
all because of you!

32
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,360
You can't kill Yirong!

33
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,160
You killed Lingyun,

34
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,520
you let the people of the country go to kill the Yan State.

35
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,920
You killed Yirong,

36
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,800
and you killed my father!

37
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,880
You...

38
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,560
You knew I liked Yirong.

39
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,200
You forced us to kill him.

40
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,040
You forced us to kill him.

41
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,400
You ruined the love in the man's mouth,

42
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,760
and killed Yirong.

43
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,120
You ruined the Yan State.

44
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,240
I killed you!

45
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,240
I killed you!

46
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,240
Father.

47
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,240
Father.

48
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,240
Father.

49
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,240
Father.

50
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,240
Father.

51
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,240
Father.

52
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,240
Father.

53
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,240
Father.

54
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,240
Father.

55
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,240
Father.

56
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,320
Father.

57
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,320
Mother.

58
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,520
Where's my power?

59
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,120
Your martial arts have been destroyed.

60
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,120
Hurry up.

61
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,120
Don't move.

62
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,120
Lingyun.

63
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,120
Lingyun.

64
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,120
Let me go first.

65
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,120
Mother, okay?

66
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,120
What do you want me to do?

67
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,120
Let's talk about it.

68
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,120
Let's...

69
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,800
Ning.

70
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,440
It's not your fault.

71
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,280
They didn't let us be together.

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,800
I let them go.

73
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
I...

74
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,000
How can I let them go?

75
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,760
I...

76
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,760
I...

77
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,480
I'm being mean.

78
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,480
They're my parents.

79
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
Let them go, Yirong.

80
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,400
Lingyun.

81
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,400
But if we let them go,

82
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,400
we can't be together.

83
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,400
I'll persuade them.

84
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,400
I'll persuade them.

85
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,400
They'll definitely agree.

86
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,400
Okay?

87
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,400
Okay?

88
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,400
But I don't need them to agree now.

89
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,400
Now the whole Yan State is in my hands.

90
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,400
As long as I kill them,

91
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,400
you and the whole Yan State

92
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,400
will be alone.

93
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,400
What do you want me to do?

94
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,400
Guards.

95
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,400
Call the police.

96
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,400
Yes.

97
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,720
No!

98
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,600
No!

99
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,600
No!

100
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,760
No!

101
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,560
No!

102
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,560
No!

103
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,040
Let me go!

104
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,400
Let me go!

105
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,400
Father!

106
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,720
Father!

107
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,160
Father!

108
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,680
Father!

109
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,960
Let me go!

110
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,240
An Ning.

111
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,600
From now on,

112
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,120
I will be the one who loves you the most.

113
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,640
I will protect you

114
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,640
and the whole Yan State.

115
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,880
Yan,

116
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm going to kill you.

117
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,080
I'm going to kill you!

118
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,760
Those words you just said

119
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,720
can't be put on your hands.

120
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,400
If you can be a good master in the future,

121
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,280
I can think about

122
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,400
letting you

123
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,360
let you

124
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,080
do what I want.

125
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,720
Father!

126
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,720
Father!

127
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,520
Father!

128
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,000
You disappoint me!

129
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Father!

130
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,840
Father!

131
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,480
Father!

132
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,400
Why?

133
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,400
Why?

134
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,400
Why?

135
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,400
What did I do?

136
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,400
Why did you do this to me?

137
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,400
Why did you destroy everything of us?

138
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,400
Why?

139
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,400
An Ning, you're too tired.

140
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,400
You should sleep.

141
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,400
It won't hurt if you sleep.

142
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,400
From now on, you are me.

143
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,400
I am you.

144
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,400
Sleep.

145
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,400
Sleep.

146
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,400
I will never become you.

147
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,400
And I will kill Ling Yun.

148
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,400
What are you doing?

149
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,400
He is my trusted man.

150
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,400
I will marry him.

151
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,400
Ling Yun.

152
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,400
Ling Yun, don't leave me.

153
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,400
I will do what you want.

154
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,400
You changed your mind?

155
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,400
I figured it out.

156
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,400
But I have one more thing to tell you.

157
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,400
What?

158
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,400
Ling Yun.

159
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,400
Nan Chu.

160
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,400
I want him to be a useless man.

161
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,400
Your Highness, something bad happened.

162
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,400
I went to the palace to see the Yan State.

163
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,400
What happened?

164
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,400
Ling Yun was killed.

165
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,400
Why did it happen?

166
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,400
The princess gave Ling Yun the tiger suit.

167
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,400
She asked Ling Yun to lead the troops to attack the Yan State.

168
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,400
Yan State.

169
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,400
Mother.

170
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,400
Mother, what happened?

171
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,400
Wake up, mother.

172
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,400
You and I are the pitiful people of the Yuan tribe.

173
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,400
Your Highness.

174
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,400
Let's go.

175
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,400
The soul of the Yan State.

176
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,400
Your Highness.

177
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,400
You are so cruel.

178
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,400
You are going to rebel.

179
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:19,400
The effect of the Yan State is not what they want.

180
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,400
Congratulations, Your Highness.

181
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,400
You are the only god in the world.

182
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,400
Thank you for your help.

183
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,400
If you didn't take the lives of the people,

184
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:52,400
and gave all the good things in the world to me,

185
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,400
I would have been a burden to you.

186
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,400
I will not let you go.

187
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,400
I will not let you go.

188
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,400
I will not let you go.

189
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,400
I will not let you go.

190
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,400
I will not let you go.

191
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,400
As long as you are happy,

192
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,400
you will know everything that I do.

193
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,400
You have changed the person who ordered you to live in Luanning

194
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,400
into the Ling Yun of the Wu Ming Clan.

195
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,400
You really surprised me.

196
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,400
Ling Cang is just a pawn to confuse Luanning.

197
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,400
When Ling Yun is born,

198
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,400
the new Yan An Ning will also appear.

199
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,400
She will fall in love with Ling Yun completely.

200
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,400
And she is willing to give out all her power.

201
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,400
The whole world and the throne are all in her hands.

202
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,400
What about after that?

203
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,400
She will die for her.

204
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,400
She will die because of her.

205
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,400
But she is a little depressed.

206
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,400
She will let Ling Yun use the world.

207
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,400
She will love and save the life.

208
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,400
Okay.

209
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,400
This world is really high.

210
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,400
I can't bear to live for Luanning.

211
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,400
The love story that is spread all over the world

212
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,400
is mostly about women.

213
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,400
They risk everything they have.

214
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,400
They are willing to sacrifice for love.

215
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,400
They will save their beloved ones.

216
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,400
Your Highness.

217
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,400
The princess of Yan State

218
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,400
clearly didn't put you in her eyes.

219
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,400
Why don't you just kill her?

220
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,400
An Ning.

221
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,400
How does it feel to be so depressed?

222
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,400
An Ning.

223
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,400
You are so tired.

224
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,400
As long as you let me out,

225
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,400
I can change everything.

226
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,400
Ling Yun loves me so much.

227
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,400
He will forgive us.

228
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,400
I will let you go.

229
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,400
I will let you go.

230
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,400
I will let you go.

231
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,400
I will let you go.

232
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,400
I will let you go.

233
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,400
I will let you go.

234
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,400
I will let you go.

235
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,400
Now,

236
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,400
you are still obsessed with Bu.

237
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,400
If he really loves you,

238
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,400
how could he hurt you?

239
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,400
How could he make you fall in love with the princess?

240
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,400
You don't understand

241
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,400
what real love is.

242
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,400
You don't understand my love for Ling Yun.

243
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,400
I was born for him.

244
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,400
I will love him.

245
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,400
I will protect him.

246
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,400
I will live to the death.

247
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,400
Everyone in this world

248
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,400
is destined to be good.

249
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,400
And your fate

250
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,400
is to give everything to the man you love.

251
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,400
You will be killed in the end.

252
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,400
And this man

253
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,400
has lost everything in his life.

254
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,400
The only way to change him

255
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,400
is to kill him first.

256
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,400
I thought

257
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,400
he was still the one who wanted to kill me.

258
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,400
But now,

259
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,400
this man is actually Ling Yun.

260
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,400
He is like a switch in the painting.

261
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,400
He should be dead.

262
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,400
He has always been Ling Yun.

263
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,400
Ling Yun.

264
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,400
I am the one who is destined to be good.

265
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,400
And your fate

266
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,400
is to give everything to the man you love.

267
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,400
You will be killed in the end.

268
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,400
And your fate

269
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,400
is to give everything to the man you love.

270
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,400
You will be killed in the end.

271
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,400
And your fate

272
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,400
is to give everything to the man you love.

273
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,400
You will be killed in the end.

274
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,400
And your fate

275
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,400
is to give everything to the man you love.

276
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,400
You will be killed in the end.

277
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,400
And your fate

278
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,400
is to give everything to the man you love.

279
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,400
You will be killed in the end.

280
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,400
And your fate

281
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,400
is to give everything to the man you love.

282
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,400
You will be killed in the end.

283
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,400
And your fate

284
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,400
is to give everything to the man you love.

285
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,400
You will be killed in the end.

286
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,400
And your fate

287
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:18,400
is to give everything to the man you love.

288
