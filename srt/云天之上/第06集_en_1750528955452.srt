1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
così

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:55,940
agreements

3
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:56,940
continue

4
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,400
Damn them.

5
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:09,960
Someone who could use this arrow to impact the world

6
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,840
will be 투

7
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,160
Shi

8
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:21,320
My luck

9
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,440
My

10
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,720
ô

11
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,960
Please let me try.

12
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,840
I won't give you a chance.

13
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,600
If you can really survive here.

14
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,880
Your Highness, long time no see.

15
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,440
You are really a rare guest.

16
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,320
The mansion is so lively.

17
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,760
As your brother,

18
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,520
you must come to Pengcheng for the crown prince.

19
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,040
Why do you want to stop shooting?

20
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,960
I haven't shot for a long time.

21
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,480
I don't know if I have a chance.

22
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,360
So,

23
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,760
I want to try.

24
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,400
So, you are ill.

25
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,880
Well done!

26
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,720
You won.

27
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,120
Will you give me some golden eagle?

28
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,640
Wait.

29
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,520
Brother Huang is really good at archery.

30
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,160
If you really shot this Anning

31
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,600
in the first sight,

32
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,680
what else can we play then?

33
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,760
Isn't that what you want to do then?

34
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,760
Your Highness, please.

35
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:30,000
vegetables

36
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,200
Excuse me,

37
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,340
it's time to protect you.

38
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,320
Jiang nature is also good

39
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:49,100
Qi will attack

40
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,280
I...

41
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,480
Don't be in 가운데

42
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,940
Li Jing

43
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,280
I want Li Liang

44
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,580
Please

45
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,580
Red Brother

46
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,620
I think your想

47
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,580
is that you think it is good

48
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,660
My lord

49
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,660
I am sorry that I have a lot of people.

50
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,660
I can't do anything about it.

51
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,660
I fear that the rumors about the outside world

52
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,660
and the royal family's cruelty

53
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,660
will be destroyed by the gods.

54
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,660
He is just a servant

55
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,660
who cares about his life.

56
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,660
If that is the case,

57
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,660
please allow the emperor to serve me.

58
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,660
If so,

59
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,660
please allow the emperor to take care of me

60
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,660
and take me with him

61
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,660
to the bottom of my heart.

62
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,660
This princess is so mean to him.

63
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,660
She has been a sister for eight lives.

64
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,660
The prince is not like the crown prince.

65
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,660
He is not good to him.

66
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,660
He is not good to me.

67
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,660
He is a woman.

68
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,660
Since he is not good to me,

69
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,660
why can't he be a consort?

70
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,660
Could it be that

71
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,660
you have been so affectionate to him?

72
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,660
What nonsense are you talking about?

73
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,660
Yes, yes, yes.

74
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,660
At the Yan State Hall,

75
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,660
the emperor said that

76
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,660
he would protect him for the rest of his life.

77
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,660
Then everything about the love

78
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,660
is the same now.

79
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,660
Shut up!

80
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,660
The emperor is not willing to take him back.

81
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:42,660
Even if he loves him,

82
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,660
I am just afraid that I will be cursed

83
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,660
and come to take back my life.

84
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,660
This is normal.

85
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,660
Brother Crown Prince,

86
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,660
do you really like that princess?

87
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,660
Crown Prince,

88
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,660
Crown Prince,

89
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,660
Crown Prince,

90
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,660
why did you say that he is a consort?

91
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,660
Why did you say that?

92
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,660
Shut up!

93
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,660
He is just a consort.

94
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,660
If you want to marry him,

95
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,660
you can take him back.

96
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,660
Thank you, Crown Prince.

97
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,660
I saw the picture.

98
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,660
Nothing happened.

99
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,660
Stop looking.

100
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,660
Save him.

101
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,660
What is this night?

102
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,660
The female master is killed by the disaster.

103
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,660
She is about to be born.

104
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,660
She is so mad.

105
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,660
She can't die.

106
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,660
The surface is covered with skin.

107
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,660
It's good to have a good skin.

108
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,660
You need to take care of your hands and feet.

109
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,660
You can recover your daily routine.

110
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,660
But you can't practice martial arts in the future.

111
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,660
You are a consort.

112
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,660
Wait.

113
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,660
She is so weak.

114
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,660
She has another person in her body.

115
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,660
She really thinks I am a consort.

116
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,660
Is she really a consort?

117
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,660
I will take her with me today.

118
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,660
Stop talking.

119
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,660
There is nothing to explain.

120
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,660
I won't tell her.

121
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,660
I will marry her.

122
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,660
I won't leave.

123
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,660
I want to marry her.

124
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,660
I thought she was playing the game.

125
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,660
No wonder she is like a person.

126
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,660
Who is this girl?

127
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,660
She is a host in the painting.

128
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,660
Princess Ying. Yan An Ning.

129
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,660
You are the host.

130
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,660
You are the one who needs to find the magic tree.

131
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,660
Magic tree?

132
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,660
No wonder you are going to the crown prince's mansion.

133
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,660
The body is double-dressed.

134
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,660
Do you have a solution?

135
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,660
If you put it in the painting,

136
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,660
only one of you can survive.

137
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,660
I am kidding.

138
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,660
I have never seen this kind of situation before.

139
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,660
I will give you a little treasure.

140
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,660
See if you have a solution.

141
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,660
Why are you standing there?

142
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,660
Hurry up.

143
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,660
I will use the magic to get her hand to the mirror.

144
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,660
It will hurt.

145
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,660
Hurry up.

146
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,660
I will go.

147
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,660
Yan An Ning.

148
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,660
I am sorry.

149
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,660
I am sorry.

150
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,660
What are you doing?

151
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,660
I am taking the medicine.

152
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,660
I can see so many wounds.

153
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,660
I don't know what it looks like on my body.

154
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,660
Then you use the magic tree.

155
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,660
Do you think I don't want to?

156
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,660
I am not a magician.

157
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:00,660
I have no way.

158
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,660
Besides, she is on the skin.

159
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,660
Yang Yang is good.

160
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,660
Wait.

161
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:06,660
Come on.

162
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,660
Let's go out first.

163
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,660
It is not on my body.

164
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,660
Which magician did this?

165
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,660
Why didn't you kill her?

166
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,660
Your Highness, take the medicine.

167
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,660
No.

168
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,660
The fire and the magic tree need to burn this person to save me.

169
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,660
Why do you have a princess?

170
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,660
Your Highness.

171
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,660
Why do you have so many wounds?

172
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,660
It hurts.

173
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,660
Your Highness.

174
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,660
Do you feel better?

175
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,660
Thank you for saving me.

176
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:58,660
I used to treat you like that.

177
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,660
Is it because of your inner soul?

178
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,660
How do you know?

179
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,660
When I saved you,

180
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,660
I used the magic tree to see it.

181
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,660
So,

182
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,660
you can save me?

183
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,660
Yes.

184
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,660
The reason I am going through all this

185
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,660
is because of Tian Ming.

186
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,660
He wants me to love Lin Yue,

187
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,660
to give him everything,

188
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,660
and then he will kill me.

189
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,660
What do you mean?

190
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,660
Your Highness.

191
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,660
Take a look at my body.

192
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,660
I am so happy.

193
