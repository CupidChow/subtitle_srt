The Long Ballad

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Episode 1

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,600
Yunrong, I told you

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,000
the wild flowers on the road can't be picked by men.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,600
Otherwise, the blood will be shed

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,400
and the seeds will be cut off.

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,800
The seeds will be crushed

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,000
and the whole family will be destroyed.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Yunrong, come and help me.

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,600
Princess,

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,600
aren't we going to find the big prince?

12
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,800
What big prince?

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,000
He's about to die.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Come and help.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,600
What if he's not well?

16
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,200
He's so pretty.

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,400
He's so pitiful.

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,200
How could he be a bad guy?

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,200
Come and help.

20
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,800
Yes.

21
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,200
Yunrong.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,600
This...

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,200
You...

24
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,200
Yunrong.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,600
Stop.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,200
This is my room.

27
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,600
Can men bring anything in?

28
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,600
Get out of here.

29
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,200
Go.

30
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,600
Yunrong, go and get the best doctor

31
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,600
for the imperial doctor.

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,600
Yes.

33
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,600
Yunrong, I told you...

34
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,200
What's going on?

35
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,600
I'm not in my body anymore.

36
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,600
What are you doing?

37
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,200
You're the one who's trying to kill me.

38
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,200
What are you doing?

39
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,400
You only know him for the first time

40
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,400
and you're trying to kill him.

41
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,400
Who are you?

42
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,800
Don't be afraid.

43
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,600
I'm the princess of Yan State.

44
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,400
I'm the princess, okay?

45
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,200
Princess of Yan State?

46
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,400
An Ning.

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,200
She knows.

48
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,200
She's close to me.

49
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,400
I'm sure she has another intention.

50
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,800
She can't stay.

51
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,600
You know me?

52
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,600
It seems

53
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,600
we're destined to be together.

54
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,600
Be more clear, okay?

55
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,600
This is a trap!

56
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,000
Princess, please help me.

57
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,000
I can take care of her.

58
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,800
I don't know what you're calling me.

59
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm Yun.

60
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,000
Yun?

61
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,400
Yun?

62
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,200
I'm not

63
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,400
clear-hearted.

64
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,600
Can you learn it from me?

65
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,200
Sister,

66
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,200
you know her for just half a day.

67
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,800
You said more than ten words.

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,200
When you first saw her,

69
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,200
you didn't even see her face.

70
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,000
How could you be clear-hearted with her?

71
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,800
Who is her surname?

72
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Do you know what her family's identity is?

73
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,400
Why would she be on my back?

74
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,600
How could you be clear-hearted

75
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,200
and be loyal to her?

76
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,600
Did you get scared?

77
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,800
Hurry up and get out of my body.

78
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,200
Leave me.

79
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,600
I'm willing to.

80
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Slow down.

81
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,800
Don't worry, Yun.

82
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,600
It's okay.

83
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,400
You should rest well.

84
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,400
When you're recovered,

85
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,800
I'll let Royal Mother Fu

86
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,000
take care of her for us.

87
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,600
Royal Mother Fu knows

88
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,600
you're going to be mad at me!

89
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,200
No.

90
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,400
I have to find a way to get back to my body.

91
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,600
I can't let her get into trouble like this.

92
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm in the sea of ​​the world.

93
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,000
Why am I here all of a sudden?

94
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,400
It's hard to get into the sea of ​​the world.

95
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,400
How could...

96
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,800
Yes.

97
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm you.

98
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,400
I'm Yan An Ning.

99
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,400
No.

100
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,400
You're impossible.

101
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,400
I'm not.

102
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,400
I'm not.

103
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,400
I'm not.

104
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,400
I'm not.

105
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,400
If you're me,

106
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,400
you should be the responsibility of the Chu Army at this moment.

107
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,400
How could a man like him

108
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,400
who doesn't know how to save himself?

109
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,400
He's not a man of the eye.

110
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,400
He's my destiny.

111
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,400
I'm born for him.

112
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,400
I'm going to marry him.

113
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,400
You're doing this for your own selfishness,

114
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
to keep the peace and care of the whole Yan State.

115
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,400
You don't deserve to be the emperor.

116
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,400
Get out of my body.

117
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,400
Give me back my body.

118
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,400
I'm going to kick him out of the Yan State.

119
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,400
I'll never let him get into the Yan State.

120
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,400
Don't think about it.

121
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,400
Don't think about separating us.

122
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,400
Since God gave me this body,

123
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,400
I won't let you bully him.

124
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,400
I've decided my own body.

125
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,400
You bastard.

126
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,400
Get out of my body.

127
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,400
I'm back.

128
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,400
I'm back.

129
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,400
Princess,

130
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,400
Doctor Zhang is here.

131
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,400
Princess, Doctor Zhang is here.

132
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,400
Yunrong.

133
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,400
Let Doctor Zhang go back first.

134
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,400
Come in.

135
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,400
Yes.

136
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,400
Come in.

137
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,400
I'm here.

138
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,400
I'm here.

139
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,400
Come in.

140
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,400
Yes.

141
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,400
Princess,

142
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,400
you're...

143
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,400
Take him to the imperial prison to be interrogated.

144
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,400
Make it clear who he is and who he is.

145
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,400
Why did you bring him back yesterday?

146
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,400
I'm not the one who brought him back.

147
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,400
What?

148
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,400
When he showed up,

149
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,400
my body was taken by someone else.

150
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,400
It was a strange thing.

151
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,400
So I suspect he has some magic.

152
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,400
Make them know.

153
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,400
I see.

154
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,400
I was wondering how Princess changed her mind.

155
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,400
Oh, right.

156
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,400
I want to talk about those things.

157
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,400
Don't listen to them or believe them.

158
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,400
Yes.

159
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,400
I'll let Jingwei talk to him.

160
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,400
Princess,

161
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
I'm here to see the prince of Lin.

162
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,400
I'm here to see the princess.

163
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,400
I'm here to see the wedding.

164
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,400
You're here so early.

165
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,400
Since you're here,

166
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,400
let's go to see the wedding.

167
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,400
Don't you want to see the wedding in front of the Marquis Yan?

168
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,400
Marquis Yan's tradition is to see the wedding

169
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,400
in Hongluan.

170
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,400
We're going there too.

171
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,400
Let's go.

172
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,400
What's the matter?

173
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,400
The prince doesn't want to go?

174
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
The princess will go there.

175
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,400
But when will he get married?

176
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,400
Yunrong.

177
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,400
Your Highness, we've prepared the wedding.

178
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,400
We'll go to Marquis Yan later.

179
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,400
Can we leave now, Your Highness?

180
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,400
Why is the emperor in the palace?

181
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,400
Your Highness.

182
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,400
Your Highness.

183
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,400
Don't you know?

184
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,400
He's the crown prince of my country,

185
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,400
Lingyun.

186
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,400
He's really a good man

187
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,400
who hides his identity.

188
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,400
Then why is the crown prince in the ghost world?

189
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,400
I'm on my way to Marquis Yan.

190
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,400
I'm so worried.

191
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,400
I don't know where I'm from.

192
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,400
I'm saved by Princess An Ning.

193
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,400
That's why I'm alive.

194
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,400
Princess An Ning is my savior.

195
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,400
We've made a deal.

196
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,400
Marquis Yan will be the one to get married.

197
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,400
This is...

198
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,400
The savior.

199
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,400
Marry.

200
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,400
Marry.

201
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,400
Marry.

202
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,400
I...

203
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,400
This is our fun.

204
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,400
I can't control you.

205
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,400
Don't talk nonsense.

206
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,400
I haven't come yet.

207
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,400
You should explain it clearly.

208
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,400
An Ning.

209
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,400
Don't talk nonsense.

210
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,400
There's nothing to explain.

211
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,400
Just tell him.

212
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,400
Now,

213
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,400
I have something more important to do with you.

214
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,400
Let's go.

215
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,400
Ming Zong.

216
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,400
How dare you treat me like this?

217
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,400
I'm the crown prince.

218
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,400
I'm the crown prince.

219
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,400
I'm the crown prince.

220
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,400
You're the crown prince.

221
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,400
I'll take him back.

222
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,400
Shu'er.

223
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,400
Ah Zang Hu.

224
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,400
I'll take you back.

225
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,400
I'll take you back.

226
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,400
You're useless to me.

227
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,400
God will have you.

228
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,400
You can't hurt me.

229
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,400
He can fight with Ling Yun.

230
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,400
Let's go.

231
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,400
We can't catch up with him.

232
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,400
I...

233
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,400
It's here.

234
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,400
How did you get here?

235
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,400
We were standing under the tree together.

236
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,400
If we had a tree leaf

237
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,400
and we could get it,

238
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,400
it would prove that we're one.

239
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,400
Ming Zong.

240
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,400
The one who's destined to die.

241
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,400
That's good.

242
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,400
Show me

243
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,400
if you can see it.

244
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,400
It's really a good tree leaf.

245
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,400
It seems that we're still a bit far away.

246
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,400
Oh no.

247
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,400
Where's the plate?

248
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,400
Your Highness.

249
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,400
The princess asked me to give you...

250
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,400
The princess' plate?

251
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,400
How could it be here?

252
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,400
Oh no.

253
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,400
There's a ambush.

254
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,400
I'm not going to let you go.

255
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,400
I'm not going to let you go.

256
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,400
I'm not afraid.

257
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,400
I'll protect you.

258
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,400
Go.

259
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,400
There are two of them.

260
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,400
Go.

261
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,400
You must die.

262
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,400
Go.

263
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,400
Go.

264
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,400
Go.
