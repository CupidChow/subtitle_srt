Oh no.

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,360
It's over.

Enough!

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,380
Now, turn and make up.

00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:13,940
Don't move.

00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:14,620
Keep running.

20
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,280
Guys,

21
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,040
turn your eyes.

22
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:16,900
Let him go.

Stop!

30
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:39,980
Pick a place.

31
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:41,780
Stop!

32
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,580

36
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,780
You can't do it.

37
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,780
Put your hands up.

38
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,780
Put your hands up.

39
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,780
How are you?

40
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,780
How are you?

41
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,780
Don't sleep.

42
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,780
We don't even think of each other.

43
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,780
Don't even think of each other?

44
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,780
We don't...

45
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,780
Don't sleep.

46
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,780
Wake up.

47
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,780
We're going home.

48
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,780
We're going home.

49
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,780
I'll take you home.

50
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,780
We're going home.

51
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,780
Come.

52
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,780
Let me go.

53
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,780
Your Highness.

54
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,780
The Crown Prince didn't say hello to me.

55
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,780
He even suppressed my vision.

56
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,780
What does that mean?

57
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,780
Do you still remember

58
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,780
what you said to me in the banquet ceremony?

59
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,780
What did you say?

60
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,780
You said Princess of Yan State has insulted you.

61
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,780
You hate me for your heart's sake.

62
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:15,780
You want to avenge your father's death.

63
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,780
But how do you treat her now?

64
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,780
You're good at attacking her.

65
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,780
You're good at protecting her.

66
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,780
You even gave her a treatment.

67
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,780
Is this a blessing?

68
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,780
Should it be a disaster?

69
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,780
The Crown Prince has given her to me.

70
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,780
He is my person.

71
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,780
How can I treat him

72
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,780
as my person?

73
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,780
He is my strategic force.

74
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,780
I want to take him away.

75
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,780
I want to take him away.

76
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,780
I want to take him away.

77
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,780
I know

78
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,780
that Brother Yun won't leave me alone.

79
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,780
Whether you love me or not,

80
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,780
I'll take him back to me

81
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,780
one day.

82
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,780
Ning.

83
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,780
I've done so much.

84
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,780
It's all for your own good.

85
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:31,780
Think about it.

86
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,780
As a princess,

87
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,780
how much humiliation and torture

88
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,780
will you suffer after you get married?

89
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,780
I swear

90
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,780
that as long as you go back with me today,

91
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,780
I'll treat you well from now on.

92
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,780
I won't let you suffer any more.

93
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:57,780
Okay?

94
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,780
Okay.

95
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,780
I have only one condition.

96
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,780
What condition?

97
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,780
You want me

98
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,780
to cut your hand and neck

99
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,780
and cut your heart in one shot.

100
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,780
Then I'll go back with you.

101
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,780
I'll go back with you.

102
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,780
I can't use this to kill him.

103
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,780
Your Highness, I...

104
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,780
Go.

105
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,780
Your Highness.

106
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,780
Your Highness.

107
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,780
How are you?

108
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,780
I'm fine.

109
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,780
I'll give you the medicine.

110
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,780
What did you say at this time?

111
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,780
I'll go back with you.

112
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,780
I'll go back with you.

113
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,780
I'll go back with you.

114
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,780
I'll go back with you.

115
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,780
I'll go back with you.

116
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,780
I'll go back with you.

117
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,780
I'll go back with you.

118
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,780
I'll go back with you.

119
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,780
I'll go back with you.

120
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,780
I'll go back with you.

121
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,780
I'll go back with you.

122
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,780
I'll go back with you.

123
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,780
I'll go back with you.

124
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,780
I'll go back with you.

125
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,780
Sorry.

126
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,780
Why did you apologize to me?

127
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,780
You saved me this time.

128
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,780
It should

129
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,780
be because I thank you

130
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,780
for saving me.

131
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,780
I should have done that.

132
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,100
Thank you.

133
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,740
I...

134
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,500
I heard from the food corner

135
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:34,940
that you and Prince Ling

136
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,700
have a past with Ling Yun.

137
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,500
I misunderstood you before.

138
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:44,900
It's okay.

139
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,500
It's all over.

140
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,140
So you don't have to blame me.

141
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,780
I owe you more and more.

142
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,100
How can I repay you?

143
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:58,940
By the way,

144
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,100
how do you know

145
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,140
I'm on that street?

146
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,700
I saw that picture.

147
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,180
You are a cultivator.

148
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,620
You are so strong.

149
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,180
Why did you kneel on that street

150
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,140
and bully them?

151
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,340
To break the family bond

152
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,540
is to pay off some debts.

153
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,060
I can take care of them.

154
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,460
It's okay.

155
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,340
I can take care of them.

156
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,020
You did a good job.

157
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,300
We can't choose our own family.

158
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,820
But we can choose our own family.

159
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,740
We can choose our own life.

160
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,660
A man like Ling Yun

161
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,060
should be far away from him for the rest of his life.

162
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:46,780
No.

163
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,100
Don't ever see him again.

164
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:51,580
It's okay.

165
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,820
You're good at it.

166
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,580
I trust you.

167
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,140
I have said

168
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,740
I have you here.

169
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,780
I'll win.

170
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,300
I haveering everything

171
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,300
It's all a small matter for you.

172
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,300
It's enough.

173
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,300
Besides,

174
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,300
I'm alone.

175
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,300
The worst result is only death.

176
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,300
If you don't mind,

177
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,300
I'll be your family.

178
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,300
I'm not your family.

179
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,300
I'm not your family.

180
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,300
Family?

181
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,300
Isn't it just family?

182
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,300
Is there anything different?

183
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,300
No.

184
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,300
You and them

185
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,300
are very different.

186
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,300
Right.

187
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,300
How did the maid on the table break up?

188
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,300
She's dead.

189
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,300
She'll be fine.

190
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,300
Just like the darkness,

191
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,300
I can't find her anymore.

192
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,300
I'll be fine.

193
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,300
I just got hurt.

194
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,300
Right.

195
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,300
I'm fine.

196
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,300
I've been curious.

197
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,300
Did you do it when you were a child?

198
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,300
When I was resting outside,

199
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,300
I was bored.

200
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,300
I was holding a maid to talk to.

201
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,300
No wonder you were so much more.

202
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,300
He has a lot of words.

203
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,300
He said everything.

204
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,300
You must have been through a lot these years.

205
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,300
The night is long.

206
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,300
The sky will be bright.

207
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,300
The night is long.

208
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,300
The sky will be bright.

209
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:25,300
The rain in the gentle wind.

210
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,300
Time and love are very different.

211
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,300
The ending is already in the ground.

212
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,300
How can I see the light in the middle of the night?

213
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,300
I should get up.

214
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,300
If I don't get up,

215
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,300
I'll leave.

216
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,300
I'll be fine.

217
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:24,300
I can't hold back my sadness.

218
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:31,300
Even if the rain and the sun are gone,

219
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,300
I'll be your family.

220
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,300
I'm willing to be your family.

221
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,300
I finally got back to this body.

222
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,300
I'm going to find Brother Yun.

223
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,300
Get out of my way.

224
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,300
I'm going to find Brother Yun.

225
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,300
You're not allowed to go anywhere without His Highness's permission.

226
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,300
I'm not your Highness's person.

227
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,300
Why should I listen to him?

228
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,300
Get out of my way.

229
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,300
You're going to find Ling Yun?

230
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,300
What's so good about him?

231
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,300
Get out of my way.

232
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,300
Chen Xiao.

233
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,300
You're the one who made him break the soul of the King of the People.

234
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,300
What's the matter?

235
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,300
You don't like me.

236
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,300
Then let me go.

237
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,300
I have to find a way to separate his soul.

238
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,300
Get out of my way.

239
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,300
Your Highness, what are you doing?

240
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,300
I'm going to find out the problem of An Ning's body and soul

241
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,300
