00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Episode 1

2
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,000
Oh no!

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,200
Ning, be careful!

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,400
Why is he here?

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,200
Brother Yun!

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh no!

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,200
My body is poisoned again!

8
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,200
Brother Yun, you finally came to me!

9
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,200
Yes.

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,200
Then take me away quickly.

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,200
I don't want to be separated from you at all.

12
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,200
Okay.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What's going on?

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What's going on?

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I think it's okay here.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Okay.

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's a coincidence.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
This is the first time you've met here.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
This means we're far from heaven.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
No one can separate us.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Tomorrow morning, I'll go to the marriage of my parents.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You're not in love with me.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Let's go.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Let's go.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
What does he mean?

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Why did he suddenly change his mind?

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Your Highness,

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
the crown prince is still the same.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
An Zhong is investigating the British headquarters.

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Ling Yun is not in love with him.

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
He came to the Yan State this time.

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
He probably didn't know

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
where the princess of Yan State met.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Thank goodness the princess has agreed to marry you.

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Otherwise, I don't know how to change the situation.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I don't think so.

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
He's not certain.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I shouldn't let him go today.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I have to settle this marriage quickly.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I want to ask my parents to give me a marriage.

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I hope my parents will agree.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Ning, you're making fun of me.

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Ning, didn't you say

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
you didn't want to marry anyone?

45
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I...

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I didn't know Yun at that time.

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yun treats me well.

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm in love with him.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I want to marry him.

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I hope my parents will agree.

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm sure

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
you'll live a peaceful life.

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Please accept my proposal.

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Your Highness,

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
don't say yes.

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Your Highness, please accept my proposal.

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Your Highness,

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I bow to Your Highness.

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The princess came to the Yan State

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
with a heavy face

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
before she married the princess.

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
She agreed to marry the prince.

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Now, she wants to break the promise.

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm in love with the princess.

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I hope you'll be happy.

66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Don't forget, princess.

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
We've already decided

68
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
to marry the princess in Hong Lan tree.

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
As you said,

70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
if I catch the princess in Hong Lan tree

71
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
and have a night,

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'll be your man.

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Really?

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Why is he still keeping that leaf?

75
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Hong Lan tree

76
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
has this legend.

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm a good friend of your mother.

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Nonsense.

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
There's no need to say it.

80
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The maid can be the witness.

81
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yun Rourou,

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
is that true?

83
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Your Highness,

84
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
it's true.

85
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I dare not say it.

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Ning,

87
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
as a princess,

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
you always say

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
the words of Yan State.

90
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
How can you just turn it back?

91
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Father, I don't care.

92
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I just want to marry Yun Rourou.

93
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I hope you'll be happy.

94
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Your Majesty,

95
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
please forgive me.

96
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
How dare you!

97
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You're forcing me.

98
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I can't let you be as you wish.

99
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Come,

100
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
send the princess back to Qin.

101
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Send the crown prince back to Qin.

102
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You can't enter the palace without my permission.

103
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yes.

104
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm not leaving.

105
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Your Highness,

106
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm going to marry Yun Rourou.

107
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Send the princess back to Qin.

108
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Let me go.

109
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm going to marry Yun Rourou.

110
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm going to marry Yun Rourou.

111
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Have you ever been mad?

112
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You...

113
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
How dare you push me, princess?

114
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Get out of here.

115
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You're a person who's not well-known.

116
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You're taking my princess's body.

117
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You're really taking her as your princess?

118
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You...

119
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
How dare you do this?

120
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
What are you doing?

121
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Stay with me.

122
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Yun Rourou,

123
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
what are you doing?

124
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Save me.

125
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm going to find Yun Rourou.

126
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Your Highness,

127
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm really sorry.

128
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I was poisoned just now.

129
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
If you wake up and feel pain,

130
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
don't blame me.

131
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's all his fault.

132
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
He's so annoying.

133
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I've never seen him so cruel.

134
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
As you said,

135
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
the spirit of the Crown Prince of Lin State

136
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
is close to the rest of the world.

137
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's not good.

138
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What does the princess want to do

139
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
when she wants to test him?

140
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So the princess will act with him.

141
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
But the princess is very important.

142
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
No matter what she and Ling Yun Tian want,

143
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
she doesn't want to agree.

144
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The princess will explain to His Majesty later.

145
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
But what does Ling Yun Tian want to do?

146
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The child has grown up.

147
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
He has his own way of thinking.

148
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Princess.

149
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's me.

150
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's really you.

151
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's great.

152
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I should have called him earlier.

153
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But the princess called him earlier.

154
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's just that I don't know

155
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
how to call him.

156
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I want to solve this problem from the start.

157
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Maybe

158
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I can't let him meet Ling Yun again.

159
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Why?

160
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
He appeared twice

161
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
because he saw Ling Yun.

162
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So now

163
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I can only let them meet first

164
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
and see what's going on.

165
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's just that

166
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
we've solved the problem

167
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
by the crown prince of Ling State.

168
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
But the prince...

169
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
He's too strong.

170
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Even if there was no woman

171
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
who appeared in the chaos yesterday,

172
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
it's hard to kill Xue Yu.

173
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I can only remember it from the start.

174
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Princess, the prince of Ling State

175
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
is here.

176
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
He's outside the door.

177
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Is it because of the thing

178
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
that happened on the hall today?

179
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You can leave now.

180
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Let him in.

181
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Yes.

182
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Greetings, princess.

183
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Is the prince here to ask for forgiveness?

184
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The princess rushed out

185
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
the palace

186
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
secretly in the palace.

187
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
She really admires him.

188
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I won't marry him.

189
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I won't marry you either.

190
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Does the prince like me?

191
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I guess

192
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
you don't like me.

193
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Then why do you have to marry me?

194
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You've been locked up in the Cold Palace for ten years

195
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
in Ling State.

196
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
The important people in the court

197
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
are all from Ling State.

198
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
If you want to break through,

199
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
you can only seek for the throne.

200
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Although I'm far away from the Yan State,

201
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm strong in my military power.

202
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And I'm the only prince.

203
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
So you'll be the one to get it.

204
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So you'll be the one to get it.

205
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So the princess is willing to marry me

206
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
if she wants to break through.

207
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You saw it, too.

208
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I was trying to kill someone.

209
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's hard to kill someone.

210
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And for me,

211
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
marriage

212
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
is not the most stable thing.

213
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It's just interest.

214
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
As long as we work together,

215
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'll be your best friend.

216
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
But I'm asking

217
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
for the throne of Ling State.

218
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
How will the princess help me?

219
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Your opponent

220
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
is only Ling Yun.

221
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
If you're willing to do it,

222
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
this is the step of Ling Yun in the Yan State.

223
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
The princess only needs to be alert.

224
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Let this cake fall into the princess' hands.

225
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
In the meantime,

226
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
the Yan State will be in trouble with my father.

227
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's good for both of us

228
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
to go out and stay alone.

229
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
He...

230
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
He really treats me as a Yan State.

231
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Is he the only one

232
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
who can handle the Yan State?

233
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,200
This is his

234
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
first-time use of the tiger's flesh to break through the bronze.

235
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Then he takes the step.

236
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
The final attack.

237
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But

238
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
you're the first one to see his face.

239
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Fine.

240
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'll lead the army to the corner today.

241
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
But if I fail,

242
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
and he finds out that you betrayed him,

243
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
then it's a betrayal.

244
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
But it's not worth it.

245
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
The battle of Chu Wei

246
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
is a good bet.

247
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Since you have the princess' help,

248
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'll take the bet.

249
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You trust me?

250
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I trust you, too.

251
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
There's a book here

252
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
that we'll use as our cooperation.

253
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
The day after tomorrow,

254
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
you'll be the emperor of Ling State.

255
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I hope

256
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
the Yan State can stop the war

257
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
in two hundred years.

258
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
We can communicate with each other

259
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
through trade.

260
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
The princess is in a bad mood.

261
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Ling Cang

262
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
has been a thanks for the people of the two states.

263
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
There's another thing.

264
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
After you left the palace today,

265
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
we've never met again.

266
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You can't

267
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
talk about it again.

268
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
But I promise

269
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
that this won't affect our cooperation.

270
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
After the battle today,

271
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'll use the Yan State as my threat.

272
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
In the meantime,

273
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
you'll have to go back to the country

274
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
and wait for the Zhao State of the Yan State.

275
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Okay.

276
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'll say goodbye to the princess.

277
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
See you.

278
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Yunrong.

279
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Princess.

280
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Princess.

281
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
What's wrong?

282
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Why are you cold?

283
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I don't want to see you again.

284
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I don't think

285
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'll be the future emperor.

286
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Princess.

287
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
What are you talking about?

288
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Yunrong.

289
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Did the security guard

290
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
catch a citizen with this pattern?

291
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Yes.

292
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
He's still locked up in the Zhao State.

293
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Take the tiger's clothing

294
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
and go to the Zhao State with me.

295
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Before the poison is removed,

296
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
confirm it again.

297
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Greetings, princess.

298
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Greetings, princess.

299
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Let him go.

300
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Even if you let me go,

301
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I won't say it.

302
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
The secret base of the Yan State

303
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
of the Zhao State of the Yan State

304
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
has been taken by me.

305
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,320
Your crown prince is

306
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,000
being guilty.

307
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It's useless for you to do that.

308
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Pull it down.

309
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Kill him.

310
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Yes.

311
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
No.

312
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
No.

313
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Don't kill me.

314
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Don't kill me.

315
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Princess.

316
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It's true.

317
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
What should we do now?

318
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I want to tell him

319
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
that the king is coming.

320
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Your Highness.

321
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
We really just leave like this.

322
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
What if the princess is lying?

323
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
She's been hiding her life

324
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
and she's been suspicious.

325
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
She won't lie to anyone

326
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
about this.

327
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Then don't be so anxious.

328
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
How can we take a night like this?

329
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
We can't come back after the contract is settled.

330
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Moreover,

331
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
it's hard to read her heart.

332
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Do you think

333
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
the princess An Ning

334
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
can really move the crown prince?

335
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Did those women

336
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
betray the family

337
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
for her last time?

338
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
An Ning.

339
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Stop talking.

340
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
There's nothing to explain.

341
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Don't tell her.

342
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Now,

343
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I have something more important with you.

344
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
She's my important person.

345
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
She can't do anything else.

346
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Moreover,

347
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
what?

348
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
She's different from others.

349
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
She's different.

350
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Only she can kill her.

351
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Your Highness.

352
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Your Highness.

353
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Let me go with you.

354
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I have the tiger suit.

355
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'll take care of the soldiers

356
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
in the whole city.

357
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I won't be in trouble.

358
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Don't worry.

359
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Wait for me.

360
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
What are you doing?

361
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Don't go in there.

362
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Don't you want to separate us?

363
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Get out of here.

364
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Brother Yun.

365
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Brother Yun.

366
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Brother Yun.

367
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
An Ning.

368
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
They're going to kill you.

369
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
This is the tiger suit of the Yan State.

370
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Hurry up.

371
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
We have to protect you.

372
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
An Ning.

373
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Brother Yun.

374
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
An Ning.

375
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Do you want to be with me forever?

376
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I want to.

377
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I want to.
