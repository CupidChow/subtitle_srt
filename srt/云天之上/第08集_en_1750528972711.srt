Your Highness.

will fall out of the world!

21
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,740
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

22
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,380
Alright.

23
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,000
Although서 a Demon god sentence speak in court,

00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,140
it can still be existed when it life.

25
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,900

27
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:15,940

Lin Ze, thank you for letting me have a home.

33
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:28,580
How do you want me to repay you?

34
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,580
I saved them

35
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,580
not to repay you.

36
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,580
So,

37
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,580
you don't have to put it in your heart.

38
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,580
I want to put it in my heart.

39
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:47,580
You can call me An Ning in the future.

40
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,580
Your Highness,

41
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,580
the whole family of the palace is here.

42
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,580
An Ning.

43
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,580
An Ning.

44
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,580
Your Majesty,

45
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:55,580
go to the Prince Ling Cang's house

46
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,580
and go to the Crown Prince's Mansion.

47
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,580
Yes, Your Majesty.

48
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,580
I'll go there.

49
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,580
Take care of the family.

50
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,580
Yes, Your Majesty.

51
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,580
Your Highness,

52
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,580
it's so late.

53
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,580
Why hasn't he come back?

54
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,580
Prince Ling has been asking you

55
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,580
without asking.

56
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,580
Now he wants to see you

57
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,580
and let you go to the Crown Prince's Mansion.

58
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,580
Prepare something.

59
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,580
What do you mean?

60
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,580
You are not allowed to be treated by Prince Ling.

61
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,580
Those crimes that the outside world has been sent to you

62
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,580
are not your fault.

63
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,580
It's not what you think.

64
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,580
Your Majesty,

65
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,580
in order to protect another son,

66
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,580
you have to return all these crimes to you.

67
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,580
Mother!

68
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,580
Mother, what's wrong?

69
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,580
Mother, wake up!

70
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,580
Father,

71
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,580
he wants to kill me.

72
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,580
I'm the Crown Prince's wife.

73
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,580
I...

74
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,580
I'm against it.

75
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,580
I'm not asking him.

76
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,580
Father!

77
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,580
It's Ling Yan who killed Mother!

78
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,580
He's still alive!

79
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,580
Help him!

80
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,580
Father!

81
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,580
Father!

82
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,580
Father!

83
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,580
Father!

84
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,580
Father!

85
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,580
No matter how he changed,

86
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,580
no one believes him.

87
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,580
He said he killed Mother.

88
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,580
He was a bad man.

89
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,580
Yes.

90
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,580
You also believed

91
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,580
the stupid rumors about this useless根.

92
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,580
I...

93
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,580
I'm sorry.

94
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,580
You should say it like the Crown Prince.

95
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,580
Not me.

96
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,580
But it seems that

97
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,580
you helped His Highness get the account book of Xiangyun House.

98
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,580
The Crown Prince was in a bad mood

99
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,580
and the evidence was confirmed.

100
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,580
I'll forgive you

101
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,580
if you can't keep it from him.

102
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,580
You...

103
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,580
What's wrong?

104
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,580
Come.

105
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,580
Come.

106
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,580
Cang'er,

107
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,580
you want me to save your brother?

108
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,580
Father,

109
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,580
don't ask for my help.

110
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,580
He stole the account book

111
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,580
and didn't want me to live.

112
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,580
Nonsense!

113
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,580
Cang'er,

114
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,580
you won't.

115
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,580
Right?

116
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,580
What do you mean?

117
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,580
You want to protect him again?

118
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,580
What do you mean?

119
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,580
You pushed your brother out

120
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,580
and took his position as the Crown Prince.

121
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,580
You want him to never

122
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,580
come to your side?

123
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,580
He killed Qinglong

124
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,580
and killed innocent women.

125
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,580
Longluo and the court are all in the same boat.

126
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,580
All these fathers are innocent.

127
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,580
He killed the people of the country

128
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,580
and the people of the country.

129
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,580
Can't you see that?

130
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,580
Brother.

131
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,580
Do you really want me to die?

132
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,580
Brother.

133
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,580
Don't think I don't know your ambition.

134
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,580
You want to take him away?

135
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,580
If so,

136
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,580
then start from this account book

137
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,580
and send me the order.

138
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,580
You...

139
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,580
You bastard.

140
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,580
What are you going to do?

141
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,580
Are you going to kill him or father?

142
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,580
Father.

143
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,580
You are the mother of Ling Yushan.

144
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,580
Shut up.

145
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:00,580
For a woman who ruined the demon tree,

146
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,580
you are here to make trouble.

147
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,580
Are you going to let the people of the world

148
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,580
blame your brother?

149
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,580
Fang Xiao is so old and cruel.

150
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,580
You want to kill me?

151
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,580
Guards.

152
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,580
Take this mother of a traitor

153
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,580
to the palace.

154
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,580
I order you not to enter the palace.

155
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,580
Father.

156
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,580
Save him.

157
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,580
Father.

158
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,580
Save my mother.

159
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,580
Father.

160
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,580
Father.

161
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,580
Do you treat me as your son?

162
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,580
You.

163
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,580
Do you recognize your crime?

164
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,580
You are not my father.

165
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,580
You are his father.

166
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,580
I am not your father.

167
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,580
I am not your father.

168
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,580
I am not your son.

169
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,580
I am your...

170
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,580
first person.

171
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,580
I can recognize my crime.

172
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,580
I can recognize your punishment.

173
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,580
But from today on,

174
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,580
we are just military officials.

175
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,580
We have no father and son.

176
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,580
You are a traitor.

177
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,580
You are a traitor.

178
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,580
You don't respect your brother.

179
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,580
I don't have your son.

180
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,580
Since you recognize your crime,

181
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,580
go to the outside to kneel.

182
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,580
No.

183
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,580
Go to the street.

184
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,580
I want the people outside to see

185
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:57,580
how cruel you are and how impudent you are.

186
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,580
How impudent you are!

187
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,580
Lin Cang.

188
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,580
Father.

189
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,580
Father.

190
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,580
Father.

191
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,580
Father.

192
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,580
Father.

193
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,580
Father.

194
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,580
Father.

195
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,580
Father.

196
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,580
Father.

Father.

I will kill him one more time.

199
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,580
He is impudent and impudent.

200
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,580
He doesn't need to be punished.

201
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,580
Father.

202
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,580

00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,580
Your Highness.

208
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,580
Are you alright?

209
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,660
I will arrest her now!

210
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,340

00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,220
Are you kneeling on the streets?

214
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,260
Please help him!

215
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,060
How do you know it?

I can find the true shame of the future.

217
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,580
I'm so embarrassed to tell you.

218

You can't go out.

Stop.
