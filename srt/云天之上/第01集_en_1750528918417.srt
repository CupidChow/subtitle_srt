Episode 1

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,500
In the Cloud Sky World,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,500
everyone's fate is set in stone.

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:23,000
The one who changes the fate will be punished by fate.

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,500
The one who changes the fate will be punished by fate.

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,500
Ye Sha,

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,500
if you can't break the seal of fate,

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,500
why don't you give me a hand?

9
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,500
The one who changes the fate will be punished by fate.

10
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,500
Since we've met the Fairy,

11
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,500
we'll be together sooner or later.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
An Ning,

13
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,000
your true heart,

14
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,500
is the most precious thing in the world.

15
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,500
I won't be able to take care of you in this life.

16
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,500
You won't take care of me,

17
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,500
I won't take care of you.

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,500
The one who changes the fate will be punished by fate.

19
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,500
The one who changes the fate will be punished by fate.

20
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,500
The one who changes the fate will be punished by fate.

21
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,500
I won't be able to break the seal of fate.

22
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,500
I won't be able to break the seal of fate.

23
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,500
I'm still alive.

24
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,500
I'm still alive.

25
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,500
How could there be two of me?

26
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,500
That body is the real you.

27
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
If you can't change the fate,

28
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
you'll be killed by the one who loves you.

29
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You'll be killed by the one who loves you.

30
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Who are you?

31
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm your god,

32
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
to help you change your fate.

33
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Change your fate?

34
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Every person's fate is destined in this world.

35
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And your fate

36
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
is to give everything to the man who loves you.

37
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,500
And your life

38
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,500
is to risk everything to save your life.

39
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,500
You'll die for the one who loves you.

40
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,500
And this man

41
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,500
will do anything to save his life.

42
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,500
The only way to change your fate

43
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,500
is to give your life to the one who kills you.

44
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,500
No!

45
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,500
I've been dating Yan Sha for ten years.

46
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,500
He mustn't kill us.

47
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,500
That's fate!

48
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,500
When we believe in dating for ten years,

49
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,500
it's like the fate to kill you.

50
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,500
I don't believe you.

51
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,500
Look at what she's doing now.

52
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,500
Don't kill me.

53
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,500
You really want to kill me

54
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,500
ten years ago?

55
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,500
Anjie,

56
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,500
Anjie,

57
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,500
your true heart

58
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,500
is the most precious thing in the world.

59
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,500
I won't lose to you in this life.

60
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,500
Yanshan,

61
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,500
ten years have passed.

62
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,500
You've been so honest to me.

63
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,500
I'm still alive.

64
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,500
I'm still alive.

65
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,500
I'm still alive.

66
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,500
I'm still alive.

67
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,500
I'm still alive.

68
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,500
You're my wife.

69
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,500
Can I do anything to you?

70
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,500
What's wrong with you?

71
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,500
Nothing.

72
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,500
I need to rest for a few days.

73
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,500
I've been thinking about it for a year.

74
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,500
I might

75
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,500
be a little nervous.

76
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,500
Husband,

77
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,500
don't look at me first.

78
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,500
Okay.

79
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,500
Yanshan,

80
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,500
Yanshan,

81
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,500
you shouldn't have killed me.

82
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,500
Welcome to the 11001 city.

83
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,500
The Clouds and Clouds are all in the night.

84
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,500
The world is full of women.

85
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,500
The world is full of men and women.

86
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,500
They're all killed in the future.

87
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,500
The 11001 city of Luanning

88
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,500
is all in the night.

89
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,500
The world is full of women.

90
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,500
Xingyun,

91
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,500
Xingyun,

92
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,500
are you okay?

93
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,500
Luanning.

94
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,500
How could he change his life?

95
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,500
I met him in the art of life.

96
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,500
He changed his life.

97
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,060
I will die.

98
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,300
Your Majesty, don't worry.

99
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,700
Once I change his life,

100
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,700
I will never let him change.

101
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,300
Tonight, he will be killed by Night Immortal.

102
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,900
He will die of the Wanshin.

103
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,700
Hurry and get back to the Shrine of the Spirit.

104
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,900
Only by a few days of his death,

105
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,500
I can really repeat my fate.

106
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,100
Okay.

107
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,500
I will personally get back to the Shrine of the Spirit.

108
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,300
Life doesn't have a purpose.

109
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,100
Let's give it up.

110
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,900
It is just withinien.

111
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,300
Let's use their collective powers toёт our

112
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,900
Farewell.

113
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,700
Your Majesty,

114
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,300
We can use Nuo Zhen's거.

115
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,100
Don't look at me like that.

116
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,900
You decided to join forces now.

117
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,180
Okay.

118
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,340
Let's go.

119
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,100
Don't you dare to walk into the murder?

120
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,940
Meet me if you have other suggestions.

121
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,020
Don't touch it.

122
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:00,980
Just a moment.

123
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,100
What big happened?

124
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,420
Luo Anning was like invisible,

125
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,460
but kept getting down on me.

126
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,220
Tian Ji Pavilion can control the fate of the world.

127
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,420
But Lu An Ning is a god after all.

128
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,900
We forced her to be the god of the gods

129
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,780
and turned her into the most evil one.

130
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:17,540
So...

131
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,860
It's not because you can't find

132
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,180
the two gods and the gods

133
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,340
that Lu An Ning can't get the fate of the gods.

134
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,340
And she can't change her fate for me.

135
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,060
I've been enough.

136
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,100
I can't find my destiny.

137
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,020
I've been enough to compete with Lu An Ning's fate.

138
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,620
Please calm down.

139
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,740
I've found out that Ling Long Xin is in the human world.

140
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,740
If I don't get the fate of the gods,

141
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,620
I'll be able to help you change your fate.

142
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,780
Lu An Ning, the first god of the world,

143
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,940
is the lord of Yan State, Yan An Ning.

144
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,500
The first god of Yan State,

145
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,180
is the god of the gods.

146
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,100
I can't let him change his fate

147
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,820
until I find out his fate.

148
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,220
Lu An Ning, the first god of the world,

149
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,140
is the god of the gods, Yan An Ning.

150
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,220
Additionally,

151
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,300
looks like Y basin leader Eunuch

152
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,020
is making a scene that

153
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,140
is starting to settle in the future in order.

154
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,340
After all this is Sh crossover,

155
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,780
we have more diminish oppressive

156
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:19,980
but long overdue

157
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:20,780
you wandering with them.

158
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:21,260
Besides

159
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,660
we also have

160
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,140
Y

161
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,820
bragging charge and

162
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,900
proving

163
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,700
that they will lay their camp

164
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,580
to yield their details.

165
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,560
Ye Yan is

166
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,480
On12 Zhichen seat in Beijing

167
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,320
It's raining in Beijing

168
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,180
Even when the windy weather fades

169
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:52,080
The princess is my First queen in Yand wrong

170
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,760
As a king she is waiting for her princess

171
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,780
Rising in Scott

172
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,540
As young as a prince

173
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,220
Thank you

174
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,760
That wasn't what I told you

175
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,580
Her princess numbered the people

176
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,180
So the people are willing to be the princesses.

177
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,140
So we must protect them.

178
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,140
We must not let them down.

179
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,100
Let's go.

how come the splendid NegJI family

183
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,300
has suddenly become the best place to avenge?

184
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,280
What big high position does it have?

185
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,620
equals them?

186
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,280
We must take revenge.

187
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,180

00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,540
Aren't you taking care of the empress today?

190
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,940
Sim...

191
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,540
Today is a good day.

192
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,540
You can't be so careless.

193
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,500
No.

194
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,500
It's not right.

195
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,460
I'm going to find the Queen Mother and ask her.

196
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:19,900
Princess.

197
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,100
Princess.

198
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,460
Don't talk.

199
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,900
Princess.

200
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,460
Your Majesty.

201
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,820
If you don't get married,

202
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,940
Ling State will not give you food.

203
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,100
People are helpless.

204
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,540
The country will be in chaos.

205
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,580
Yes, Your Majesty.

206
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,980
If Ling State doesn't come,

207
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,940
the people will be punished.

208
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:40,900
Your Majesty.

209
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,260
Ling State is always cruel to our people.

210
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,940
If you don't get married,

211
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,780
I'm afraid...

212
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,740
Princess is coming.

213
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,900
Greetings, Queen Mother.

214
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,740
Good luck.

215
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,060
Thank you, Queen Mother.

216
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,380
What are you waiting for?

217
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,740
Are you giving her justice?

218
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:18,160
Natural

219
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,580
Father Today I am arranged

220
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:25,380
to see the Crown Princess and to get married?

221
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,940
The Crown Princess and...

222
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,300
You and купara

223
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,300
in the palace?

224
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,020
This...

225
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,020
He Qing

226
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,060
is also for Yan State.

227
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,260
What's going on?

228
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,140
Why don't they remember?

229
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,140
The princess

230
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,660
doesn't want to marry He Qing.

231
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,380
Your Majesty,

232
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,660
the two states of the world

233
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,220
can't have a princess.

234
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:49,860
It's not a violation.

235
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,700
Ning.

236
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,060
If you don't marry He Qing,

237
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,340
the Lin State

238
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,300
won't allow you to have a child.

239
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,900
The food is already gone.

240
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,540
No food.

241
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,260
I started to sell lotus seeds

242
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,860
in a large number of places in the country three years ago.

243
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,380
It's been closed for years.

244
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,900
Why is it so cold?

245
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,300
No.

246
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,180
The princess is a man of ten thousand people.

247
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,140
She wants to marry He Qing.

248
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,580
Is it so hard to

249
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,700
push her to marry the people of Yan State?

250
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,980
How can she marry him?

251
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,940
Let's stop He Qing

252
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,980
and figure out how they will change.

253
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,180
As a princess,

254
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,580
I know the princess' responsibility

255
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,220
better than anyone else.

256
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,180
But I won't sacrifice myself.

257
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,300
As the only son of my parents,

258
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,100
if I marry He Qing,

259
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,620
I will send our country of Yan

260
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,780
to the Lin State.

261
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,740
Who said that?

262
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,620
You want me to betray the country?

263
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,300
Or

264
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,060
you want to be the crown prince

265
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,860
of the Lin State?

266
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:57,900
Your Majesty,

267
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:00,260
you are right.

268
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,380
Yes.

269
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,300
You are right.

270
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,020
Your Majesty.

271
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:03,820
Yes.

272
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:05,780
All right.

273
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,940
I won't force you.

274
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,660
Thank you, mother.

275
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,020
But this marriage

276
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,780
is really hard to get for Yan State.

277
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,460
It's not like

278
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,780
we will send our country of Yan

279
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,060
to the Lin State.

280
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,020
The eldest prince

281
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,700
died of love

282
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,260
when he was 9 years old.

283
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,660
He did not reform.

284
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,900
He has become more complex nowadays.

285
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,140
The umbilical medics of 처�or

286
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,540
are really imp Stay at ease.

287
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,420
It's hard to blij

288
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,060
I ask the emperor to get the marriage out of Ling State

289
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,460
where he will get home?

290
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,860
Princess ordered if you heard it,

291
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,420
she asked the second prince to stay.

292
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,980
She did too many evil things.

293
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,780
Is it

294
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:55,720
Talk about this will be the meditation ceremony of laden and imperial,

295
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,320

296
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,360

for father himself

303
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,560
who Morning Sun

304
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,620
dreamed of sobbing

305
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:54,860
Then let's go to the end of our lives

306
00:16:54,860 --> 00:17:00,820
The world is full of ups and downs

307
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:07,580
The world is full of ups and downs

308
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:11,020
The world is full of ups and downs

309
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:14,180
The world is full of ups and downs

310
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:17,820
The world is full of ups and downs

311
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:21,580
The world is full of ups and downs
