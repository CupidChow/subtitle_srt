You're willing to drink with me today.

71
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,390
I suppose you just want a listener.

72
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:53,950
Is that right?

73
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,760
Whatever.

74
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,000
Even if it's you, Sang Qi,

75
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,720
I don't care.

76
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,270
Get out then.

77
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,670
I just got hold of Wei Zhan Hong's whereabouts.

78
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,670
Wei Zhan Hong? How is he?

79
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,670
He was exiled! What do you think?

80
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,390
Before he left,

81
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,440
I even bribed the soldiers
escorting the Wei family

82
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,070
with some money

83
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,110
so that they could look after Wei Zhan Hong.

84
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,440
But I just received news from the stage station

85
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,550
that they're arriving at the border of Jingzhou.

86
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,640
Is Grand Tutor Song aware of this?

87
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:32,950
My...

88
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,230
My father prohibits any mention of Wei

89
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,200
in our residence.

90
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,270
He severed our ties completely
with the Wei family.

91
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,880
That's why I'm here alone,
drowning my sorrow away.

92
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,790
Song Luo Tian,

93
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,000
at first, I thought

94
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,200
Wei Zhan Hong was just a sidekick of yours.

95
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,390
But it seems like

96
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,720
you hold him dearly.

97
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,440
You changed my view of you.

98
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,040
However...

99
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:08,600
Speak.

100
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,390
While Wei Zhan Hong is someone loyal,

101
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,880
the Wei family is convicted now.

102
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,200
Is the good faith you have in Wei Zhan Hong

103
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,160
enough to exonerate the Wei family?

104
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,110
Yes, I always ordered him around,

105
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,880
but we have also known each other for years.

106
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,640
My dad is strict

107
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,880
and I am temperamental.

108
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,830
So I always ask Wei Zhan Hong

109
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,070
to do things for me.

110
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,880
By the way,

111
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:36,670
sorry.

112
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,640
Wake up!

113
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,110
You can't leave me hanging.

114
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,160
Finish your sentence.

115
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,270
What did you ask him to do?

116
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,270
I asked him to prank you,

117
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,880
but he botched the plan.

118
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,600
Don't hold any grudges.

119
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,230
Get off me.

120
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,600
Forgive me, please.

121
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,640
I forgive you.

122
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:10,040
But you need to tell me what he did.

123
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,510
Okay?

124
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:15,390
Remember when you were poisoned
in the Imperial College?

125
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,350
It was me who asked
Wei Zhan Hong to poison the dishes.

126
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,000
You insisted on cooking for Deputy Chief.

127
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,950
So I poisoned it.

128
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,110
What poison did you ask him to put?

129
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,760
Laxatives.

130
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:37,160
Look!

131
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,440
(No, I didn't consume any laxatives.)

132
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,070
(It was the poisonous powders from Xizhao.)

133
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,160
(It could kill.)

134
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,390
(This means)

135
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,070
(Wei Zhan Hong is related)

136
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:54,950
(to Xizhao too.)

137
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:56,670
(Oh, no.)

138
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,830
(It was a trap!)

139
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,320
Wait.

140
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,230
We agreed

141
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,440
to forget about the past after drinking.

142
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:07,880
Later.

143
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,320
I'll drink with you when I have the chance.

144
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,270
But... Wait.

145
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,920
Come back, Sang Qi!

146
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,640
I

147
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,550
don't have any friends at all.

148
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:31,880
Young Lady!

149
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,110
Young Lady!

150
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,600
Young Lady, why are you going to Jingzhou?

151
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:37,200
Qi.

154
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,350
Please stop her.

155
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:43,670
Why are you going to Jingzhou?

156
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,000
Deputy Chief might be trapped.

157
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:46,320
I need to save him.

158
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,960
But is he worth risking your life for?

159
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,470
Yes.

160
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,000
Young Lady!

161
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,320
Wait. I'll come with you.

164
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,640
There is quite some distance
away from the station.

165
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:25,960
Why aren't they here?

166
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,350
Did something happen on their trip?

167
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,280
Escorting prisoners is a tough
and laborious job. They can't be so fast.

168
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,230
Move.

169
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,910
Help! Help!

170
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,110
Young Master, there's a ruckus in front.

171
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,470
Save them, Bai Shi.

172
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:44,110
Help!

173
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,960
Help me.

174
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,440
Deputy Chief.

175
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,420
(Prisoner)

176
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:16,520
Run.

177
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,710
Run, Official Wei.

178
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,350
Are you okay?

179
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,110
Why are you here?

180
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,110
I won't let any harm come to you.

181
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:13,520
Deputy Chief.

182
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:16,590
Deputy Chief.

183
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:18,320
Deputy Chief.

184
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:40,070
(Prisoner)

185
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,110
Deputy Chief Yan.

186
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,590
We are here on Official Yan's order.

187
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,230
Forget about me. Chase after them!

188
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:53,840
Follow me.

189
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,440
Yes!

190
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,030
Bai Shi, carry your Young Master.

191
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,760
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

192
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,840
Find Wei Zhan Hong with the others.

193
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,590
I'll chase after Official Wei.

194
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,400
Be cautious.

195
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,520
Qi!

196
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:04,520
Qi!

197
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,520
Young Master! Young Master!

198
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,790
Sang Qi!

199
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,330
(Prisoner)

200
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,760
We're too late.

201
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,200
Official, can you clean up?

202
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,280
I need to travel back to the main path.

203
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:00,030
Noted.

204
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,840
Better now, Young Master?

205
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:17,960
Deputy Chief.

206
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,440
Deputy Chief.

207
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,030
What's the situation?

208
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,840
I was late. Official Wei was killed.

209
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:27,840
Bai Shi.

210
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,640
Deputy Chief is gravely wounded.

211
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:31,000
We need to bring him back to the city for treatment.

212
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,440
We can't let him bleed like this.

213
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:33,110
Let's go.

214
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:35,030
Qi, go back first. Don't worry about me.

215
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,640
What if the assassins come back here?

216
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,150
I want you to be safe.

217
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,440
Yan Yun Zhi, we're not in the Imperial College.

218
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,590
I don't have to follow your orders.

219
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,110
Should we wait for Mr. Zhuo?

220
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,640
He should be fine.

221
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,470
The assassins are not after him

222
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,550
so they won't do anything.

223
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,590
Besides, he has many soldiers with him.

224
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:00,710
Let's go.

225
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:01,760
Careful.

226
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,790
Come.

227
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,150
I'll carry you, Young Master.

228
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:09,840
No.

229
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,590
I don't want to ride with you.

230
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,590
But...

231
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:14,760
You should have told me earlier.

232
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,920
Your wound, Young Master.

233
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:53,830
Young Master Zhuo.

234
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,760
Wei Zhan Hong won't probably survive the fall.

235
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,160
It's fine.

236
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,310
Our plan failed.

237
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,040
He serves no purpose anymore.

238
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,350
According to our original plan,

239
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:06,920
after Yan San Lang

240
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,230
received the news that the Wei family
is close to Jingzhou,

241
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,470
Yan Yun Zhi would definitely follow us.

242
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:12,760
We didn't expect

243
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,190
Sang Qi to appear suddenly.

244
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,230
Forget about the plan then.

245
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,000
I took into account

246
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,160
the possibility of failure

247
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,160
and has stationed assassins on their way back.

248
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:27,800
Just in case the plan fails.

249
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,190
Do not harm Sang Qi.

250
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,040
I know that, Young Master Zhuo.

251
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,680
I already told them

252
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,230
not to hurt your Sang Qi.

253
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,680
Aren't you injured?

254
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,950
Yet you're holding me so tightly.

255
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,070
Didn't I ask you to stay put?

256
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,590
Why came here?

257
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,280
The Wei family is fishy.

258
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,470
Following them will put you at risk.

259
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,230
How do you know?

260
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,950
Song Luo Tian told me

261
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,430
that he asked Wei Zhan Hong

262
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,950
to poison me with laxatives.

263
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,520
However, I got the poisonous powders instead.

264
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,110
The Wei family is hiding something.

265
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,800
Deputy Chief, here.

266
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,310
Lean on me.

267
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,190
Xizhao again, unsurprisingly.

268
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,830
They want to leave no survivors.

269
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,000
Their infamy is real.

270
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:27,950
Get up now.

271
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:30,800
Young Master.

272
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,800
What happened?

273
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,110
Young Master,

274
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,710
we only have one horse left.

275
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,110
It might be too challenging to travel together...

276
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:45,830
Qi, you should head back first.
It's dangerous here.

277
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,110
Bring a physician and a carriage.

278
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:47,950
We'll wait for you here.

279
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:48,800
I'm staying.

280
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,400
Bai Shi, can you do that?

281
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,070
I...

282
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,070
Okay.

283
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,590
I'll leave him to you, Miss Sang.

284
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,880
Stay alert.

285
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,950
Qi, stop looking at me like that.

286
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,560
I'm fine. I know myself.

287
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,760
You're gravely wounded.

288
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,280
Rest well. Don't speak.

289
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,040
But I want to.

290
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,880
If you want to speak,

291
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:31,920
then you should tell me

292
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,280
what my brother had to do with Xizhao.

293
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,400
Yu.

294
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,880
To celebrate your recovery,

295
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,110
I stole my dad's best wine.

296
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,920
What's the matter, Yu?

297
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,680
You were so happy during the day.

298
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,190
Did something bad happen
at the frontier fortress?

299
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,760
With one wrong move,

300
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,310
everything falls apart.

301
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:11,280
With one wrong move, everything falls apart.

302
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,160
What did he mean by that?

303
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,920
I pondered about it for a while too.

304
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,880
Yu died abruptly in front of me the next day.

305
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,430
The coroner said

306
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,230
that it was a sudden cardiac arrest.

307
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:30,230
But he just told me

308
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:31,950
that he was recovering.

309
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:37,590
When I tried to look for clues
to uncover the truth,

310
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:40,350
someone had already erased all traces of Yu

311
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,920
in the Imperial College.

312
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:42,920
Perhaps...

313
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,830
Perhaps he found

314
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,680
a crucial

315
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,400
secret.

316
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:00,590
What are you guys doing?

317
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,150
(Sang Yu, Imperial College)

318
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,160
(Sang Yu, Imperial College)

319
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,430
Who asked you to burn Yu's belongings?

320
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,710
No idea.

321
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,520
Someone claimed he's from the imperial court

322
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,190
and talked to Scholar.

323
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,110
Scholar then asked us to burn it,

324
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,110
saying it was to get rid of rubbish.

325
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,760
So you couldn't find those

326
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:29,310
who burned his clothes. Is that right?

327
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,710
Yu's case concluded very quickly.

328
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,560
Everyone from the Imperial College

329
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,830
to the Grand Commandant's Residence
assumed that he died from his sickness.

330
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,800
But I know very well

331
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,190
that someone was behind

332
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,710
his death.

333
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:52,350
The culprit was very well hidden

334
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,880
and I was just a student back then.

335
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,230
I couldn't investigate

336
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,110
nor fight against the dark forces.

337
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,880
Thanks to your perseverance,

338
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:05,310
the death of my brother
was not swept under the rug.

339
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:06,830
However,

340
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:10,880
how did you latch onto Xizhao?

341
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,470
After I was appointed as the Deputy Chief,

342
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:15,710
I've been conducting my own investigation.

343
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,230
I use Yan San Lang's position

344
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,110
to investigate in secret

345
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,920
any death that's similar to Yu's.

346
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:27,230
After you enrolled in the Imperial College,

347
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:28,640
we found

348
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,040
another crime scene
that bore a striking resemblance.

349
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,830
We discovered the powders
from Xizhao on the scene.

350
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,040
How is that so coincidental?

351
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,560
All clues point towards the Song and Wei families.

352
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,880
Our enemy may be hidden,

353
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,190
but I know that they are powerful.

354
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:48,520
When I enrolled in the Imperial College,

355
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,680
you were extra harsh on me.

356
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,680
You even sent me to the Lingwu Mountain
to find a master.

357
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,000
All that was just to...

358
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:57,880
Protect you.

359
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,800
To protect you.

360
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,470
Who are they?

361
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:14,760
I just hope

362
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,040
that after you undergo training,
you could be able to fend for yourself.

363
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,230
It's all in preparation for an ambush

364
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:21,800
like this.

365
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:25,470
Deputy Chief.

366
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:26,760
Deputy Chief.

367
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:29,920
This...

368
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,800
Are you okay?

369
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,470
Qi, I want

370
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,640
to rest.

371
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:39,070
No, you can't sleep.

372
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,000
Yan Yun Zhi!

373
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,430
Look at me.

374
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,880
Open your eyes and look at me.

375
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,640
If you do this,

376
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,590
how are we supposed to get together?

377
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:49,470
Will you really

378
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,470
abandon me despite knowing my feelings?

379
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,950
When will we get together then?

380
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,950
Don't you know already?

381
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:09,710
Young Master!

382
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:11,800
Bai Shi!

383
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:14,920
Young Master! Young Master!

384
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,400
Hurry up, Bai Shi.

385
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,760
The carriage and the physician are here.

386
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,040
Young Master,

387
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,230
what happened to your lips?

388
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:24,680
Did someone hurt you again?

389
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,190
Bring him to the carriage now.

390
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,160
Don't ask him.

391
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,070
Qi, I want you to carry me.

392
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,310
But Young Master...

393
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:34,560
Come.

394
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,070
My sword, Bai Shi.

395
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,040
Okay.

396
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:28,590
Your Majesty.

397
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,680
(Official Document)
Yan San Lang.

398
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,310
How's the investigation?

399
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,470
Your Majesty,

400
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:33,710
Official Wei is confirmed dead.

401
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:35,110
The coroner has determined

402
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,160
a Xizhao tattoo on Official Wei's shoulder.

403
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,640
Wei Zhan Hong is still missing.
No idea if he's dead or alive.

404
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,430
The Wei family was found guilty,

405
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:43,070
but the crime scene had been tampered with.

406
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,880
We don't know who the Wei family was contacting.

407
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:49,470
Yan Yun Zhi was investigating the Wei family.

408
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,230
How is he now?

409
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:52,280
Deputy Chief Yan

410
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:56,110
was gravely wounded during his investigation.

411
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,040
Morning, Deputy Chief.

412
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,230
Morning.

413
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,640
Deputy Chief is back.

414
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,230
Morning, Deputy Chief.

415
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:12,880
Morning.

416
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:15,520
Deputy Chief.

417
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:21,820
(The wind blows and carries a beautiful poem)

418
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,430
Deputy Chief Yan?

419
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,710
Yun Zhi, you're here.

420
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,760
Everyone has been studying hard.

421
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,190
The imperial examination is around
the corner. It's just a practice test

422
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,310
so that they won't panic during the real one.

423
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,430
I brought some food for everyone.

424
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,350
Bai Shi.

425
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,560
Bring some water after you place down the food.

426
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,000
Careful.

427
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,110
Wash your hands before you eat.

428
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,110
Thanks, Deputy Chief!

429
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,760
Thanks, Deputy Chief!

430
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,760
Now you're all spirited.

431
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,280
Tell me why all of you looked so defeated

432
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,830
when you were writing the essay.

433
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,470
I missed all of you dearly

434
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,830
during my absence.

435
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,800
Yan Yan, I wanted

436
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,920
to drink with you, but it seems like

437
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,920
Scholar Feng would never let you go.

438
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,760
What a pity.

439
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,190
It's okay.

440
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,040
Several glasses can raise morale.
It's my treat next time.

441
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,640
Scholar Feng wants all of you to study hard

442
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,350
for your own future.

443
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,590
Show him some results,

444
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:17,190
okay?

445
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,110
Yes.

446
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:21,680
Look at

447
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,400
your handwriting, Guo Cheng.

448
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,430
I don't need

449
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,070
to read your text to know

450
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:28,070
you've improved.

451
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,230
Thanks, Deputy Chief.

452
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:31,830
The water is here.

453
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:32,400
The water is here.

454
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:33,950
Take a break, everyone.

455
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,760
Eat something.

456
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,230
Let's go.

457
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:36,830
Come.

458
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,430
Thanks, Deputy Chief.

459
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,920
Wash your hands.

460
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,430
- Hurry.
- Share it.

461
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,520
What is this? Let me see.

462
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,070
For you.

463
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:43,710
That's a lot.

464
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:46,430
Deputy Chief has been reborn.

465
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,400
Be patient. We'll share it.

466
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,710
Stop shoving. Pass it to me, please.

467
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,880
You have recovered?

468
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,190
What trick are you pulling this time?

469
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,400
Don't worry.

470
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,040
Play along.

471
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,070
Thank you, Deputy Chief.

472
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:58,760
It smells so good.

473
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,350
Come.

474
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,310
Give me some.

475
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:00,760
I want this.

476
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,470
Here, for you.

477
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,800
Qi, let's talk later.

478
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:07,640
There's some left. Here.

479
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,000
I can't finish it alone.

480
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,310
I feel like yours is more delicious.

481
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,760
We can swap later.

482
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,070
Can you pass this to him?

483
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:13,880
This is yummy.

484
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,000
Pass it to him. Try it.

485
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,350
Qi?

486
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,470
Master Sang.

487
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:29,950
Deputy Chief.

488
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:34,760
Qi.

489
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,040
Master Sang.

490
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:38,710
Why are you alone here?

491
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:39,560
What are you doing?

492
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:41,760
What are you reading?

493
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:44,160
Give it back to me!

494
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,880
Let me read it.

495
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,310
Why do you want to read it?

496
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:46,950
You won't understand anyway.

497
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,710
Anything?

498
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,590
Nothing.

499
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,800
We thought you were bored.

500
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,350
Exactly.

501
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:57,400
I'm not bored.

502
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,350
You guys can head back.

503
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:11,470
(Yan)

504
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,470
(Grand Commandant's Residence)

505
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,300
(Yan)

506
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:21,830
(Grand Commandant's Residence. Great Aspiration)

507
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:22,560
Greetings, Deputy Chief.

508
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,470
Zhuo Wen Yuan is not here, right?

509
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,160
No. Mr. Zhuo is not here.

510
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:37,520
Master, Mr. Yan is here.

511
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:41,520
Grand Commandant Sang.

512
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,950
Pardon my unannounced

513
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:45,070
visit.

514
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,110
How can I help?

515
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,830
I'm here to talk about

516
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,110
Sang Qi's academic performance.

517
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,430
But I remember

518
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,590
you are no longer the Deputy Chief
of the Imperial College.

519
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,520
Is our private residence part of your duties now?

520
00:31:59,110 --> 00:31:59,950
You're right, Grand Commandant.

521
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,640
I am indeed free now,

522
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:04,350
so I can

523
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,920
offer some private tuition.

524
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:09,640
I believe Sang Qi could use

525
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,000
some tutoring.

526
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:13,830
Yan Yun Zhi.

527
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Just be frank.

528
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,920
As you wish, Grand Commandant.

529
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,950
I am old enough to find a wife now.

530
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,160
Sang Qi has long attracted me.

531
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,800
So I hope you can consider me

532
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,520
as your future son-in-law.

533
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:30,430
Lian Pian.

534
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:32,800
What's for dinner today?

535
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,430
The Third Young Master Li sent pork chops today.

536
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,160
Our chefs are working on them as we speak.

537
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,760
They keep giving us pork chops

538
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:46,230
as if we don't already have this dish.

539
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:50,280
I guess Qi is just very popular among the men.

540
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,160
I don't know what's in the mind

541
00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:54,520
of girls in Bianjing.

542
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,470
Four Bachelors? Four Handsome Men?

543
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,710
None of them holds a candle
to how I looked when I was young.

544
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,590
They look so hideous

545
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,880
yet they managed to enchant so many women.

546
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,760
With all due respect, Grand Commandant, my Young...

547
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,190
My, my. I'm getting old.

548
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,190
I forgot you're here.

549
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,800
I humbly accept your remarks.

550
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:22,880
Also,

551
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:26,470
Yan and Sang families are
two prestigious families in Bianjing.

552
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,760
Our statuses match each other's,

553
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:30,880
but there are pros and cons to everything.

554
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:33,470
Our marriage

555
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,040
might draw unnecessary attention.

556
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:39,800
I understand your concerns, Grand Commandant Sang.

557
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:43,160
However, marriage is an important matter.

558
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:46,680
Sang Qi should have a say too.

559
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,110
Lian Pian.

560
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,640
Mr. Yan has been standing here for a while.

561
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,190
Where's his tea?

562
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:54,950
Did I not teach you anything?

563
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:56,710
Yes.

564
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,040
I'll prepare the tea now.

565
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:58,590
It's okay.

566
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:05,040
I shall wait until Sang Qi makes up her mind

567
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,040
before my next visit.

568
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,000
Thanks, Grand Commandant.

569
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,000
See you.

570
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,080
I knew it.

571
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,280
It's indeed a trial from God.

572
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:34,840
I heard that he's arrogant.

573
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,910
But now, he's all

574
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,390
humble and modest.

575
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:42,840
That's a bad sign.

576
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:48,320
Qi will be charmed sooner or later.

577
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,190
Master.

578
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,470
You just shooed him away.

579
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:53,430
You know nothing.

580
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,320
He will come back again.

581
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,000
Father.

582
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:06,320
Master.

583
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,080
Great timing.

584
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:09,120
Look at this.

585
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:13,100
(Recommended Candidates
for Vice-Magistrate of Chenliu County)

586
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,920
(Vacancy in Chenliu)

587
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:18,710
I heard there's a vacancy in Chenliu,

588
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,800
so I gave your name to the Ministry of Personnel.

589
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,820
(The candidate shall depart to Chenliu
as soon as possible)

590
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:24,840
Chenliu?

591
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:28,080
It's a small county but it's close to Bianjing.

592
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,950
It's a good job nonetheless.

593
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:32,000
(Recommended Candidates
for Vice-Magistrate of Chenliu County)

594
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,390
Think about it. The position is ready.

595
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,320
If you continue to waste your time,

596
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,040
you'll never find a wife.

597
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:41,910
Then I shall marry a crane as well.

598
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:52,220
(A Place for the Talented. Imperial College)

599
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:54,280
What's so urgent?

600
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,800
Deputy Chief Yan is really leaving.

601
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,280
Leaving?

602
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:59,360
Where to?

603
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,320
I got news from the Ministry of Personnel

604
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,600
that the Deputy Chief is
taking up a position in Chenliu.

605
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:06,470
He'll be inaugurated in a few days.

606
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:10,470
I thought he'd be back to host the vesting ceremony
for the top scorers in the imperial examination,

607
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:14,280
but it seems like our encounter
with him is short-lived.

608
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:18,910
I have an idea!

609
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:21,080
- What idea?
- Tell us.

610
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:21,840
During the test later,

611
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,080
don't answer properly.

612
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,360
Just write something random.

613
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,040
Are you saying

614
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,190
we should make Scholar Feng believe
the absence of Deputy Chief

615
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,430
is the reason why we can't study well?

616
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,230
You know me well, Master Sang.

617
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,630
Scholar Feng will be infuriated

618
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:35,600
and inform His Majesty.

619
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,910
The rest will solve itself.

620
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,000
You're right.

621
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:40,840
Yes.

622
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,800
Especially you, Zhuo.

623
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,560
Don't stand out.

624
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:50,600
We have to be in this together.

625
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:51,390
Isn't that right?

626
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:52,870
Yes.

627
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,190
I don't know why you guys are upset.

628
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,360
The Imperial College will operate as usual

629
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,600
regardless of Yan Yun Zhi.

630
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,560
Don't you want Deputy Chief Yan to return?

631
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,560
I'm here to study,

632
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,360
not to idolize him.

633
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:09,190
You guys are too young.

634
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,000
What does he mean by that?

635
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,280
Does he have to put it that way?

636
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,560
Right, what does he mean?

637
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:18,570
(The wind blows and carries a beautiful poem)

638
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,000
Stop writing.

639
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:39,710
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

640
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:52,320
Put it here.

641
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,300
(Grand Hall)

642
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,600
How insolent!

643
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:15,670
Let's head back and wait for the good news.

644
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:17,430
Sure.

645
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:23,150
Let's go.

646
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,000
Qi.

647
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,360
You really want Yan Yun Zhi to come back?

648
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,360
Not just me.

649
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,080
Every student wants him to come back.

650
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,280
Everyone might be afraid of Deputy Chief,

651
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,710
but deep down,

652
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,710
we all agree with his pedagogy.

653
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,150
They think Scholar Feng is way too conservative.

654
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,840
I'm asking for your opinion,

655
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,080
not theirs.

656
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:45,560
Never mind.

657
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,230
I'm not in a good mood today.

658
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:48,870
Let's hang out in Qingfeng restaurant.

659
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:50,560
But I have plans later.

660
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,320
You can go yourself.

661
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,600
(The one responsible for my brother's death
is nowhere to be seen.)

662
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,520
(The situation is risky now.)

663
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,040
(Is Deputy Chief seeking refuge in Chenliu?)

664
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,700
(Tomb of Sang Yu, Beloved Son)

665
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,390
(Someone was here.)

666
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,760
What a chance encounter!

667
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,910
We're meant to meet here.

668
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,390
You scared me.

669
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,470
Shouldn't you be afraid of my palm?

670
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,600
Let me remind you

671
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,760
that I'm your senior
when it comes to martial arts.

672
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,280
Also, you won't hurt me.

673
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,910
You're heading to Chenliu.

674
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,630
Why won't I hurt you?

675
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:52,670
You already knew?

676
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:54,120
Yes.

677
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,760
I learned it from someone else, instead of you.

678
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:01,360
We were so sweet together a few days ago,

679
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,560
but now, you wouldn't even tell me

680
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,910
something important like this.

681
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,430
I guess I'm still an outsider.

682
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,000
Qi, only by accepting that position

683
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:12,560
in Chenliu

684
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,120
can I have enough confidence

685
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,870
to ask your father for your hand.

686
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,360
What?

687
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,190
I haven't said yes to you yet.

688
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:34,000
Pinched!

689
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:36,560
If you're pinched by me, you have to be my wife.

690
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:44,120
I forgot you're still wounded.

691
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,000
Are you okay?

692
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:45,710
Qi,

693
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:48,800
if you don't want me to leave,

694
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,470
I won't leave.

695
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,910
My brother's will is not fulfilled yet,

696
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,320
and we still don't know the truth about Xizhao.

697
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,230
You can't...

698
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,120
I want your answer.

699
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,360
Go away! Go!
