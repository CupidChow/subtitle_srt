Nothing unusual.

30
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,190
Happy now?

- Qi.

35
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,190
What happened, Qi?

Qi.

37
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,910

Qi.

39
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,630
Qi,

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,960
you're awake.

41
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,880
Didn't you just recover?

42
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,320
What happened?

43
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:50,800
Qi,

44
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,520
I will find the best physician

45
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,960
and buy you the best medicine.

If anything bad happens to Qi,

49
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,440
I won't let you off the hook.

50
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:03,550
Bring some water.

51
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,520

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,880
Young Master, about Miss Sang's sickness...

55
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,030
It's exactly like what Qian Jiu described.

56
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,390
The poison from her pouch
must have entered her body.

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,160
Are you sure you won't save her,

58
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,360
Young Master?

59
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,360
I didn't ask Qian Jiu for the antidote.

60
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,320
There's no turning back now.

Yan Yun Zhi still eludes us.

64
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,800
So let's set up the bait

65
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:07,030
and wait for him to bite it.

And Qingfeng Restaurant
closed down just like that.

73
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,670
Not too long ago,

74
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,950
we were here celebrating
the end of the imperial examination.

75
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,790
It was crowded back then.

(Imperial College)

77
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,950
Sang Qi even announced that important news

78
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,950
about her and Deputy Chief back then.

79
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,230
Looking back,

80
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,720
her enrollment a year ago

81
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,830
was sensational news.

82
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,510
Her performance in the Lantern Festival
was stellar also.

83
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:42,230
And when she passed the palace examination,
everyone had their eyes on her.

84
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,640
I heard she's very sick at the moment.

85
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:50,000
She might even pass away soon.

86
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:54,390
Life comes and goes.

87
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,000
Nothing is set in stone.

88
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,160

89
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,350
How is she?

90
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,390
Qi's pulse is erratic.

91
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,200
I have never seen anything like this.

92
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,480
If it's a poison,

93
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,230
then it must be something undiscovered.

94
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:28,760

96
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,270
Why did you get out of bed?

97
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,550
Lan paid me a visit.

98
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,550
I should send her off.

99
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,070
Lan,

100
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,720
I know my health.

101
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,640
Don't worry about it, okay?

102
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,950
After this farewell,

103
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,920
I don't know if we can meet again.

there's no need

I can't cure myself anyway.

I just want to know why I'll die like this.

as an unspoken yes then.

If only you could stop thinking about Yan Yun Zhi

127
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,470
and stop bringing the pouch with you at all times,

128
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,470
then you wouldn't be this sick.

129
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,230
I get it now.

130
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,590
Zhuo Wen Yuan,

131
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,710
I believe you're not involved

132
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,280
in my brother's death.

133
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,470
But why did you frame my father?

134
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,000
Why do you want to kill me?

135
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,790
Have you forgotten our childhood memory?

136
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,760
You're the one who forgot about it.

137
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,550
I did everything to gain your attention,

138
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,760
hoping that you'll finally see me.

139
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,400
Even one glance would suffice.

140
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,350
But no, you only have your eyes on Yan Yun Zhi.

141
00:10:42,155 --> 00:10:43,885
You forsook our past.

142
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,910
You forced my hands.

143
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,200
The Zhuo Wen Yuan I know

144
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,080
is a gentleman

145
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,110
and a virtuous young man.

146
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,880
He's not someone

147
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,960
who makes mistakes

148
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,110
and blames others for them.

149
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,440
The Zhuo Wen Yuan you know?

150
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,880
You think you know me?

151
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,320
You think you understand me?

152
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,520
You can never.

153
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,000
Because you're the daughter
of the Grand Commandant.

154
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,440
Your father protects you since you were a kid.

155
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,640
Your brother pampered you.

156
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,470
You grew up carefree in the frontier fortress.

157
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,670
But me?

158
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,790
My father made one mistake

159
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,000
and my family was exiled from Bianjing.

160
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,520
Fortunately, my aunt has a high status
in the harem.

161
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:01,400
Otherwise, I wouldn't even be allowed
to come back to study.

162
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,030
I will always remember

163
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,200
those people

164
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:09,320
who stepped on, spat on,

165
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,790
and looked down on me.

166
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,880
I played by the rules and climbed up the ranks.

167
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,840
Inch by inch.

168
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,000
Until I'm good enough to be acknowledged,

169
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,110
to be respected.

170
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,350
All this so that no one can humiliate me,

171
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:31,960
so that I can live with dignity,

172
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,350
so that one day,

173
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,960
when you need me,

174
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,550
I can stand by your side bravely

175
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,670
and protect you.

176
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,150
Qi,

177
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,280
you're my weakness.

178
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,910
Ever since you came to Bianjing,

179
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,000
you ruined my plans repeatedly,

180
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,440
but I was never mad at you.

181
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,320
I negotiated with Xizhao and my aunt

182
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:05,790
to protect you as much as I can.

183
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:09,000
I have expressed the will to marry you many times.

184
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,880
But you?

185
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,440
You let me down over and over again.

186
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,440
You lied to me with everyone repeatedly.

187
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,320
You brought this

188
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,670
upon yourself.

189
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,960

Sang Qi passed away just like that.

00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,440
The Sang family

228
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,710
must be incompatible with Bianjing's feng shui.

229
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,470
Sang Yu died from an illness four years ago.

followed in his footsteps.

I heard he's now bedridden.

Today is the funeral procession of Sang Qi,

but he's not here to host.

236
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,640
Apparently, after today,

237
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,710
he'll tell His Majesty he's retiring

238
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,400
and will leave Bianjing for good.

239

How dare you come here.

00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:14,400
We were good friends.

246
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,400
Can't I say her a prayer?

247
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,230
Good friends?

248
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,350
I am afraid Sang Qi didn't think so.

249
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,110
Aren't you afraid that
she might come back and haunt you?

but we will settle the score in the future.

I'll be there, waiting for you, Yan Xiao Lang.

Move!

256

allow him to see you.

259
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,830
Forgive me, Qi.

260
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,430
He's here as expected.

261
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,070
Song Luo Tian, arrest him.

262

Honor the dead.

263
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,230
He doesn't look like he'll flee.

264
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,430
Why not let him say his prayer

265
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:02,000
before arresting him?

266
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,950
Finally decided to show yourself?

I'll be honest with you.

I won't allow you to see Sang Qi for the last time.

(Yulei Hall)

300
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,280
I was sleeping soundly.

301
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,880
And you had to wake me up.

302
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:04,310
Look around you. Just plead guilty already.

303
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,430
I look back to where the wind rustles.

304
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:15,350
But no matter, I shall walk with no fear
of the rain or the sun.

305

You're still in the mood for poetry?

306
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,280
Oh well, let me tell you something then.

307
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,880
Escorting Yan San Lang to the mountain back then

308
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,280
was a great strategy.

309
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,760
However, his body failed him.

310
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,640
Grand Commandant Sang,

311
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,880
after the loss of both his children,

312
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:38,070
is in grief and is now bedridden.

313
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:42,280
He hasn't been attending the court
for several days.

314
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,070
As for the Yan family...

315
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,230
Although you're not involved with them anymore,

316
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,640
the Chancellor, magnanimous as he can be,

317
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,800
still has to show sincerity.

318
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,800
He is now reflecting upon himself.

319
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:02,920
The other Yan family...

320
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,710
Need I say more?

321
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,560
Yan Yan is but

322
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,070
a low-ranking official.

323
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,110
Restoring honor to his family

324
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:15,000
is impossible.

325
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,350
The loyal sidekick of the Song family

326
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,760
is now...

327
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:22,040
as tame as a lamb.

328
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,560
It seems like

329
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,310
congratulations are in order, Official Zhuo.

330
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:31,560
From the commoners to His Majesty,

331
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,950
everyone is counting on you.

332
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,680
Whatever you tried to achieve,

333
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,560
I won't do it.

334
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:49,760
Official Zhuo,

335
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:51,070
ultimately,

336
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:53,230
you're still the son of a criminal.

337
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,520
If the Imperial College

338
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,520
didn't accept and educate you,

339
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,350
you wouldn't be who you are now.

340
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:01,400
Do not mention my father.

341
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,950
He's incapable.

342
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:04,230
I'm not him.

343
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,110
I made myself into who I am today.

344
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,350
It has nothing to do with him.

345
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,070
I won.

346
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,190
Is that so?

347
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,520
Zhuo Wen Yuan,

348
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,350
Sang Qi is not here anymore.

349
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:32,310
Is winning that important?

350
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,310
Let's say you possess immense power and wealth

351
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:40,040
like you always coveted,

352
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,190
but Sang Qi is gone.

353
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:43,880
Are they worth it?

354
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,950
I thought hard about that question.

355
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,830
I wanted to answer properly

356
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,430
and picked my option carefully.

357
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,680
But Qi never gave me a chance to.

358
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:06,280
You guys

359
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:10,160
forced me to be like this.

360
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,310
Yan Yun Zhi.

361
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,760
What's so funny?

362
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,760
Why are you laughing?

363
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,190
I know you won't let me go.

364
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:27,040
I know I won't have long to live.

365
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,560
But I feel sorry for you.

366
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,470
In terms of losses,

367
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,160
you lost more than I did.

368
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,680
I can kill you now, you know?

369
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,950
Make it quick then.

370
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:44,920
Talking might make you change your mind.

371
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:58,710
What?

372
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,000
You changed your mind?

373
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,580
(Prefecture Court)

374
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,710
Young Master,

375
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,590
perhaps you'd like to get changed

376
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,680
before meeting your aunt?

377
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,110
Just to get rid of the bad luck.

378
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:31,760
No need for that.

379
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,950
Bad luck is miles away from me.

380
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,280
Let's enter the palace.

381
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,640
Yes.

382
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,320
(Prefecture Court)

383
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,580
(Prefecture Court)

384
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:13,950
The rogue minister that colluded with Xizhao,
Yan Yun Zhi,

385
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,070
has now been arrested.

386
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,160
He is now kept in the Prefecture Court.

387
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:21,310
His Majesty appointed Official Xiao
to trial him.

388
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,950
With the ledger, the eye-witness,

389
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,040
as well as the criminal motive

390
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,590
of long-suppressed discontent
towards his commoner origin,

391
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:30,190
he has confessed.

392
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:33,400
No need to worry about it anymore, Aunt.

393
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:37,800
Hiring hitman, colluding with
unscrupulous parties,

394
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:40,230
and jeopardizing the safety of officials,

395
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,520
all of them are serious crimes.

396
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,160
Better get rid of such a pest early.

397
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,470
Yes.

398
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,310
Only with a clean slate,

399
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:53,070
we can re-establish the orders.

400
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,470
I have repaired the water route

401
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,160
and land route.

402
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,110
They will be back in operation in a few days.

403
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,310
Now that Xizhao is not here to share the profit,

404
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,920
we will earn more than before.

405
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,310
With this money,

406
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,470
we can have a bigger goal

407
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:16,920
and bribe more people.

408
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,680
Keep the money well.

409
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,760
Don't keep it in your residence again.

410
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:24,920
Don't worry.

411
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:27,280
I have transferred it away
before anything occurs.

412
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:30,800
It's now in a very, very safe place.

413
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:35,880
If your father

414
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,230
was half as smart as you,

415
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,590
he wouldn't have butchered the plan

416
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,470
and paid with his head as the scapegoat.

417
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:47,040
You were exiled to the border due to him too.

418
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,070
I have endured much pain too.

419
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,760
Our teamwork

420
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,880
brings the fallen Zhuo family

421
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:59,000
back to its newfound prominence.

422
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,190
Our effort all these years is not in vain.

423
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:05,830
Wen Yuan.

424
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,350
I thought Sang Qi

425
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,400
would hinder you.

426
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,880
It seems like

427
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,920
I worried too much there.

428
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,230
I still have much to learn.

429
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:21,070
I should thank you for your guidance, Aunt.

430
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,040
From now on,

431
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,710
no one will cross us again.

432
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,880
They have to coddle us now.

433
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,520
Where are you going?

434
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,400
You're not done eating, but you got up
when you saw me.

435
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:55,040
Am I an eyesore now?

436
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,310
Come dine with me.

437
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,000
Speak.

438
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:07,640
If you insist.

439
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,590
Tell me.

440
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,760
Do you have anything to do with Sang Qi's death?

441
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,680
Everyone says that.

442
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,040
No, I do not.

443
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,230
She's as healthy as a horse.

444
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:21,280
How can she pass away in a few days?

445
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,190
I don't know.

446
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,560
I didn't study medicine.

447
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,310
Also, you're the weird one.

448
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,520
Sang Qi had been your sworn enemy

449
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:32,880
ever since you met her.

450
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,880
You want her to make a fool out of herself.

451
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:37,520
Why do you care so much about her now?

452
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,560
Yes.

453
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,830
Sang Qi and I are not good friends per se.

454
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,830
We're always at each other's throats.

455
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,350
But when I...

456
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,680
But when I knew she passed away,

457
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,400
I wanted to see her for the last time too.

458
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,920
In Bianjing,

459
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,430
only she was bold enough to stand up to me.

460
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,310
She didn't care about my status.

461
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,640
Honestly, bickering with her

462
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,560
was quite fun.

463
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,830
I might not want her to do well,

464
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,830
but I wouldn't wish death upon her.

465
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:22,920
Stop crying. The dishes are getting cold.

466
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,310
Let's eat together.

467
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:28,310
Okay.

468
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:31,430
You've been too busy

469
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,590
to visit your parents these days.

470
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:37,000
We'll pay them a visit tomorrow.

471
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:40,070
Really? Will you?

472
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:44,760
Many things have happened.

473
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,710
I'm tired.

474
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,640
I want to spend time with my family.

475
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:52,590
We're family, are we not?

476
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,590
You finally view me as your family?

477
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,640
From now on,

478
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:03,190
I will treat you well and appreciate you.

479
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:05,920
Jing Mu.

480
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:07,520
Yes.

481
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:09,880
Prepare some expensive gifts
for my father-in-law.

482
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:12,680
It's inadequate to visit empty-handed.

483
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,800
I'm on it.

484
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,360
Thank you.

485
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:29,470
Let's eat.

486
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,600
Am I still a villain now?

487
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,280
No, you're my family.

488
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,910
Darling, have some.

489
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,710
Eat together.

490
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:42,670
Eat.

491
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,070
(Grand Tutor's Residence)

492
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,390
(Grand Tutor's Residence)

493
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:49,670
Father, where's my mother?

494
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:53,630
I have something to tell my son-in-law.

495
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,910
Go find your mother in the room at the back.

496
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,870
But Father!

497
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,430
Behave.

498
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,470
Fine, I'll leave you two alone.

499
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:04,080
Go.

500
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,080
My son-in-law,

501
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:16,470
I heard you solved the Xizhao case.

502
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:18,600
That's an impressive feat.

503
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,560
I heard Yan Yun Zhi pled guilty too.

504
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:41,430
Yan Yun Zhi

505
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:44,870
can't escape anymore.

506
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:45,800
Of course.

507
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,630
About the ledger...

508
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,910
Gone. Naturally.

509
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,560
Father-in-law,

510
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,710
I hope you learned your lesson.

511
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:01,390
Your brain should be your ledger.

512
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,280
Don't rely on pen and paper.

513
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,080
Duly noted.

514
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:10,390
Then can we...

515
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,230
My son-in-law.

516
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,360
Look.

517
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:19,120
We're a family now.

518
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,840
Everything I did

519
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,360
was for my family.

520
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,280
It was also for you and your aunt.

521
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:29,840
So I...

522
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,430
We're behind three or four batches now.

523
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:40,560
The south is humid,
unsuitable for prolonged storage.

524
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,000
We risk losing a lot of money.

525
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,430
If there's no problem,

526
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,190
we can put everything in motion.

527
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,870
Everyone will be happy to see that.

528
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,190
So...?

529
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:50,520
I have talked to my aunt.

530
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:51,870
She's okay with it.

531
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:54,280
The case is now closed.

532
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,390
Official Xiao is writing the judgment
as we speak.

533
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,280
Since the case is closed,

534
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,760
it won't raise a lot of attention.

535
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:03,950
So

536
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:06,040
can we bring the goods in then?

537
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:06,520
Yes.

538
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,950
Profit attracts people

539
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,910
as quickly as it leads them away.

540
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:14,600
Stagnant goods mean bad business.

541
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:19,560
It creates disgruntlement too.

542
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:20,760
Definitely.

543
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:24,470
You're wise, my son-in-law.

544
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,040
Stop.

545
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:47,190
Sir, this is the customs clearance pass.

546
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:50,630
Have a look.

547
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:53,690
(Customs Clearance Pass)

548
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:01,190
You can go now.

549
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:17,950
I would like to meet His Majesty
and report something important.

550
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:18,910
Please convey my message.

551
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,000
As per His Majesty's order,

552
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:37,320
search this place!

553
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:38,390
Yes!

554
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:50,620
(Contract)

555
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:04,950
Sir, I found something.

556
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:06,670
Sir, I found something.

557
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:18,000
Sir, the snitch in the Prefecture Court
has been identified.

558
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,360
How?

559
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,080
It's...

560
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,390
Speak. Don't hesitate.

561
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:24,870
I'm sure I saw it clearly,

562
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,470
