Qi.

31
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,910
Why do you keep your head down?

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,910
You didn't do well?

33
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,230
I feel a bit strange.

34
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,480
What is it?

35
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,270
I studied hard before the examination.

36
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,590
But as I handed in the paper,

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,630
my body felt empty.

38
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,950
My heart became empty, too.

39
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,470
Deputy Chief.

40
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,880
It is over now?

41
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:21,960
Yes.

42
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,880
Qi, your imperial examination is over.

43
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,550
But for us,

44
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,550
this is just the start.

(Imperial Examination Hall)

46
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,910
Everyone, the imperial examination
is officially over.

47
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,910
You've worked hard all this while.

48
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,000
How strange.

49
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,830
We don't need to go to class now.

50
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,520
But there's a sense of emptiness.

51
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,550
Right.

52
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,520
All this while,

53
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,550
I've been going back and forth
between my residence and Imperial College.

54
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,000
Now I don't know where to go.

55
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,240
Qi, are you going back to your residence?

56
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:07,920
I'm not going back.

57
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,110
My father will keep asking things for sure.

58
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,080
I don't want to go back.

59
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,670
Me as well.

60
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,190
Since you all don't want to go back,

61
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,600
we did arrange something.

62
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,720
The metropolitan examination

63
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,000
is finally over.

64
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,550
But for the palace examination,

65
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,360
you have to rely on yourselves.

66
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,910
We as teachers

67
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,630
can't help much.

68
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,270
To cope with the imperial examination,

69
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,030
we assigned plenty of laborious revision tasks

70
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,720
for you.

71
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,960
We all know

72
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,320
that you've put in a lot of effort.

73
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,550
We appreciate your hard work.

74
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,440
Therefore, to make up for...

75
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,830
All right, Feng.

76
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,160
You should hurry up.

77
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,190
We intend

78
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,390
to take all relax later.

79
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:51,800
Relax?

80
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:52,720
It's on us.

81
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,240
You can choose where to go

82
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,470
and what to do.

83
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,910
Really?

Let's go to...

Qingfeng Restaurant.

86

Let's go.

Let's go.

88
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:06,830
Are we going there?

89
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:07,390
Sure.

90
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,390
Qingfeng Restaurant for real?

91
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:08,800
Let's go.

Welcome.

94
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:21,670
It's rare to see teachers and students

95
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,760
from the Imperial College come here.

96
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,440
I guess you've finished your examination

97
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,720
and come here to relax.

98
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,440
Am I right, Mr. Zhuo?

99
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,040
How brilliant Miss Qian Jiu is.

100
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,320
In this case,

101
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,760
it's on me.

102
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,070
Miss Qian Jiu, it's okay.

103
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,830
Deputy Chief Yan, please don't refuse.

104
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,510
I believe you're all tired

105
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,880
from the examination.

106
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,270
Please relax. It's on me.

107
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,510
Madam Zhang, serve them well.

108
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,510
Sure.

109
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,550
Please go upstairs, everyone.

110
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,440
Please come this way.

111
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,350
Mr. Feng.

112
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,760
Since you're here,

113
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,510
why didn't you greet me?

114
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,760
Well...

115
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,640
Who is Mr. Feng?

116
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,550
Who is Mr. Feng?

117
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,510
I've seen you long ago.

118
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,040
You don't have to avoid me.

119
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,110
Or did you forget me

120
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,790
as we haven't met for a decade?

121
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,550
Do you know each other?

122
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,480
We've known each other for long.

123
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:39,720
Well...

124
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,720
All right, I don't want to embarrass you.

125
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,350
Today, we'll give you a discount.

126
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,110
I'll be there for you.

127
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,670
Great!

128
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,160
Nice!

129
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,440
This way, please.

130
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,830
Mr. Feng, this way.

131
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,350
Let's go in, everyone.

132
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,040
Let's go in.

133
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,760
This way, please.

134
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,160
This way.

135
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,650
(Feng Ai)

136
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,790
All of you look radiant with dignified manners.

137
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,600
You're going to be the officials.

138
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:14,040
I'm sure you'll pass the examination.

139
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:28,760
Mr. Zhuo, I'll appreciate your guidance
in the future.

140
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,950
Miss Qian Jiu really knows things well.

141
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,760
She knows Zhuo is most likely

142
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,200
to pass the examination.

143
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,880
Not like us.

144
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,550
As long as we don't drag Deputy Chief down,

145
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,950
we're satisfied enough.

146
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,160
I'm kind of worried

147
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,720
as you said so.

148
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,830
What if we didn't do well

149
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,550
and burden Deputy Chief's future?

150
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,270
Sang Qi.

151
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,350
Don't say so.

152
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,070
Tell me. Did you try your best?

153
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,550
Of course I did!

154
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,350
That's enough then.

155
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,160
Same to all.

156
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,510
The imperial examination is an opportunity

157
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,160
to examine your learning outcomes.

158
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,480
Speaking of fame,

159
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,760
it's the stepping stone to your future career.

160
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:12,880
It has nothing to do with me.

161
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,800
Same to me.

162
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,200
His Majesty is examining my working ability

163
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,600
at the Imperial College.

164
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,390
But of course,

165
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,830
if I can't continue to stay,

166
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,760
all of you have the responsibilities.

167
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,230
Mr. Feng.

168
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,830
You weren't like this when you were young.

169
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,550
All the students are looking at us.

170
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,950
We won't look at you.

171
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,480
Deputy Chief, just act as usual.

172
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,070
Okay.

173
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,270
Do you mean I often come here?

174
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,040
I don't know her at all!

175
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,110
Am I right, Hua?

176
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:08,160
Mr. Yan, I heard that you rejected Miss Su.

177
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,920
Is it true?

178
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,510
Since you don't deny it,

179
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,350
we'll call it true.

180
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,880
Are you already in love with someone?

181
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,600
Miss Su is so beautiful and intelligent.

182
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:25,640
But you don't even like her.

183
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:29,270
Which kind of girl do you like?

184
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,600
Could you please tell us?

185
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,230
So that you can open our eyes.

186
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,070
Right.

187
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:37,070
We'd like to know who she is.

188
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,200
So that we can learn from her.

189
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,440
Please drink.

190
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:41,880
It's okay.

191
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,280
I don't drink much.

192
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,200
Just drink it, please.

193
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,110
Just a little.

194
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:45,670
I just drank it.

195
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,030
Scholar Feng! Scholar Huo!

196
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:47,910
Please.

197
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:48,840
You may ask them.

198
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:50,790
Please ask them to drink.

199
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,150
- You may have it.
- Mr. Yan.

200
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,470
- Just drink some.
- I really can't.

201
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,520
Thank you for that.

202
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,840
Well...

203
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,550
Whoever wants Deputy Chief Yan to drink,

204
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,320
just let me have it.

205
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,440
I'll drink it.

206
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,280
I do have a girl

207
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,910
that I'm fond of.

208
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,910
Gentle and sincere.

209
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,350
Having good manners.

210
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,910
Beautiful and intelligent.

211
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,710
Virtuous.

212
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,790
All of these don't describe her.

213
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,440
Or I can say

214
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,400
these are the opposite of her.

215
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,880
She's free and easy.

216
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,150
Clever yet mischievous.

217
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,640
She's totally different from the young lady

218
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,550
that you think.

219
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,550
But I like this kind of her.

220
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,200
I like this kind of

221
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,470
Sang Qi.

222
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,670
Deputy Chief, you finally say it!

223
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,030
I can't hold it anymore!

224
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,150
Let me tell you.

225
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,470
When we were on the mountain,

226
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,110
I already...

227
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:22,440
Yan Yan!

228
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,670
Deputy Chief Yan, it's not easy
to be the Sang family's son-in-law.

229
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,150
I think there's no problem.

230
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,710
Come on, let's drink.

231
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,320
I've long realized

232
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,350
Deputy Chief Yan behaves differently to Sang Qi.

233
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,960
But you didn't find it strange.

234
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,350
I've long known

235
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,550
there'd be a marriage from the Imperial College.

236
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,080
Forget it.

237
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,350
You always tell terrible fortune.

238
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,910
When did you tell a marriage?

239
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,670
Qi.

240
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,760
Just sit here.

241
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,640
Let's drink.

242
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,760
I'm that girl.

243
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,880
What a surprise, right?

244
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,400
Come on, bottoms up.

245
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,820

249
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:52,200
(Grand Commandant's Residence)

250
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:53,960
We're here.

251
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,880
Thank you for taking me home, Deputy Chief.

252
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,110
Tomorrow...

253
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,840
No need to go to the Imperial College now.

254
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:08,400
Young Lady, you ate too much at night.

255
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,960
I'm afraid it's hard for you to digest.

256
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,710
How about you go for a walk and then come back?

257
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,110
Right.

258
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,400
I ate too much. It's hard to digest.

259
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,030
Deputy Chief, is it hard for you?

260
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,230
I'll accompany you.

261
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,350
I'll go back and tell Master.

262
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,910
Deputy Chief, please take care of Young Lady.

264
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,710
Go back with me to rest.

265
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:40,960
Let's go.

266
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,350

267
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,710
What are you doing?

268
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,640
Deputy Chief.

269
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,030
The imperial examination is over.

270
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,030
Stop calling me Deputy Chief.

271
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,350
Just call me Yun Zhi from now on.

272
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,520
Yun...

273
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:10,470

Even if I'm not in the Imperial College,

276

you're still my Deputy Chief.

277
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,640
I just think that Yun Zhi sounds more intimate

278
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,030
than Deputy Chief.

279
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,910
But I think it's more comfortable
to call you Deputy Chief.

280
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:25,960
All right then.

281

Of course.

342
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,590
But I don't mean this.

343
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,000
Qi.

344
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,790
After the vesting ceremony,

345
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,150
I'll come to Grand Commandant's Residence
to ask for your father's blessing.

346
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,080
Okay.

347
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,760
What time is it now?

348
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,000
You're going to be late.

349
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,030
The result won't change.

350
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,000
It doesn't matter when to go.

351
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,320
That's not it.

352
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,440
Lian Pian, where's Sang Qi?

353
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,200
She's in Young Master's study.

354
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:56,640
Brother.

355
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,110
The result of the exam will be out today.

356
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,030
I'm not nervous at all.

357
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,840
I'm just a bit flustered.

358
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,880
I really don't dare to see it.

359
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,560
But the result is there, no matter I check it or not.

360
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:15,590
I'll have to know it sooner or later.

361
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,280
Forget it.

362
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,400
Maybe later?

363
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,680
Deputy Chief said it's all right.

364
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,470
But I'm afraid I will fail the exam

365
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,710
and ruin your plan.

366
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,560
I can't afford it.

367
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:32,070
For Critical Thinking.

368
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,560
I think the word count for
Critical Thinking is enough.

369
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,880
For Writing,

370
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,920
we have to answer based on the topic

371
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,110
and the teacher's mood.

372
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,280
Well...

373
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:52,760
Brother.

374
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,830
You'll bless me, right?

375
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,190
If I ruin it,

376
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,110
you won't blame me, right?

377
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,110
Finally, you come out.

378
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:19,920
Let's go now.

379
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,560
Right.

380
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,520
I heard it's filled with people.

381
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,590
If we don't go yet, we can't see it.

382
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:23,680
Wait a minute.

383
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,710
What did you say?

384
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,310
It's filled with people?

385
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,000
There's a lot of people.

386
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,110
If I don't pass the examination,

387
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,520
I'll be embarrassed.

388
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,710
How about you go on behalf of me?

389
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,280
Tell me after you see the result.

390
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:33,920
I'll go back first.

391
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,470
Stop chattering. Let's go.

392
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,280
Hurry up.

393
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,280
When did Young Lady become so timid?

394
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,350
Where is Young Lady going?

395
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,560
Master.

396
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,520
Young Lady went to see the result

397
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,230
with Mr. Zhuo and Mr. Yan.

398
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,760
Why don't you follow?

399
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:53,800
Tell me

400
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,040
as soon as you know the result.

401
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:56,800
Yes.

402
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,470
Finally, the result is out.

403
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,000
Yes.

404
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,590
(First Class First Place, Zhuo Wen Yuan)
See if there's your name.

405
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:05,830
Did you find your name?

406
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:08,920
No.

407
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,110
You did well as expected.

408
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,230
Excuse me.

409
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,000
Wen Yuan.

410
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,070
Congratulations.

411
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,870
(First Class First Place, Zhuo Wen Yuan)

412
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,430
Zhuo.

413
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,230
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

414
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,710
Mr. Zhuo is such a fine fellow indeed.

415
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:26,680
Bravo.

416
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,640
You'd better look after yourself.

417
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,800
Congratulations, Mr. Zhuo!

418
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,110
Congratulations!

419
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,920
Congratulations, Mr. Zhuo!

420
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,040
Congratulations, Mr. Zhuo! Congrats.

421
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,160
Congratulations, Mr. Zhuo!

422
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,070
Mr. Zhuo, congratulations
on being awarded one of the top honors.

423
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:41,640
Congratulations, Mr. Zhuo!

424
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,230
(20th Place, Yan Yan)
Congratulations!

425
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,640
Congratulations, Mr. Zhuo! Congrats!

426
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,920
I'm one of the top honors!

427
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,590
Young Lady, let me check it for you.

428
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,220
(Top Honors)

429
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,160
I saw your name. There!

430
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,280
Congratulations!

431
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,880
Are you one of the top honors?

432
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:09,920
Deputy Chief.

433
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,880
Don't rush. Take it slow.

434
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,470
Yan Yan. Third Class 20th Place.

435
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,590
Awarded Jinshi's Parentage.

436
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:18,760
Great!

437
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,160
How is it? I didn't embarrass you, right?

438
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,280
Well done.

439
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,880
For you, it's a good result.

440
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,040
You're awarded.

441
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,830
How about Sang Qi?

442
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:27,350
Sang...

443
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,040
Sang Qi...

444
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:32,640
She...

445
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,590
What is it?

446
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,350
What's wrong with her?

447
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:38,430
She should tell you by herself.

448
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,070
Master.

449
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,430
Take it slow.

450
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,470
How is it?

451
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,110
Did she pass?

452
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:08,470
Young Lady...

453
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:11,110
Where's Qi?

454
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,950
Why isn't she with you?

455
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,680
No, no.

456
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,800
She didn't pass. I knew it.

457
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,000
Look, I even prepared dishes for her.

458
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,310
All her favorite food.

459
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,760
To comfort her.

460
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:42,680
Deputy Chief.

461
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:45,400
I...

462
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,310
It's okay, Qi.

463
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,190
Don't blame yourself.

464
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:49,800
It's all right.

465
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,430
Second Class 18th place!

466
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,900
(Second Class 18th Place, Sang Qi)

467
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,800
Awarded Jinshi's Parentage.

468
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,710
Deputy Chief, I made it!

469
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,830
You've made it.

470
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,110
Why did you scare me?

471
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,470
Do you know how worried I was?

472
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,070
That's because

473
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,590
you always scare me.

474
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,280
Finally, I got the chance.

475
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,950
I wanted to return the favor.

476
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,310
Return the favor?

477
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,800
It seems not only

478
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,040
did you learn a lot from the Imperial College,

479
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,070
but you also become more mischievous.

480
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,350
Isn't that because you taught me all?

481
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,520
Or else how I can learn so fast.

482
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,560
There's one thing more.

483
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,040
You become more articulate.

484
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,310
Young Lady.

485
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,560
Young Lady, she...

486
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,000
Young Lady, she made it!

487
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:01,430
She made it?

488
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,070
Second Class 18th place!

489
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,160
My good girl.

490
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,310
What an honor to Sang family.

491
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,070
I have had the foresight.

492
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,760
I prepared the after-party in advance.

493
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:15,070
Master, you didn't say so just now.

494
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,310
You only know to talk back.

495
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:18,920
Where's Qi?

496
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:21,830
Young Lady is reporting herself to Deputy Chief
at the Imperial College.

497
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:22,950
She went to him again?

498
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,190
Does she even care about her father?

499
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,430
Go. Take her back.

500
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,070
All right.

501
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,800
Everything's finally settled.

502
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,110
It's not the end, actually.

503
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:49,590
This is just the start.

504
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:54,070
Yu wanted to change the current
education system

505
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,160
through your study

506
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,830
at the Imperial College.

507
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,040
So that more people can have the opportunity
to attend school and study.

508
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,950
Now you're awarded one of the top honors.

509
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:05,640
I'm more confident

510
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:08,400
to suggest this to His Majesty.

511
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,560
Our journey just begins.

512
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,680
Deputy Chief, I understand.

513
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,110
Have you heard it?

514
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,710
You mean it's true?

515
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:23,800
It's true, indeed.

516
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,830
Miss Sang is quite something.

517
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,920
If I had a chance to enroll
in the Imperial College,

518
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,710
maybe I'd do better than her.

519
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,110
She's the daughter of the Grand Commandant.

520
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,800
We come from average families.

521
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,520
How would we have such a chance?

522
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,040
(Peach Blossoms Blooming)
Father took me here and there these two days.

523
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,110
My legs are so sore.

524
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,830
Grand Commandant Sang is proud of you.

525
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:46,640
That's why he did so.

526
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,190
You made history, after all.

527
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,110
I understand that.

528
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,560
I understand him as well.

529
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,350
But I think it's too much.

530
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,950
Why is he always like that?

531
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:58,110
If it weren't for you,

532
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,110
I wouldn't be free today.

533
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,880
By the way, why do you look for me?

534
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:03,430
I want...

535
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,560
What's between you and Deputy Chief?

536
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,640
Didn't Deputy Chief already say it?

537
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,040
You heard it too, didn't you?

538
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,110
It doesn't matter what he said.

539
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,400
I want you to tell me.

540
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,710
Why must it be me?

541
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:28,160
It's...

542
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,880
Deputy Chief and I...

543
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,430
Deputy Chief and I...

544
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,040
Both of us...

545
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,040
Do you get it?

546
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:52,640
I don't get it.

547
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,310
I mean

548
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,110
we fall for each other.

549
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,470
Do you get it now?

550
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,880
If not, just forget it.

551
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,950
You're so stupid.

552
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,230
I'm sorry.

553
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:11,430
Yin.

554
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,470
It's been a while.

555
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,680
I'm not like you.

556
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,470
Spread everywhere as you're awarded top honor.

557
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:22,070
That's because Deputy Chief taught me well.

558
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,280
It can't be helped.

559
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,350
(Great Learning)

560
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,430
You even read books now.

561
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,400
I want to. Anything wrong with that?

562
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:32,680
(Ten-Year Critical Thinking)

563
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,040
You read Critical Thinking too?

564
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,310
Why? You've taken the examination.

565
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,520
Can't I read books?

566
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,000
Let me tell you.

567
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,400
With my intelligence,

568
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:42,640
I can get a higher rank
than Second Class 18th place.

569
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,070
Tomorrow I'll ask my father

570
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,560
to let me enroll in the Imperial College.

571
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,950
I'm looking forward to it.

572
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,040
What are you pleased with?

573
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,760
Don't you think you'd be able to marry Deputy Chief

574
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,230
for what happened in Qingfeng Restaurant.

575
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:54,800
Even if you did,

576
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,640
bear in mind

577
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:57,760
that I have the final say!

578
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,710
In this way,

579
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:07,590
why does Mr. Zhuo still stay by Sang Qi's side?

580
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:10,070
Sang Qi and I went for a walk.

581
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:12,280
Why does it bother you?

582
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,880
She's with a dandy like you.

583
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:16,590
What if...

584
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:22,400
What if Sang Qi really marries my husband,

585
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,710
others may say

586
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,350
she misbehaved.

587
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:27,190
Maybe I'd be criticized

588
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:28,430
for not teaching her well.

589
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,800
I don't know about Qi.

590
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,280
But Miss Song is slandering us.

591
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,760
We're the ones who're being talked about.

592
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,760
Please look after yourself.

593
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,520
Moreover,

594
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,470
parents' orders and matchmaker's words
come first.

595
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,230
What Qi and Deputy Chief said doesn't count.

596
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,560
Miss Song, I advise you not to worry about it.

597
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,520
It's good then.

598
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:43,230
Let's go!

599
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:48,560
Why did you talk that much to her?

600
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,560
I didn't think about it.

601
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,400
Let's go.

602
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:55,640
I made a reservation at Qingfeng Restaurant.

603
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,430
Let's go and eat.

604
00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:57,310
No.

605
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,040
Father is waiting for me to eat.

606
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,950
I'll take my time and go back.

607
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:01,920
I'm leaving.

608
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,110
Such a gravy train.

609
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:25,920
Brother!

610
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,110
You!

611
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,590
Ouch, my leg!

612
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:28,920
You're so careless!

613
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,190
Right!

614
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:30,000
You bumped into our brother.

615
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,830
He bumped into me first.

616
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:34,000
We all saw that.

617
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,110
You still deny it?

618
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:37,040
You're defrauding.

619
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:39,040
I think my leg is broken.

620
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,760
Compensate me!

621
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,920
If not,

622
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,190
you're not going to cross this way.

623
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,560
Shut up and give us money!

624
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,000
It hurts!

625
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,430
How dare you rob in broad daylight!

626
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:53,350
My leg.

627
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,830
You're quite strong, little girl.

628
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,800
All at once!

629
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,880
A sneak attack?

630
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:31,560
Do you want me to reattach your leg?

631
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,470
No, you don't have to.

632
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:34,280
No need?

633
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:35,880
Let's go!

634
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,190
Go away.

635
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:36,920
No need!

636
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,310
Hurry up!

637
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:42,040
Not bad. Your skill has improved.

638
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:43,760
I don't need to help you now.

639
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:46,520
Aren't you going with me for dinner?

640
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,590
You're going to Bianjing tomorrow.

641
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,280
Why did you come to town?

642
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,160
Your father and you have been taking care of me.

643
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,640
I should bring something.

644
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:00,040
You don't have to.

645
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,160
My father is waiting for you.

646
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,160
Let's go.

647
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:13,350
(First Class First Place, Zhuo Wen Yuan)

648
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,900
(Second Class 18th Place, Sang Qi)

649
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:17,100
(Imperial College)

650
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,350
Yan.

651
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:21,040
Your Majesty.

652
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,640
For this year's imperial examination,

653
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:24,760
the Imperial College achieved much better
than in previous years.

654
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:27,350
(Sang Qi)
Even Sang's daughter is one of the top honors.

655
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,350
You taught them well, indeed.

656
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,000
I'm very pleased.

657
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,680
Thank you, Your Majesty.

658
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,560
I'm impartial at giving rewards and punishments.

659
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:35,710
I said this before.

660
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,190
If the results aren't as good as
in previous years,

661
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:38,640
you'll resign from Deputy Chief.

662
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:41,680
It far exceeds that in previous years.
You should be rewarded.

663
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:44,400
Tell me what reward you'd like to have.

664
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,590
I don't dare to ask for rewards.

665
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,520
But I have a suggestion.

666
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,470
Please consider it, Your Majesty.

667
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,120
(Report)

668
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,470
(Recruiting female students...)

669
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,560
Your Majesty,

670
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,190
please expand the scale of recruiting
female students in the Imperial College.

671
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,640
Your Majesty, it shouldn't be.

672
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,470
Grand Tutor Song, what do you think?

673
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:21,590
Since the establishment of the dynasty,

674
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,950
the Imperial College has been
the highest institution of learning.

675
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,310
For hundreds of years,

676
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:28,070
we only recruited one female student, Sang Qi.

677
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:31,560
This exception has broken the rule.

678
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,470
If it goes on like this,

679
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:36,430
that's absolutely a no.

680
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,760
Pardon me, Grand Tutor Song.

681
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:41,760
Although the Imperial College
doesn't recruit female students,

682
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:43,880
there's no rule

683
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,280
that female students can't be recruited.

684
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,040
Does it even break the rule?

685
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:48,800
Sang Qi enrolled in college.

686
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:51,110
A lot of people are already criticizing it.

687
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,400
But after Sang Qi passed the exam,

688
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,000
many people held a positive
attitude towards this.

689
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,310
Many females are also eager

690
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,230
to have such a chance.

691
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,190
That's because...

692
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:57,830
All right.

693
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,230
It can't be decided solely by the two of you.

694
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:06,190
But I think Yan's suggestion

695
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:08,760
is worth discussing.

696
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,470
Yan.

697
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:13,760
The vesting ceremony will be held
in the Imperial College soon, right?

698
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:17,000
Your Majesty, it's been well-prepared.

These are meaningful to scholars.

702
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,640

take responsibility.

703

Order received, Your Majesty.

go out together now?

817
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:13,080
it was badly ill at the North Frontier.

I was stranded in the frontier fortress
when I was a child.

836
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,870
Only you treated me fairly.

837
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,320
After we separated, we sent letters to each other.

838
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:23,280
For me who lives alone in Bianjing,

839
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,280
you're my one and only friend.

840
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,390
The moment I saw you

841
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:28,470
I've made up my mind.

(So I asked Miss Qian Jiu to help you.)

Qi, actually I...

850
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:52,600
