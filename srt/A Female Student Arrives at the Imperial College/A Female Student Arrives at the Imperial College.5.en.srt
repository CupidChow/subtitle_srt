I'm just an entertainer.

31
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,360
How's that proper for me to attend

32
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,050
such an extravagant event together with you?

33
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,530
Let's not worry about the formality today.

34
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,170
As long as the task entrusted is done,

35
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:11,640
I'll reward you handsomely in the future.

Since you've said so,

I'll surely try my utmost to get it done.

Sang Qi and I have known each other
since childhood.

49
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,290
She's never afraid of anything.

00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:35,290
Good!

51
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,600

will definitely happen tonight.

Sang Qi is getting her clothes changed
at the backstage area.

60
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:08,130
Good!

61
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,210
Young Lady, did you see Deputy Chief today?

62
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:11,770
I didn't.

63
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,240
I think Yan Yun Zhi

64
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,520
is making fun of me intentionally.

65
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,570
I finally got it.

66
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,930
I can barely recognize you, Sang Qi.

67
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:23,930
You look quite good in this costume
of an entertainer.

68
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,970
You'll be famous all over Bianjing tonight.

69
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,650
I think you don't need

70
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:31,770
to go and study at the Imperial College anymore.

71
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:33,650
I think you're better at performing on stage.

72
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,210
Isn't this Young Lady Song?

73
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,810
It seems that you want to be on the same stage with me,

74
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:43,930
but you're embarrassed to say so

75
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:44,970
in order to save your face,

76
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:45,490
right?

77
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:46,530
What are you talking about?

78
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,810
Who wants to go on the stage together with you?

79
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,050
Since she wants to be on the same stage with me,

80
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,370
then we need to help her to wear make-up,

81
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:50,970
right?

82
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,440
Come on. Let me help you to wear make-up.

83
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:54,490
What are you doing?

84
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,000
Let go of your hands.

85
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,600
Let go of your hands.

86
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:08,320
Where have you been?

87
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,600
Zhuo Wen Yuan, what are you doing?

88
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,600
Isn't this Young Lady Song?

89
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,370
I'm sorry.

90
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:17,530
I mistook you for someone else.

91
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,720
I thought you were the entertainer that I engaged.

92
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,090
But with this costume today,

93
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,370
you're going to...

94
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,440
Zhuo Wen Yuan, what are you pretending for?

95
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,650
Don't you just want to stand up for Sang Qi?

96
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,050
What's the point of saying
that I was an entertainer?

97
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:34,810
Believe in me, Miss Song.

98
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,160
If you don't believe in me,

99
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,370
I'll show you.

100
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,600
Mr. Zhuo, the show is going to begin soon.

101
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,490
Hurry up and take a seat.

102
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,440
Miss Song,

103
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:55,840
I bet you'll believe in me this time around.

104
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,250
It's so embarrassing!

105
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:01,840
Go away!

106
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,650
Song Jia Yin, I'll wait for you
to be on the same stage with me.

107
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,840
Zhuo Wen Yuan, you're so impressive.

108
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,930
You've made her blow her lid.

109
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,770
Deputy Chief is unkind enough
to make you embarrassed,

110
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:19,720
but I just can't bear to be so.

111
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,000
I even specially invited a savior for you.

112
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:25,280
This is...

113
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:28,930
She is Miss Qian Jiu.

114
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,770
She is the best entertainer in Bianjing.

115
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,650
I specially engaged her to perform
together with you.

116
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,880
You just need to act on stage later on.

117
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:38,690
Others won't be able to notice it.

118
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,090
Wait. It won't do.

119
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,840
I appreciate your kindness.

120
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,160
But I don't mind making myself embarrassed.

121
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:49,160
Since Miss Qian Jiu possesses excellent skills,

122
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:51,400
she can't deploy that in such trickery.

123
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,210
That won't do.

124
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,400
Listen to me. It's my call.

125
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,250
I practiced for one whole night at home yesterday

126
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,880
and didn't sleep at all.

127
00:06:59,370 --> 00:06:59,810
Yes.

128
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,370
I can still cope with this kind of situation.

129
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,880
But by then, you have to cover your ears.

130
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,280
Lian Pian, let's go.

131
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,810
Good!

132
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:41,210
Good!

133
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,050
I'm the Grand Commandant's daughter, Sang Qi,
who arrived at Bianjing not long ago.

134
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,320
I heard that every year's Lantern Festival

135
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,280
would begin with "Po Zhen Zi".

136
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,400
Today, I'll make the event merrier
by playing the guqin

137
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,400
to wish for favorable weather and a prosperous
nation with its people living in peace.

138
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:02,840
Good!

139
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:32,770
What's going on?

140
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,050
Exactly.

141
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,280
Can you play it?

142
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,280
If not, we'll perform instead.

143
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,760
Exactly, I can play better than her.

144
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,810
What kind of performance is this?

145
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:41,450
Mister.

146
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,250
She shouldn't play like this.

147
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,130
Why is she playing like this?

148
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,810
Perhaps she's testing the guqin.

149
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,130
Mister, aren't you going to help her?

150
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:55,960
She insisted on making herself embarrassed.

151
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:57,450
I can do nothing.

152
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,690
That's right.

153
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,280
Don't play anymore.

154
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,840
Don't play anymore.

155
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,370
This is embarrassing.

156
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,400
I didn't expect this to happen.

157
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,570
Exactly.

158
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:12,960
Do you really know how to play it?

159
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,810
I don't think I can enjoy it.

160
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,050
What's going on?

161
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,280
Why is she playing like this?

162
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:21,720
What kind of performance is this?

163
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,330
Exactly.

164
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,520
Exactly.

165
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,280
It's so unpleasant to hear.

166
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,400
Can Sang Qi

167
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,690
make it?

168
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,840
If she can make it,

169
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,080
I'll no longer have entertainment.

170
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,010
The villains are gloating.

171
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,370
It's a fact that she lost the bet.

172
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,280
What's it?

173
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,280
Yan Xiao Lang's friend can't afford to lose?

174
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,280
So what if she lost?

175
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,450
Everyone knew

176
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,570
that Sang Qi had no chance of winning this bet.

177
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,840
I heard my son, Yan said

178
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,200
that your daughter
possesses excellent martial arts skills.

179
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,520
I didn't know that she's
even well-versed in music.

180
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,960
Grand Commandant Sang, you have indeed raised

181
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,640
a daughter who is adept
with both the pen and the sword.

182
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,280
I'm sorry. This is embarrassing.

183
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,130
Can you play it? If not, go away.

184
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:17,640
Exactly.

185
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,520
Go away.

186
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,280
Go away if you don't know how to play it.

187
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,080
Don't play it anymore. Change to another person.

188
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,640
Go away.

189
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,600
It's so unpleasant to hear.

190
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:25,690
Go away.

191
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:26,720
We just can't bear with it.

192
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,600
Go away.

193
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:30,690
Fireworks.

194
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,280
Fireworks are indeed very beautiful.

195
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,080
It looks really nice.

196
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,200
At this moment,

197
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,160
it'd be great if it's complemented
by a beautiful song.

198
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:38,840
Exactly.

199
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:39,690
It looks so nice.

200
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,050
Too bad. The performance is poorly presented,

201
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,160
or else it'd be perfect.

202
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,130
This is good.

203
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,720
He is exactly

204
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,250
peerlessly charismatic.

205
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:57,330
Deputy Chief?

206
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,280
I bet you must be bored

207
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,250
to listen to "Po Zhen Zi" every year.

208
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,600
Young Lady Sang grew up
by the frontier fortress since childhood.

209
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,130
It's for sure that her musical skills
don't live up to your expectations.

210
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,330
Since she's so sincere about performing
for everyone today,

211
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,840
why don't we let her sing

212
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,010
a folk song of the frontier fortress

213
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,690
to entertain us? Okay?

214
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:23,130
Sure.

215
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:33,720
Good!

216
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,250
Sing a song.

217
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,200
Good!

218
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,690
Sing a song.

219
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:40,400
Okay. Sing a song. Come on.

230
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,280
She's already very good at singing,

231
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,080
but her dance is even more amazing.

232
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:11,840

233
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,810

Mr. Sang,

236
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,690
my son is getting along well with your daughter.

237
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:26,050
You may consider us, the Yan family,
for her marriage.

238
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:28,720
This is not the matter.

239
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,050
You're also aware

240
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,130
that her mother passed away at an early age.

241
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:33,840
So for all these matters,

242
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,520
she makes the decisions on her own now.

243
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,130
I don't have the say.

244
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,400
I didn't expect

245
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:42,890
that you would spoil your daughter to this extent.

246
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,720
Isn't your daughter also spoiled by you

247
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,050
that she's unable to bear any grievance?

248
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:49,960
Look. I...

249
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,960
Then again, it's also your daughter
who intentionally arranged

250
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,370
for my daughter to perform on the stage
this time around.

251
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,930
There's nothing wrong with spoiling our daughters,

252
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,280
right?

253
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,280
Yes.

00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,960
The singing was good! Good!

257
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,490
Good!

258
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,250
Deputy Chief.

259
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:21,960
Deputy Chief.

260
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:23,690
Deputy Chief.

261
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,330
Good!

262
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,050
Did you see it?

263
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,810
Deputy Chief came to my rescue just now.

264
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,520
Qi,

265
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,370
don't go and barge in on their good time.

266
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,080
What do you mean?

267
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,600
Deputy Chief is in a good mood
and performed on the stage today

268
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,330
as he

269
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,450
wanted to show his impressive talent
in front of his future wife.

270
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:48,960
No, what are you talking about?

271
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,930
What do you mean by future wife?

272
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:55,050
Su Jie Yu, the first bluestocking in Bianjing.

273
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:57,280
Young Lady Su is extraordinary.

274
00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:00,010
Yun Zhi, she is...

275
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,010
She's Yu's younger sister,

276
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,050
who is also my student.

277
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,520
(I can't believe that such a beautiful woman)

278
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,760
(is the wife-to-be of Deputy Chief.)

279
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,890
It's so amazing.

280
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,840
Good!

281
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,760
Good!

282
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:22,330
Wait.

283
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,280
Why do you still dare to give the food

284
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,250
that has fallen on the ground to the masters?

285
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,280
Catch him!

286
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:31,840
Don't move.

287
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:33,690
And also him.

288
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:36,760
Step aside!

289
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,930
Step aside!

290
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,160
Stay right where you are!

291
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,450
Step aside!

292
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:53,690
What has happened?

293
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:56,520
Qi!

294
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:57,600
No.

295
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:58,810
Step aside!

296
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:06,130
I'll go and have a look.

297
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,120
(Qian Family's Dried Fruit Store)

298
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:58,690
Be careful!

299
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:10,760
Step aside!

300
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:11,240
Don't run!

301
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,880
Deputy Chief, I haven't had time to thank you

302
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,360
for coming to my rescue on the stage just now,

303
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,570
and you saved me again now.

304
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:33,730
We are really destined.

305
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:34,690
Yun Zhi.

306
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:36,870
(Luofu Inn)

307
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:43,280
Yun Zhi, you didn't hurt yourself, did you?

308
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,520
I'm all right.

309
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,400
I'm Su Jie Yu.

310
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:54,760
I'm Sang Qi.

311
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,160
It's been a while since I came to Bianjing,

312
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,880
but I've never seen

313
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,970
such a woman like you, Miss Su.

314
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,120
You're like a fairy upon closer look.

315
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,360
I'm flattered, Miss Sang.

316
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:06,850
I'm just an ordinary woman.

317
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:08,330
I don't deserve your compliment.

318
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,210
On the contrary, the song you sang

319
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,610
on the stage just now was really good.

320
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,240
I...

321
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,000
It was nothing. It was just...

322
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,330
Then again,

323
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:23,970
I've known you a long time ago.

324
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:28,210
I heard long ago that a female student
had arrived at the Imperial College.

325
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,000
What's more, she's the daughter
of the Sang family.

326
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,090
We really share a close affinity

327
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,970
with the Sang family.

328
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,690
We used to meet your elder brother frequently

329
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:41,880
and were on good terms with him.

330
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,520
You know my elder brother?

331
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:44,970
Qi.

332
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:45,750
(Luofu Inn)

333
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,400
Qi, are you all right?

334
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,880
My elder brother...

335
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,810
It's not safe to linger here.

336
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,480
Don't stay here anymore. Let's all go back first.

337
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,730
Then Deputy Chief, you bring Miss Su back first.

338
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,330
I'll take care of Qi.

339
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,120
No worries.

340
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,210
Miss Sang,

341
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:58,880
the two of us hit it off straight away.

342
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,480
Let's catch up in the future
when there's an opportunity.

343
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:06,380
(Wang's Wonton)

344
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:10,610
Let's go.

345
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,000
The Lantern Festival has finally ended.

346
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:23,970
Hurry up and get changed.

347
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:24,850
I'll bring you back home.

348
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:25,610
Okay.

349
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,970
By the way, Lan,

350
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,640
I have a physical evidence
which I just received not long ago.

351
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:36,810
And there's one more,

352
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,850
the poison which was previously proven
to cause hallucinations.

353
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,690
Can you help me to check

354
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,160
if these two have the same content?

355
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,480
I'll try my utmost to accomplish it

356
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,330
for whatever task that you've entrusted me to.

357
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:50,970
Thank you very much.

358
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:05,160
Why are you still worried

359
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,000
when you don't have to go on the stage
to perform anymore?

360
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:09,240
You previously said at the performance venue

361
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,570
that Miss Su is extraordinary.

362
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,450
How is she extraordinary?

363
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,570
Now I see that you're thinking about Miss Su.

364
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,640
She's Su Jie Yu, the daughter of the
Head of the Secretariat Chancellery, Su Ting.

365
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,930
The Yan and Su families
have a friendly relationship for generations.

366
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,970
When Yan Yun Zhi just began standing out
conspicuously in the early times,

367
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,610
she was already a famous bluestocking in Bianjing.

368
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,760
She's even well-versed in music, chess,
calligraphy and painting.

369
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,000
Everyone in Bianjing knows

370
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,450
that Su Jie Yu and Yan Yun Zhi

371
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:37,520
are childhood sweethearts
and a match made in heaven.

372
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:39,730
Perhaps since they've come back this time around,

373
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,970
they'll discuss their marriage.

374
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:45,120
What's it?

375
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,480
No one has informed you of this news, right?

376
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,690
What are the capabilities?

377
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:57,610
Even though Su Jie Yu is good,

378
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,640
in my heart, you're the best.

379
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,400
Don't take things to heart and belittle yourself.

380
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,730
What are you talking about?

381
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:07,160
I mean Yan Yun Zhi doesn't deserve her.

382
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:08,330
It's too bad.

383
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:14,880
Why would a normal lady become silly?

384
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:16,210
You're the one who is silly.

385
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,930
I thought all the women in Bianjing

386
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,360
were like Song Jia Yin.

387
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,120
I didn't expect to see such
an elegant woman like Miss Su.

388
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,000
She's just like a fairy.

389
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,520
It'd be better if I could meet
her again in the future.

390
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:30,850
Miss Su.

391
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,000
I specially lighted the fireworks for you.

392
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:38,930
"Jie".

393
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,480
Young Master, should we continue
lighting the fireworks?

394
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,730
Looking at her state now,

395
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:48,330
do you think if she's interested
in watching the fireworks?

396
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,520
(Imperial Study)

397
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,120
Greetings, Your Majesty.

398
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:28,690
Yan San Lang,

399
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,610
why didn't you report

400
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,640
the commotion at the Lantern Festival

401
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:33,760
and the poisoning matter
in the Imperial College earlier to me?

402
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,050
Your Majesty,

403
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,120
for the incident at the Lantern Festival,

404
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:38,880
it happened while I brought my subordinates
to inspect the order at the event.

405
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,610
At that time, a crook was going to poison
in the midst of chaos.

406
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,000
And for the incident in the Imperial College,

407
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,690
the daughter of Grand Commandant Sang, Sang Qi,

408
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:46,050
did have symptoms
of being poisoned on that day.

409
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,930
But the meal that she ate
didn't contain any poison upon testing.

410
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:52,090
After inspecting with Deputy Chief Yan together,

411
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:53,480
we've found the poison now.

412
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,930
So Deputy Chief Yan and I came
to report to Your Majesty today.

413
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:58,730
Your Majesty,

414
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,760
I've inspected the food

415
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,730
kept in the freezer of the Imperial College.

416
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:04,280
I discovered that the food we consumed on that day

417
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,450
released poison in a cold environment.

418
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:08,090
After experimenting,

419
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,480
the response shown after inhaling this poison
through the burning of an incense

420
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:12,450
was the same as the one shown
by Second Young Lady Sang.

421
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,520
The two poisoning incidents
that took place consecutively these days

422
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:17,760
are not to be taken lightly.

423
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:18,930
Yan San Lang,

424
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:21,000
you must get to the bottom of these.

425
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:21,930
But bear in mind

426
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:23,120
that you must act cautiously

427
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,610
so that you won't cause panic.

428
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,480
We've received Your Majesty's order.

429
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,160
I'm no longer bothered

430
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,880
by the trouble to perform at the Lantern Festival.

431
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:32,930
I no longer have to worry

432
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:34,330
(Imperial Street)
about giving my pouch

433
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,520
to Yan Yun Zhi in my life.

434
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,450
I've risen from the ashes!

435
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,520
Yan Yun Zhi must have a bad taste

436
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:43,880
to ignore the pouch which I sewed sedulously.

437
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,450
But I can't let such a sedulously sewed pouch

438
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:47,480
go waste for sure.

439
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,520
I'll wear it every day, treating it
as a personal belonging.

440
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:51,930
Let's go shopping!

441
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:52,320
(Pottery Store)

442
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:55,190
(Juwen Hall)

443
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,240
Shopkeeper.

444
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:01,120
It's so weird. Why there's no one
tending the shop?

445
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,570
I guess they're busy.

446
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,880
But let's take a look ourselves.

447
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,160
Young Lady, look.

448
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:09,570
There're so many brushes.

449
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,330
Are they all used for writing?

450
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,090
That's not necessary.

451
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,280
Some might use the brushes for painting.

452
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:14,280
Take a look at the shaft.

453
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,640
It must be expensive.

454
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:16,400
Do you see it?

455
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:18,810
Take a look at this.

456
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,520
Lian Pian.

457
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:22,930
Sir.

458
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,160
Please wait.

459
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,640
This is the best set of brushes in our shop.

460
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:31,610
Whether you want to write in a light, heavy,
slow, or swift manner,

461
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:32,970
or in a slanted or straight way,

462
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,210
they'll fit all the purposes.

463
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:36,240
Very good.

464
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:38,160
Thank you for being willing to sell these to me.

465
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,050
Don't mention it.

466
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,360
Miss Su, you possess excellent painting skills.

467
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:42,480
It's my honor

468
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:43,810
for you to use our brushes.

469
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:45,760
Pack these for us then.

470
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:46,450
Okay.

471
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:51,280
Young Lady Sang.

472
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:53,120
We meet again.

473
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,000
Miss Su.

474
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:57,930
You can just call me Lan.

475
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,520
Yun Zhi and his friends call me so.

476
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:01,880
Them?

477
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:05,610
You can just call me Qi.

478
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,520
Are you also here to choose brushes?

479
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:10,330
I know a little about this.

480
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:11,240
I can help you to choose.

481
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,810
Lan, you're way too humble.

482
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,450
Your paintings

483
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,640
are the best in town.

484
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,730
But I'm here to purchase paper.

485
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,280
Do you have any good recommendations?

486
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:23,210
Then you're definitely asking the right person.

487
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:26,480
Please help me to get the paper
that I always use,

488
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:27,850
and I'll also pay for it.

489
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,210
No.

490
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,570
I'll pay on my own.

491
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,730
It's just paper.

492
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,570
Moreover, this type of paper that I use

493
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:34,360
won't easily cause the ink to spread on it.

494
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:36,850
You just treat it as me
recommending it to you to try.

495
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,400
If you think it's good,

496
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:39,610
when you come next time,

497
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:40,930
you can mention my name.

498
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:43,360
The shopkeeper should be able
to give you a discount.

499
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,610
Thank you very much, Lan.

500
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,210
I was in a hurry yesterday

501
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,360
and didn't manage
to have a talk with you properly.

502
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,850
I'm not sure if you're available today?

503
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:53,240
It happens

504
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,730
that my elder brother, Qing Xuan,
is arranging a banquet today,

505
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,330
would you want to come along?

506
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,000
Qing Xuan?

507
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,450
Qing Xuan is your elder brother?

508
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,240
I heard

509
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,970
about one of the Four Bachelors
of Bianjing, Qing Xuan, before.

510
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,090
Is it true that he got married to a crane?

511
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,760
This is indeed true.

512
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:17,880
I hope you don't mind.

513
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:23,760
Then it happens that I have a lot
to talk to you, Lan.

514
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:24,850
Moreover,

515
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,120
I want to know what happened to my elder brother.

516
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,210
Then this is the right time.

517
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:31,930
My elder brother, Yu,

518
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,640
and Yun Zhi always gather together.

519
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,160
Yu

520
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,400
even kept mentioning you before.

521
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,970
We'll tell you together at my residence later.

522
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:41,930
Sure.

523
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:50,930
(Jianshan Pavilion)
Young Lady, it's snowing.

524
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:52,000
Be careful of the slippery road.

525
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:01,280
(Jianshan Pavilion)

526
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,690
I've never seen

527
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:21,930
such a tranquil place in Bianjing.

528
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:23,570
My elder brother doesn't like noise.

529
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:25,760
He found this place after racking his brain.

530
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:27,640
He named it "Jianshan Pavilion".

531
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:28,520
Jianshan Pavilion?

532
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,610
Jianshan Pavilion?*
(* It means "seeing a mountain")

533
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,480
But there's no mountain in the compound.

534
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:33,090
Not even a fake one.

535
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:36,810
Lian Pian always acts recklessly.

536
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:37,970
Please don't mind.

537
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:38,690
It's all right.

538
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,160
There's indeed no mountain in the compound.

539
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,730
There's another intention

540
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,850
to name it "Jianshan Pavilion".

541
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:48,160
Then please explain to me.

542
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:57,160
Young Lady, it's a crane.

543
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:58,280
A crane?

544
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:08,450
Although the mountain is there,

545
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:09,690
it might not look like one.

546
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:11,520
It can be in people's hearts

547
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:13,360
without existing for real.

548
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:16,640
It's about the return to purity and simplicity
after understanding worldly matters thoroughly.

549
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,090
Miss Su is truly a fairy,

550
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,210
she's not saying something
that we human beings can understand.

551
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,330
I can understand each word,

552
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,850
but when they're put together,
it's beyond my comprehension.

553
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:23,760
Lan,

554
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:26,880
you deserve the title
of the first bluestocking in Bianjing.

555
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,160
The one who is knowledgeable is my elder brother.

556
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:31,160
An accomplished monk said this to him

557
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,520
when he wandered around outside.

558
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:34,090
I just jotted down

559
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,000
what he told me.

560
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:36,760
Then again,

561
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:38,930
I even learned from your elder brother before.

562
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,570
My elder brother?

563
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:42,400
When Yu was alive,

564
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,810
I once learned pharmacology from him
for some time,

565
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,210
and I gained a lot.

566
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:47,760
Too bad...

567
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,050
Qi,

568
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,050
let's quickly go in.

569
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:54,330
Okay.

570
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:55,850
Go.

571
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:00,280
Bai Shi?

572
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:01,810
Miss Sang. Miss Su.

573
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:02,930
Deputy Chief, you are also here?

574
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,000
Lan, you're here.

575
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:08,730
This is...

576
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:11,000
Let me have a guess.

577
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:11,480
Yes.

578
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:12,970
Sang Qi?

579
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:14,930
What brought you here?

580
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:16,570
I haven't had time to speak.

581
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:17,570
Why did you announce the answer?

582
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,050
I know upon looking

583
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,520
that she's the younger sister of Yu
whom he used to talk about.

584
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:22,570
Look at her eyebrows and eyes.

585
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:24,450
I am Sang Qi from the Sang family.

586
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:25,520
Greetings, Qing Xuan.

587
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:27,120
Deputy Chief,

588
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,000
I came together with Miss Su.

589
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:29,450
Why?

590
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,160
Only you can come and others are not allowed to?

591
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:32,450
You're bold enough to talk to me like this

592
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:33,880
when you're not in the Imperial College,

593
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:36,330
notwithstanding that I came to your rescue
on the stage last night.

594
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,090
You're still telling me this?

595
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:40,330
If you had accepted the pouch,

596
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,930
I wouldn't have troubled you to go on the stage.

597
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,930
Then things wouldn't happen

598
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:44,610
if you didn't bet on that in the first place.

599
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,160
Then things wouldn't happen
if you didn't drink that liquor.

600
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:48,810
What do you mean by the liquor?

601
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:50,000
What do you mean by the pouch?

602
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:53,280
Sang Qi, this is...

603
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,120
I know.

604
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:55,570
I've seen him before.

605
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:56,880
Yan San Lang from the Prefecture Court.

606
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,210
He's the one who is to blame.

607
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,880
On the day when you first came to Bianjing,

608
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:02,210
the liquor that you fought
with Young Lady Song to drink

609
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:03,330
was actually drunk by him.

610
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:05,210
All these happened because of him.

611
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,450
It's not the Prefecture Court here.

612
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:07,450
It's not necessary for you, Yan San Lang,

613
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,050
to get to the bottom of the matter.

614
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:11,400
Now I see that it was because of you,
Deputy Chief.

615
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,120
Lan,

616
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,480
here's the thing.

617
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,520
I wanted to give a pouch to Deputy Chief,

618
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,240
but he insisted on rejecting it no matter how.

619
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,690
As a result, I was forced to perform on the stage
and embarrassed myself,

620
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,330
right?

621
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:23,400
Am I right?

622
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:28,360
I'm so envious of both of you
who can bicker like this.

623
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:29,120
That's really good.

624
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,610
Now I see that it was a farce
resulting from misunderstanding.

625
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,450
Let's not stand while talking.

626
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:35,280
Let's hurry up and take our seats
and kickstart the banquet.

627
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:46,330
Sang Qi,

628
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:47,970
this is just a gathering amongst friends.

629
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,120
Don't worry about the formality.

630
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:49,930
You can just be casual.

631
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:55,690
Deputy Chief,

632
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,930
does my face have anything?

633
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:59,330
Why does he keep staring at me?

634
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:03,690
It'd be great if Sang Yu was still alive.

635
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:11,050
Sang Qi,

636
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:13,520
when Yu was still studying
at the Imperial College,

637
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,280
he'd also always come here

638
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,210
and take your current seat.

639
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:23,640
I bet everyone at this table

640
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,850
must be very close to my elder brother.

641
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:28,000
Yu was our old friend.

642
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,400
We used to get together for activities
related to music, chess, calligraphy and painting.

643
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,760
He was able to unite people
yet allow the expression of different opinions.

644
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:57,730
He was poised but not arrogant.

645
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,050
I'd been wandering around outside for years

646
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:01,000
and meeting numerous people.

647
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,120
Yu

648
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:04,090
was the one who deserved this compliment.

649
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,880
But too bad.

650
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:07,280
Those whom heaven loves die young.

651
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,000
Throughout all the years when my
elder brother was in Bianjing,

652
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:11,400
he surely wouldn't feel lonely

653
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:13,570
as he could drink and chat

654
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:14,880
while being accompanied by you.

655
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,330
Thank you, everyone,
for keeping my elder brother company.

656
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,520
This is to you.

657
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:26,520
But

658
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,970
I do feel frustrated

659
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,330
as I wasn't able to keep my elder brother
company until the end of his life.

660
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,120
Since every one of you was
my elder brother's close friend,

661
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:36,050
I have a question to ask.

662
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,000
Go ahead.

663
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:40,480
I heard that my elder brother had
a close friend at the Imperial College.

664
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,360
He's called White.

665
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,330
My elder brother would also
always mention this person

666
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,880
in his letters.

667
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,450
He said this was his classmate
who was very close to him.

668
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:49,930
He's

669
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:51,810
gentle, adorable,

670
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:53,480
clingy, obedient and sensible.

671
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,970
Qi Lang had the closest relationship with Yu,

672
00:32:58,330 --> 00:32:59,160
and they were classmates.

673
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,520
Qi Lang, have you heard of White before?

674
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:03,120
Never.

675
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,050
Perhaps your elder brother was joking with you.

676
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,640
(Since you had the closest relationship
with my elder brother,)

677
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,520
(how could you not know White?)

678
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:13,160
(You're contradicting yourself.)

679
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,730
Anyway, my elder brother told me

680
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:16,880
that White

681
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:18,480
treated him really well.

682
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:19,930
When my elder brother needed
a storytelling script,

683
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:21,000
White would go

684
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,570
to all the streets and alleys of Bianjing

685
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:23,970
to look for the very one for him.

686
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:25,480
My elder brother had a poor health condition,

687
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:27,880
so White would always check out
his medicine which was being decocted

688
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:28,850
to make sure the fire was controlled.

689
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,050
When they went to the mountains
to learn agriculture,

690
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,330
White even

691
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:34,850
carried my elder brother down from
the mid-level of the mountain on his own.

692
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:37,970
When my elder brother's health
condition was aggravating,

693
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:39,450
White was very anxious.

694
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:41,240
He could only put his mind at ease

695
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,640
after my elder brother had comforted him.

696
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,850
Now I see that the Imperial College
has such an adorable person.

697
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,240
I've never heard of him before.

698
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:50,280
I still thought that most of them were pedants.

699
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:52,690
Yu really knew a lot of friends.

700
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:55,280
But Yu can unexpectedly
get along with both of them

701
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,360
when they have absolutely
different personalities.

702
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:57,360
White must be brought along

703
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:58,850
to see us next time.

704
00:33:59,160 --> 00:33:59,570
Yes.

705
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:00,570
Deputy Chief,

706
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:02,520
do you want to get to know White?

707
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,090
Listening to what you've described just now,

708
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,970
White isn't like a human

709
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:08,480
but is more like a dog.

710
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,930
(You're still feigning ignorance.)

711
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:13,120
(I'll see when you'll expose yourself.)

712
00:34:13,930 --> 00:34:14,970
But then again,

713
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,570
Deputy Chief, I guess you must be
very powerful and well-connected

714
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,130
in the Imperial College.

715
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:19,850
I think it won't be a difficult matter for you

716
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,000
to look for an ex-student, right?

717
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:24,280
Why are you always thinking

718
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:26,370
of the ways to instruct your teacher
to work for you?

719
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,130
I was my elder brother's younger sister.

720
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,520
You were the one who had the closest relationship

721
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,280
with my elder brother here.

722
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:32,520
You're surely the most suitable person.

723
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,240
There's a crane behind.

724
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,050
That's...

725
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:48,280
That's the "wife" of Qing Xuan.

726
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:49,000
"Wife"?

727
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,440
Hello, "Sister-in-law"!

728
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:01,960
At that time,

729
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,170
the family of Qing Xuan thought

730
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:04,850
that he'd reached the right age to get married,

731
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,090
so they forced him to do so.

732
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:08,890
No one could have expected
that without saying anything,

733
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:10,650
he put a veil

734
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:12,200
on the crane that he raises himself,

735
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,920
which is the one at the back.

736
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,130
They wore wedding costumes,

737
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,370
then a wedding ceremony was conducted
and they got married.

738
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,440
Head of the Secretariat Chancellery,
Official  Su Ting,

739
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:20,050
who is Qing Xuan's father,

740
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:21,810
was so furious that he coughed
and gasped on the spot.

741
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:24,130
Two physicians took a long time to save him.

742
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,200
What happened after that?

743
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:27,130
After that, His Majesty also heard of this

744
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:28,170
and thought that it was very interesting,

745
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,000
so he acceded to this marriage.

746
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,920
It was a farce.

747
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:32,850
San Lang,

748
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:34,280
you're in the wrong.

749
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,650
Why was acceding to my marriage

750
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,650
a farce?

751
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,130
You're dissatisfied with my "wife"?

752
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:41,650
Don't you drive a wedge
between my "sister-in-law" and me.

753
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,000
But Qi,

754
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:44,850
why did you react intensely to the crane just now?

755
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:47,720
Don't tell me that the daughter of the
Grand Commandant's Residence is afraid of birds?

756
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:48,890
You

757
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,130
really embarrass Yu.

758
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,720
That was because...

759
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:54,810
That was because there's no such
kind of bird at the frontier fortress.

760
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:56,410
So I'm scared.

761
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,520
Yun Zhi,

762
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,200
I know that you're not willing to drink a lot.

763
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:14,370
So I've specially prepared the flower tea you like.

764
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:17,440
I've even added flower dew into it.

765
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,440
It can be used for sobering up.

766
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,090
Thank you very much.

767
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:24,720
Lan.

768
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:26,370
Where's mine?

769
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:29,090
The white cake that you like to eat the most

770
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:30,440
is in the house all the time.

771
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,960
You can just go and get it yourself.

772
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:35,520
Sang Qi,

773
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:37,370
why don't you be my younger sister?

774
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:40,050
It's always said that others'
younger sisters are better.

775
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:49,720
This young lady from Sang family

776
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:50,720
is good at drinking instead.

777
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:52,410
But

778
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,050
I am a free-spoken person.

779
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:55,200
I have something to ask you.

780
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,170
Please go ahead.

781
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,440
Was it because of Sang Yu

782
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:01,050
that you came to the Imperial College to study?

783
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,650
I was indeed influenced
by my elder brother partly.

784
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
But I have my own thoughts as well.

785
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:10,370
It's been a while since I entered
the Imperial College.

786
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:12,130
I've become more aware

787
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:15,090
that the Imperial College should
allow women to study there.

788
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,810
I'll regard it as you're still young.

789
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:19,170
Do you know that this will cause a huge outcry?

790
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,330
I know for sure.

791
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:24,680
But women's abilities are not lower than men's.

792
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:27,050
Women can similarly talk and write excellently.

793
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,330
We just lack an equal opportunity.

794
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:31,090
If every subject

795
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,960
is granted an equal educational opportunity,

796
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,610
won't it be better

797
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:35,680
for the country's future?

798
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:40,370
Let's take Lan as an example.

799
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:43,370
Lan is the first bluestocking in Bianjing.

800
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:45,480
If Lan is able to enter the Imperial College,

801
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:48,200
then the students in Class Sky
are totally incomparable to her.

802
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:48,960
Right, Deputy Chief?

803
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:51,370
You yourself are already in the Imperial College,

804
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,890
why did you need to take her as an example?

805
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,570
Deputy Chief Yan,

806
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:55,920
do comment

807
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:58,200
on the learning progress of your female student.

808
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:02,480
Both of you have the same thoughts.

809
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,480
Perhaps

810
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,480
she can even be your
capable assistant in the future.

811
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:06,680
Looking at her vigor now,

812
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,240
she might also surpass you in the future.

813
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:34,720
The music played by a beauty

814
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,370
is immersive.

815
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,280
Qing Xuan.

816
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:45,680
Here.

817
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:56,890
Yun Zhi,

818
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:59,760
don't you like watching Lan playing guqin?

819
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,090
It's meant to be listened to.

820
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,170
Do stop here, Lan.

821
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,850
I'll make a move first.

822
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:39,890
Qi.

823
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,130
There is one thing I don't understand.

824
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,440
We saw the crane upon entering today,

825
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:47,570
but I didn't feel that you were scared.

826
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:52,170
Perhaps...

827
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,050
Perhaps I didn't see it clearly upon entering.

828
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,130
Qi,

829
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,850
Yun Zhi specially asked me
to be back this time around.

830
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:02,850
I might stay for a long time.

831
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,650
We must meet each other frequently.

832
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:05,960
That's for sure.

833
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,090
Let's go.

834
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,410
Young Lady,

835
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:20,090
I think Mr. Yan cares about Miss Sang.

836
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,600
(Jianshan Pavilion)

837
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,130
Be careful a bit.

838
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:33,000
It seems that I really drank a bit too much.

839
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,570
Did I drink too much?

840
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:42,520
Come up.

841
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,680
Come up. I have something to talk to you about.

842
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:56,960
My Young Master

843
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:59,370
has never sat in the same carriage with a lady.

844
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,720
Is it because he doesn't have a carriage?

845
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:26,700
(Sang)

846
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:30,960
You've drunk too much.

847
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:32,130
Drink this to sober up.

848
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:39,810
This is something with an unknown source.

849
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:42,520
How do I know if you'll harm me or not?

850
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:46,090
I wouldn't wait until now if I were to harm you.

851
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:57,680
I blocked the crane for you today

852
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,200
and didn't tell a soul

853
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:02,090
about your secret of having pteronophobia.

854
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,570
But

855
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:07,170
I'm going to exchange this for a thing.

856
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,960
You need to tell me honestly
about the things that I want to know.

857
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:14,200
If you dare to tell a soul about this matter,

858
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:16,280
I'll make sure you suffer.

859
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,240
I, Sang Qi,

860
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:23,680
have drunk too much.

861
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:24,890
I'm already drunk.

862
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:26,130
I can remember nothing.

863
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:27,480
But if you don't tell me honestly,

864
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:27,850
I'll...

865
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,610
What will you do?

866
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:31,960
I'll...

867
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:43,850
Okay.

868
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:46,240
Since we've already spat it out,

869
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,050
I'll tell you the truth.

870
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:48,720
I admit

871
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,410
that I'm White.

872
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,720
I knew that you were White.

873
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,520
Let go of your hands.

874
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:54,370
I got it right.

875
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:55,330
My elder brother said

876
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,480
that White is meek and humble.

877
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,410
But look at you,

878
00:42:58,410 --> 00:42:59,200
you're so nasty,

879
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,000
you don't deserve to be called "White".

880
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,370
You should be called "Black".

881
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:02,200
I'm not nasty at all.

882
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,240
Didn't you say that you wouldn't act violently?

883
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:03,650
Let go of your hands.

884
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:05,720
Notwithstanding that I've asked you so many times,

885
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,920
why didn't you tell me?

886
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,650
What does it matter to you?

887
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:09,000
That was between your elder brother and me.

888
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,090
He could call me "White",

889
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:10,720
but you're not allowed to.

890
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,760
Why should I tell you?

891
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,960
Then my elder brother even asked White
to let me slack off,

892
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:14,520
but why don't you allow me to do so?

893
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:15,570
Your elder brother also wanted me
to spur you on to study hard.

894
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:16,000
Let go of your hands.

895
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:16,720
To spur me on?

896
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,570
You're almost using a whip to lash me.

897
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:19,480
If my elder brother knew

898
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,570
that he had such a fair-weather friend like you,

899
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,610
he'd definitely kill you.

900
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,720
I did that intentionally,

901
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:24,440
or else you would...
