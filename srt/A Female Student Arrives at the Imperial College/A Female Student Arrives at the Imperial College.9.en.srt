Qi, are you awake yet?

31
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,480
If you don't come out, I'll go in.

32
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,040
I'm coming in!

33
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:00,800
Master Sang?

34
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,680
She isn't here.

35
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,270
Her luggage is gone too.

36
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,190
No one's here.

37
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,270
She already left?

38
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,750
Your female disciple is nothing
to boast about, after all.

39

This is just the beginning.

She will definitely be back.

00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,520
Well, you're certainly confident.

42
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,440
I have suffered as well.

43
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,190
Just wait and see.

44
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,800
Yan Yan, go to your training.

These are tea leaves that just
arrived from the south.

49
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,360
It's good, right?

50
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,720
Is there a reason you summoned me today,

51
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,470
Aunt?

52
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,270
There is a new official in charge

53
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,160
of the place that produced this tea.

54
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,800
You mean...

55
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm afraid it won't be easy

56
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,960
to get this tea anymore.

57
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:35,520
Find a time

58
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,320
and make a trip there personally.

59
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,030
Understood.

60
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:48,910
Father!

61
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm back!

62
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,470
You brat.

63
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,110
So you still remembered to come back, huh?

64
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:03,080
Do you not care about your father at all?

65
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,270
I wouldn't dare.

66
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,670
I left a note saying I was headed

67
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,470
to the mountains, didn't I?

68
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,600
There are so many mountains out there.

69
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,960
How would I know which mountain you went to?

70
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,910
Come over here. Let me take a look at you.

71
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,320
How about it?

72
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,600
Don't you think your daughter

73
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:23,760
became even more beautiful?

74
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,670
I don't know if you've become more beautiful or not,

75
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,200
but you've certainly tanned.

76
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,640
Come on. Tell me.

77
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,350
What did you do on the mountain?

78
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,760
I went to Lingwu Mountain to learn martial arts.

79
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,950
To learn martial arts?

80
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:37,670
Yes.

81
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:38,790
Why?

82
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,760
Is it not enough for you
to practice our own martial arts?

83
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,110
Father, you can't put it like that.

84
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:49,110
The Sang family focuses on military arts
and spear techniques.

85
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,200
But I won't use any of those in Bianjing.

86
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,550
I can use the martial arts

87
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,550
I learned for self-defense,

88
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,510
don't you think?

89
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,390
That's true.

90
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,270
Hold on.

91
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,600
Lingwu Mountain?

92
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,670
Isn't that Yan He Xing's territory?

93
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,000
You know him, Father?

94
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,070
Of course, I do.

95
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,790
How could I not know a guy

96
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,950
who mooched off so much wine from me?

97
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,390
But he is someone who can exchange
over a hundred moves

98
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,790
with your father.

99
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,480
He is qualified to be your teacher.

100
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,600
But if he bullies you,

101
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,510
tell me.

102
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,440
I'll go up there and take care of him.

103
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,160
Master...

104
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:28,880
Lian Pian.

105
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,390
I'm thirsty.

106
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,200
I'm thirsty.

107
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,950
I'm parched!

108
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,790
No, I mean, Father,

109
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,790
you know me.

110
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,720
Who would be able to bully your daughter?

111
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,790
I've had a comfortable time up there.

112
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,720
There is someone to serve me during meals

113
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,600
and someone to serve me tea when I'm thirsty.

114
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,830
Deputy Chief helps massage my shoulders,

115
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,270
(Carp leaping over the dragon gate)
and Yan Xiao Lang runs errands for me.

116
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,670
I don't need to do anything.

117
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,390
I only came home to pick up some necessities.

118
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:58,640
After that, I'll...

119
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,350
So Deputy Chief is on Lingwu Mountain too.

120
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:03,200
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

121
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,270
If it was as you said,

122
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,320
shouldn't Yan Xiao Lang be here
to help you pick up your items?

123
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,920
Why did you make the trip

124
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,830
yourself?

125
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,920
It's not good for Yan Xiao Lang

126
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,390
to pick up women's items.

127
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,880
That's why I made the trip myself.

128
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,510
S... Stop asking me questions.

129
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,440
Why are you here then?

130
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:30,110
I'm here to see you, of course.

131
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,160
I guess I came just in time.

132
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,510
If I arrived any later,

133
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,760
I wouldn't be able to see you again.

134
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,670
You make it sound

135
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,270
as if I never stay home.

136
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,720
I agree

137
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:42,720
with him on that point.

138
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,230
Father, why are you taking his side?

139
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,550
I was off to do serious business!

140
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:52,950
Sit.

141
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,230
Come on. Why did you come to see me?

142
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,160
Well, I had come to tell you I was leaving.

143
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,200
Where are you going?

144
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,550
I needed to make a trip to the south.

145
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,070
But I changed my mind.

146
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,390
I'll go with you to Lingwu Mountain.

147
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,720
Don't.

148
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,880
You don't have to come with me to the mountain.

149
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,480
Just stay here and keep my father company.

150
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,440
I'm going to pick up my stuff.

151
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,640
Father, I'm off!

152
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,040
Why would I want to keep your father company?

153
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,480
Young Lady,

154
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,270
while Master has never spoiled you

155
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,350
and you've been punished before as well,

156
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,070
but he has never made you do chores

157
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,000
and serve others.

158
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,350
Do you actually want to go back to the mountain?

159
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,320
I hadn't wanted to go back

160
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,640
and suffer either,

161
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,320
but Master Yan showed his skills, didn't he?

162
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:47,880
Look.

163
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,000
He went like this

164
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,920
and managed to seize me in a few moves.

165
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,790
I was putting in serious effort
when I went up against him.

166
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,270
Seeing that made me realized

167
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,200
that I'm far behind him
in terms of martial arts skills.

168
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,000
If I can actually learn true
martial arts up there,

169
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,160
I'm willing to become a servant.

170
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,830
But Young Lady,

171
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,350
I think Master Yan

172
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,390
is going to make things hard for you purposely.

173
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:11,880
Don't worry.

174
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,070
I may be someone

175
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,830
who respects her elders and teachers,

176
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,040
but if he tries to make things
difficult for me on purpose,

177
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,670
or does anything unreasonable,

178
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,270
I'll definitely get him back for it.

179
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,200
Young Lady,

180
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,670
why do we have to climb up
the mountain in the middle of the night?

181
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:38,480
And we're both carrying such heavy things.

182
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,000
It can't be helped.

183
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,910
I can't let my father know

184
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,760
that I not only failed to learn martial arts,

185
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,670
but was also forced to do chores.

186
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,030
What would he do if he found out?

187
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,110
We're almost there.

188
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:50,880
Look. It's just up ahead.

189
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You've already said that many times, Young Lady.

190
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,760
How many more "up aheads" are there?

191
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,030
Well, you have to say that
to keep yourself motivated.

192
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,880
We're already at a time like this.

193
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,320
Even if you say you don't need
all this stuff anymore,

194
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,200
I don't think I even have enough energy to go back.

195
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,710
Fine.

196
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,200
Let's take a break then.

197
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:08,710
Come on.

198
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,790
Let's have a break.

199
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,350
Zhuo Wen Yuan? Why are you here?

200
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:25,880
Young Master was worried about Miss Sang.

201
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,760
So we've been following you guys

202
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:28,910
since you started hiking up the mountain.

203
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,080
Qi.

204
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,760
It's not safe for you
to carry all these things with you

205
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,470
in the middle of the night.

206
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,200
Um, well, my master said

207
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:42,910
that physical strength training
is important too.

208
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,590
Carrying heavy items up the mountain

209
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,280
is part of the training as well.

210
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,350
That's enough. You should train in moderation.

211
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,150
I see you've almost used up all your energy.

212
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,320
I'll help you carry your items.

213
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,230
Don't!

214
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,470
Jing Mu.

215
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,280
Yes, Young Master.

216
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,880
No, why...

217
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,840
Why do you insist on going up the mountain?

218
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,400
Give it to me.

219
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,030
It's fine.

220
00:09:59,030 --> 00:09:59,590
Give it to me.

221
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,320
It's fine.

222
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,880
You... you should just go back.

223
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,470
Why do you want to go up the mountain?

224
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,080
Young Lady,

225
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,200
why chase Young Master Zhuo away?

226
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,080
It's great to have someone
carry our stuff for us, isn't it?

227
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,320
You lazybones.

228
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,880
It is convenient.

229
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
But what if he sees that I'm being treated
like a servant up there?

230
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,350
It's fine if he just nags me.

231
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,150
But what if my father finds out about it?

232
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,030
My father will be furious!

233
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,670
What if he has the Sang family's soldiers

234
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,110
destroy Lingwu Mountain?

235
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,520
Where am I going to learn martial arts then?

236
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,030
Huh? Where?

237
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,880
What are you guys whispering about?

238
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,320
Nothing. Don't worry about it.

239
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,400
It's rare for you to have some time off.

240
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,320
Why don't you use the time to rest?

241
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,200
Or do something

242
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,790
you like?

243
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,080
I want to go up the mountains with you.

244
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,550
It's boring up there.
There is no music or entertainment.

245
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,280
You won't be able to stand it.

246
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,000
Besides, you don't like learning martial arts.

247
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,350
So why do you keep following me?

248
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,910
What if you suffer up there?

249
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,320
Why would I?

250
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,200
I told you, didn't I?

251
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,320
The ones up there

252
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,670
treat me very well.

253
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,790
Yan Xiao Lang runs errands for you
and the Deputy Chief massages your shoulders.

254
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:58,320
Yes.

255
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,880
Putting aside Yan Xiao Lang,

256
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,670
there's no way I would believe Deputy Chief

257
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,080
would massage your shoulders.

258
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,440
I want to see

259
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:08,520
how you actually fare up there.

260
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,000
You...

261
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,150
You were supposed to go to the south, weren't you?

262
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,110
Why did you change your mind?

263
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:16,440
Your matter

264
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,790
is more important than that.

265
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,910
If you're doing fine up there,

266
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:22,520
I'll go ahead and leave for the south.

267
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,520
And if I am not?

268
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,520
If you are not,

269
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,400
I'll make them do right by you, of course.

270
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,000
Jing Mu, come on.

271
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:33,710
Yes, Young Master.

272
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,400
Zhuo Wen Yuan!

273
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,350
(Lingwu Manor)

274
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,520
We're finally here.

275
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,270
(Lingwu Manor)

276
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,000
Look.

277
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,080
It looks grand, doesn't it?

278
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:08,110
There are mountains and rivers here.

279
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,230
Also it has flowers and fields.

280
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,790
Isn't it serene?

281
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,030
As the saying goes, "To send..."

282
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,280
All right. Let's go inside.

283
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:14,960
Hey...

284
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,350
Master Sang!

285
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:21,710
You're finally back!

286
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,440
Yan Yan.

287
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:23,910
This isn't training!

288
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,910
This is asking for my life!

289
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,150
Zhuo, why are you here?

290
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,320
Never mind.

291
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,880
Help!

292
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,400
Help me, Zhuo!

293
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,230
Sang Qi!

294
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:36,960
I've returned.

295
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,550
Since you're back,

296
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,110
then hurry up and go to your post.

297
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,030
Post?

298
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,520
What is he talking about?

299
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,280
Where's Lian Pian?

300
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,470
She's outside.

301
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,590
I'll go find her.

302
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,440
I'll go find her too.

303
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:49,840
Lian Pian...

304
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,280
- Qi, wait.
- Lian Pian, save me!

305
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:52,760
Tell me what's going on.

306
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,350
What is there to say?

307
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,110
Sang Qi? Sang Qi!

308
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,400
Now that you're back,

309
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,880
hurry up and do your chores.

310
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,200
Why are you still slacking around?

311
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,200
Qi.

312
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,400
You told me the people here
are all focusing on training,

313
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,470
and that you are well-adored.

314
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,110
That you had people serving you
and taking care of your every need.

315
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,350
That you lived an even more
comfortable life here than back in town.

316
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,760
But why doesn't that seem

317
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,880
to be the case to me?

318
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,320
Qi.

319
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,960
You're not actually here
to learn martial arts, are you?

320
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,320
Of course, I came here to learn martial arts.

321
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:22,760
But...

322
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,440
But I ran into a little trouble.

323
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,080
Trouble?

324
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:26,440
Yes.

325
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,150
Trouble.

326
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,230
How would I have known

327
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,880
that Master Yan would only take in one disciple?

328
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,440
So he had me and Yan Yan duel.

329
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:33,640
You lost?

330
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:34,910
No, I didn't lose!

331
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:37,590
It's because Master Yan

332
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,910
is very kind.

333
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,760
He wants to test me.

334
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,030
See.

335
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,640
He may treat me like a servant,

336
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:46,230
but he never said anything
about making me go back.

337
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,110
You understand

338
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,200
what that means, right?

339
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,520
So

340
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,760
your master hasn't even accepted you yet?

341
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,030
That's not important.

342
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:58,960
Sang Qi.

343
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:00,640
Deputy Chief.

344
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,790
I told Second Uncle that you would
definitely be back.

345
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,440
But I didn't expect you
to bring another person with you.

346
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:13,670
Deputy Chief Yan.

347
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:16,880
Sang Qi.

348
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,910
You know Lingwu Mountain

349
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,280
is meant to be a hidden place.

350
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,470
Second Uncle already made an exception

351
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,550
by letting you and Yan Yan stay.

352
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,470
But now, you've brought another person here.

353
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,320
Aren't you worried that he'll
get angry and chase you out?

354
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:29,080
Deputy Chief,

355
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,880
don't... don't chase me out.

356
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,590
It took me a lot of effort to get up here.

357
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,520
I can explain.

358
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:37,030
He... he won't stay long.

359
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,000
He is just here to take a look.

360
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:38,590
Right?

361
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,350
Come on. Say something!

362
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:42,710
Zhuo Wen Yuan!

363
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,230
Come on, tell him!

364
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,280
Sang, why are you still dawdling?

365
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,280
Hurry up and get to work.

366
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,400
I'll be going now.

367
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,350
Coming!

368
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,590
So your "Second Uncle"

369
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,320
is the master Qi has been talking about.

370
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,760
Probably.

371
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,790
You sure went through a lot of effort to trick Qi

372
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,350
to come up here.

373
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,280
It's a teacher's responsibility
to fulfill a student's request.

374
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,760
I only did what I should.

375
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:10,710
However,

376
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,840
you, on the other hand,

377
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,840
are on holiday right now.
Don't you have your own things to do?

378
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,230
You should head down soon.

379
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,080
Don't waste your time here.

380
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,670
You don't have to worry about that, Deputy Chief.

381
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,030
But I'm a bit thirsty.

382
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,470
I'm sure you'll at least give me a cup of water first.

383
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,030
That way.

384
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,640
Sang Qi!

385
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,960
Get me some wine!

386
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,440
Didn't you want a cup of water?

387
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,200
I'm not thirsty anymore all of a sudden.

388
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,080
Sang Qi, I want some peanuts.

389
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,080
Get the peanuts!

390
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,760
Peanuts. Peanuts.

391
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,000
Here are your peanuts.

392
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,840
I'm hungry. Go and prepare my meal.

393
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,400
Prepare a meal.

394
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:10,910
Prepare a meal...

395
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:14,030
You...

396
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:19,840
Zhuo Wen Yuan,

397
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,110
why haven't you left yet?

398
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,550
That's not a concern.

399
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:23,840
I'm staying here.

400
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:24,790
What?

401
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:25,760
Why?

402
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,550
You run errands for them.

403
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,000
Then, I'll be your errand boy.

404
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:30,910
My errand boy?

405
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,230
You must be kidding!

406
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,200
You would be better off
spending your time with those ladies.

407
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:35,880
How would you know if we didn't give it a try?

408
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,910
If you have that much free time,

409
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,110
you should go back and work on
other serious matters.

410
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:43,710
After all, why waste your time here

411
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:44,880
with nothing to do?

412
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,280
Deputy Chief,

413
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,470
you seem pretty free around here too.

414
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,550
Why don't you come back with me?

415
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:51,670
Sang Qi.

416
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,230
Sang Qi!

417
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,550
Sang Qi!

418
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:55,470
I...

419
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,080
Sang Qi,

420
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,910
I'm starving!

421
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:58,520
What are you doing here?

422
00:16:58,590 --> 00:16:59,230
Hurry up and prepare a meal for me!

423
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,150
Hurry up!

424
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:00,590
All right.

425
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:01,880
Second Uncle.

426
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:05,790
Who are you?

427
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,110
Master Yan, I am Zhuo Wen Yuan.

428
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:09,760
I'll be troubling you as I'll be
staying here for a few days.

429
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,350
Please forgive the intrusion.

430
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:11,920
Jing Mu.

431
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,470
This is a Tumixiang liquor

432
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,680
I got from Xijing for you.

433
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,040
As compensation for disturbing you
for the next few days.

434
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:25,070
Oh, this is fine wine indeed.

435
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,710
All right. There are already so many people here.

436
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,920
It won't make a difference if you stay as well.

437
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,230
But I have to be clear about this.

438
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:32,800
I'm no longer accepting disciples.

439
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,190
I only came here to take care of Sang Qi.

440
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:35,590
Sang Qi.

441
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,310
I'm not here to learn martial arts.

442
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,110
Based on the situation,

443
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,830
your efforts to please my uncle

444
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,160
will only spoil him

445
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,710
and encourage him to order you around even more.

446
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:44,830
In that case,

447
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,310
you won't be able to learn anything.

448
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,710
I know.

449
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,470
But there's no way to solve this.

450
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:50,230
There is.

451
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,830
Master Yan, do you like the wine?

452
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,950
Please give me your guidance, Deputy Chief.

453
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,520
If you can bring me such fine wine,

454
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,160
I won't mind if you visit more often.

455
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:00,950
I have a few jars of Bilin liquor
from Dezhou as well.

456
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,040
I'll have them bring them to you next time.

457
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,190
- You must remember
- Good boy.

458
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,520
what I'm about to tell you.

459
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,430
My uncle likes two things.

460
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,230
First, fine wine.

461
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,560
He enjoys drinking like no other.

462
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,760
And second, good food.

463
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:16,160
If you can control his appetite,

464
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:18,190
you can make him do everything you want.

465
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,830
You mean...

466
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,190
Second Uncle,

467
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,110
you have some good wine now.

468
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,920
I'll prepare some dishes
to go along with it for you.

469
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,520
Good girl.

470
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,350
Go on now.

471
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,280
Lian Pian, come and help me!

472
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,590
Sang Qi, I'll go with you.

473
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,000
Young Master.

474
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:44,040
About the matter Noble Consort Zhuo asked you to...

475
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,800
It's fine. This won't affect our plans.

476
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,310
Why are you guys following me?

477
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,950
I'm your errand boy.

478
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,160
Of course, I have to help you.

479
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,430
I'm worried you'll burn the kitchen.

480
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,680
There's no need for you to worry, Deputy Chief.

481
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,710
You should just wait out here.

482
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:09,880
Come on, Qi.

483
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:10,920
Otherwise, Master Yan will be mad.

484
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:11,680
Come on.

485
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,830
These vegetables do look fresh.

486
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:26,560
Young Master,

487
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,190
why don't you go inside?

488
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:33,520
Deputy Chief, I'm not going to burn the kitchen.

489
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,880
I'm just worried.

490
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,040
If anything accidentally goes wrong,

491
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,710
I can at least take care of it if I'm here.

492
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,040
That way, Second Uncle won't be able to say
that I slacked off and didn't supervise you.

493
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,040
Deputy Chief.

494
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,520
I'm here, aren't I?

495
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:44,040
It's because you're here
that makes me even more worried.

496
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,520
Now, both of you,

497
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,470
have you ever entered the kitchen

498
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,830
and worked here?

499
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,160
You've never even been in here.

500
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,110
What are you going to help me with?

501
00:19:59,190 --> 00:19:59,560
I'll cut the vegetables.

502
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:01,110
I'll prepare the ingredients and side dishes.

503
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,230
You don't know how to do anything,

504
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,680
but you sure know the terms.

505
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,230
That's perfect then.

506
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,400
Young Lady, you will be the head chef
and I'll assist you.

507
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:11,040
We'll have an entire team ready in the kitchen.

508
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,310
What do you mean by "an entire team"?

509
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,710
They are just here to cause trouble.

510
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,680
Hurry up and get them out of here.

511
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:14,950
Come on.

512
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,400
Young Lady, it's wrong of you to do that.

513
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,830
Lian Pian?

514
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,640
I am in the wrong?

515
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,400
Deputy Chief and Young Master Zhuo

516
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:25,040
offered to help because of their kindness.

517
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,400
You can't just turn them away.

518
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:27,520
Besides,

519
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,070
with an experienced and skilled
sous chef like me here,

520
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,400
there won't be any problems
like missing vegetables,

521
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,230
ingredients, side dishes,

522
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,680
and inadequate stove heat.

523
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:35,950
Don't worry.

524
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,350
All right. Fine.

525
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,590
If anything goes wrong,

526
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:41,710
you'll be responsible.

527
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,070
All right.

528
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:47,110
Now, hurry up and think about what we should make.

529
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,110
Why don't we make a roast chicken?

530
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,350
You made roast chicken for me several times

531
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,190
when we were in Xibei.

532
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,950
It was aromatic but not greasy at all,
leaving one to want more.

533
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:57,950
- Of course.
- Do we have a chicken?

534
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,040
Zhuo Wen Yuan,

535
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,800
since you want to make a roast chicken,

536
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,040
why don't you go find one

537
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:05,920
and bring it back for us?

538
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,590
Sang Qi and I will work on the other dishes.

539
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,680
All right. Go on.

540
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,710
Sang Qi.

541
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,560
Why don't we make sweet lotus root?

542
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,310
Sweet lotus root?

543
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,110
Second Uncle made some osmanthus jam.

544
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,680
It will go great with the lotus root.

545
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:23,680
You're doing this on purpose.

546
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:27,280
Only the outer layer of the sweet lotus root

547
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,000
is delicious.

548
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,160
The inside is too sweet, so you can't eat much of it.

549
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,520
It's just like the Deputy Chief.

550
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,230
He looks fine on the outside.

551
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,310
But once you get to know him,

552
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,880
he is very troublesome.

553
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,230
Would sweet lotus root be too simple?

554
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:40,680
No.

555
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,310
It'll pair well with the Tumixiang liquor.

556
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,310
No.

557
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,710
If we do that, Master Yan will only remember

558
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,800
Zhuo Wen Yuan who gave him the wine.

559
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,590
He won't remember the Sang Qi
who prepared the dishes.

560
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,950
That's putting the cart before the horse.

561
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,070
That won't do.

562
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:54,760
Young Master.

563
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,190
I got you the item you wanted.

564
00:21:59,470 --> 00:21:59,920
Sang Qi.

565
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,280
What is this?

566
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,040
Cumin from the Western Region?

567
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,590
This is fantastic!

568
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,000
I got Master Yan to come out last time

569
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,070
with my crispy suckling lamb.

570
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,680
With this secret weapon,

571
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,880
I'll definitely have him hooked on this dish

572
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,190
and make him want more.

573
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,800
Then, he'll definitely accept me as his disciple.

574
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,400
You know me so well.

575
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,160
I'm sure it'll turn out great.

576
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,040
Let us all help you.

577
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,800
All right. Let's begin.

578
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,680
Deputy Chief, you'll chop up the meat.

579
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:38,230
Zhuo Wen Yuan will prepare the ingredients.

580
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,520
Lian Pian, assist me.

581
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,110
Both of you better do well.

582
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,520
I won't stay here to cause trouble then.

583
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,640
You get out of here too.

584
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:11,920
Lian Pian, come over here.

585
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:12,560
Come on.

586
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,230
All of them are in the kitchen?

587
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,310
Yes, they're all there.

588
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,040
Here, have a peanut.

589
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,160
Thank you, Master.

590
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,430
Master, I caught it!

591
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:30,880
Even though Lian Pian was the one who tossed it,

592
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,350
it counts as well.

593
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:32,070
Take a break.

594
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,160
You...

595
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,070
Move aside.

596
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,430
Master,

597
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:45,400
you've always favored
peace and quiet, haven't you?

598
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,400
Then why did you allow Zhuo Wen Yuan to stay?

599
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,800
Have I ever gotten any peace and quiet

600
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,310
since all of you came here?

601
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,400
In that case,

602
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,070
I might as well enjoy the ruckus.

603
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:57,160
Well, you still don't need to let Zhuo Wen Yuan stay.

604
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,190
If you're going to watch a fight,
you ought to watch a big one.

605
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,000
A big one?

606
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,760
Have you ever seen a cricket fight?

607
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,520
One cricket may not be much,

608
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,190
but if you put two together and have them fight,

609
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:07,680
like this...

610
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:27,680
What are you guys doing?

611
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,230
Qi, what do you think about my cut? Not bad, right?

612
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,830
Is my cut to your satisfaction?

613
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,070
Lian Pian.

614
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:48,760
Lian Pian! Lian Pian!

615
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:50,760
Young Lady.

616
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,710
Get them both out of here.

617
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,040
Young Lady,

618
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:03,950
Young Master Zhuo and Deputy Chief
were only trying to help.

619
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:05,800
Get them out of here.

620
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,310
Hurry up and get them out of here!

621
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,760
Both of you, please.

622
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,800
How is the taste, Second Uncle?

623
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,470
It is juicy and tender.

624
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:55,950
Rich and aromatic.

625
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,310
It's a fine dish indeed.

626
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,000
It's delicious!

627
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,110
This is the secret recipe.

628
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,110
The leftover ingredients are in the kitchen.

629
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:09,880
This is for you.

630
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:16,070
You are thoughtful indeed.

631
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:18,680
But I understand

632
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,350
that one shouldn't accept something
without giving anything.

633
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:21,950
Don't beat around the bush.

634
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:22,710
Be direct with me.

635
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,430
As long as you understand.

636
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,230
It's not much, actually.

637
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:29,310
I just wanted to ask you to excuse me
from doing all those chores

638
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,640
and teach me martial arts properly.

639
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,560
But I'm not asking you to teach me for free.

640
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,000
I'll take care of everything.

641
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:36,160
I'll take care of all your meals.

642
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,000
I guarantee you'll be satisfied.

643
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,590
I've been waiting to hear that.

644
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,560
It's settled then.

645
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:40,950
It is?

646
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,310
Yes.

647
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,590
Really?

648
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:50,110
Please accept...

649
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,160
No need for such formalities.

650
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,040
No need.

651
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:52,880
No need?

652
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:53,400
Yes, no need.

653
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,640
That makes Sang Qi my martial sister,
then, doesn't it?

654
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,520
Martial Sister.

655
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,110
Mastering the art of martial arts

656
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,430
is a long and difficult journey.

657
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,040
It takes time and patience.

658
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,830
I became Master's disciple earlier than you did.

659
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,560
So I learned more things than you.

660
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,160
If there's anything you don't understand...

661
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,000
Oh, enough with you.

662
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,430
You have a lot of nerve to be bluffing here.

663
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:18,430
I'll be honest with you,

664
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,680
I knew Sang Qi

665
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,590
had the build and potential
from the moment I saw her.

666
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:23,520
I've wanted to take her as a disciple.

667
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,950
Making her do all those chores

668
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,760
was just to see if she is truly sincere.

669
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,000
Am I sincere enough then?

670
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,590
(Wine)

671
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,400
I've been craving some wild mushroom soup lately.

672
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,710
I'll make wild mushroom soup tomorrow.

673
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:35,830
All right.

674
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,760
Seeing as you are so sincere,

675
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,560
from tomorrow on,

676
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,830
I'll personally teach you
the Yan Sword Technique.

677
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:41,760
The Yan Sword Technique?

678
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,190
Great!

679
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:43,760
Come on, have a seat.

680
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:48,730
(Lingwu Manor)

681
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,470
All right. Have you memorized it?

682
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:50,760
Practice on your own then.

683
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,310
Master.

684
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,470
I have memorized it.

685
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,950
But I don't quite understand.

686
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,590
If I just practice like this,

687
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,800
I'll only master the form but not the essence.

688
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,190
Wouldn't that just be a waste of time?

689
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,000
Let me ask you then.

690
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,110
What do you not understand about it?

691
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,160
I can't really explain.
I just don't seem to understand.

692
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:07,920
Look.

693
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:09,760
If you don't master the form first,

694
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,800
you won't even know which part
you don't understand about it.

695
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,110
You should master the form first.

696
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,430
When you figure out what you
don't understand, come and see me.

697
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,590
I have to train Yan Xiao Lang now.

698
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:18,950
You just need practice.

699
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:19,520
Go on.

700
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,070
Is there something you don't understand?

701
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,430
Deputy Chief.

702
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,640
This sword technique flows like a river.

703
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,160
Its movements are natural and subtle.

704
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:41,880
Even someone with a small physique

705
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,880
will be able to unleash great force with this.

706
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,710
But trying to turn such elegant moves

707
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,190
into attacks is not easy.

708
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,950
It's challenging indeed.

709
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:50,040
And the purpose behind
the movements is abstract.

710
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,950
It's hard for me to understand.

711
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,470
Take this move for an example.

712
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,110
This move is called "Wind Touches Water".

713
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,830
"Wind Touches Water"

714
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,560
refers to the breeze caressing
the surface of the water

715
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,590
and creating ripples on it.

716
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,950
The next move, "Stars Worshipping Moon".

717
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,280
Qi.

718
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,070
I guess I came at the wrong time.

719
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,280
What is it?

720
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,520
You did interrupt us.

721
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:41,430
When are you leaving?

722
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:42,830
Well,

723
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:44,710
I happened to get along well with Master Yan.

724
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:46,710
I won't be leaving any time soon.

725
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,920
It's fine if you stay.

726
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,110
But don't interrupt my martial sister's training.

727
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,280
Don't worry, Deputy Chief.

728
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:56,760
I have my own plans.

729
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,230
Qi.

730
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,470
Let me know when you're done.

731
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,310
I'll go with you to pick wild mushrooms
at the back of the mountain.

732
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,040
Young Master,

733
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,040
you're still thinking about picking mushrooms?

734
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,070
The goods will be departing from the south soon.

735
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,110
If you don't head over there soon,

736
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,190
you might be too late.

737
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,070
I know that.

738
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,430
You don't have to remind me constantly.

739
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,280
I'll leave for the south when it's time.

740
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:33,640
I won't let this affect that matter.

741
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:34,560
Yes.

742
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,070
This cave...

743
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:46,190
Is there something wrong with this cave?

744
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,710
Nothing.

745
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:51,160
It just brought up some memories.

746
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,640
Sang Qi and I were in a cave like this once too

747
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:56,830
when we first met each other.

748
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,070
Stop crying.

749
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:14,000
I'm not crying.

750
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:17,310
Then why are your eyes watery?

751
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,950
Why do you care?

752
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,680
Don't be afraid.

753
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:23,070
My father and his men will come

754
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,470
and save us soon.

755
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:26,920
I'm not afraid.

756
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:29,190
Besides, your father will be here to save you.

757
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,640
Who would care about

758
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,830
a downtrodden boy like me?

759
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:37,000
What does downtrodden mean?

760
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:42,800
It... it means someone nobody wants.

761
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,640
Obviously, no one would save
someone nobody wants.

762
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:49,280
I want you. I'll save you.

763
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:51,710
Really?

764
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,880
If no one wants you,

765
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,070
I'll save you.

766
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:57,470
Pinky promise.

767
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:10,640
If given another chance,

768
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,920
would Qi still...

769
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,430
Another chance?

770
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,760
What are you talking about, Young Master?

771
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:23,430
It looks like there will be heavy rain tonight.

772
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:24,880
Jing Mu.

773
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:25,760
Young Master.

774
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:26,920
I have something for you to do.

775
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:28,230
Of course.

776
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:30,590
Ask Sang Qi to come here this evening.

777
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:31,680
But make sure

778
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,470
that Yan Yan and Lian Pian don't follow her.

779
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:34,160
And

780
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,640
don't let the Yans know about this.

781
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:36,760
I'll get it done immediately.

782
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,560
But Young Master, you just said

783
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,880
that it would rain tonight.

784
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,640
In that case,

785
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,800
wouldn't it be dangerous for you and Miss Sang

786
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:44,920
to be here?

787
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,430
I wouldn't have come here

788
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,070
if it wasn't going to rain tonight.

789
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,350
Not bad.

790
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,400
Within a few hours,

791
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,280
you've improved so much.

792
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:13,710
It's all thanks to Deputy Chief.

793
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,910
I should've had Deputy Chief teach me after all.

794
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,000
I mean...

795
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:32,950
I'm not saying that Master isn't
as good as Deputy Chief.

796
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,320
That doesn't sound right either.

797
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:38,000
Either way, I don't regret having you as my master.

798
00:34:38,430 --> 00:34:39,600
Never mind.

799
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,760
I know what you mean.

800
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,870
You think I don't want Deputy Chief to teach you?

801
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:44,630
I wouldn't have bothered otherwise.

802
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,230
When he came to see me,

803
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,320
I told him he should teach you himself.

804
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:50,150
That way, you wouldn't even have to come here.

805
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,520
And what did Deputy Chief say?

806
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,000
He said

807
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,150
that I was the one you were looking for.

808
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:57,870
If you didn't see me, you would just keep asking.

809
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,470
He knows me better and better.

810
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,710
That's exactly how I thought.

811
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,390
And he said

812
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,560
that you have to be the one

813
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,910
to decide all of this.

814
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:09,910
So he had to make you come here.

815
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,910
All right. That's enough.

816
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,320
Let's keep training.

817
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,040
Once you manage to learn a few moves,

818
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:17,840
you won't have to

819
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:19,950
worry about those men in black
who attacked you that day.

820
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,280
Even if you can't win against them,

821
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,320
you can at least escape safely.

822
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,840
And my silly nephew won't
have to worry constantly

823
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,670
and secretly protect you all the time.

824
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:29,600
Wait.

825
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,840
You said Deputy Chief secretly protected me?

826
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:34,630
When?

827
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,280
I...

828
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,320
I... probably...

829
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:38,520
I heard it from someone else.

830
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,230
From whom?

831
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:39,760
Whom?

832
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:40,840
Bai Shi.

833
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:41,390
Bai Shi?

834
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:42,600
Probably from Bai Shi.

835
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:44,190
I'll go see Bai Shi.

836
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:53,760
Bai Shi.

837
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:56,840
Miss Sang, what is the matter?

838
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,190
Oh, you.

839
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,390
Your young master did so much for me.

840
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,760
And you didn't even tell me.

841
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:05,840
Could it be that you've found out
about Young Master curing your poison

842
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,910
and how he braved the rain
in the middle of the night to search

843
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,800
for the imperial physician?

844
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,630
That too?

845
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:17,190
Or could it be the time when we set off fireworks

846
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:20,360
outside the Grand Commandant's Residence

847
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,710
during the new year's?

848
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,000
Deputy Chief was the one
who set off the fireworks?

849
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:28,670
Um...

850
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,470
Then it must be the time when Deputy Chief
was unhappy about how the scholars

851
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,910
made it difficult for you during
the examination to enter the Imperial College

852
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,710
and he tried to make things easier for you.

853
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:38,910
Is that it?

854
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,120
Deputy Chief did that too?

855
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,360
Where is Deputy Chief right now?

856
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:47,150
Where is he?

857
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:49,000
Deputy Chief...

858
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,630
Oh, my blabbermouth.

859
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:08,760
Miss Sang.

860
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,500
(Lingwu Manor)

861
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:11,150
Miss Sang.

862
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,710
Young Master discovered
a large field of wild mushrooms

863
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,870
in the back of the mountain.

864
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,280
He asks you to come and see it.

865
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:17,080
But I'm in a hurry to see Deputy Chief right now.

866
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,710
But Young Master spent days

867
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,390
looking for it for you.

868
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,280
If you don't go...

869
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:24,670
All right.

870
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,360
I'll let Lian Pian know.

871
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:27,760
Miss Sang,

872
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,470
it's about to rain soon.

873
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,080
I'm afraid it'll take

874
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:33,080
a lot of time if you make the trip
and you might get wet along the way.

875
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,120
I think we should just make a quick trip
and come back as soon as possible.

876
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,190
All right. Let's go.

877
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,840
Young Master, Miss Sang is here.

878
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:50,800
Qi.

879
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:51,710
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

880
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:53,910
Where are the wild mushrooms?

881
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:55,080
I don't see them.

882
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,560
The sky looks dark.

883
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,600
I think heavy rain is coming.

884
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,870
Let's hurry up and go back.

885
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:01,840
Qi,

886
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,630
you promised you would accompany me.

887
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,280
I did.

888
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,190
I can accompany you on the way
back to the manor too, can't I?

889
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:07,910
Besides,

890
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:08,950
the weather isn't good today.

891
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,630
I'll keep you company on another day

892
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:11,630
when the weather is better, all right?

893
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,040
Come on.

894
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:13,120
Look.

895
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,630
It's raining.

896
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,600
Come on. Let's go back right now.

897
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:16,040
Qi,

898
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:17,760
do you remember what happened when we were young?

899
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:19,040
Of course.

900
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,320
We hid inside a cave

901
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,630
because it was raining that time, didn't we?

902
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:22,470
Do you want

903
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:23,710
to experience something so awful again?

904
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,670
Let's hurry up and go back. Come on.

905
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:25,760
Qi.

906
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,040
That accident may have been

907
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,320
an unfortunate thing to you,

908
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:31,040
but to me...

909
00:38:42,066 --> 00:38:43,555
Qi!

910
00:38:44,133 --> 00:38:45,088
Qi!

911
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:46,280
Deputy Chief?

912
00:38:46,933 --> 00:38:48,520
