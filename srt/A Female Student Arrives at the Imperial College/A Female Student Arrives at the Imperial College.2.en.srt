=Episode 02=

28
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,590
You asked for me finally, Deputy Chief.

29
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,590
Deputy Chief.

30
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,160
Are you trying to assault me

31
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,080
in broad daylight?

32
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,550
Sang Qi.

33
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,630
There's no one else here at the moment.

34
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,360
I want to talk with you.

35
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,080
I want to ask you,

36
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,670
what do you want to stop causing troubles

37
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,390
and stop bothering me?

38
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,960
I've made it very obvious.

39
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,470
As long as you accept my pouch,

40
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,160
I'll be a well-behaved student,

41
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,960
and never give any trouble to you, Deputy Chief.

42
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:32,880
Are you serious?

43
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,080
Yes!

44
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,550
I, Sang Qi, always keep my promises.

45
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,160
All right.

46
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,800
Then I'll make an exception this time.

47
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,190
If you give me the pouch now,

48
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,360
I will accept it.

49
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,360
You're not kidding me, are you?

50
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,320
Of course.

51
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,240
I'm the Deputy Chief of the Imperial College,

52
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,630
why would I be kidding?

53
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,320
But I'll only give you this one chance.

54
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,030
Give it to me.

55
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,240
All right.

56
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,000
The pouch...

57
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:01,910
I...

58
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:04,750
Where's my pouch?

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,630
Deputy Chief,

60
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,800
I'm sure I carried it with me.

61
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,520
However, just now I...

62
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,270
I...

63
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,160
I knew it.

64
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,470
You're not going to gift me a pouch,

65
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,750
but it's real that you disrupted the order.

66
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,360
I...

67
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:13,880
Just now...

68
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,670
That's enough. Stop talking.

69
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,360
I've given you the chance,

70
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,600
but you didn't grasp the opportunity.

71
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,830
But I...

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,960
However, even though you're unkind,

73
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,080
I can't be unrighteous.

74
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,080
About the rumors you spread before this,

75
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,910
I'll let it pass.

76
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,440
I hope in the future in Imperial College,

77
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,750
you will know your place

78
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,320
and devote yourself to learning.

79
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,750
Don't humiliate your Sang family's reputation.

80
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,240
It is strange.

81
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,910
This is strange.

82
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,110
Deputy Chief, aren't you setting your heart

83
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,240
on kicking me out of the Imperial College?

84
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,670
Now that I made such a mistake,

85
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,600
you still don't want to punish me?

86
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,030
May I ask

87
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,080
which teacher in this world

88
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,030
will deliberately make things
difficult for their students?

89
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,630
I know.

90
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,830
I was a little harsh on you before,

91
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,030
but it was all for your good.

92
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,960
I hope you can learn more new things.

93
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,000
I hope you can go through some hardships.

94
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,080
Sang Qi.

95
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Don't ever

96
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,470
let me down.

97
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,470
(Could it be)

98
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,720
(that I misunderstood him in the past?)

99
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,830
All right.

100
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,320
I know you've understood.

101
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,720
Hurry and go to study.

102
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,350
I need to mark the test papers too.

103
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:29,230
Go on.

104
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,230
Go.

105
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,110
No!

106
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,040
Deputy Chief, why are you so generous today?

107
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,160
This is not your style at all.

108
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,880
Besides,

109
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,760
when I went out,

110
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,640
I'm sure the pouch was on my waist.

111
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,070
This can only explain one truth,

112
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,600
my pouch was stolen by you!

113
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,830
Sang Qi.

114
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,200
Why would I?

115
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,110
Where did you keep it?

116
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:12,440
Sang Qi!

117
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:12,830
Where is it?

118
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:13,160
Sang Qi!

119
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,160
I will punish you!

120
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,720
Punish!

121
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,070
You're lucky that you run fast.

122
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,600
Bai Shi!

123
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,670
Anything, Young Master?

124
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,640
Put this pouch back into Sang Qi's drawer

125
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,640
without anyone knowing.

126
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,070
Yes, Young Master!

127
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,830
Young Master,

128
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,790
which seat is Miss Sang's?

129
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,670
The second table in the second row from the East.

130
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,790
Up North, down South. Left West, right East.

131
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:08,110
The second table in the second row
on the right-hand side of the door.

132
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,480
Yes, Young Master.

133
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,040
Hold on!

134
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:13,920
Just walk through the door.

135
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,040
Yes, Young Master.

136
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:27,950
Left.

137
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:28,720
Right.

138
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:29,720
Left.

139
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,600
Right.

140
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,880
Is it left hand or right hand?

141
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,160
Right hand! Boys on the left, girls on the right.

142
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,600
Is it the first row or the first column?

143
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,510
Ah! Young Master!

144
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,670
I don't care now.

145
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,000
It's this.

146
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,640
I'll put it here.

147
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,790
That's right.

148
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:46,550
I'm sure.

149
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,480
I'll let you guys see something later.

150
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,440
What is it?

151
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:58,670
Go in.

152
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,510
I'll let you see my new storytelling script.

153
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,600
Storytelling script?

154
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,530
It's absolutely

155
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,510
(Sang)
a fantastic book.

156
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,000
Yan Xiao Lang.

157
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,230
Why is there a pouch on your desk?

158
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,350
Could it be that a student is interested in you?

159
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,950
But there's only one female
student in the Imperial College.

160
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,510
Is it her?

161
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,350
I, Yan Xiao Lang, have no intention of marrying.

162
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,510
But Grand Commandant's daughter

163
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,880
is too proactive,

164
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,950
which makes me difficult to deal with it.

165
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,040
Difficult to deal with it.

166
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:27,760
Sang Qi.

167
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,350
Sang Qi.

168
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,720
The teacher is here.

169
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,270
Are you crazy?

170
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,000
Stand up!

171
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,830
Good day, Scholar Feng.

172
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,480
Good day.

173
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,760
Everybody, please sit down.

174
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,830
Things have their roots and branches,

175
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,000
affairs have their end and beginning.

176
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,760
Do you want to get beaten up?

177
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,830
When you know what comes first
and what comes last,

178
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,230
then you are near the rule of the world.

179
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,320
Let's go!

180
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,110
Wait for me!

181
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,390
(Classroom)
Hurry up!

182
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:15,790
Coming!

183
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:16,750
(The Place for the Talented)

184
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,000
Let's go.

185
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,830
What you mean is

186
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,600
everything in the world will
eventually come to an end,

187
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,440
and every affair has a beginning and an ending.

188
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,880
Then the Great Learning is...

189
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,920
Qi,

190
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,510
the school has ended.

191
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,790
Can't you rest for a while?

192
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,040
You should learn

193
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,390
to relax while studying.

194
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,320
I know.

195
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:35,720
Sang Qi.

196
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,350
That's why...

197
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,590
Yan Yan asked me to give this to you.

198
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,640
What is this?

199
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,280
Could it be

200
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,880
a love letter from Yan Xiao Lang?

201
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,760
Cut it out!

202
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,850
(Yan Yan)

203
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,280
What is this crooked writing saying?

204
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,520
He probably meant to tell you

205
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,670
don't leave after school,

206
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,230
and meet him at the school field.

207
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,150
He also tells you

208
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,000
to go alone.

209
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:17,960
I understand now.

210
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:19,790
This is a letter of challenge.

211
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,230
No wonder he keeps staring at me today.

212
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,590
He even broke the pen in half to threaten me.

213
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:28,320
Then why do you think he would target you?

214
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,670
Maybe...

215
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,200
Maybe he's reluctant to see
girls enrolling in school.

216
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,840
All right.

217
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,350
Then I'll accompany you to meet him.

218
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,150
There's no need.

219
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,440
I think that Yan Yan won't dare to hurt me.

220
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,960
What I'm worried about

221
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,110
is Yan Yan's safety.

222
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,200
Don't worry.

223
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,080
After all, we're classmates.

224
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,030
I will be merciful.

225
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,200
I'll go first.

226
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,110
I'll come back soon.

227
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:56,910
That's not it.

228
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,790
(Promote education and lessen military training)

229
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,520
Sang Qi.

230
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,000
Seems like you can't wait to meet me.

231
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:39,750
(To Sang Qi)

232
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:41,280
Come on.

233
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:42,960
What?

234
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,350
Why are you pretending?

235
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,400
Let's start.

236
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,670
Wait.

237
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,590
Isn't our progress

238
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:51,470
too fast?

239
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,200
(Promote education and lessen military training)

240
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:52,670
Besides,

241
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,230
this is Imperial College's school field.

242
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,020
Yes.

243
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,440
Didn't you choose this place?

244
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,000
Spacious enough,

245
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,880
and it won't confine me.

246
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,030
Hurry up.

247
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,320
I still have lots of things to do.

248
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,880
It's not like that.

249
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,760
Although you admire me,

250
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,440
shouldn't we

251
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,470
worship first,

252
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,880
and then I give you the betrothal presents?

253
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,520
Why didn't you avoid it?

254
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,230
You...

255
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,760
Do you want to murder your husband?

256
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,000
I...

257
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,030
Just now you said

258
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,230
about worship and marriage.

259
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,710
What nonsense were you talking about?

260
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,000
Didn't you give me this pouch

261
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,080
to confess your love to me?

262
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,640
Why is my pouch with you?

263
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,350
Someone secretly

264
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,400
put it in my drawer.

265
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,320
If it's not you, who puts it then?

266
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,550
Who is that bastard?

267
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,400
What are you doing?

268
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,590
What bastard?

269
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,400
I don't want you to humiliate yourself like that.

270
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,320
Although I don't want to get
married at this moment,

271
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,910
seeing you love me that much,

272
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,470
while your father

273
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,470
is the greatest hero,

274
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,790
I agree

275
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,470
with this marriage.

276
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,200
Yan Yan,

277
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,520
this is a misunderstanding.

278
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,550
I have an emergency. I'm leaving now.

279
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,000
What are you doing?

280
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,150
What do you mean?

281
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,880
Let go!

282
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:15,880
Are you trying to fool me?

283
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,080
Is the pouch meant to be given
away when you feel like it?

284
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,030
You're humiliating me in public.

285
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:20,710
I've said before,

286
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,110
I did not gift you this pouch.

287
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,280
Moreover,

288
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,280
I won't tell anyone about this.

289
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,440
If there's anyone who knows,

290
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,840
I'll help you to murder them.

291
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,320
Yan Xiao Lang.

292
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,590
You deserve it.

293
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:43,960
Sang Qi!

294
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,000
Where are you going?

295
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,030
Don't go.

296
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,000
Sang Qi!

297
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,230
Just you wait!

298
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,640
Don't fool around.

299
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,640
Get up!

300
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:57,840
Hurry up.

301
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,350
Get up.

302
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:04,760
Deputy Chief!

303
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,310
You set me in a trap.

304
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,550
You stole my pouch

305
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:12,760
and transferred it to Yan Yan.

306
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,520
Careful, Young Master!

307
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,200
There's an assassin!

308
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,350
Stand right there!

309
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,110
Where are you going?

310
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,440
Is he

311
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,440
a bit

312
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,230
crazy?

313
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:44,670
Just say it.

314
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,590
Let's see how you'll explain

315
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,760
and what excuse you'll use to prevaricate me.

316
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,320
Start.

317
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,960
Why should I explain?

318
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,760
I did say that I would accept the pouch,

319
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,230
but I didn't say that I wouldn't pull any tricks.

320
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,670
Since ancient times, there can never
be too much deception in war.

321
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,400
I advise you to read more

322
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,790
and gain more knowledge.

323
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,880
Next time if you meet people

324
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,760
and face something like this,

325
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,230
you can also protect yourself.

326
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,440
What you mean is

327
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,520
I should thank you?

328
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,030
You're right.

329
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:15,710
Teaching and educating people

330
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,230
is my duty.

331
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,350
You're welcome.

332
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,470
Teaching and educating people.

333
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,280
Yan Yun Zhi,

334
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,960
sooner or later, I'll let you know

335
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,000
what is meant by there is always someone

336
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,030
who is better than you.

337
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:46,710
(Song Luo Tian, Imperial College)
(Tang Shao Qi, Imperial College)

338
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,760
Yan Xiao Lang deserves it.

339
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,280
Did you see his face just now?

340
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,280
He was

341
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,590
embarrassed to death.

342
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,640
This girl, Sang Qi.

343
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,840
First, she spread rumors about
Deputy Chief hanging himself,

344
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,670
now she has provoked Yan Yan.

345
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:04,150
Is she going to offend every influential person

346
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,000
in the Imperial College?

347
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,910
Seems like she won't be staying long

348
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,790
in the Imperial College.

349
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,000
Why don't we accelerate it,

350
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,840
so that this girl will leave immediately?

351
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:31,470
(Imperial College)

352
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,750
(A Place for the Talented)

353
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,280
Young Master!

354
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,320
Something bad happened!

355
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,670
I saw Yan Yan aggressively

356
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,030
bringing a lot of men into the Imperial College.

357
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,960
I'm sure he's going to trouble Miss Sang.

358
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,590
I think you should take care of this.

359
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,200
What do her troubles have to do with me?

360
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,280
But...

361
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,000
Still...

362
00:15:58,670 --> 00:15:59,670
You...

363
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,910
If you want to make amends,

364
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,080
go to do it by yourself.

365
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,590
Yes!

366
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,080
At night, you can stay in Sang family's house,

367
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,840
and protect Miss Sang's safety.

368
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,110
Young Master.

369
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:16,470
I was wrong.

370
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,200
That Yan Yan lost his face in public,

371
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,760
he won't let it go that easily.

372
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,400
Yan Yun Zhi is to blame.

373
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,550
I'll make him pay.

374
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,080
Sang Qi!

375
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,030
Sang Qi!

376
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,030
Over there!

377
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,550
How's the preparation over there?

378
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,520
Don't worry,

379
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,790
it's already set up.

380
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,400
Yan Yan has come to take his revenge.

381
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,400
What should we do?

382
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,790
His Majesty asks me to be well-behaved

383
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,910
in the Imperial College.

384
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,470
I can't take any action in public.

385
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,230
After Yan Xiao Lang finishes his revenge,

386
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,110
we'll fight.

387
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,080
Don't be afraid.

388
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:59,520
I'm right here.

389
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,550
There're so many people, can you beat them all?

390
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,790
I can handle ten people at once,
do you believe it?

391
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,880
No, I don't believe it.

392
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,150
Then why aren't you running
away if you don't believe me?

393
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:07,790
Go!

394
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:12,680
Are you running away?

395
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,190
Don't run!

396
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,310
Stand there!

397
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:17,830
Catch her!

398
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,310
That's not good.

399
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:20,880
Sang Qi's running away!

400
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,520
You guys,

401
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,040
go and stop Sang Qi.

402
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,800
Help Yan Xiao Lang.

403
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,310
Hurry!

404
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:23,560
Stand there!

405
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,040
Chase them!

406
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,590
Quick!

407
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,760
Stand there!

408
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:48,280
Song!

409
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,190
Yan Yan is tricked.

410
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:50,070
He's tricked. Go and beat him!

411
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:50,710
No! What?

412
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,710
So both of you are in the same gang.

413
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:53,110
Yes, the same gang!

414
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,000
What?

415
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,800
No!

416
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,520
Song Luo Tian,

417
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,760
I'll pay back all the old and recent grudges.

418
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,350
I...

419
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:57,830
It's not it!

420
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,560
It's a misunderstanding!

421
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,400
Listen to my explanation!

422
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:10,920
- Pull them!
- Careful! Pull them up!

423
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:15,880
- Be careful!
- Pull them up!

424
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,640
Pull them!

425
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,110
Hold on!

426
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,280
Pull them up!

427
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,400
Pull them!

428
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,520
Help!

429
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,100
Save him, hurry!

430
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:36,610
Get them up!

431
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:38,940
Song Luo Tian!

432
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,060
What are you guys fooling around with?

433
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:51,370
Go back!

434
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:55,130
Deputy Chief,

435
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,180
I'm so scared!

436
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,700
Deputy Chief!

437
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:19,650
Come, slowly.

438
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,220
Slowly, Deputy Chief.

439
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,220
Careful.

440
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:25,980
Careful, slowly.

441
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,820
Sang Qi!

442
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,180
Deputy Chief!

443
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,580
Don't talk.

444
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,460
I understand what you're trying to say.

445
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,650
Let's talk next time.

446
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,340
Hurry and go back to change
your clothes, don't catch a cold.

447
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,340
If you catch a cold,

448
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:35,940
what should we do?

449
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,530
What about the Imperial College?

450
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:38,490
We will all be upset, Deputy Chief!

451
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,010
Great. You...

452
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:41,580
Health is more important.

453
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,130
The few of you!

454
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,250
Anyone who dares to cause
troubles, I'll punish them all!

455
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:54,650
Yes!

456
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:57,820
Sang Qi!

457
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:00,940
I've always distinguished kindness and hatred.

458
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,770
It's not over yet for today's matter!

459
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:03,460
All right! Go!

460
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:03,860
Brothers!

461
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:04,890
Retreat!

462
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:05,860
Let's go!

463
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:08,610
Let's go! Not over yet!

464
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:13,530
Qi,

465
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,340
go back to the classroom and wait for me.

466
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,340
I'll fetch a brazier.

467
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,370
All right! No problem.

468
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:20,370
Miss Sang Qi,

469
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,300
I'm Wei Zhan Hong from Class Black.

470
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,300
Nice to meet you.

471
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:27,130
I see you're soaked all over.

472
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,940
Why don't I take you to the
wing room to rest a little?

473
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,890
Coincidentally,

474
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,700
there are unused uniforms inside,

475
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,340
you can just pick one first for emergency use.

476
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:39,700
All right!

477
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,700
Great.

478
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,650
I'll be going.

479
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,010
Thank you, Song.

480
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:44,530
Follow me.

481
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:49,580
Hurry.

482
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:57,300
Hurry up, let's go.

483
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,460
Take a look,

484
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,060
the question you asked me last time,

485
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:02,940
the teacher has told us before.

486
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,300
Do as I said.

487
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,370
It makes sense. It's like this.

488
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:06,340
Yes, it's here.

489
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,700
It's written above here.

490
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,300
Take a look by yourself.

491
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:08,860
Here too.

492
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:10,530
All of this has to be noted down right?

493
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:10,820
Yes.

494
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,300
Hello,

495
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,860
have you seen Sang Qi?

496
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,860
She seems to go to the wing room

497
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,820
with Wei Zhan Hong from Class Black.

498
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,490
Wei Zhan Hong?

499
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:18,180
Yes.

500
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,580
Please help me take it, thank you!

501
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:27,730
Over here.

502
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:39,580
It's here.

503
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:41,220
I'm a man. So it's inconvenient to stay here.

504
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,410
Miss Sang Qi,

505
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:49,980
please help yourself.

506
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,220
Thank you.

507
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:56,100
But Wei,

508
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,340
I'm scared of the dark.

509
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,180
Why don't you go in with me?

510
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:14,650
Where is she?

511
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:15,650
What's wrong? Are you fine?

512
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:16,530
Let us go!

513
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,340
Stop it!

514
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,220
Let us go!

515
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,730
Is this how you treat your classmate?

516
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:34,460
That's so kind of you!

517
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:35,770
Let me tell you,

518
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,060
I, Sang Qi, never want to cause any trouble,

519
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,010
but I will never let you bully me.

520
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:43,650
From today onwards, please behave yourself.

521
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,530
Don't even think of messing with me.

522
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:46,820
Do you understand?

523
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:49,220
Goodbye, my fellow classmates.

524
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:53,300
I...

525
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:00,530
You

526
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,980
are a useless piece of trash.

527
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,100
Young Master, here.

528
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,460
Drink some ginger soup to warm up your body.

529
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:16,820
Young Master,

530
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,820
are you feeling better now?

531
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:22,180
I'm fine.

532
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,060
How's Sang Qi?

533
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:26,890
She's fine.

534
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,770
However, this ginger soup is sent by her.

535
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,530
But

536
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,220
she says your body is weak,

537
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:38,250
and this bowl of soup is for
you to get rid of the cold.

538
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,490
I don't want to drink it anymore.

539
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:43,130
This Sang Qi still dares to provoke me.

540
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:45,700
Deputy Chief!

541
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,100
Deputy Chief!

542
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:51,610
Deputy Chief,

543
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,370
what are you...?

544
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:54,890
It's nothing.

545
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:55,860
Anything, Scholar Feng?

546
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:56,530
Have a seat.

547
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:03,300
Deputy Chief,

548
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:05,820
Sang Qi

549
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:08,730
bullied a group of Class Black's students.

550
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,490
Song Luo Tian went to me

551
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,130
to complain about her.

552
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:14,700
Male students of Class Black

553
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:16,100
are bullied by Sang Qi again?

554
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:16,610
Yes.

555
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:19,860
This doesn't make any sense.

556
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,700
Then I'll go and ask Sang Qi right now

557
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,180
and find out the truth.

558
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,460
Scholar Feng,

559
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:27,460
I think it's not necessary.

560
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:29,490
Just let the students solve

561
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:30,860
the problems between themselves.

562
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,220
As long as there's no major incident,

563
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,650
there's no need to intervene.

564
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:34,490
But...

565
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:36,580
Scholar Feng.

566
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:38,700
I'll take note of this matter,

567
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,490
so go ahead and do your work.

568
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:42,300
All right.

569
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,580
Then I'll follow your advice.

570
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,250
Young Master,

571
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,130
you're so broad-minded.

572
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:55,220
It was Sang Qi who pulled you into the water,

573
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,980
but now you're defending her.

574
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,100
And you even speak up for her.

575
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:01,370
Looks like you've forgiven her.

576
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,580
Who says I've forgiven her?

577
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,340
I want to avenge myself.

578
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:19,080
(Imperial College)

579
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:25,520
(Classroom)

580
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,520
(Classroom)

581
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:46,060
Why are you sighing?

582
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:47,530
Deputy Chief already knows

583
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:49,410
that Yan Yan is seeking revenge from me.

584
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,460
He wouldn't dare to cause any troubles.

585
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,530
If he wants to play some tricks,

586
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:54,490
that's fine too.

587
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:55,890
I can play with him.

588
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:58,220
I'm not worried about Yan Yan.

589
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,250
I'm afraid that Deputy Chief
will do something about this.

590
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:01,820
What you mean is,

591
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,580
you're worried that Deputy Chief will
wait for an opportunity to prank me?

592
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:07,460
Deputy Chief is someone who'll seek revenge.

593
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,650
Rumor has it that Chief was forced
to travel around the world

594
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,060
after offending him.

595
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:13,300
Yesterday you pulled him into the water,

596
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:14,370
today,

597
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,530
I'm afraid that he might kill you.

598
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:19,460
But I sent him a bowl of ginger soup already.

599
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,340
He's the Deputy Chief,

600
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,820
I think he won't be so petty.

601
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,300
(Classroom)

602
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,610
Then we'll wait and see.

603
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:24,580
Deputy Chief is here. Hurry up!

604
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,730
Deputy Chief is here.

605
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:36,460
In today's law class,

606
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:38,250
we won't be learning laws and regulations.

607
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,410
I will teach you about judgment skills.

608
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:42,650
Later, I will recreate a few

609
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:44,610
unsettled cases that Prefecture Court
has handled in recent years.

610
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:45,610
You guys

611
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,250
will act as the constables

612
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:48,460
and the coroner.

613
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:49,980
You guys will work together

614
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,730
and try to solve the case.

615
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,370
Constable?

616
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:56,010
This class is quite interesting.

617
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,250
Later, I will show you my skills

618
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,060
and let you see

619
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,180
how I will capture the real murderer.

620
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:04,610
Although it's just a simulation case,

621
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,940
we still need to make it seem real.

622
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,940
Later, we will draw lots to decide

623
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,410
who among all of you

624
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:11,770
will act as the deceased.

625
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:13,300
The deceased?

626
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,340
The deceased?

627
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,610
We even need to act as the deceased.

628
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:20,530
Sang Qi.

629
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:22,650
You're the first female student

630
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:23,890
that came to Imperial College.

631
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,250
We should take care of you more.

632
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,250
You should pick first.

633
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,410
I knew Deputy Chief wouldn't be that petty.

634
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,530
Thank you, Deputy Chief.

635
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,180
Are you done?

636
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,770
I've done choosing.

637
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,200
(The deceased)

638
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:57,530
What is it?

639
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:58,730
(The deceased)
What?

640
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:01,530
The deceased!

641
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:02,890
Keep quiet.

642
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:06,250
Stand back at your place.

643
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:10,220
As expected, you got the role.

644
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:13,820
It's okay, just this one time.

645
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,890
This case happened last month.

646
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:24,180
In a farmhouse in the mountains,

647
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,340
the deceased lay prostrate
on the ground like this.

648
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,180
The deceased got stabbed from the back.

649
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:29,980
But the doors and windows in the
room were locked from the inside.

650
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:32,250
How did the murderer escape?

651
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:36,700
Deputy Chief,

652
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,980
I think the deceased is still breathing,

653
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,340
and should be sent to the
doctor as soon as possible.

654
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,980
I will go and prepare my horse immediately.

655
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,370
Don't play around during class.

656
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,370
Is there anyone

657
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,250
who would like to share his thoughts?

658
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,490
There's only one truth.

659
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,220
I have a conclusion.

660
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,890
The deceased committed suicide.

661
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:03,820
Yan Yan,

662
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,460
why do you say it's a suicide case?

663
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:08,610
Listen carefully.

664
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:09,410
Listen carefully.

665
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,370
The doors and windows are locked from the inside.

666
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,580
The murderer could never escape.

667
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:17,100
Therefore, there was no murderer.

668
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,860
The deceased killed himself.

669
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:22,370
Then how do you explain the knife on his back?

670
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,490
Isn't it simple?

671
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:25,410
He froze the handle of the knife with ice

672
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:26,340
with the blade facing upwards.

673
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,370
Then with the back facing the blade,

674
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:29,700
he jumped onto it.

675
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,610
You're really smart, Yan Yan.

676
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,890
It's not yet autumn last month,

677
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,890
where did the ice come from?

678
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:37,650
Do you think they have an icehouse

679
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:38,860
like yours in your residence?

680
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,300
Last month?

681
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,410
Then what do you think?

682
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,650
How did the murderer escape?

683
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,530
If you want me to say,

684
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:50,130
I think it should be...

685
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:51,580
Come and find me in the underworld!

686
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,770
You shook with fright!

687
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:55,770
Sang Qi,

688
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:57,650
you're toying with me again.

689
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:58,860
The deceased,

690
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,530
please play your role well.

691
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:01,580
Don't act like a feigned corpse.

692
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,180
Get down.

693
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,300
That's right.

694
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,980
The face of the deceased is too hideous.

695
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,100
Is there anyone who has a handkerchief?

696
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:08,650
Please cover her face.

697
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:17,940
I know it now.

698
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,530
The murderer can walk through the walls.

699
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:21,980
Yan Yan,

700
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,650
don't read too many legend storytelling scripts.

701
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:24,980
You've gone off the deep end.

702
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:28,490
Could it be

703
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,060
the deceased was not attacked here,

704
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,580
but was seriously injured and
hid in the room for safety,

705
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,180
and eventually, he died because of his injuries?

706
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,010
Indeed it is.

707
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,370
It's that simple?

708
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:40,580
It is that simple.

709
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:42,940
That's it?

710
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:44,730
The reason I bring you here
to investigate the case is

711
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,410
that I hope that when you're judging a case,

712
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,580
you won't be blinded by what you see.

713
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:53,250
In the future, if you become imperial officials

714
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:54,860
and serve the imperial court,

715
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,770
don't be self-contained.

716
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,530
You must be cautious

717
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:02,010
and remember that life is of
greater value than everything.

718
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:04,650
There's still some time left.

719
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,580
Let's probe into other cases.

720
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:07,940
Deputy Chief,

721
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:10,860
can we draw the slots again?

722
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,100
Of course.

723
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,100
Great!

724
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:15,730
Let's go!

725
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:16,610
Go!

726
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:21,840
(Class Yellow)

727
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:37,550
(The deceased)

728
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,170
(The deceased)

729
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,610
Everyone has seen

730
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:48,130
that there's a female dead here

731
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:49,010
with unknown age.

732
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,730
Let's continue to probe the case.

733
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:51,770
Obviously,

734
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:53,100
if you see a dead person,

735
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,180
then first you have to find out

736
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,650
the cause of her death.

737
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:56,370
We don't have to find it here,

738
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:57,250
the knife is the cause of her death.

739
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,300
Number two,

740
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:02,180
you have to determine the time of death.

741
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,730
How do we normally determine it?

742
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:06,890
Livor mortis usually appear
on the body of the dead.

743
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:08,490
First, it's the hand,

744
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:09,890
the wrist, the neck,

745
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:11,130
then look at her pupils.

746
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,720
(The deceased)

747
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,340
You're the deceased again.

748
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:42,340
Everybody.

749
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,650
First, we see a corpse with an arrow in the back.

750
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:46,730
What will you guys think of?

751
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:47,300
There's no need to guess.

752
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:49,730
The shooter should be over there.

753
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:50,610
Am I right?

754
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,010
Next,

755
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,530
if we want to find this person,

756
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,370
we need to take a look at this.

757
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:57,820
The deceased,

758
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,610
please play your role well.

759
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,650
(It hurts so much.)

760
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:03,180
(Brother,)

761
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,130
(is this)

762
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:05,820
(the Imperial College you wanted me to study at?)

763
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,940
(Two years ago)
Miss Sang Qi!

764
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:10,650
Brother!

765
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:14,340
Brother!

766
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:16,940
Why are you leaving after
accompanying me for just two days?

767
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,890
Didn't you say that you'd play with me?

768
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,060
Moreover,

769
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:21,410
isn't it just a school reopening?

770
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,650
What's there to miss?

771
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,860
You don't even want your sister already.

772
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,060
Qi.

773
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,340
The Imperial College is not an ordinary place.

774
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,340
It changes someone into a
reasonable and worthy man

775
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,460
to become the pillar of the country.

776
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:33,340
Besides,

777
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,060
I can make many interesting friends there.

778
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,410
What interesting friend

779
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:38,410
makes you don't want your sister?

780
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:41,730
His name is...

781
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,130
His name is White.

782
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:44,490
He's my classmate.

783
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:46,940
He's not only the best in our year,

784
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,700
but also considerate and reasonable.

785
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:51,180
When I go back to Bianjing, take me to meet White.

786
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:51,730
All right.

787
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,100
White should be always staying
at the Imperial College.

788
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:56,890
Qi.

789
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,490
I hope someday,

790
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,610
you can study at the Imperial College too.

791
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,460
Take the imperial examination,

792
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:04,580
and be nominated on the list.

793
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,100
Let the world see

794
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:08,820
that not only men can attend college,

795
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:10,250
but women can do it too.

796
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,530
All right, I promise you.

797
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:17,010
Being human is so tiring.

798
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:20,620
Let me tell you,

799
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:24,060
Bianjing is not as fun as the frontier.

800
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:25,620
I don't even know

801
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,690
how my brother managed to go through this.

802
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,620
And where is his best friend, White?

803
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,170
Brother told me before

804
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:35,900
that I just need to find White and I'll be fine.

805
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,490
He will protect me just like my brother did.

806
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,170
If I found White,

807
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:41,420
I'm sure he'll hammer

808
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,380
Yan Yun Zhi's head

809
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,860
and teach him a lesson.

810
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,210
But I don't even know

811
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,100
where he is.

812
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,580
Did you meet White before?

813
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,010
Sang Qi.

814
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:03,530
What are you doing here?

815
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:04,490
Go!

816
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:08,730
Deputy Chief,

817
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:10,770
you've been in the Imperial College for so long,

818
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:13,100
do you happen to know my brother, Sang Yu, and White?

819
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,420
(If Sang Qi knows)

820
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,300
(I'm that friend, White,
who her brother mentioned,)

821
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,490
(how can I discipline her well in the future?)

822
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:25,100
It's the horseback archery class later.

823
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:27,100
You didn't go to the school field,

824
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,170
are you thinking of skipping the class?

825
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:30,860
I'll go immediately.

826
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,570
(Promote education and lessen military training)

827
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,820
Aren't you good at this?

828
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:54,420
Why didn't you go and show off to them?

829
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:56,690
Haven't I caused enough trouble recently?

830
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,970
I should keep a low profile.

831
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,070
(Train to serve the country)

832
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:07,060
Today, we will learn the horseback archery skill.

833
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:08,860
Is there someone who would like to try?

834
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,210
Isn't this the daughter of the Sang family?

835
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,660
Turns out she's scared of horseback archery.

836
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:20,140
Then why are you coming to college like men?

837
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,010
Am I right?

838
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,620
- Yes.
- Yes.

839
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:23,450
You're right. Yes.

840
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:24,170
What's wrong?

841
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,210
You came late intentionally

842
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:27,580
and still look terrified.

843
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:28,900
Did I say anything wrong?

844
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:30,380
Yan Xiao Lang,

845
00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:31,380
what are you talking about?

846
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:32,970
The daughter of the Sang family

847
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,340
is pretty arbitrary

848
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:35,970
and comparable to the men in the barracks.

849
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:38,010
Why would she be scared of riding while shooting?

850
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:40,450
- You're right.
- You're right.

851
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:41,860
Why aren't you helping me to say something?

852
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,580
I think they make sense.

853
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:44,820
Where does it make sense?

854
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:49,930
Scholar Huo,

855
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,620
please let me try.

856
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,210
I'll show someone

857
