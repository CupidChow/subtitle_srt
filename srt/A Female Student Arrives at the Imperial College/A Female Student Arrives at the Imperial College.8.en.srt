Isn't it tiring to follow me for such a long time?

29
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,120
I didn't expect Miss Sang Qi

30
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,680
to think so highly of me.

31
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:58,910
Looks like

32
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,550
I'm considered to have
the approval of the legal wife.

33
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,590
If in the most unlikely situation

34
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,480
that Miss Sang Qi finds out

35
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,230
about the secret that you are hiding

36
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,160
and the fact that you always mingle
with people like us,

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,910
I don't think she will be honest with you

38
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,470
like she did today, right? Mr. Zhuo.

39
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,000
You can't scare me with that.

40
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,360
I've done everything you arranged nicely

41
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,600
without making any mistakes.

42
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,550
If Xizhao is still not satisfied,

43
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,080
please find yourself other allies.

44
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:33,550
Let's not waste each other's time.

45
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,270
Mr. Zhuo, why do you have such a bad temper today?

46
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,600
That wasn't how you treated me in the past.

47
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,110
You were the most patient person.

48
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,240
You were a straightforward person

49
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,110
without beating around the bush.

50
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,030
But right now,

51
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,110
why have you become

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,750
such a strange person?

53
00:02:59,100 --> 00:02:59,800
(Ambition)

54
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,470
I know.

55
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,720
The person that went to
assassinate Sang Qi at the side house that night

56
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,080
was arranged by you.

57
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,320
If the plan didn't work, you would
hide your identity

58
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,080
Sang Qi would even trust you more.

59
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,550
I've given you freedom.

60
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,630
But the only thing you can't do

61
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,360
is to hurt Sang Qi.

62
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,630
She is too troublesome.

63
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,720
I had no choice.

64
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,160
That Yan Yun Zhi

65
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,550
is still doubting me as we speak.

66
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,390
We don't know how much information he has on us.

67
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,830
We should still be careful and discrete.

68
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:43,910
I understand.

69
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,240
There's a problem with the salt routes
in the south.

70
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,000
Our goods can't come in.

71
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,270
The guards have been keeping their eyes on them.

72
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,830
Is there something wrong
with Noble Consort Zhuo's arrangement?

73
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,030
There are more people
complaining about us to the emperor.

74
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,960
They have realized
the salt smuggling through the water route.

75
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,600
It's time to stop for the moment.

76
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,800
I'm contacting people of the land route

77
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:14,000
to see if we can work with local merchants

78
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,320
and prepare a few more routes.

79
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,630
Local merchants?

80
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,160
Are they reliable?

81
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,550
Everyone in the world gathers for profits.

82
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,440
As long as you're willing to share with them,

83
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,760
people will be willing to come.

84
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:29,880
Fine.

85
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:33,110
Salt smuggling is the foundation
of the Zhuo family's wealth.

86
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,760
It's a given that you know more than me.

87
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,670
Since you say there's nothing wrong with it,

88
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,640
I'm sure it will be fine.

89
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,600
Please arrange the schedule as soon as possible

90
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,920
to deal with this shipment.

91
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:46,920
I...

92
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,200
I will send my trusted follower
to get this thing done

93
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,070
because I still can't leave Bianjing

94
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,640
in the next few days.

95
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:00,320
What is the obstacle that can
even trouble Mr. Zhuo?

96
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,200
It's that girl from the
Grand Commandant's Residence, right?

97
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,390
My men saw Yan Yun Zhi

98
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,270
sending people to protect her
in secret every day.

99
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,830
She has a one-track mind.

100
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,670
She doesn't know anything about love.

101
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,070
If I don't keep an eye on her,

102
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,920
unforeseen issues might arise.

103
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,230
I'm really not used to seeing Mr. Zhuo

104
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,550
who is constantly worried.

105
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,760
I am just making sure
that the whole situation is fine.

106
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,350
The Sang family will work with us in the future.

107
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,350
This is also a part of the plan.

108
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,440
Mr. Zhuo.

109
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,670
There's no need

110
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,790
to tell me all these beautiful words.

111
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,040
Don't forget

112
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,480
your promise with Xizhao.

113
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:57,480
(Tavern)

114
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,040
This way.

115
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,440
A very important customer is here.

116
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:03,920
Greetings, Deputy Chief Yan.

117
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,790
I will be seeing Mr. Zhuo today.

118
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,760
Mr. Zhuo?

119
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:13,070
Why are you here, Deputy Chief Yan?

120
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,600
Zhuo Wen Yuan?

121
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:16,790
Since you are already here,

122
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,600
let's have a drink and listen to some tunes.

123
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,110
Sure.

124
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:22,880
Have a seat.

125
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,200
Sorry to trouble Miss Qian Jiu

126
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,440
to perform for both of us.

127
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,950
I will bring the pipa over immediately.
[*a traditional Chinese musical instrument]

128
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,160
I'm going to make both of you
enjoy yourselves today.

129
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,200
Master Sang!

130
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,720
Good news, Master Sang!

131
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,160
Good news, Master Sang!

132
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,160
Good news!

133
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:21,920
Master Sang.

134
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,270
Good news.

135
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,040
Yan Yan.

136
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,670
Can you not exaggerate things

137
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,320
every time?

138
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,040
Father is dying to see me get married.

139
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,070
What if he hears that?

140
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,230
Grand Commandant Sang is noble and experienced.

141
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,200
That's impossible.

142
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,670
Tell me. Why are you looking for me?

143
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:41,110
I found the white-robed old man
you are looking for.

144
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,550
Apparently, he is an elusive master.

145
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,670
He is low-profile

146
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,720
and he nurtures himself well.

147
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:47,550
He is still single.

148
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:48,670
Single...

149
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:49,830
Not even if he is single.

150
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:53,640
I said it.

151
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:55,830
Yan Yan.

152
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,070
I thought you knew what you are doing,

153
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,200
so I allowed you to get along with Qi.

154
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,790
You brat!

155
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,600
How dare you arrange a 60-year-old man for her?

156
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:05,510
Are you looking for a brother

157
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,390
or son-in-law for me?

158
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:06,950
Father.

159
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,510
No.

160
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,790
You've misunderstood.

161
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:11,000
He is looking for my benefactor.

162
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,640
It's not about that.

163
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,230
Yes.

164
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,670
It's not about that.

165
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,230
You are such a good kid.

166
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,550
You can even find her benefactor.

167
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,320
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree indeed.

168
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,070
Inform the treasurer.

169
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:26,950
Prepare more gifts.

170
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,480
We must satisfy your benefactor.

171
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:29,600
Is there a budget, Father?

172
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,760
No. Get whatever you like.

173
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,760
I know you love me the most.

174
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:51,670
♪The sun will be out soon.
The sound of recitation wakes me up♪

175
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,790
We should be there soon.

176
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:59,740
♪Surrounded by a conducive environment.

178
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:07,720

180
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,710
This should be the place he is staying at.

181
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:14,750
(Lingwu Manor)

182
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,800
(Lingwu Manor)

183
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,550
This is it?

184
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,840
Yes. It's here.

185
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,470
But Yan Yan,

186
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,280
don't you think something fishy is going on?

187
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:38,790
Look.

188
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,670
From Bianjing to Lingwu Mountain,

189
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,030
the most convenient and fastest way

190
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,280
is clearly drawn here.

191
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,670
Even this small house is clearly marked.

192
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,960
It's like waiting for us to discover it.

193
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,350
Do you think an elusive master

194
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,550
will be hiding so clearly in plain sight?

195
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,520
I didn't think about that.

196
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,470
I haven't asked you yet.

197
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,520
Where did you find this map?

198
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,440
I went to Qingfeng Restaurant again.

199
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,590
Qingfeng Restaurant?

200
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,320
Qian Jiu gave it to you?

201
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,080
No.

202
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,320
A guy in Qingfeng Restaurant
talked to me that day.

203
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,590
He said he knows the master

204
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,960
and gave me this map.

205
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,350
I'm afraid

206
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,470
the person waiting for us
is not the white-robed old man

207
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:22,840
but someone else.

208
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,320
Wait here.

209
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,470
We will scout ahead.

210
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,640
Let's go.

211
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,520
I am Sang Qi.

212
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:54,910
I've come here

213
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,320
to find my benefactor, a white-robed old man.

214
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,350
Everyone who visits is a guest.

215
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,910
Just come in.

216
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:15,200
Let's go.

217
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:25,910
Look.

218
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,400
This is the white-robed old man
I was talking about.

219
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,080
You had to say I imagined him.

220
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,030
I'm not, right?

221
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,840
Isn't he a lively

222
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,280
alive person sitting here?

223
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,470
Stop using words you don't understand.

224
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,080
Lively?

225
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,760
He might not accept you.

226
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:41,400
Deputy Chief?

227
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,520
Deputy Chief?

228
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,790
Deputy Chief.

229
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,880
Isn't it the holidays now?

230
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,840
Can't you spare your students?

231
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,150
Why have you appeared here?

232
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,080
Me?

233
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:57,150
I'm filial and polite. I came to visit my elders.

234
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,150
Oh, right.

235
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,550
I haven't introduced you.

236
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,440
This is my second uncle.

237
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:04,710
Yan He Xing.

238
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,350
Second uncle?

239
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:08,760
Second uncle?

240
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,000
You are relatives?

241
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,670
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

242
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,520
Isn't it easier if you had told us earlier?

243
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:19,400
That's right.

244
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,760
This is such a weird question.

245
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,880
You didn't even ask me at that time.

246
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,520
I didn't ask you?

247
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,640
Think about the time
when you were in Qingfeng Restaurant.

248
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,470
You even came here to gather information.

249
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,840
Haven't you thought about

250
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,590
finding someone who is capable?

251
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,150
Someone who is capable?

252
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,150
Who is so knowledgeable?

253
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,230
Someone who seems far
but is actually close at hand.

254
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,200
Yes.

255
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,960
The most powerful person
in the Imperial College.

256
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,110
Scholar Feng!

257
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,790
I've already decided to help you then.

258
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,590
You were the one who didn't know what I was saying.

259
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:50,550
That was because...

260
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,200
It's more important to find my master.

261
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:55,400
Yes.

262
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'll deal with you later.

263
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,200
Second Uncle.

264
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,670
Since you are the Deputy Chief's relative,

265
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,080
our relationship is even closer.

266
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,470
It makes it more convenient.

267
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,280
Please accept your disciple's...

268
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:15,880
No.

269
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,200
Please accept your disciple's disciple...

270
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,080
Disciple's disciple doesn't sound right too.

271
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,910
Seniority is not important.

272
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,670
The most important thing

273
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,910
is that you can accept both of us.

274
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,440
We came here this time

275
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,350
to ask you to become our martial arts master.

276
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,200
Not bad.

277
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,440
You are capable.

278
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,110
You are not someone who awaits their death.

279
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,590
But I don't like

280
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,790
taking in disciples.

281
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,640
I have to teach and look after them.

282
00:13:58,910 --> 00:13:59,880
It's a nuisance if they cause trouble

283
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,000
and it's noisy if they become famous.

284
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,080
If I'm free, why don't I do something else?

285
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,030
Talking nonsense again.

286
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,230
Aren't I your disciple?

287
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,590
Why aren't you taking in disciples?

288
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,520
I'll chase you out together if you keep talking.

289
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,520
This is not the Imperial College

290
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,640
where you can say anything you want.

291
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:13,960
Second Uncle.

292
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,080
You don't have to

293
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,840
make decisions so hastily.

294
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,350
Me...

295
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,550
I am different compared to

296
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:22,280
Yan Yan.

297
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,440
I keep

298
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,590
a low profile and I'm hardworking.

299
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,150
I am normal

300
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,080
and have no talents.

301
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:29,470
I can't be a big shot.

302
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:30,520
I won't achieve anything

303
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,110
in the martial arts world in the future.

304
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,350
So you don't have to

305
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,030
worry about being successful.

306
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,670
I also suit

307
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,030
your style as an elusive master.

308
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:38,590
Right?

309
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:40,670
Is that so?

310
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:43,520
One of you

311
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,670
is the precious daughter
at the Grand Commandant's Residence

312
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,550
who grew up at the frontier fortress.

313
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,230
The first female student of
the Imperial College.

314
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,150
Another person is the eldest son
of Grand Preceptor.

315
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:54,320
The son of a rich family who is famous in Bianjing.

316
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,280
Who are you both trying to fool?

317
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,520
My dear nephew.

318
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,150
Take care of your own students.

319
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,030
They can stay here for a few days.

320
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,840
Becoming my disciple?

321
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,000
Forget it.

322
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,200
How did he know?

323
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:14,320
I don't know.

324
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
That's why he's an expert.

325
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:21,230
(Three days ago)
You're doing this for that girl from Sang family.

326
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,520
You know her?

327
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,590
How can I not know?

328
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,030
The precious daughter
of Grand Commandant's Residence.

329
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,440
The first female student
in the Imperial College.

330
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,670
By the way,

331
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,760
both of us did have an encounter before.

332
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,910
I even saved her once.

333
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:35,520
That's right.

334
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,550
It's exactly because of that.

335
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,710
She is now determined

336
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,000
to make you her master.

337
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:41,880
No, thanks.

338
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,960
Forget it.

339
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,400
I came here to live in the mountains
for its tranquillity.

340
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,200
If the precious daughter
of Grand Commandant's Residence is here,

341
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,080
I will be so troubled.

342
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,670
Luckily,

343
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,910
it's quiet and hidden here.

344
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,350
If you hinder her progress,

345
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,760
she won't find this place easily.

346
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,440
I've already spread the location of your house.

347
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,640
What do you mean by spread?

348
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,280
What do you mean?

349
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,470
I'm sure you told her directly.

350
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,110
That's not it.

351
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,400
That shows I'm helping her obviously.

352
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,520
Aren't you helping her now?

353
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:18,030
I just revealed your location.

354
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:18,760
That's not helping her.

355
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,520
Besides,

356
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,000
even if she comes up here,

357
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,960
you will still be the one

358
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,840
who decides whether to
take her in or not, Second Uncle.

359
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,110
Of course, I won't.

360
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,350
That's not bad.

361
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,790
It's enough for Sang Qi to just have me.

362
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,550
I don't want her to get another teacher.

363
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,520
You sound weird.

364
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,110
However,

365
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,030
it's fine to not take her in,

366
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,590
but you have to teach her martial arts.

367
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,030
According to what you said,

368
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,080
she will learn my martial arts

369
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,080
but not call me "master"?

370
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,910
I work hard to grow a tree,

371
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,960
but I can't eat the fruit it bears? What for?

372
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,280
Take her in then.

373
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,230
Stop twisting your words.

374
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,150
Why do you need me to teach her?

375
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,030
It's a long story.

376
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,840
I know.

377
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,880
I'm sure this girl has caused a lot of trouble.

378
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,710
I understand.

379
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,910
But I remember

380
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,590
there was a Sang Yu previously
who you couldn't forget.

381
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:12,640
Now, there's a Sang Qi
who makes you feel uncomfortable.

382
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,310
You are really worried

383
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,230
about the Sang family.

384
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:19,110
Me worrying about which family
is not your concern.

385
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,350
As long as Sang Qi

386
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,710
can learn martial arts from you

387
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,560
to protect herself, I'll be relieved.

388
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:26,230
You are so considerate of her.

389
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,350
You think too much.

390
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,560
I think too much?

391
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,590
Fine. I think too much.

392
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,430
Sure.

393
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,070
We'll do it according to your plan.

394
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,760
But let me say this first.

395
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,110
I can take her in as my disciple,

396
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,520
but I will decide how to take her in.

397
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:43,350
Of course.

398
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,760
Pour the tea.

399
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,560
I just poured for you.

400
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,040
Didn't you see me spit it out?

401
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,920
Quickly. Pour the tea.

402
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:54,070
Deputy Chief.

403
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:56,520
How is it?

404
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,640
Deputy Chief, how is it?

405
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,160
How is it?

406
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,520
See? I told you so.

407
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,070
My second uncle still doesn't want to
take both of you in at the moment.

408
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,680
However, after talking to him for a long time,

409
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,520
he finally gave in.

410
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,470
He gave in?

411
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,640
What should we do?

412
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,160
If you want him to take you in,

413
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:22,590
first,

414
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,640
it depends on your sincerity.

415
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,760
Of course, we are sincere.

416
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,310
Yes. We are definitely sincere.

417
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,590
We came all the way here

418
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:31,830
just to learn from him.

419
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:33,680
What you two said doesn't count.

420
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,680
He suddenly said he wanted to drink
the wine brewed in the mountains.

421
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,830
(If you can bring him a jar)

422
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,470
(before nightfall,)

423
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,920
(you will pass this test.)

424
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,280
(Wine?)

425
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:45,000
(Let's go.)

426
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,520
Actually, I think finding a master

427
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,830
isn't that difficult

428
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,310
besides being a bit exhausting.

429
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,400
Yan Yan!

430
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:26,590
Deputy Chief.

431
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,310
Yan Yan, are you all right?

432
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,000
Are you fine?

433
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,310
I'm fine.

434
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,520
Deputy Chief.

435
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,400
Why are you here suddenly?

436
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,310
Why am I here?

437
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,830
If I were not here,

438
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:36,920
could you handle

439
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,920
a situation like this yourselves?

440
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,680
I was just careless.

441
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,520
Look.

442
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,040
In that case,

443
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,230
I don't think we can go on today.

444
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,110
Let's send him back.

445
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,230
That won't do.

446
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,310
You've prepared for such a long time
to find a master.

447
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,230
You can't stop here.

448
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,760
This is just a mountain. There's no one around.

449
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,800
I will wait for you here.

450
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,800
Go and find the wine quickly.

451
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,470
No.

452
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,920
How can we abandon you and go on?

453
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:00,880
Besides,

454
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,830
it's exactly because this is a mountain
which is why there will be beasts.

455
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:03,800
With your leg,

456
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,110
you can't even run away.

457
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:06,230
Young Lady.

458
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,880
I will stay here with Young Master Yan.

459
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,760
If something happens,

460
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,640
I will inform you.

461
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,680
It shouldn't be too far away from the houses.

462
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,110
You should go there with Deputy Chief.

463
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,160
Yes. Lian Pian will take care of me.

464
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:16,590
It'll be fine.

465
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,640
Just go.

466
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,110
Sure.

467
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,640
We will be quick.

468
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,800
Take good care of Yan Yan.

469
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,190
Sure.

470
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,350
Take good care of Lian Pian.

471
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,110
Let's go.

472
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:28,400
Thank you, Deputy Chief.

473
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,430
Be careful.

474
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:50,310
Are you hungry?

475
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:52,190
A little.

476
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,590
You little girl,

477
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,950
you even brought food up the mountains?

478
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,280
I am well-prepared.

479
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,520
Who knows what will happen out here?

480
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:08,560
Besides,

481
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,000
if I didn't plan well

482
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,110
and make our Young Lady suffer,

483
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,560
I would have made a big mistake.

484
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,190
If you were not hurt,

485
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:16,520
I wouldn't even give it to you.

486
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:18,310
Have one.

487
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,400
Sure.

488
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,640
I thought

489
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,400
you are just a little girl with a sharp tongue.

490
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:27,920
But I underestimated you.

491
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:29,760
Of course.

492
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,640
I experienced everything
when I was at the frontier

493
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,710
with my Young Lady.

494
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:33,640
Besides

495
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,710
my sharp tongue,

496
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,830
I am perfect, all right?

497
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,920
That's quite similar to me.

498
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:50,310
Stop.

499
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,470
Walk behind me.

500
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,470
Walk faster.

501
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,710
What's there to be afraid of?

502
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,800
You are so slow.

503
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:13,590
There's nothing to be afraid of.

504
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,640
Wine.

505
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,190
(Second Uncle!)

506
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,880
(You fooled me again.)

507
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,110
Deputy Chief! Don't be afraid!

508
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:56,230
Listen to me!

509
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,070
Walk two steps in front!

510
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,000
Can I walk backwards?

511
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,040
No!

512
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,400
Go!

513
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,070
Go.

514
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,950
Go.

515
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:12,000
Put out your hand.

516
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,430
That's right.

517
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,190
Succeeded.

518
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:17,680
Retreat.

519
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,280
Let's go!

520
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:20,430
Let's go!

521
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:23,830
Second Uncle!

522
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,070
I have things to ask you!

523
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,800
You are back early.

524
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,470
The traps along the way...

525
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,520
My dear nephew.

526
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,760
I have something to tell you.

527
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,350
Let's go.

528
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:37,280
Let's talk inside.

529
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:38,350
Let's go.

530
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:42,760
That's...

531
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,640
Let's go.

532
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:50,830
Let's go.

533
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,000
Quickly. Come in.

534
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,190
Come in quickly.

535
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,400
Second Uncle, I have something to ask you.

536
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,230
Are those goose feathers

537
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,040
used to trick me?

538
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,470
That's...

539
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,430
You know a person gets petty

540
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,160
when he is old.

541
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,760
Your students disturbed my peace

542
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,920
and forced me to take them in as disciples.

543
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,680
If I didn't use you for some fun,

544
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,590
I wouldn't be able to sleep at night

545
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,920
because it lingered on my mind.

546
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,800
Who forced you to accept them?

547
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:23,680
What?

548
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,590
Do you think I didn't suffer from this?

549
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,880
Fine.

550
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,710
Didn't you just get a bit scared...

551
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:31,520
By goose feathers?

552
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,470
I lost my peace in the mountains.

553
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,230
There's a jar of

554
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:37,000
30-year-old Nv'er Hong wine outside.

555
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,160
I'll let you drink a few cups

556
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,400
as compensation.

557
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:51,160
We got it.

558
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,110
Can we talk about

559
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,680
taking us in as your disciples now?

560
00:24:58,350 --> 00:24:58,920
Fine.

561
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,680
Both of you are my nephew's students after all.

562
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:01,920
I will break my rule just this once.

563
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:03,920
Calm down.

564
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,800
I can take you in,

565
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,950
but...

566
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,040
My dear nephew.

567
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:10,110
Go out for a while.

568
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,950
Hurry up. Go out.

569
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,040
What are you planning again?

570
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:22,830
I am old and I have limited energy.

571
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,070
I can only take one of you in.

572
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,040
One of us?

573
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,680
That's not right.

574
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:31,520
Both of us came up together,

575
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,950
but you'll only take one of us in?

576
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,400
That's not right.

577
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,280
Yes.

578
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,950
We are very close at the Imperial College.

579
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,560
It's a relationship more important than life.

580
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:40,400
Not really.

581
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,040
Isn't it too cruel

582
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,350
to just take one of us in?

583
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,470
I said I'd accept one of you,

584
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,430
but I didn't ask the other person to leave.

585
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:50,520
If you want to stay here,

586
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,070
you can run some miscellaneous errands.

587
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,000
Miscellaneous errands?

588
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,070
Doing miscellaneous errands

589
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,160
is just a form of saying.

590
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:58,470
I'm not asking you to be my servant.

591
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,680
But there's a need for people to run errands.

592
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:01,470
Of course.

593
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,040
You won't be doing it for free.

594
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,070
Although I'm only taking in one disciple,

595
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,760
when the other person finishes his errands,

596
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,880
he can also come to watch and learn.

597
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,160
I can provide some guidance as well.

598
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:17,040
Fine.

599
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,400
It's decided, then?

600
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:21,280
It's decided.

601
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:23,350
All right.

602
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:26,230
I will give you a task as a trial for both of you.

603
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,640
Whoever completes it first

604
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:29,310
will become my disciple.

605
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,040
Say it.

606
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:32,230
It's not something difficult.

607
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,920
I want Yan Yun Zhi's middle garment.

608
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,280
Both of you, get it for me.

609
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:38,400
Middle garment?

610
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,470
That's not something difficult?

611
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,590
I am a girl.

612
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:43,230
How can I get his middle garment?

613
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:45,000
It's your loss if you don't want to do it.

614
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:46,040
This is unfair.

615
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:46,520
I can do it.

616
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,760
Me too.

617
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,710
Yan Yan, is something wrong?

618
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,040
No.

619
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:11,800
It's nothing.

620
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,470
Deputy Chief.

621
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:20,880
Will you give your full support

622
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:23,040
to help me become your uncle's disciple?

623
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,040
Of course.

624
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:27,830
Thank you, Deputy Chief.

625
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,350
Deputy Chief, let me fill your cup.

626
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,760
Sang Qi, what are you thinking?

627
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,520
I was careless.

628
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:48,000
Your wine.

629
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,160
Sorry, Deputy Chief.

630
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,070
Sang Qi, you...

631
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,920
Deputy Chief, sorry. It was an accident.

632
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,950
Deputy Chief, why don't you take a bath?

633
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:57,760
I'll heat up the water for you.

634
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:58,880
Hurry up.

635
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:02,470
All right.

636
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,590
I'm going.

637
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,280
What a good strategy.

638
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,190
How could she do that?

639
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,310
How can I compete against her?

640
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:28,350
Deputy Chief.

641
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,040
I've prepared everything.

642
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,160
Just have a nice bath.

643
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:33,110
Oh, just throw your dirty clothes

644
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,000
out here.

645
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,190
I will wash them for you later.

646
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:38,830
There's no need.

647
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,190
I was the one who dirtied them.

648
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,880
It's my responsibility.

649
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,000
All right then.

650
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,070
You are a girl.

651
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,190
It's not right to stay here, right?

652
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,040
You're right.

653
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,000
I'm going out. Take your time.

654
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:13,430
Get out!

655
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,430
No, Deputy Chief. Listen to me.

656
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:16,520
I can explain.

657
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,710
I told you to get out!

658
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,760
Why... why don't you

659
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,310
give me your middle garment?

660
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:21,230
Go out.

661
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:22,920
- Go out, quickly.
- I can't see.

662
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,350
I can't see. There's a step.

663
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:31,350
It got my dress.

664
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:42,430
Yan He Xing wanted you two to get my undergarment.

665
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,560
So you spilled the wine and dishes on me,

666
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:45,520
so I could take a bath.

667
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,640
Do you think you are very smart?

668
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,520
Don't you think there's anything wrong with that?

669
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,760
I shouldn't go inside Deputy Chief's bath.

670
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,400
You are right, Deputy Chief.

671
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,110
Yes.

672
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,000
But I'm not talking about that.

673
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,110
You've been with me for a long time.

674
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:10,950
Why didn't I see Yan Xiao Lang?

675
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,520
You think you are witty,

676
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,800
but someone already got ahead of you.

677
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,400
Qi.

678
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,280
Sang Qi, you are back?

679
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,430
Yan Yan.

680
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,280
What kind of trick did you use?

681
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,800
Don't say that.

682
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:39,920
I got it rightfully

683
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:42,680
from the Deputy Chief.

684
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,880
You lost, Qi.

685
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:53,680
Sang Qi is using tricks,

686
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,830
but you can respond in an upright way.

687
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:58,800
Master Yan, please tell me.

688
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,520
Just find Yan Yun Zhi

689
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,400
and say you'll wash his middle garment.

690
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:04,470
You are so stupid.

691
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:06,880
Amazing.

692
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:14,880
Admit that you've lost.

693
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:18,760
Yan Yan.

694
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,040
I will deal with you

695
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,070
when we go down the mountains.

696
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:29,430
Master was the one who told me to do so.

697
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,070
Master?

698
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,830
You are already calling him "master"?

699
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,110
Master.

700
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,880
You must protect your disciple well.

701
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,800
Sang Qi is very bad.

702
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,800
How dare you scold me?

703
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:42,470
I...

704
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:43,400
What are you doing?

705
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,110
Come here.

706
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:47,400
Come!

707
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:16,800
Master, save me!

708
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,520
Yan Yan is my disciple.

709
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,950
You can't bully him here.

710
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,070
You can either leave or do
miscellaneous errands here.

711
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:28,920
Decide that yourself.
