Qi,

you're still holding this pouch?

30
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:45,345
Why don't I keep it for you?

31
00:01:46,265 --> 00:01:47,915
It belongs to Deputy Chief.

32
00:01:47,955 --> 00:01:48,755
He's no longer here.

33
00:01:48,755 --> 00:01:50,345
Why do you still keep this pouch?

34
00:01:52,555 --> 00:01:54,665
I'll be with you after this anyway.

35
00:01:54,665 --> 00:01:55,745
Give it to me.

36
00:02:13,905 --> 00:02:14,265
Physician,

37
00:02:14,995 --> 00:02:17,475
how serious is Sang Qi's illness?

38
00:02:17,515 --> 00:02:19,515
Apart from anxiousness,

39
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:21,065
from her pulse,

40
00:02:21,065 --> 00:02:23,315
there's a sign of toxin invading her body.

41
00:02:32,545 --> 00:02:33,065
Young Master.

42
00:02:38,635 --> 00:02:39,545
How did it go?

43
00:02:40,505 --> 00:02:42,635
Young Master, I was incompetent.

44
00:02:42,635 --> 00:02:44,315
We've dealt with Yan San Lang.

45
00:02:44,355 --> 00:02:46,435
But the injured Yan Yun Zhi fell off the cliff.

46
00:02:46,435 --> 00:02:47,825
No trace has been found so far.

47
00:02:51,715 --> 00:02:52,755
I only found this.

48
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,185
This is the pouch he carries
with him at all times.

49
00:03:16,075 --> 00:03:16,545
Jing Mu,

50
00:03:17,905 --> 00:03:19,545
bring me the white porcelain bottle

51
00:03:19,545 --> 00:03:20,185
Qian Jiu left.

52
00:04:08,345 --> 00:04:10,505
But I love her just the way she is.

53
00:04:10,505 --> 00:04:12,835
This is the Sang Qi that I like.

54
00:04:19,345 --> 00:04:22,065
My heart belongs to Yan Yun Zhi alone.

55
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,350
(Double Happiness)

56
00:05:32,035 --> 00:05:33,475
Take this pouch

57
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,915
to the cliff where Yan Yun Zhi fell off.

58
00:05:39,425 --> 00:05:40,555
Don't hide it too well.

59
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:42,985
Make sure Qi finds it.

60
00:05:47,955 --> 00:05:48,555
Young Master,

61
00:05:49,555 --> 00:05:50,225
this is Qian Jiu's...

62
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:50,955
I know.

63
00:05:53,675 --> 00:05:54,715
Do as I say.

64
00:06:14,555 --> 00:06:16,275
Young Master, Miss Sang's illness...

65
00:06:16,745 --> 00:06:17,995
From the symptoms,

66
00:06:18,675 --> 00:06:20,155
it is exactly as Qian Jiu described.

67
00:06:20,435 --> 00:06:21,595
I remember she said

68
00:06:21,905 --> 00:06:23,675
that this prescription is a slow poison.

69
00:06:24,465 --> 00:06:25,625
Even if she doesn't take the antidote,

70
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,905
she will show no symptoms
of poisoning within three months.

71
00:06:28,905 --> 00:06:29,955
Why did Miss Sang...

72
00:06:29,955 --> 00:06:32,155
It's because she misses Yan Yun Zhi too much!

73
00:06:32,345 --> 00:06:33,595
She kept the pouch with her at all times.

74
00:06:34,025 --> 00:06:35,875
That's why the poison is developing so quickly.

75
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:38,995
If that's the case,

76
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,345
then why didn't you
remove the pouch, Young Master?

77
00:06:42,305 --> 00:06:43,745
I tried to take it from her just now,

78
00:06:43,955 --> 00:06:45,875
and she clung to it firmly

79
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,275
without the slightest hesitation.

80
00:06:50,065 --> 00:06:51,065
Besides,

81
00:06:52,155 --> 00:06:53,875
what difference would it make?

82
00:06:54,345 --> 00:06:55,115
She is no longer

83
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:56,625
the Sang Qi that I know.

84
00:06:57,995 --> 00:07:00,785
But are we just going
to let Miss Sang's condition worsen?

85
00:07:04,995 --> 00:07:06,785
Qi made her choice.

86
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:11,675
Let's leave things the way they are.

87
00:07:13,785 --> 00:07:15,275
If I can't have her,

88
00:07:16,345 --> 00:07:18,155
Yan Yun Zhi can't have her either.

89
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,435
No matter what, I will definitely be the one

90
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:26,185
to remain by her side.

91
00:07:30,225 --> 00:07:30,955
Tell them

92
00:07:31,835 --> 00:07:33,745
to continue the search for Yan Yun Zhi.

93
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,745
I want to see him dead or alive.

94
00:07:35,785 --> 00:07:36,955
He knows too much.

95
00:07:37,275 --> 00:07:38,225
If we don't get rid of him,

96
00:07:38,555 --> 00:07:39,875
we'll have trouble dealing with him in the future.

97
00:07:40,905 --> 00:07:41,835
Understood.

98
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,300
(Jianshan Pavilion)

99
00:08:01,595 --> 00:08:02,675
Lan,

100
00:08:03,395 --> 00:08:05,065
don't keep sighing.

101
00:08:05,835 --> 00:08:07,345
My wine has turned cold.

102
00:08:09,185 --> 00:08:09,875
Come on.

103
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:11,345
Smile.

104
00:08:12,115 --> 00:08:13,185
Come on, smile.

105
00:08:17,465 --> 00:08:18,995
You're optimistic indeed, Brother.

106
00:08:20,065 --> 00:08:21,905
Yun Zhi is missing,
and we don't know if he's alive or dead.

107
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:23,595
All those charges are against him now.

108
00:08:26,065 --> 00:08:27,675
How could I possibly smile at a time like this?

109
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:31,675
I heard Aunt and Uncle went to see His Majesty

110
00:08:31,675 --> 00:08:32,875
and clarified

111
00:08:32,905 --> 00:08:34,395
that you had nothing to do with Qi Lang.

112
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:36,875
They also requested to call off the engagement.

113
00:08:37,115 --> 00:08:38,185
Is that true?

114
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:43,225
Well, I guess you can't smile after all of that.

115
00:08:43,225 --> 00:08:44,625
We're already at a time like this.

116
00:08:46,065 --> 00:08:48,065
And you're still making fun of me, Brother?

117
00:08:48,065 --> 00:08:49,555
I was just trying to cheer you up

118
00:08:49,955 --> 00:08:51,025
because you looked so down.

119
00:08:51,275 --> 00:08:52,025
Brother,

120
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,555
aren't you worried about him at all?

121
00:08:55,675 --> 00:08:56,835
What's the use of worrying?

122
00:08:57,025 --> 00:08:58,465
Sang Qi has already fallen ill.

123
00:08:59,225 --> 00:09:00,835
And you're obsessed.

124
00:09:01,025 --> 00:09:03,025
But I don't see Yan Yun Zhi showing up.

125
00:09:08,225 --> 00:09:12,065
All things happen according to heaven's will.

126
00:09:12,065 --> 00:09:14,625
Just leave everything to fate.

127
00:09:27,955 --> 00:09:28,710
Take care now.

128
00:09:28,715 --> 00:09:29,670
(Pastry)

129
00:09:29,675 --> 00:09:30,625
This looks great.

130
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:31,745
Yes, it smells so good.

131
00:09:31,745 --> 00:09:32,780
Yes. It's almost ready.

132
00:09:32,785 --> 00:09:33,670
(Luofu Inn)

133
00:09:33,675 --> 00:09:34,465
I'll be leaving now.

134
00:09:35,155 --> 00:09:35,875
Take care.

135
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:37,155
It's so cold today.

136
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:45,905
Young Lady, it's going to be winter soon.

137
00:09:46,675 --> 00:09:47,625
Indeed.

138
00:09:48,745 --> 00:09:50,395
The Lantern Festival is just around the corner.

139
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,225
Young Lady, are you thinking

140
00:09:53,225 --> 00:09:55,185
of the time Deputy Chief Yan
played guqin for you again?

141
00:09:59,275 --> 00:10:01,155
I remember he came down from the sky

142
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:03,675
dressed in white that day

143
00:10:03,675 --> 00:10:05,395
and saved you.

144
00:10:05,745 --> 00:10:07,745
It's no wonder you remember that day so well.

145
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,595
But it has been so long,

146
00:10:09,595 --> 00:10:11,305
and we still haven't heard anything about him.

147
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:14,985
Young Lady, be careful.

148
00:10:15,545 --> 00:10:17,105
Why don't we go back to your room first?

149
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,475
The physician said that you've gotten much better,

150
00:10:19,505 --> 00:10:21,665
but I think your health has gotten frailer.

151
00:10:21,915 --> 00:10:22,915
It's fine.

152
00:10:23,715 --> 00:10:25,065
I have to get some fresh air.

153
00:10:25,835 --> 00:10:28,595
Otherwise, I would be bored to death.

154
00:10:30,035 --> 00:10:30,865
Qi.

155
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,505
Yan Xiao Lang, why are you here?

156
00:10:35,185 --> 00:10:37,275
Go on. I can handle this on my own.

157
00:10:37,545 --> 00:10:40,395
Young Lady, how can I possibly leave you alone?

158
00:10:41,835 --> 00:10:43,745
I came to see you, Qi.

159
00:10:45,035 --> 00:10:46,475
Have you found Deputy Chief?

160
00:10:46,475 --> 00:10:47,715
I'll be direct.

161
00:10:48,505 --> 00:10:50,915
You had been ill, so I didn't tell you this.

162
00:10:50,915 --> 00:10:52,595
Zhuo Wen Yuan replaced Yan Yun Zhi

163
00:10:52,835 --> 00:10:54,475
as the Deputy Chief of the Imperial College.

164
00:10:54,745 --> 00:10:56,235
He took over the authority
and made drastic changes.

165
00:10:56,505 --> 00:10:57,915
The Imperial College
is no longer what it used to be.

166
00:10:58,355 --> 00:11:00,830
(Agarwood)
And I heard

167
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:03,035
he removed you from your manager position

168
00:11:03,395 --> 00:11:04,865
on the grounds of inappropriateness.

169
00:11:08,355 --> 00:11:09,235
Young Lady.

170
00:11:10,035 --> 00:11:10,795
What?

171
00:11:15,395 --> 00:11:17,065
Lian Pian, help me get dressed.

172
00:11:17,395 --> 00:11:18,545
And prepare the horse carriage.

173
00:11:18,955 --> 00:11:21,185
Young Lady, you're in no state
to go outside right now!

174
00:11:21,185 --> 00:11:22,105
Get the carriage ready.

175
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,550
(Imperial College)

176
00:11:35,715 --> 00:11:37,235
Halt. Do you have a visiting card?

177
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,065
Visiting card?

178
00:11:39,475 --> 00:11:40,595
The Imperial College's visiting card.

179
00:11:40,835 --> 00:11:41,425
This is an important place.

180
00:11:41,745 --> 00:11:43,355
We can't just simply let anyone in.

181
00:11:43,665 --> 00:11:44,745
That's strange.

182
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:46,425
I've been coming to the Imperial College
for more than a year.

183
00:11:46,425 --> 00:11:47,955
But I've never heard of a visiting card.

184
00:11:47,985 --> 00:11:49,665
If you don't have one, leave.

185
00:11:49,795 --> 00:11:50,505
Don't waste my time!

186
00:11:50,545 --> 00:11:51,475
Go on! Leave!

187
00:11:51,475 --> 00:11:52,185
Guo Cheng.

188
00:11:52,185 --> 00:11:53,065
Sang Qi?

189
00:11:55,985 --> 00:11:57,305
Weren't you removed from your position?

190
00:11:57,305 --> 00:11:58,505
Why did you still come here?

191
00:11:58,505 --> 00:12:00,185
Oh, right. Have you been recovering well?

192
00:12:00,745 --> 00:12:03,065
I came to ask about this.

193
00:12:03,065 --> 00:12:05,355
I came as soon as I felt better.

194
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:06,505
What is going on here?

195
00:12:06,545 --> 00:12:07,625
Why aren't they letting others in?

196
00:12:07,715 --> 00:12:09,035
It's as if this place is a court right now.

197
00:12:09,035 --> 00:12:10,395
They even have guards.

198
00:12:10,665 --> 00:12:11,355
Oh, don't even bring it up.

199
00:12:11,595 --> 00:12:13,235
Zhuo Wen Yuan set these rules up

200
00:12:13,235 --> 00:12:14,545
when you were sick.

201
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:16,915
He says he is doing this
to avoid suspicious people from entering,

202
00:12:16,915 --> 00:12:19,065
but in fact, he would only give those cards

203
00:12:19,065 --> 00:12:20,155
to a select few.

204
00:12:20,155 --> 00:12:22,035
And he even chased some other students out too.

205
00:12:22,035 --> 00:12:23,305
Isn't he being outrageous?

206
00:12:23,305 --> 00:12:24,275
What exactly is he trying to do?

207
00:12:24,275 --> 00:12:25,425
He did way more than that.

208
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,745
He abolished all the new rules

209
00:12:27,835 --> 00:12:29,065
you and Deputy Chief established as well.

210
00:12:29,065 --> 00:12:30,985
The students and scholars are furious,
but none of us dares to speak up.

211
00:12:31,035 --> 00:12:33,185
Ever since Zhuo Wen Yuan took charge,

212
00:12:33,425 --> 00:12:35,475
the Imperial College has become
stricter and more narrow-minded.

213
00:12:35,665 --> 00:12:36,985
They placed requirements
on one's background and status.

214
00:12:37,235 --> 00:12:38,865
The rich could do whatever they want to.

215
00:12:39,065 --> 00:12:40,155
The Imperial College has essentially

216
00:12:40,155 --> 00:12:42,355
become a college for rich people and nobilities.

217
00:12:42,985 --> 00:12:44,155
Ridiculous.

218
00:12:44,275 --> 00:12:45,275
Is Zhuo Wen Yuan inside?

219
00:12:45,275 --> 00:12:46,035
I'll go and see him.

220
00:12:46,395 --> 00:12:48,475
I think he is inside Deputy Chief Yan's study.

221
00:12:52,475 --> 00:12:53,795
Why are you back again?

222
00:12:53,835 --> 00:12:54,665
What?

223
00:12:54,665 --> 00:12:55,505
Are you going to force your way in?

224
00:12:55,505 --> 00:12:57,105
Yes. I plan on doing just that.

225
00:12:59,985 --> 00:13:00,475
Stop!

226
00:13:00,475 --> 00:13:00,955
Go!

227
00:13:00,955 --> 00:13:01,625
(Imperial College)
Stop!

228
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:02,745
- Hurry!
- How dare you!

229
00:13:02,805 --> 00:13:03,226
(Imperial College)

230
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:14,745
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

231
00:13:15,835 --> 00:13:17,665
Qi, why are you here?

232
00:13:17,665 --> 00:13:19,105
What exactly are you trying to do?

233
00:13:19,955 --> 00:13:20,625
Let's sit down and talk.

234
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:21,425
We can talk right here.

235
00:13:24,745 --> 00:13:27,235
Are you referring to the matter
of me removing your position, Qi?

236
00:13:27,355 --> 00:13:28,625
That's one of them.

237
00:13:29,185 --> 00:13:30,065
There's another matter.

238
00:13:30,355 --> 00:13:32,395
Deputy Chief and I worked so hard
to get rid of this mindset.

239
00:13:32,505 --> 00:13:35,595
Why did you restore the old system
that valued students' backgrounds and statuses?

240
00:13:35,985 --> 00:13:36,865
Look.

241
00:13:37,355 --> 00:13:39,105
You know Yan Yun Zhi did all this too.

242
00:13:39,835 --> 00:13:41,235
That is why

243
00:13:41,665 --> 00:13:42,915
I made this decision.

244
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,425
Yan Yun Zhi has infiltrated
the Imperial College for many years.

245
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:46,795
We can't be sure of his intentions

246
00:13:46,795 --> 00:13:48,425
and why he got rid

247
00:13:48,425 --> 00:13:49,505
of the status requirement.

248
00:13:51,065 --> 00:13:52,665
For safety,

249
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,305
I abolished all of them.

250
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:57,545
His Majesty

251
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,065
approved this as well.

252
00:13:59,795 --> 00:14:01,035
What for?

253
00:14:02,065 --> 00:14:04,625
What else could he gain from opening
Imperial College to everyone?

254
00:14:05,275 --> 00:14:06,425
Zhuo Wen Yuan,

255
00:14:06,425 --> 00:14:08,865
he did it because it was my brother's dying wish.

256
00:14:08,865 --> 00:14:11,185
Even if that is Yu's dying wish,

257
00:14:12,105 --> 00:14:13,795
Yan Yun Zhi was the one who told you that.

258
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,745
You can't guarantee
that isn't a lie he told you either.

259
00:14:21,275 --> 00:14:22,235
Then, tell me.

260
00:14:22,955 --> 00:14:24,595
How can I make you stop doing this?

261
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:27,395
The Lantern Festival is around the corner.

262
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:30,475
If you're willing to keep me company,

263
00:14:30,955 --> 00:14:32,275
my mood might change,

264
00:14:32,665 --> 00:14:34,035
and I might reconsider it.

265
00:14:36,505 --> 00:14:37,595
All right. You have a deal.

266
00:14:44,155 --> 00:14:45,505
Then, for the upcoming days...

267
00:14:48,065 --> 00:14:49,035
Do what you want.

268
00:14:49,865 --> 00:14:51,835
As long as you keep my brother's final wish.

269
00:14:52,745 --> 00:14:53,595
All right.

270
00:14:54,065 --> 00:14:55,275
Deal.

271
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:36,450
(Imperial College)

272
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:02,475
Qi.

273
00:16:02,955 --> 00:16:05,395
The rumors are all over the city right now.

274
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:07,665
Do you still believe in Yan Yun Zhi?

275
00:16:09,955 --> 00:16:11,665
Lan,

276
00:16:11,795 --> 00:16:13,355
why should I not believe in him?

277
00:16:15,665 --> 00:16:16,625
Qi.

278
00:16:17,545 --> 00:16:20,505
I won't hide this from you any longer.

279
00:16:21,595 --> 00:16:22,625
I held a grudge

280
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:25,475
against you once.

281
00:16:27,835 --> 00:16:30,745
After all, I grew up longing for a life

282
00:16:30,745 --> 00:16:32,625
where I would serve my husband
and take care of our children.

283
00:16:33,275 --> 00:16:36,625
And I have always considered
Yun Zhi my ideal husband.

284
00:16:38,475 --> 00:16:42,065
Your appearance ruined all of that.

285
00:16:44,745 --> 00:16:46,395
But thinking back on it,

286
00:16:47,035 --> 00:16:50,035
I realized why I could never win against you.

287
00:16:51,355 --> 00:16:54,665
Because you and he
have faced life and death together.

288
00:16:54,715 --> 00:16:56,065
You are dependent on each other.

289
00:16:57,865 --> 00:16:59,625
To be very honest,

290
00:16:59,665 --> 00:17:01,065
if it had been me,

291
00:17:02,475 --> 00:17:04,915
I might not be able

292
00:17:05,035 --> 00:17:07,305
to go through all of this

293
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,395
and be together with Yan Yun Zhi.

294
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:17,795
Sang Qi, I do envy you.

295
00:17:18,545 --> 00:17:21,545
You dare to love and hate.
You dare to do what you want.

296
00:17:21,545 --> 00:17:23,475
Even in the face of all those obstacles.

297
00:17:24,305 --> 00:17:25,625
But I...

298
00:17:27,545 --> 00:17:31,475
I may hold the title
of the first bluestocking in Bianjing,

299
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:33,955
but I am

300
00:17:35,835 --> 00:17:38,065
just an ordinary woman.

301
00:17:44,065 --> 00:17:45,835
Lan.

302
00:17:45,835 --> 00:17:48,155
You shouldn't think that of yourself.

303
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:50,985
It's a choice to live life the way I do.

304
00:17:51,235 --> 00:17:53,625
It's also a choice to live life the way you do.

305
00:17:54,545 --> 00:17:56,955
As long as you are content with that lifestyle,

306
00:17:57,425 --> 00:17:58,505
it doesn't matter.

307
00:18:00,065 --> 00:18:01,915
There is no such thing
as a better or worse way of life.

308
00:18:03,425 --> 00:18:05,475
I believe that someday,

309
00:18:05,475 --> 00:18:08,545
you'll meet someone who loves you

310
00:18:08,915 --> 00:18:10,275
with all his heart as well.

311
00:18:11,665 --> 00:18:13,865
Thank you for your words of blessing.

312
00:18:18,395 --> 00:18:19,275
Qi.

313
00:18:20,105 --> 00:18:21,625
I know things have been hard

314
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,065
for you recently.

315
00:18:23,745 --> 00:18:25,595
If there's anything I can help you with,

316
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:26,545
let me know.

317
00:18:26,545 --> 00:18:28,155
I'll do my best to help.

318
00:18:30,355 --> 00:18:31,355

00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:18,145
Great!

329
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:21,235
Qi, is there one to your liking?

330
00:19:23,265 --> 00:19:24,835
Not really.

331
00:19:24,835 --> 00:19:26,235
I just wanted to take a look.

332
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,265
I'll take that one, Mister.

333

00:19:34,145 --> 00:19:35,025
All right.

336
00:19:40,115 --> 00:19:41,025
Qi?

337
00:19:42,425 --> 00:19:43,265
Qi?

338
00:19:45,115 --> 00:19:45,875
Qi!

339
00:19:46,475 --> 00:19:48,665
- Great!
- Great!

340
00:19:49,145 --> 00:19:50,145
Amazing!

341
00:19:51,475 --> 00:19:52,385
Qi!

342
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:53,715
How skillful.

343
00:19:53,755 --> 00:19:54,545
Indeed.

344
00:20:14,955 --> 00:20:15,595
Deputy Chief...

345
00:20:15,595 --> 00:20:16,545
Don't call me that.

346
00:20:17,475 --> 00:20:20,635
I suppose I'll be calling you "Madam Zhuo" soon.

347
00:20:22,265 --> 00:20:23,425
Deputy Chief, listen...

348
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:27,425
I never expected

349
00:20:27,425 --> 00:20:29,545
that you would be such a heartless woman.

350
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:31,635
You and I were engaged.

351
00:20:31,635 --> 00:20:33,065
Yet, you're going to marry Zhuo Wen Yuan

352
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,755
while I might have been dying out there.

353
00:20:36,955 --> 00:20:37,545
I...

354
00:20:37,545 --> 00:20:38,355
What?

355
00:20:38,355 --> 00:20:39,665
You left the Imperial College.

356
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:42,545
You don't need me anymore
after you got the position

357
00:20:44,515 --> 00:20:46,875
of the Manager of the Archive
and gained both fame and success?

358
00:20:47,355 --> 00:20:48,475
Deputy Chief...

359
00:20:48,475 --> 00:20:50,995
You sure put up a great act.

360
00:20:51,025 --> 00:20:51,875
Let me tell you this.

361
00:20:52,355 --> 00:20:54,545
I will never forgive you!

362
00:20:56,265 --> 00:20:57,115
Yan Yun Zhi!

363
00:21:00,755 --> 00:21:01,785
Don't come any closer!

364
00:21:01,785 --> 00:21:02,785
Let go of Sang Qi.

365
00:21:04,755 --> 00:21:05,595
Let go of her.

366
00:21:10,595 --> 00:21:12,875
You won't be able to escape anymore.

367
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,265
Surrender now.

368
00:21:21,955 --> 00:21:23,635
What a clever way to trap me there.

369
00:21:24,755 --> 00:21:26,755
So you remember what I taught you after all.

370
00:21:33,635 --> 00:21:34,355
Wait!

371
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:35,595
Don't move.

372
00:21:35,955 --> 00:21:36,955
Don't hurt Sang Qi.

373
00:21:38,595 --> 00:21:39,305
Don't move!

374
00:21:41,145 --> 00:21:44,385
Zhuo Wen Yuan, your affections run deep indeed.

375
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:47,425
But as someone who experienced betrayal,

376
00:21:47,475 --> 00:21:48,905
I have a few words of caution for you.

377
00:21:50,595 --> 00:21:52,475
I don't want anything to do

378
00:21:53,715 --> 00:21:56,065
with such a heartless woman ever again.

379
00:21:58,835 --> 00:21:59,785
I suggest

380
00:22:00,265 --> 00:22:02,025
you consider it well.

381
00:22:11,355 --> 00:22:12,025
Qi!

382
00:22:14,025 --> 00:22:15,715
Qi, are you all right?

383
00:22:18,635 --> 00:22:20,145
He still doesn't believe me...

384
00:23:20,635 --> 00:23:21,545
You're back.

385
00:23:36,835 --> 00:23:37,875
Qi.

386
00:23:46,065 --> 00:23:47,265
Qi...

387
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:56,385
Deputy Chief Yan.

388
00:23:56,755 --> 00:23:57,515
Yes.

389
00:23:59,755 --> 00:24:01,115
Taking advantage of the situation.

390
00:24:01,635 --> 00:24:03,065
You were quite bold out there, weren't you?

391
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,515
I wasn't. I wouldn't dare.

392
00:24:05,545 --> 00:24:08,145
It just happened. Have you forgotten already?

393
00:24:08,185 --> 00:24:11,595
I recall you said something about promiscuity?

394
00:24:11,635 --> 00:24:16,185
Something about ungratefulness? Heartless?

395
00:24:16,235 --> 00:24:17,475
Shameless?

396
00:24:17,515 --> 00:24:18,305
That's... impossible!

397
00:24:18,305 --> 00:24:19,025
I would never say such...

398
00:24:19,025 --> 00:24:19,955
Dare you talk back?

399
00:24:19,955 --> 00:24:20,595
I...

400
00:24:20,995 --> 00:24:22,185
You shoved me away so harshly.

401
00:24:22,185 --> 00:24:24,025
Weren't you worried that I might get hurt?

402
00:24:24,025 --> 00:24:25,115
How are you going to explain that?

403
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:27,835
Qi...

404
00:24:28,755 --> 00:24:29,785
I'm sorry, it was my fault.

405
00:24:29,785 --> 00:24:30,665
I didn't control my force.

406
00:24:30,665 --> 00:24:31,715
I almost hurt you.

407
00:24:31,715 --> 00:24:33,235
You hurt my heart.

408
00:24:33,235 --> 00:24:35,145
Yes, I hurt your heart.

409
00:24:36,265 --> 00:24:38,425
But I couldn't help it.

410
00:24:38,475 --> 00:24:39,995
My heart hurt

411
00:24:39,995 --> 00:24:41,065
when I said those things

412
00:24:41,065 --> 00:24:43,145
and shoved you away too.

413
00:24:43,145 --> 00:24:43,875
It felt hurt here.

414
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:46,785
You've certainly gotten
a lot sweeter with your words.

415
00:24:47,785 --> 00:24:50,025
But I wonder if you truly mean them.

416
00:24:50,025 --> 00:24:51,595
Of course, I do.

417
00:24:53,635 --> 00:24:54,425
Qi.

418
00:24:54,875 --> 00:24:55,995
But...

419
00:24:57,955 --> 00:25:00,875
Your ability to provoke others
has certainly improved as well.

420
00:25:02,235 --> 00:25:03,185
So, are you finding fault with me now?

421
00:25:04,145 --> 00:25:05,475
Well, if you do,

422
00:25:06,115 --> 00:25:08,635
my father shouldn't have saved you back then.

423
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:24,785
Master, we've been out here all day.

424
00:25:25,145 --> 00:25:26,115
We should go back soon.

425
00:25:27,995 --> 00:25:29,265
I've been terribly worried,

426
00:25:29,265 --> 00:25:30,595
so I wanted to get some fresh air.

427
00:25:31,425 --> 00:25:32,875
Don't tell me you even want to stop me from this.

428
00:25:33,835 --> 00:25:34,955
Well, I can't do that.

429
00:25:35,425 --> 00:25:36,785
But if you stay out here any longer,

430
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,265
I'm sure Young Lady will be worried.

431
00:25:38,665 --> 00:25:40,305
You're just tired from all the walking.

432
00:25:40,785 --> 00:25:42,145
Yet, you're using her as an excuse.

433
00:25:44,065 --> 00:25:46,305
But I haven't found a single clue yet.

434
00:25:48,235 --> 00:25:50,355
If only someone

435
00:25:50,355 --> 00:25:51,835
who knew everything that had happened

436
00:25:52,185 --> 00:25:53,355
would just fall from the sky.

437
00:25:57,145 --> 00:25:57,835
Master.

438
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,835
Look. There's someone over there.

439
00:26:07,025 --> 00:26:07,635
Get him up.

440
00:26:13,665 --> 00:26:15,025
Master, he's Deputy Chief Yan.

441
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:21,185
It looks like that person doesn't
have to fall from the sky.

442
00:26:21,185 --> 00:26:22,905
He could come from the river as well.

443
00:26:22,905 --> 00:26:24,025
What shall we do now, Master?

444
00:26:24,025 --> 00:26:25,475
Save him, of course!

445
00:26:25,515 --> 00:26:26,235
Someone!

446
00:26:35,755 --> 00:26:37,665
(You always seek your brother
when you're in trouble.)

447
00:26:38,185 --> 00:26:39,785
(Couldn't you come to me instead?)

448
00:26:40,115 --> 00:26:41,145
Deputy Chief?

449
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:46,755
Why would Deputy Chief be in my brother's room...

450
00:26:50,715 --> 00:26:52,635
I must be hallucinating.

451
00:26:53,835 --> 00:26:54,785
How would he...

452
00:27:11,355 --> 00:27:12,545
It doesn't make sense.

453
00:27:13,635 --> 00:27:15,115
But I am here indeed.

454
00:27:32,595 --> 00:27:34,595
Qi, I'm injured.

455
00:27:35,755 --> 00:27:36,995
Where are you hurt?

456
00:27:37,545 --> 00:27:38,875
Shouldn't you run into my arms

457
00:27:38,875 --> 00:27:40,265
and hug me at a time like this?

458
00:27:40,265 --> 00:27:41,635
Why did you hit me?

459
00:27:41,665 --> 00:27:43,145
You didn't tell me anything.

460
00:27:43,425 --> 00:27:45,475
You had me worried for nothing for so long.

461
00:27:49,665 --> 00:27:50,475
I'm sorry.

462
00:27:51,665 --> 00:27:53,235
I'm sorry for making you worried.

463
00:28:03,545 --> 00:28:04,785
Qi, my injuries are on my back.

464
00:28:16,305 --> 00:28:18,235
You didn't tell me anything.

465
00:28:18,715 --> 00:28:20,425
After you left the city,
I couldn't find you at all.

466
00:28:20,545 --> 00:28:22,385
And when you came back,
you were suddenly a wanted criminal.

467
00:28:22,715 --> 00:28:24,065
Just when I was thinking about you,

468
00:28:24,065 --> 00:28:26,065
you suddenly showed up in my brother's room.

469
00:28:26,385 --> 00:28:27,115
You gave me a great shock

470
00:28:27,115 --> 00:28:28,995
when you came out of there.

471
00:28:29,515 --> 00:28:30,995
Well, I had no other choice back then.

472
00:28:31,755 --> 00:28:33,235
I didn't have time to tell you.

473
00:28:33,875 --> 00:28:34,635
I've told you

474
00:28:35,025 --> 00:28:36,595
everything now, haven't I?

475
00:28:37,065 --> 00:28:39,145
Well, you can't hide anything from me anymore.

476
00:28:39,145 --> 00:28:40,635
You have to tell me everything.

477
00:28:51,145 --> 00:28:52,025
Coming!

478
00:28:56,185 --> 00:28:57,065
Official Zhuo.

479
00:29:05,905 --> 00:29:07,425
Master, Official Zhuo is here.

480
00:29:19,665 --> 00:29:21,235
Well, isn't this Zhuo?

481
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:23,425
What brings you here?

482
00:29:24,235 --> 00:29:25,835
I thought you had been busy

483
00:29:25,835 --> 00:29:27,355
climbing the ladders.

484
00:29:27,635 --> 00:29:28,715
I never expected

485
00:29:29,385 --> 00:29:31,595
that you would have time to visit me.

486
00:29:32,355 --> 00:29:34,715
That's too courteous, Grand Commandant Sang.

487
00:29:35,385 --> 00:29:36,665
No matter how busy I am,

488
00:29:36,665 --> 00:29:38,595
I wouldn't forget about you and Sang Qi.

489
00:29:38,595 --> 00:29:40,955
I will definitely visit often.

490
00:29:46,875 --> 00:29:48,835
Well, I certainly doubt
that you brought these men with you

491
00:29:51,265 --> 00:29:53,235
just to visit me.

492
00:29:55,235 --> 00:29:56,595
You're a clever man indeed, Grand Commandant Sang.

493
00:29:56,955 --> 00:29:59,305
Sang Qi and I ran into

494
00:29:59,305 --> 00:30:00,545
Yan Yun Zhi earlier.

495
00:30:01,265 --> 00:30:02,185
Hold on.

496
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:07,385
You said you found Yan Yun Zhi?

497
00:30:08,235 --> 00:30:08,635
Not just that.

498
00:30:09,755 --> 00:30:10,905
He tried to kidnap Sang Qi too.

499
00:30:12,355 --> 00:30:13,355
He almost got her hurt.

500
00:30:14,385 --> 00:30:15,355
Is this true?

501
00:30:15,755 --> 00:30:16,755
Absolutely.

502
00:30:17,355 --> 00:30:18,355
I brought these men here

503
00:30:18,785 --> 00:30:20,305
in case Yan Yun Zhi

504
00:30:20,355 --> 00:30:21,515
refuses to give up

505
00:30:22,065 --> 00:30:23,955
and comes here to disturb Sang Qi again.

506
00:30:24,835 --> 00:30:26,875
Yan Yun Zhi is a wanted fugitive right now.

507
00:30:27,475 --> 00:30:28,785
What if he acts out of desperation?

508
00:30:28,995 --> 00:30:29,545
What?

509
00:30:31,515 --> 00:30:33,025
Do you think I, as the Grand Commandant,

510
00:30:33,545 --> 00:30:34,905
can't even protect

511
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:38,385
my daughter and my residence?

512
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:41,755
Of course, we trust you, Grand Commandant Sang.

513
00:30:42,185 --> 00:30:44,475
But we came on His Majesty's orders.

514
00:30:45,235 --> 00:30:48,115
You won't disobey
His Majesty's orders now, will you?

515
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:58,900
(Royal Decree)

516
00:31:00,835 --> 00:31:02,595
Young Lady, bad news!

517
00:31:03,305 --> 00:31:05,065
Mr. Zhuo brought his men here.

518
00:31:05,065 --> 00:31:05,955
He said he would have them guard you.

519
00:31:06,475 --> 00:31:07,305
Zhuo Wen Yuan?

520
00:31:31,665 --> 00:31:32,635
Mr. Zhuo.

521
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:35,875
Mr. Zhuo, Young Lady is sleeping now.

522
00:31:39,835 --> 00:31:40,635
Mr. Zhuo.

523
00:31:42,515 --> 00:31:43,065
Qi.

524
00:31:45,145 --> 00:31:46,115
Why are you here?

525
00:31:46,355 --> 00:31:47,425
I'm already in bed.

526
00:31:47,835 --> 00:31:49,265
It's inconvenient for me to come out and see you.

527
00:31:53,755 --> 00:31:54,515
It's nothing.

528
00:31:54,875 --> 00:31:56,265
We ran into Yan Yun Zhi earlier, didn't we?

529
00:31:56,515 --> 00:31:57,635
I'm worried he will come back.

530
00:31:57,955 --> 00:31:59,025
So I've asked my men to guard you.

531
00:31:59,385 --> 00:32:01,475
I'm fine. Don't worry.

532
00:32:02,955 --> 00:32:03,635
It's all right.

533
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:05,265
I came on His Majesty's orders.

534
00:32:05,835 --> 00:32:06,955
Rest well.

535
00:32:08,145 --> 00:32:10,305
All right. Thank you.

536
00:32:22,145 --> 00:32:23,025
Mr. Zhuo!

537
00:32:23,145 --> 00:32:24,595
Mr. Zhuo, Young Lady already went to bed.

538
00:32:24,905 --> 00:32:25,595
Young Lady...

539
00:32:28,475 --> 00:32:29,355
What is going on?

540
00:32:31,425 --> 00:32:32,185
Nothing.

541
00:32:32,955 --> 00:32:34,145
I heard a noise coming from inside your room.

542
00:32:34,515 --> 00:32:35,755
So I came inside to take a look.

543
00:32:37,235 --> 00:32:39,355
I haven't moved since I got into my bed.

544
00:32:39,835 --> 00:32:40,875
What sort of noise could there be?

545
00:32:42,025 --> 00:32:42,635
Is that so?

546
00:32:43,265 --> 00:32:44,025
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

547
00:32:45,475 --> 00:32:47,995
It's inappropriate for you to barge into my room

548
00:32:48,995 --> 00:32:50,265
at night.

549
00:32:51,425 --> 00:32:52,235
And you even brought so many people with you.

550
00:32:59,785 --> 00:33:00,755
I'll leave soon.

551
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,265
But don't worry, Qi.

552
00:33:02,905 --> 00:33:04,545
I'll be guarding you outside your room tonight.

553
00:33:04,875 --> 00:33:06,385
If you see or hear anything,

554
00:33:07,025 --> 00:33:08,025
just call me.

555
00:33:09,305 --> 00:33:09,995
Lian Pian.

556
00:33:11,425 --> 00:33:13,515
Mr. Zhuo, please.

557
00:33:43,115 --> 00:33:43,785
He left.

558
00:33:48,385 --> 00:33:49,235
He's gone.

559
00:33:51,265 --> 00:33:51,995
Qi.

560
00:33:52,835 --> 00:33:53,785
I guess

561
00:33:54,145 --> 00:33:55,715
I'll have to sleep here tonight.

562
00:33:56,235 --> 00:33:57,955
What? You don't want to?

563
00:33:58,265 --> 00:33:59,025
No.

564
00:34:01,955 --> 00:34:02,955
I'm just worried about you.

565
00:34:04,635 --> 00:34:05,305
Lie down.

566
00:34:15,755 --> 00:34:16,995
He came here on His Majesty's orders.

567
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:18,635
What a great excuse.

568
00:34:21,235 --> 00:34:22,595
Let's not bother about him for now.

569
00:34:23,065 --> 00:34:25,265
Let's think about what we're going to do next.

570
00:34:26,715 --> 00:34:28,185
According to our plan,

571
00:34:28,475 --> 00:34:29,545
once you show up,

572
00:34:29,835 --> 00:34:31,425
Zhuo Wen Yuan will definitely come.

573
00:34:32,715 --> 00:34:33,425
It looks like

574
00:34:34,355 --> 00:34:35,875
our speculation was right.

575
00:34:35,995 --> 00:34:37,475
When the time comes, he'll definitely

576
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:39,545
mobilize the Prefecture Court's
forces to capture me.

577
00:34:39,875 --> 00:34:41,355
The security there will be lowered then.

578
00:34:41,835 --> 00:34:43,355
And he'll use that opportunity
to get rid of Yan San Lang.

579
00:34:44,235 --> 00:34:45,715
Do you have a plan?

580
00:34:46,235 --> 00:34:47,635
This is a serious matter.

581
00:34:47,875 --> 00:34:50,065
Don't worry. I have planned everything.

582
00:35:32,235 --> 00:35:32,875
Don't move!

583
00:35:35,355 --> 00:35:37,265
I already had Yan Yan prepare himself in advance.

584
00:35:38,065 --> 00:35:40,265
My Second Uncle has taken San Lang away as well.

585
00:35:41,265 --> 00:35:43,315
Your master will be protecting him.
You don't have to worry about him.

586
00:35:43,625 --> 00:35:45,075
As long as Yan San Lang is safe.

587
00:35:49,515 --> 00:35:51,075
When will he wake up?

588
00:35:52,075 --> 00:35:55,185
I'm still counting on him to clear your name.

589
00:35:56,075 --> 00:35:57,105
I don't know.

590
00:35:58,385 --> 00:36:00,345
We can't put all our hope

591
00:36:00,345 --> 00:36:01,665
on him right now.

592
00:36:04,625 --> 00:36:06,105
But we can't just wait and do nothing.

593
00:36:11,185 --> 00:36:11,795
Qi.

594
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:12,185
What's the matter?

595
00:36:13,075 --> 00:36:14,385
You touched my wound.

596
00:36:14,425 --> 00:36:15,715
Sorry. Are you all right?

597
00:36:17,865 --> 00:36:18,755
I'm fine.

598
00:36:19,315 --> 00:36:20,235
I'll continue.

599
00:36:25,315 --> 00:36:26,585
I guess

600
00:36:27,905 --> 00:36:29,105
all those things that happened back then,

601
00:36:29,625 --> 00:36:30,475
Yu's death,

602
00:36:32,235 --> 00:36:33,425
Xizhao,

603
00:36:33,665 --> 00:36:35,865
and assassination of Yan San Lang
in the outskirts of the city,

604
00:36:36,625 --> 00:36:39,075
all of these won't be enough
to take down Zhuo Wen Yuan.

605
00:36:39,315 --> 00:36:40,865
We can only try to catch him in the act.

606
00:36:42,385 --> 00:36:43,955
You have the same idea as I do.

607
00:36:44,585 --> 00:36:47,235
We can look into the investigation
on the salt route.

608
00:36:47,235 --> 00:36:49,755
If we can find evidence of him
selling salt illegally,

609
00:36:50,345 --> 00:36:51,625
we should be able to get him.

610
00:36:52,075 --> 00:36:53,345
But we need to think of a way

611
00:36:53,345 --> 00:36:54,755
to get him to do all of those things again.

612
00:36:56,145 --> 00:36:57,105
We need to find a way

613
00:36:57,865 --> 00:36:59,075
to lower his guard.

614
00:36:59,475 --> 00:37:01,385
Only then will we be able to catch him in the act.

615
00:37:02,755 --> 00:37:03,385
Qi.

616
00:37:04,665 --> 00:37:05,385
Tonight will probably be

617
00:37:05,385 --> 00:37:06,955
the last night I'll be able
to spend with you for a while.

618
00:37:07,955 --> 00:37:10,235
Zhuo Wen Yuan didn't notice me tonight.

619
00:37:10,905 --> 00:37:12,715
But I'm sure he'll realize it soon.

620
00:37:14,105 --> 00:37:14,905
Get some rest.

621
00:37:16,475 --> 00:37:17,995
It'll be a long battle.

622
00:37:33,235 --> 00:37:34,075
Sleep now.

623
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,590
(Grand Commandant's Residence)

624
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:58,420
(Grand Morale)

625
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:03,905
(Grand Commandant's Residence)

626
00:38:06,755 --> 00:38:07,475
You've worked hard.

627
00:38:07,715 --> 00:38:08,755
Go back and get some rest.

628
00:38:11,275 --> 00:38:12,385
You should go back soon as well.

629
00:38:13,145 --> 00:38:14,825
Let's go, everyone.

630
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,824
(Grand Commandant's Residence)

631
00:38:35,385 --> 00:38:35,755
Young Master.

632
00:38:35,955 --> 00:38:36,585
How did it go?

633
00:38:36,665 --> 00:38:37,625
Unsuccessful.

634
00:38:38,275 --> 00:38:39,385
As per your orders,

635
00:38:39,475 --> 00:38:40,555
our men attempted to assassinate Yan San Lang.

636
00:38:40,795 --> 00:38:42,145
But we were ambushed.

637
00:38:42,475 --> 00:38:44,315
Yan San Lang was replaced by Yan Yan.

638
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:45,715
But fortunately,

639
00:38:45,755 --> 00:38:47,345
our assassin did not fear death.

640
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,345
He took his own life immediately
after he was captured.

641
00:38:49,555 --> 00:38:50,955
We left no traces.

642
00:38:52,585 --> 00:38:54,075
Yan Xiao Lang doesn't have the wits

643
00:38:54,075 --> 00:38:55,315
or the guts to deceive me.

644
00:38:55,555 --> 00:38:56,235
I think

645
00:38:57,185 --> 00:38:58,755
this is still the doing of Yan Yun Zhi.

646
00:38:59,585 --> 00:39:00,585
Our people

647
00:39:00,825 --> 00:39:02,345
searched the entire Bianjing,

648
00:39:02,665 --> 00:39:04,275
but we didn't manage to find Yan Yun Zhi.

649
00:39:04,905 --> 00:39:06,715
Young Master, you guarded
the Grand Commandant's Residence overnight,

650
00:39:07,105 --> 00:39:08,385
but you didn't find anything either.

651
00:39:10,755 --> 00:39:13,185
Could it be that he didn't stay in the city?

652
00:39:15,865 --> 00:39:16,795
That's possible too.

653
00:39:26,795 --> 00:39:28,235
Dear, where have you been?

654
00:39:28,275 --> 00:39:29,555
You were not around all night.

655
00:39:30,425 --> 00:39:32,425
What's going on, Jia Yin?

656
00:39:32,755 --> 00:39:33,555
Oh, don't bring it up.

657
00:39:33,585 --> 00:39:35,185
I lost my favorite hairpin.

658
00:39:35,995 --> 00:39:37,345
It's just a hairpin.

659
00:39:37,345 --> 00:39:38,235
You can always buy another one.

660
00:39:38,475 --> 00:39:39,515
That won't do.

661
00:39:39,755 --> 00:39:40,905
That's the only one in the entire city.

662
00:39:41,075 --> 00:39:41,905
You can't buy it anywhere.

663
00:39:43,075 --> 00:39:44,185
If you can't buy it, then search for it.

664
00:39:44,425 --> 00:39:46,235
I've searched all the shops and restaurants

665
00:39:46,275 --> 00:39:48,475
I visited yesterday several times already.

666
00:39:49,995 --> 00:39:50,715
But you still couldn't find it?

667
00:39:51,275 --> 00:39:52,275
There's nothing I can do to find it.

668
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:53,145
Madam!

669
00:39:53,515 --> 00:39:54,515
We found your hairpin.

670
00:39:55,035 --> 00:39:56,145
Which shop did you find it from?

671
00:39:56,235 --> 00:39:57,665
We found it in your room.

672
00:39:58,425 --> 00:39:59,905
I spent a long time searching my room for it.

673
00:40:00,035 --> 00:40:01,345
How could it possibly have been there?

674
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:04,825
That's right.

675
00:40:05,585 --> 00:40:06,755
We couldn't find him anywhere.

676
00:40:07,035 --> 00:40:08,425
But he was right under our noses.

677
00:40:09,105 --> 00:40:09,555
Jing Mu.

678
00:40:10,235 --> 00:40:10,665
Get the people.

679
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,105
We'll go to the Grand Commandant's Residence again.

680
00:40:12,715 --> 00:40:12,995
I...

681
00:40:20,185 --> 00:40:20,795
Master.

682
00:40:22,235 --> 00:40:23,270
Official Zhuo is here again.

683
00:40:30,865 --> 00:40:32,185
Why are you here again?

684
00:40:32,665 --> 00:40:34,105
Is there no end to this?

685
00:40:36,715 --> 00:40:38,185
I am right beside my daughter.

686
00:40:38,755 --> 00:40:39,665
Are you still worried

687
00:40:39,665 --> 00:40:41,385
that Yan Yun Zhi will snatch her from my side?

688
00:40:42,145 --> 00:40:43,275
We received a tip-off

689
00:40:43,385 --> 00:40:44,275
that the fugitive, Yan Yun Zhi,

690
00:40:44,625 --> 00:40:46,075
is hiding inside this residence.

691
00:40:51,755 --> 00:40:52,715
What tip-off?

692
00:40:53,345 --> 00:40:54,585
I can't tell you that.

693
00:40:54,955 --> 00:40:55,865
Qi.

694
00:40:56,145 --> 00:40:57,995
Could you not interfere with my duties?

695
00:40:58,075 --> 00:40:58,825
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

696
00:41:00,145 --> 00:41:02,235
I haven't blamed you

697
00:41:02,235 --> 00:41:03,555
for that you barged into my room last night.

698
00:41:04,075 --> 00:41:05,825
Yet, you want to search my residence today.

699
00:41:06,665 --> 00:41:07,825
What exactly are you trying to do?

700
00:41:08,425 --> 00:41:09,515
I'm just here on official business.

701
00:41:09,515 --> 00:41:10,715
Could it be that you have something to hide?

702
00:41:12,755 --> 00:41:13,625
Me?

703
00:41:14,515 --> 00:41:15,275
Something to hide?

704
00:41:16,825 --> 00:41:17,385
All right then.

705
00:41:17,865 --> 00:41:18,345
Search the place!

706
00:41:18,825 --> 00:41:19,235
Search the place!

707
00:41:52,345 --> 00:41:53,185
Search the room!

708
00:41:57,825 --> 00:41:58,625
Search the place!

709
00:42:08,715 --> 00:42:09,825
Official, we didn't find anything.

710
00:42:09,825 --> 00:42:10,345
Nothing.

711
00:42:10,425 --> 00:42:10,755
Leave!

712
00:42:13,995 --> 00:42:14,625
Nothing.

713
00:42:14,955 --> 00:42:15,825
Nothing, Official.

714
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:16,345
Let's go!

715
00:42:27,035 --> 00:42:27,715
Official,

716
00:42:28,075 --> 00:42:29,145
we've searched the entire residence.

717
00:42:29,145 --> 00:42:30,235
We didn't find anything unusual.

718
00:42:34,345 --> 00:42:35,425
What about Sang Qi's room?

719
00:42:35,755 --> 00:42:37,235
Official, we've searched her room as well.

720
00:42:40,585 --> 00:42:41,715
Are you satisfied now?

721
00:42:43,515 --> 00:42:43,955
Qi...

722
00:42:44,035 --> 00:42:44,795
Don't bother.

723
00:42:45,275 --> 00:42:45,955
Send our guests off!

724
00:42:54,755 --> 00:42:55,315
- Qi!
- Qi!

725
00:42:59,665 --> 00:43:00,715
What's the matter?

726
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:01,865
Qi?

727
00:43:03,035 --> 00:43:03,905
Qi.

728
00:43:05,865 --> 00:43:07,665
Qi? Qi?

729
00:43:09,235 --> 00:43:09,755
Qi.
