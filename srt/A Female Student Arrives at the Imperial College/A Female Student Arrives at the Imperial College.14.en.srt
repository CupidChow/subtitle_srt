So tell me,

29
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:40,800
did anything happen lately?

30
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,120
Nothing.

31
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,830
Maybe I'm just a little tired.

32
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:51,950
Who could it be at this hour?

33
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,360
Is the Deputy Chief here for inspection?

34
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,360
The Deputy Chief?

35
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,230
Hurry up!

36
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,360
Hurry!

37
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,040
Hide.

38
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,800
- But where?
- Hide.

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,830
I'm coming.

40
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:06,830
Here.

41
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:10,720
I'll be right there!

42
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,830
I'm getting changed.

43
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,110
Yan Yan.

44
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:19,880
Why are you here?

45
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,720
Song Luo Tian wants to harm me.

46
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,550
Trust me,

47
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:22,670
he's brewing a grand scheme.

48
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,910
He wants to lure me in

49
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,360
and trap me

50
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,360
without me even noticing it!

51
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:25,910
Trap?

52
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:26,630
He's pretending to be asleep.

53
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,800
But this whole place could be
crawling with assassins!

54
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,390
Sang Qi, you must save me!

55
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,270
Save you?

56
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,240
Oh no, they are already here.

57
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,670
A wise man knows when to retreat.

58
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:36,910
Let's hide ourselves!

59
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:37,960
Hide.

60
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:38,750
But...

61
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,000
Come in here.

62
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,360
Not bad.

63
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,240
Deputy Chief.

64
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,110
How may I help you?

65
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,360
I was patrolling the yard.

66
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,240
I heard noises coming from here.

67
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,110
So I came to check it out.

68
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,270
Are you all right?

69
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:10,390
I am fine.

70
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,440
Thank you for your concern.

71
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,190
Sang Qi.

72
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:14,470
I feel a little parched.

73
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:15,720
Could I have some tea?

74
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,080
He asked for tea?

75
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,030
Do you find this place comfortable?

76
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,960
Thanks to your help,

77
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,320
I'm adjusting well.

78
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,440
I'm getting used to it.

79
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,390
This place is great.

80
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,720
Who could it be at this hour?

81
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:43,960
Who is it?

82
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,830
It's Lan.

83
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,670
I thought she left the mountain.

84
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,670
I'd like to have a word with Qi.

85
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,440
May I come in?

86
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,550
Deputy Chief, perhaps you should hide
for the time being.

87
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:03,360
Why should I?

88
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,910
It's the middle of the night.

89
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,750
She might take it wrongly.

90
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,910
We wouldn't want any trouble.

91
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:08,800
I'll explain to her.

92
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,390
Deputy Chief.

93
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,110
Hide.

94
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,270
Right away!

95
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,960
Why should I hide?

96
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,240
Where should I hide?

97
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,350
One, two, three...

98
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,320
Over here.

99
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:31,550
But...

100
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:32,920
Under the bed?

101
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:35,950
Hurry up.

102
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:37,600
Go.

103
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:42,950
Why are you here?

104
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,350
Lan.

105
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,200
Sorry for bothering you.

106
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,480
Lan, we can talk

107
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,830
at the tea plantation.

108
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,670
To enjoy its view at night?

109
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:55,640
Yes.

110
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:57,790
The air there feels refreshing at night.

111
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:58,510
It's soothing.

112
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,920
We should talk inside.

113
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,270
How thoughtful of Yun Zhi.

114
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,880
I can tell right away

115
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,550
he put thoughts into decorating this room.

116
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,950
He does the same for all students.

117
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,600
Deputy Chief is truly thoughtful.

118
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,390
What's wrong, Qi?

119
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,880
Are you not feeling well?

120
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,830
Not at all.

121
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,040
I just finished my martial art practice.

122
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,950
I feel rejuvenated.

123
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,320
Lan, you wish to have a word with me?

124
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:48,640
It's about your question from earlier.

125
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,830
I want to discuss it with you.

126
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,510
Lan.

127
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:54,550
Perhaps we should save the discussion
for another time.

128
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,200
- Qi...
- But...

129
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,230
I came to you

130
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,920
to clarify everything.

131
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,550
There are only the two of us here.

132
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,270
It's quiet and cozy.
I couldn't ask for a better place.

133
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,600
Not at all.

134
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,200
You once told me

135
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
your feelings for Yun Zhi.

136
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,110
I was ill that day,

137
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,600
so I didn't get the chance to talk.

138
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,350
But after thinking it through,

139
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,640
I think

140
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,950
you don't truly like him.

141
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,270
Perhaps

142
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,760
you merely projected your longing
and trust for your brother

143
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,600
onto him.

144
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:31,880
It's only transference.

145
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,760
Qi, since we are both honest to each other,

146
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,760
I want to make things clear to you.

147
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,830
I don't want you to get hurt.

148
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,640
I know Yun Zhi well enough.

149
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,070
He is loyal to his friends.

150
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,440
You are Sang Yu's younger sister.

151
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,480
His kindness for you

152
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,160
is to fulfill his friend's wish.

153
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:03,200
Or perhaps he only sees you as a sister.

154
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,110
If you confess to him recklessly,

155
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,320
it might be very awkward for both of you.

156
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,000
It'll be the same Song Jia Yin's case.

157
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,040
But you are also different from Song Jia Yin.

158
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,550
After all, you will be staying

159
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,550
at the Imperial College to study.

160
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,000
Making a fuss out of it

161
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,320
will only make life unhappy for both of you.

162
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,390
Qi.

163
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,720
Heed my advice.

164
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,350
You are still young.

165
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,760
Do not get distracted.

166
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:38,760
Do not waste your time on a relationship
that will never end well.

167
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:42,790
But...

168
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,920
Mr. Yan.

169
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,270
Miss Su.

170
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,040
Why are you here?

171
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,270
It's not just me.

172
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:08,230
There are also...

173
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:08,920
Mr. Zhuo.

174
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:09,760
Yes.

175
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,550
Zhuo Wen Yuan is here too.

176
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,200
Yes.

177
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,070
- Zhuo.
- What are the odds?

178
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,230
Zhuo Wen Yuan, come out.

179
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,270
But...

180
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,270
Mr. Zhuo.

181
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:19,920
It's so lively in here.

182
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,950
The more, the merrier.

183
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,550
Miss Su.

184
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,070
The three of you...

185
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,550
The three of us...

186
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,230
The three of us...

187
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,720
We were drinking!

188
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:31,790
Yes.

189
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,760
- We were...
- Bring it out.

190
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,200
- Drink.
- We were drinking.

191
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,200
We were drinking.

192
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:35,720
Yes.

193
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,000
Pardon my intrusion.

194
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,230
Sorry for the interruption.

195
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:42,760
Not at all.

196
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,200
I shall take my leave now.

197
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,200
Let me see you off.

198
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:54,440
Deputy Chief.

199
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,550
Deputy Chief.

200
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,640
Do you have no regard for rules?

201
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:04,840
Go back to where you should be.

202
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,840
Deputy Chief, aren't you leaving?

203
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:22,230
We must talk after leaving the mountain.

204
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:22,710
Wait for me.

205
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,760
Rest well.

206
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:34,870
(Good health and longevity)

207
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,520
Qi.

208
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,110
Are you really in love with the Deputy Chief?

209
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:38,960
(Good health and longevity)

210
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,790
No way.

211
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,670
Lan got it all wrong.

212
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,320
Nonsense.

213
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:45,590
Deputy Chief.

214
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,400
Get back to your work.

215
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,110
Aren't you joining us today?

216
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,080
There are things to discuss

217
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,400
with the farmers.

218
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,520
The Deputy Chief is acting strange today.

219
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,470
He is always strange.

220
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,880
So it's normal.

221
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:28,840
Young Master.

222
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,200
Have you found anything?

223
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,350
As your ordered,

224
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,640
I found out certain plants

225
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,910
of the Song Tea Plantation were different.

226
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,910
It's heavily guarded and suspicious.

227
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,320
It's time to reel in the net.

228
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,760
Ask Yan San Lang to bring his men.

229
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:42,550
Yes.

230
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:01,230
This is

231
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,280
the detailed map of Song Tea Plantation
I drew overlooking from the hill.

232
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,880
Along with Bai Shi's lead,

233
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,320
I marked several suspicious locations.

234
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:11,520
Very well.

235
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:12,470
Tomorrow morning

236
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,080
I'll raid the tea plantation

237
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,150
in the name of arresting the fugitive.

238
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,200
Is the tea plantation surrounded?

239
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,200
Don't worry.

240
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,350
My men have the whole tea Plantation surrounded.

241
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,200
I assure you,

242
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,640
not even a fly can get past us.

243
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:00,470
(It's warm.)

244
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:07,030
Deputy Chief,

245
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,150
shouldn't you be in bed by now?

246
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,910
It's nothing. I was tucking in your blanket.

247
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,080
Go to sleep.

248
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,550
Don't stay up too late.

249
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:33,470
Sang Qi!

250
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,400
Sang Qi!

251
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,110
What is it?

252
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,200
The Song Tea Plantation is in trouble.

253
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,590
Hurry up!

254
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,350
Scram!

255
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:52,760
Confiscate the evidence!

256
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,400
Yes!

257
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:03,880
Stop!

258
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,880
Why are you raiding our plantation?

259
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:16,550
Why?

260
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,520
You conspired with Xizhao

261
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,400
and planted illegal species.

262
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,280
Both are heinous crimes!

263
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:21,910
Inform your father.

264
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,440
Punishments await him.

265
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,000
Impossible.

266
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,760
Someone must have set us up!

267
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,320
My father will get to the

268
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,280
bottom of this!

269
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,590
Mr. Song.

270
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,640
We have the evidence with us.

271
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:34,200
I advise you not to obstruct us.

272
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,960
Otherwise, I shall show no mercy for you.

273
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:39,350
Sir!

274
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:46,470
It indeed has nothing to do with Official Song.

275
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,280
The land with the plants you confiscated

276
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,840
was owned by Official Wei.

277
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,760
We have no idea

278
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,790
what's going on under the table.

279
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,670
I can't absolve your master

280
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,320
base on your words alone.

281
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,440
I wouldn't dare.

282
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,760
We have the land deed to prove my claim.

283
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,320
There are records in the ledger.

284
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,760
I will gladly present you with both.

285
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:10,790
It's all right.

286
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,070
(Deed)
(Receiver: Wei)

287
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:25,670
I will

288
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:27,590
investigate this case further at the capital.

289
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,400
Load the evidence onto the cart,
send it to the Prefecture Court!

290
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,280
Wei Zhan Hong.

291
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,280
Don't worry.

292
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,910
I'll ask for my father's help
to clear the Wei family's name.

293
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,320
Song.

294
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,670
You must help my father.

295
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,550
The farming just ended so abruptly.

296
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,030
This is all too sudden.

297
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,550
(Good health and longevity)
Maybe the Deputy Chief find this place unlucky

298
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:10,840
that we shouldn't stay here.

299
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,910
The authority will search
the whole mountainside.

300
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,840
It'll be inconvenient if we stay.

301
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,790
Why didn't the Deputy Chief come with us?

302
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,030
I saw him leaving

303
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,350
with Official Yan.

304
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,030
Did the Deputy Chief come here
to investigate the case?

305
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,080
Maybe the farming was just a cover.

306
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,550
It's hard to tell.

307
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,000
The Deputy Chief is a man
of complicated thoughts.

308
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,670
It's not like we can see through his mind.

309
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,570
(Prefecture Court)

310
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,710
Grand Tutor Song must be part of this operation.

311
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,640
But who would have thought?

312
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,520
He is using Official Wei to save his neck.

313
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,400
The authority just gave up on this case.

314
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:00,320
They just want to close it.

315
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,350
Something is amiss.

316
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:04,910
This deed is not new by any means.

317
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,200
(Land Deed)
It wasn't written recently.

318
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,030
Perhaps Grand Tutor Song had
already planned to abandon

319
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,430
his accomplice to save his skin.

320
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,520
Or perhaps Official Wei himself

321
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,350
has been corrupted.

322
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,160
Someone else was pulling the strings.

323
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,590
Qi Lang, what do you have in mind?

324
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,470
Could you arrange for me

325
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,680
to talk to Official Wei in private?

326
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,760
He is in prison.

327
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,000
Seeing him won't be easy.

328
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:28,520
How about this?

329
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,590
I know a warden.

330
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,470
I can make the arrangement

331
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:32,470
when it's his shift.

332
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,470
I'll keep you posted.

333
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,470
I'm counting on you, San Lang.

334
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,430
I have work to see to.

335
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,280
I'll be off now.

336
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:40,350
Thank you, Qi Lang.

337
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:09,160
Deputy Chief.

338
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,430
You're here.

339
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:13,880
Is this about

340
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,830
the tea plantation?

341
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,350
I saw Yan San Lang there.

342
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:17,880
Sang Qi.

343
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,760
Do you think I asked you to come all the way here

344
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,880
only to talk about the investigation?

345
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,560
Then...

346
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,920
I've been working hard.

347
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,190
I finished my homework.

348
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,400
Don't worry about me.

349
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,350
We can talk about your study
at the Imperial College

350
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,110
instead of here.

351
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,280
Then...

352
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,560
Is it about my brother?

353
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,310
No.

354
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,830
Master must have got into some trouble.

355
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,760
So he wants us back at the Lingwu Mountain?

356
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,110
Sang Qi.

357
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,710
Aside from the Imperial College,

358
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,160
your brother,

359
00:18:59,070 --> 00:18:59,920
the investigation,

360
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,160
and martial arts,

361
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,590
don't we have anything else we can talk about?

362
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,190
We...

363
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,070
Anything else?

364
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,710
The weather is so pleasant today.

365
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,560
The view is magnificent.

366
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:25,800
Indeed.

367
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,160
I can enjoy the company of this beautiful view

368
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,310
and a beautiful lady.

369
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:36,560
Family?
[*a pun]

370
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,760
You mean...

371
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,830
Do you mean I'm your family?

372
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,430
You want me to be your little sister.

373
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,230
Lan was right the other day.

374
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,430
I'm only ever a little sister to you.

375

Qi...

376
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,230
I want...

377
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,230
What do you want?

378
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,760
I think you've known

379
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,470
what I want all along.

380
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,590
I'm tired of guessing.

381
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:10,430
I want a clear answer

382
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,800

Deputy Chief.

408
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,000
Did you plan

409
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,310
to confess to me

410
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:17,710
after the investigation is over?

411
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,520
Mind the steps.

412
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,470
Keep your head up.

413
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:21,800
I don't need to.

414
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,760
I know you'll be my eyes.

415
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,280
I just want to look at you.

416
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,800
So when did you fall for me?

417
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:32,830
Does it matter?

418
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,710
Of course. I want to know.

419
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:37,560
I don't remember.

420
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,430
You don't remember?

421
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,590
I bet you just forgot about it.

422
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:42,310
So

423
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,640
when you did fall for me?

424
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,350
Do you remember?

425
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,430
Of course.

426
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,280
When was it?

427
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,110
I'm not telling you.

428
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,000
When you're alone with me,

429
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,760
call me Yun Zhi.

430
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,760
Yun Zhi.

431
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,590
No, that sounds rude.

432
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,310
I should address you as Deputy Chief.

433
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,310
You may call me whatever you want.

434

Deputy Chief.

435
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,760
Do you have any plans for the future?

436
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,760
I'll propose to you.

437
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:27,950
After you graduate,

438
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,230
I'll marry you.

440
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,280
Can we keep this relationship

441
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,190
a secret for now?

442
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,680
Let's make it official after I graduate, okay?

443
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,560
Are you concerned about something?

444
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:47,280
Or are you worried about gossips?

445
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,710
I want to finish my study

446

at Imperial College myself.

447
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,950
Promise me.

448
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,110
Very well.

449
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:58,920

Do you have to make it so obvious?

492
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,800
I have no choice.

493
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,560
I tried to make people think we had a fallout.

494
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,800
You could at least make up some logical excuses.

495
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,680
You kept

496
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,880
punishing me over the most trivial matters.

497
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:14,760
Don't you think

498
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,880
people might start suspecting?

499
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,880
But if I didn't do so,

500
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,230
we'd barely

501
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,920
have any time for each other.

502
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,880
You can't punish me for that.

503
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,190
You could have saved me some face.

504
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,430
Fine, Qi. I get it.

505
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,430
I won't be so assertive again.

506
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,760
I'll do as you say.

507
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:31,880
Don't be mad at me.

508
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,190
Cheer up, all right?

509
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,280
When you get too tense,

510
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,350

Have you learned your mistake?

514
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:43,000
You...

515
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,470
You're driving me insane!

516
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,430
Deputy Chief.

517
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:52,280
You should educate the students
with good manners.

518
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,880
You cannot resort to violence!

519
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,350
You must always have patience.

520
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,310
Sang Qi.

521
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,880
I've heard rumors about your playful demeanor.

522
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,310
It's time to behave yourself.

523
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,040
The Deputy Chief lost his patience for a little.

524
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:08,110
Right?

525
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:09,560
Do not blame him.

526
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:12,520
Between the students and teacher,

527
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,560
it's normal to have some arguments.

528
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,110
Just talk it through.

529
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,350
It'll be water under the bridge the next day.

530
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,000
Deputy Chief, talk it through with her.

531
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,040
No more violence!

532
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,560
How dare you!

533
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,640
Yan Yun Zhi...

534
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,000
I can't believe you hit me!

535
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,520
Qi, sorry.

536
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,350
You actually hit me!

537
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,560
It was only an act.

538
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,430
I didn't hit too hard.

539
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,470
I barely put any strength into it.

540
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:45,520
I don't care!

541
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:49,760
Qi.

542
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:51,590
Don't you think it's nice

543
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,190
when we don't have to hide?

544
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,470
I wish we could make it official.

545
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:06,640
People might see us during the daytime.

546
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,430
But I can wait outside your place

547
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,830
after nightfall.

548
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,310
You mean...

549
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,190
I have to get over the wall at night?

550
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,400
That is a little exciting.

551
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,350
That is a little inappropriate.

552
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,590
Very well, that settles it.

553
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:29,880
So tonight,

554
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:31,680
how do I signal you?

555
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,760
We can use

556
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,950
a cat's meow as our signal.

557
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,350
Can you make the sound?

558
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:40,880
Bai Shi can do it.

559
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:44,400
Qi.

560
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:45,760
I...

561
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,680
I didn't hit hard.

562
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,430
Let me take a look.

563
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,590
Let me see it.

564
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:51,710
You can hit me back.

565
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:54,920
I won't dodge it.

566
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,430
I knew you wouldn't do it.

567
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,430
It hurts me to hit you.

568
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:03,800
Young Lady!

569
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,350
The night is cold, stay warm.

570
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,190
How do I look?

571
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,710
Keep meowing.

572
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:11,280
All right.

573
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:13,230
Wait.

574
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,160
Freshen your foundation.

575
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:18,710
Is it done now?

576
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:19,190
Perfect.

577
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:23,590
Master.

578
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,560
Father. Why...

579
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:31,950
What are you doing?

580
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,520
Keep meowing.

581
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,880
Why are you here?

582
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,760
I...

583
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,160
I was looking for the cat.

584
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,760
As soon as I went to bed,
the cursed cat started meowing.

585
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,830
I can't train well tomorrow at the riverside
if I don't sleep well.

586
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:46,680
I'll get rid of it.

587
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:47,520
Father!

588
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:47,760
Stop.

589
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,430
Father, that was uncalled for.

590
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,830
Let's not trouble ourselves with some animals.

591
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,760
It's just your usual training.

592
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,560
What's the halberd for?

593
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,590
Why not?

594
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:58,070
I promised the men

595
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:58,800
I'd train them.

596
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,310
What if I can't perform well tomorrow?

597
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,880
I'll be a laughing stock for the ladies.

598
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:02,280
Father!

599
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,070
Would you listen to that cat?

600
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:05,920
It's provoking me!

601
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,280
Father!

602
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,190
Father, listen to me.

603
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,350
We must always try a civil conversation.

604
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,680
Let me talk to the cat.

605
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:13,710
How does that sound?

606
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,830
Let me talk to it.

607
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,190
Stray cat behind this wall!

608
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:18,470
Stop.

609
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:19,760
Can you hear me?

610
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,760
My father carries a halberd with him!

611
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,520
He can split you in half!

612
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,350
Did you hear that?

613
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:28,070
Just go away!

614
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,280
Keep meowing.

615
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,000
Why are you talking to the cat?

616
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
It doesn't understand you.

617
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,590
I should get rid of it.

618
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:35,950
Father!

619
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,430
Listen.

620
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:38,710
It's quiet now.

621
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:41,800
There it goes again.

622
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,590
There it goes again!

623
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:43,310
Father.

624
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:43,950
How about this?

625
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,470
Let's save the weapon for better use.

626
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:47,830
Use my blade instead.

627
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:50,830
I'll slay it.

628
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:52,640
Don't worry.

629
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,190
Girl, watch the ladder.

630
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,190
Stop.

631
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,000
I'll get rid of the cat.

632
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,680
Higher.

633
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,640
Go away, my father is here.

634
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:15,640
Come closer.

635
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,950
Did you see the animal?

636
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:24,800
I saw it.

637
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:25,760
That cat

638
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,470
just hissed at me.

639
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,310
I must teach it a lesson!

640
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:29,680
Just go.

641
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,310
Leave now.

642
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:35,230
Let the cat hiss again.

643
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:39,920
All right, leave.

644
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:40,680
Go on.

645
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,230
Go away!

646
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,000
Get down.

647
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:49,950
Go away!

648
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,710
Young Master, you got what you wanted.

649
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,710
Now I got a sore throat.

650
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,190
Let's go.

651
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,430
Well?

652
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:01,920
It's gone, Father.

653
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:03,000
You can sleep soundly tonight.

654
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:04,430
Train well tomorrow.

655
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:05,310
All right.

656
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,040
San Lang.

657
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:22,880
Qi Lang.

658
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,190
What is it?

659
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:25,430
The warden had a sudden shift change.

660
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,800
You can see Official Wei tonight.

661
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:27,590
Very well.

662
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:28,470
Come with me.

663
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:50,020
(Prison)

664
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:06,950
Sorry for the treatment, Official Wei.

665
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,520
Chancellor Yan's son.

666
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:12,520
Official Wei,

667
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,800
don't you have anything to tell me?

668
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,710
I will help you clear your name.

669
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,600
I was blinded by my greed.

670
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:22,520
I failed His Majesty's kindness.

671
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:26,150
I failed the Grand Tutor's trust.

672
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:29,670
I got the punishment I deserve.

673
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:31,560
I have nothing to tell you.

674
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:32,870
The Grand Tutor?

675
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:35,390
Official Wei.

676
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:37,800
A death sentence awaits you.

677
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,390
Do you not fear death?

678
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,360
I have nothing to tell you.

679
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:49,630
Mr. Yan, stop wasting your time.

680
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,120
In that case,

681
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:17,390
I shall leave you be.

682
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,860
(A Place for the Talented)
(Imperial College)

683
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,320
Breaking news!

684
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,910
The case of Official Wei's conspiracy
with Xizhao has been closed.

685
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,360
Was he guilty of the crime?

686
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:06,040
He's been convicted as the main culprit.

687
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,120
He claimed to have been
tricked by the spy of Xizhao.

688
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:11,910
Seeing that he had served
the imperial court for years,

689
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:12,870
his life was spared.

690
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,360
But his entire family is exiled.

691
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,710
What about Grant Tutor Song?

692
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:17,520
Was he punished?

693
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,190
Sure.

694
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:21,150
He suffered a pay cut due to his negligence.

695
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,760
Grand Tutor Song got away easy.

696
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,320
The whole Bianjing knows his greed

697
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:25,950
and treachery.

698
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:27,600
It happened on his tea plantation.

699
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,360
How is he not part of the scheme?

700
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,040
I don't buy it.

701
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:33,710
The most unfortunate of all

702
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,670
is the Song family's farmers.

703
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,320
They lost their job.

704
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,870
The whole tea plantation has been sealed off.

705
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,190
I thought the Deputy Chief was a great detective.

706
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,080
Why can't he investigate it
for the Prefecture Court?

707
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:48,280
He is the son of Chancellor Yan after all.

708
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,600
It'd look bad if he was involved.

709
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,320
It might have caused family disputes.

710
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:54,760
Don't spread baseless rumors.

711
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,870
The Deputy Chief is honorable.

712
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:57,870
Sang Qi.

713
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:00,230
Of course we know the Deputy Chief is righteous.

714
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,600
But he might need to stay his hand out of this

715
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,230
because of Chancellor Yan's pressure.

716
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,000
Don't get so agitated.

717
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:08,320
Was I?

718
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,390
Very much so.

719
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:24,390
I just find this whole case fishy.

720
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,760
It's not fair to the farmers.

721
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,710
I'll have a word with the Deputy Chief.

722
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,390
He must have an explanation for this.

723
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:34,470
Well said.

724
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,470
Stand aside.

725
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:52,520
(Grand Hall)

726
00:37:58,630 --> 00:37:59,190
Deputy Chief.

727
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,710
Does Grand Tutor Song really have
no connection with Xizhao?

728
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,390
We'll discuss it another time.

729
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,800
Pretend we are fighting.

730
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,230
Why is that?

731
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:08,320
(There are eyes and ears everywhere.)

732
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,470
Why didn't you help with
the Prefecture Court's investigation

733
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,600
and prove the farmers' innocence?

734
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,230
Why?

735
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,430
The case is concluded.

736
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,670
There is no mystery involved.

737
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,190
I can't just frame anyone.

738
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:22,600
Forget it.

739
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,470
I don't have time for you.

740
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,620
(Grand Hall)

741
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,300
(Cenotaph of the beloved son, Sang Yu)

742
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,360
Qi.

743
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,080
Can you tell me now?

744
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,470
I talked to Official Wei in prison.

745
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,630
He cherishes

746
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:06,840
the life of the tiny ant

747
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,710
that falls

748
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,840
onto his shirt.

749
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,360
(Cenotaph of the beloved son, Sang Yu)

750
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,760
He must cherish the life of any living being.

751
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:13,870
Conspiring with Xizhao is a serious crime.

752
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,040
He'd surely be executed.

753
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,430
But he was so calm.

754
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,910
He didn't bother to defend himself.

755
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,190
His calmness was not normal.

756
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,520
Unless...

757
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:25,760
Unless he knew he would escape
the death sentence.

758
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,760
He must have made a deal

759
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,840
with the mastermind.

760
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,320
As long as he keeps his mouth sealed,

761
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,840
he will be spared.

762
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I see.

763
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:37,190
I doubt the mastermind would stop at this point.

764
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,150
Official Wei might not survive

765
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:40,470
his exile.

766
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,120
I plan to follow him secretly

767
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,560
and track down the mastermind.

768
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,190
You are going after him covertly?

769
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,360
My position at the Imperial College will only

770
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,040
hinder my plan.

771
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,120
If I leave Bianjing too suddenly,

772
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:51,560
people will start suspecting.

773
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,280
So I need an excuse

774
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,000
to leave the Imperial College.

775
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,630
I need you to play along with me.

776
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:00,630
I understand.

777
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,150
But why are we meeting here?

778
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,080
I want Yu to know

779
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:12,840
about our relationship.

780
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:18,070
(Cenotaph of the beloved son, Sang Yu)

781
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:19,840
Yu.

782
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:21,950
I swear on my life

783
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,560
I will never let Sang Qi down.

784
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,520
As long as I live,

785
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,190
I will keep her safe.

786
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:44,910
Qi.

787
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,430
Are you sure no one would recognize us here?

788
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:50,910
I asked Lian Pian.

789
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,600
She told me the young masters and ladies

790
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,080
don't come to this area.

791
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:54,870
So don't worry about it.

792
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,430
No one would recognize us.

793
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,950
So can we be at ease now?

794
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:01,600
Of course.

795
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,560
Relax.

796
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,430
Be yourself.

797
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,870
Two bowls of noodles. Enjoy the food.

798
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:21,320
Sir.

799
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:22,800
Wait.

800
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:24,520
We need some hot water

801
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,230
to sanitize the chopsticks.

802
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:27,120
What...

803
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,280
But we don't have a kettle.

804
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:30,870
If it's the chopsticks...

805
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:32,320
Wait here.

806
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:37,430
There is no need to be too fussy.

807
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,080
He's...

808
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:45,520
I...

809
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,150
I'm starting to think

810
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,600
the noodles aren't edible.

811
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,710
Mr. Yan, we are not in a fine restaurant.

812
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,280
Don't be too picky.

813
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:06,080
Try it out first.

814
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:17,430
Come on.

815
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:33,950
Dig in.

816
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:41,320
This is remarkable!

817
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:47,520
(Noodles)

818
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:54,190
I never knew such delicacy existed in Bianjing!

819
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:55,040
Was it delicious?

820
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:55,710
Yes.

821
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:58,230
Where are we going next?

822
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,040
We'll decide as we take a stroll.

823
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:06,870
Let's pay up.

824
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:08,630
Sir.

825
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:10,560
In a moment.

826
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:12,600
(Oh no.)

827
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:13,600
Oh no.

828
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:16,800
Don't tell me you don't have any money on you.

829
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,430
I don't.

830
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,280
I never needed to carry any money.

831
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,000
I only pay the bill

832
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,390
once every month for the handful of shops I go to.

833
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,870
As expected from the son of Chancellor Yan.

834
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:27,950
What about you?

835
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,320
I usually let Lian Pian handle it.

836
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:35,840
As expected from Grand Commandant's daughter.

837
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:40,190
What now?

838
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:41,000
Stay calm.

839
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:42,190
I have an idea.

840
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,080
A friend of mine

841
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,670
once ran into the same predicament.

842
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,840
He's coming.

843
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,470
Have you finished the noodles?

844
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:52,840
It was delicious, sir.

845
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,190
May I ask,

846
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:57,080
do you know who I am?

847
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:01,760
No.

848
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:02,910
Do you know this lady?

849
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:06,280
No.

850
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,840
He doesn't know us.

851
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,280
How can you not know who we are?

852
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:11,390
He doesn't know us!

853
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,190
He has no idea who we are.

854
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:14,190
Let's go.

855
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:16,910
Pay up!

856
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,000
Stop right there!

857
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:39,430
