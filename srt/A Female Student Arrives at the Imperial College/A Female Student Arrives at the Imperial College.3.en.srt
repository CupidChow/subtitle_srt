She's here. Sang Qi is here.

00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:52,950
Sang Qi is here.

33
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,550
Master Sang, thank you for saving my life.

34
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,910
It's just a small matter. Don't mention it.

35
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,040
Master Sang, after witnessing your skills today,

36
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,310
I was so in awe.

37
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,720
I've offended you many times previously.

38
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,360
Master Sang, if you require
my assistance in the future,

39
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,400
please don't hesitate to let me know.

40
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,120
I will serve you faithfully.

41
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,870
The things that happened previously
were just misunderstandings.

42
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,510
Everyone, please don't take it to heart.

43
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,670
From now on, let's write it off.

44
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,630
Master Sang, you are a broad-minded person indeed.

45
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,750
I feel ashamed of my inferiority.

46
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,600
Master Sang.

47
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,190
Please have a seat.

48
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:25,960
- Please.
- Please.

49
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,550
- Please.
- Please.

Yan Yan.

52
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,360
Were you planning to make an offering to me

53
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,670
when you prepared all of this?

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,800
You might as well prepare the joss paper too.

55
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,630
Who did this?

56
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,030
This...

57
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:47,270
- It was him.
- It wasn't me.

58
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,960
It wasn't me.

59
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,470
You're still not going to confess?

60
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,520
Is this better?

61
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,390
Yes, it looks like I'm making
an offering to you now.

62
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,880
Here you go, Master Sang.

63
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,470
Here.

64
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:12,800
Here you go. Hold it carefully.

65
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,440
Thank you.

66
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,000
This is the home of the victim's family.

67
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:17,880
It's also the scene of the murder case.

68
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,520
Previously, I brought several people
to investigate this area thoroughly

69
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,720
but we didn't find any clues.

70
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,470
That's why I rushed over to seek your help.

71
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,600
Bai Shi.

72
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,910
Let's spread out and look around.

73
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,470
Yes.

74
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,000
Young Master.

75
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,480
It seems that the entire courtyard
has been purposely cleaned up.

76
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,000
There were no clues left behind.

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,390
The family was still here several days ago.

78
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,640
Why did they hurriedly move away?

79
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,040
Move the table.

80
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,070
What is this?

81
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:59,790
Collect it and take it back to get examined.

82
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:21,570
(The scene bringing back memories)

83
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:28,650
(May all your wishes come true)

84
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,320
Back then, you suspected that

85
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,720
Sang Yu was killed by someone else.

86
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,550
I previously couldn't decide
if I should believe you or not.

87
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,230
But now, it looks like your suspicions were right.

88
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,950
The deceased's cause of death this time

89
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,230
is extremely similar to
Sang Yu's cause of death back then.

90
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,640
Moreover, the family suddenly
vanished into thin air.

91
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,440
It's really strange.

92
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,550
Perhaps

93
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,790
there's a connection between both of them.

94
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,200
As long as we can identify
the source of the poison,

95
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,720
we have hope of solving everything.

96
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:52,440
Qi Lang.

97
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,510
You're the best at solving cases
in the entire Bianjing.

98
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,830
If it wasn't for your help over the years,

99
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,040
there would be so many unsettled cases
in Prefecture Court

100
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,790
that were just left hanging.

101
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:00,720
Don't worry.

102
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,350
All of us at Prefecture Court
will spare no effort in supporting you.

103
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,110
We will get justice to Sang Yu.

104
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,230
I'll leave it to you.

105
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,480
Oh, right, Sang Qi is studying
at the Imperial College now.

106
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,230
Well,

107
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,510
she is your old friend's younger sister after all.

108
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,440
You must take extra good care of her.

109
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,200
Make sure that she doesn't get bullied.

110
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,200
Her?

111
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,200
Get bullied?

112
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,070
Guard the physical evidence.
I'll go after that person.

113
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:29,350
All right.

114
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,320

The Grand Commandant's Residence.

117
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,880
Who is it?

118
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,390
What do you think you're doing?

119
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,600
I...

120
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,390
Would you believe me if I say
that I came to pay a visit?

121
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:56,880
Pay a visit?

122
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,550
Why don't you visit my father
while he is taking a bath instead?

123
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,510
You came to watch me bathe.

124
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,480
Who in their right mind would believe you?

125
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,830
You're right, I don't think
that you would believe me either.

126
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:03,670
All right then.

127
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,480
I will take my leave.

128
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,350
There's an assassin!

129
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,670
Go after him! Hurry!

130
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,110
I'm sorry.

131
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,040
Are they here to capture you?

132
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,440
I'm talking to you.

133
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:13,920
I...

134
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,510
I was helping Prefecture Court
arrest a thief earlier.

135
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,070
I saw the thief enter
the Grand Commandant's Residence

136
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,070
and heard you scream,

137
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,830
so I thought you were in danger.

138
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,000
That's why I rushed inside.

139
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,160
Is that so?

140
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:31,640
If you don't believe me,

141
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,790
I'll go and properly explain everything to them.

142
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,440
What exactly are you going to say to them?

143
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,200
We're a man and a woman alone together.

144
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,320
If you go outside now, how will you explain this?

145
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,470
There's no valid excuse.

146
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:40,670
Never mind.

147
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,790
You saved me during horseback archery class,

148
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,150
so it's my turn to save you now.

149
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,910
How about we call it even?

150
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:50,590
Fine.

151
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,030
Search thoroughly. Don't let the thief escape.

152
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,320
Yes.

153
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,550
You can hide in the bathtub.

154
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,030
Come on, go inside.

155
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,230
Hold your breath.

156
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,320
Just hold your breath and get inside.

157
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,550
Go on, Deputy Chief. Get inside.

158
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,960
There's no need. I've found a way to escape.

159
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,470
I just finished my bath. It doesn't smell.

160
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:08,840
Young Lady.

161
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,520
Young Lady.

162
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,440
Young Lady, a thief entered the residence just now.

163
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:14,470
Are you all right?

164
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,280
I'm fine.

165
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,670
You should hurry up and go back to bed.

166
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:17,080

168
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:18,080
Go on then.

169
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:19,550
You can go back now.

171
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,110
Young Master.

172
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,200
Do you think that Miss Sang is in danger?

173
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,960
We should never let our guard down.

174
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,080
Has Prefecture Court managed to find out

175
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,590
what kind of poison that powder contains?

176
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,440
They have yet to find out.

177
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,670
But Official Yan has already sent people over

178
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,280
to seek numerous officials throughout
various places to compare their findings.

179
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,960
He will inform us immediately
once he receives any news.

180
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,520
Oh, right, Young Master.

181
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,320
Official Yan purposely left some behind

182
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,440
to request you to help him examine it.

183
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,790
Since it's time for our music class,

184
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,640
let's do a different activity today.

185
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,960
Instead of reciting a poem,
the loser will have to perform

186
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,280
by playing a musical instrument.

187
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,030
Play a musical instrument?

188
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,280
I don't know how to do that.

189
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,280
Neither do I.

190
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,030
Don't worry.

191
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,400
It's not like we're drawing lots
in musical temperament class.

192
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,670
You won't get chosen so easily.

193
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,550
Really?

194
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,640
I feel so relieved now.

195
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,000
It's completely...

196
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,440
Go, go, go.

197
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,350
Sang Qi, you're chosen!

198
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,080
Thank God it's not me.

199
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:18,440
Zhuo Wen Yuan, didn't you say that...

200
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,110
I've heard long ago

201
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,200
that all the young ladies in Bianjing
are skilled at musical temperament.

202
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,470
I'm sure that includes Sang Qi as well.

203
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,550
I have the good fortune
of hearing beautiful music today.

204
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,760
Sang Qi, please go ahead.

205
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,000
Why don't I take your place
and perform a song instead?

206
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:40,840
No need. I can do it myself.

207
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,150
You can do it!

208
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:53,000
Sang Qi is really unfortunate.

209
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,110
That's right.

210
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,550
I'm surprised that she knows how to play this.

211
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,000
I never expected it.

212
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:09,910
Me neither.

213
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:39,150
That was great!

214
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm sorry.

215
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,350
I'm not skilled at playing musical instruments.

216
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,550
However, those who play the game
must accept to lose.

217
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,880
Why don't I sing a song for everyone instead?

218
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,440
Is that all right?

219
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,710
- There's no need to sing.
- Don't do it.

220
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:55,350
No need, no need. There's really no need.

221
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,350
You really don't have to do it.

222
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:58,640
Sing.

223
00:12:59,150 --> 00:12:59,910
Please continue.

224
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,110
Go ahead and sing.

comes from a certain type of plant.

00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,950
so he must be in Class Sky.

330
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,230
(Class Sky name directory)

331
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:20,830
I've found it.

332
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,640
I knew that my brother was so amazing.

333
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,680
He would definitely be in Class Sky.

334
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,560
(Class Sky name directory)

335
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:28,760
(A missing name)
This...

336
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,190
(Class Sky)
Could it be Deputy Chief's name?

337
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,000
But Deputy Chief

338
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,280
and my elder brother were schoolmates.

339
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:41,310
No, they were actually classmates.

340
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,430
So why won't he admit it?

341
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,950
Enemies are bound to run into each other.

342
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:05,950
However,

343
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:08,160
he came at the right time.

344
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,000
Who is it?

345
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,430
Who dares to sneak into the archive?

346
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,590
It's me.

347
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,640
Students are not allowed to enter the archive

348
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:32,040
without a scholar's permission.

349
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,800
You've behaved badly
and broken the imperial rules.

350
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,640
How could the Imperial College
accept a student like you

351
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,760
who refuses to follow the rules?

352
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,000
You must know,

353
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,880
if I publicly revealed this to everyone,

354
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:43,280
the scholars would definitely expel you
from the Imperial College.

355
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,800
Who was the one who misbehaved

356
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:49,590
and snuck into a woman's bedroom
to watch their female disciple bathe?

357
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,190
How could the Imperial College
accept a Deputy Chief like that?

358
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,470
I want to publicly reveal this as well.

359
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,000
I dare you to say that again.
Who watched you bathe?

360
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,520
That time, I...

361
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,680
Back then, weren't you taking
your dignity into consideration

362
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,070
and said that you wanted
to hide this matter?

363
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,040
What's wrong? Are you not afraid
of embarrassing yourself now?

364
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,000
I couldn't even fulfill my brother's last wish.

365
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:08,710
Why would I be afraid of embarrassing myself?

366
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,760
Who cares about dignity?

367
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,590
Fine.

368
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,350
As your teacher, I will forgive you this time.

369
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,190
But this is an exception.

370
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,280
However, to make sure you remember this,

371
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,880
your punishment is to copy out
all the rules of the Imperial College.

372
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,190
I'd like to confirm one more matter.

373
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:35,920
Deputy Chief, you knew my elder brother.

374
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,470
Why are you too afraid to admit it?

375
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,590
(Class Sky name directory)
You must have torn the name it.

376
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:43,800
You've hidden everything well, but I
still managed to discover it eventually.

377
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:46,470
So what if I knew him?

378
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,310
We were merely acquaintances.

379
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,000
So why would I constantly bring him up?

380
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,680
A mere acquaintance would not know that song.

381
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,680
You and I are probably
the only two people in Bianjing

382
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,470
who know this song.

383
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,680
Deputy Chief, could it be

384
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,640
that you're trying to hide something?

385
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,680
I told you

386
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,040
that song has an extremely simple rhythm.

387
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,520
I was merely improvising when I played it.

388
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:12,280
Moreover,

389
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,950
what do I have to hide?

390
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,680
Deputy Chief, it doesn't matter
if you refuse to admit it right now,

391
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,760
but I will still get to the bottom of this.

392
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,560
When the time comes, you will have to admit

393
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,680
that you're White.

394
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,040
If you still refuse to disappear from my sight,

395
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,190
I'll punish you to copy it out twice.

396
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,110
Why would I...

397
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:27,760
Ten times.

398
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,280
This is...

399
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:29,640
Twenty times.

400
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:32,310
I...

401
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:32,880
Thirty times.

402
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,430
Forty.

403
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:37,920
Hold on.

404
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,920
Are you trying to take something with you?

405
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,710
Fifty times.

I'm not going. I still have to return
and copy out the rules.

Aren't you Young Lady Sang?

onto Young Master Zhuo in public?

428

You were racing your horse in public.
How dare you!

429

Aren't you worried about ruining
the Song family's name?

That reminds me.

The Lantern Festival is right around the corner.

432
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:25,110
Miss Sang, if you still can't give out your pouch,

433
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:28,350
you will end up humiliating the Sang family.

434
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,710
That's none of your business.

435
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:39,160
Haven't you decided how to give your pouch away?

436
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,590
What can I do?

437
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,880
Yan Yun Zhi is so stubborn.
He refuses to budge no matter what I do.

438
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:45,760
What should I do? I'm at my wits' end.

439
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,190
If Deputy Chief refuses to accept it,

440
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,230
you could just give it to me.

441
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:55,950
I'm lacking a pouch anyway.

442
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:57,190
If you like it so much,

443
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:59,190
I'll get Lian Pian to embroider
a dozen of them for you.

444

Lian Pian.

445
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,470
Tell me, how can I get Yan Yun Zhi

446
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:31,520
to accept my pouch?

447
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:34,070
I'm really out of ideas.

448
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,520
Young Lady, there's a saying that goes

449
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,800
"Even the loveliest embroidered pouch

450
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,560
is no match for the finest dish."

451
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,590
Although this saying is rather old,

452
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,640
we must still trust our ancestor's experience.

453
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:51,280
That's right, I haven't tried this method.

454
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,430
Perhaps it will work well.

455
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:56,470
In that case, I'll leave it to you.

456
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,400
Remember, you must capture Yan Yun Zhi's taste.

457
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,430
Do you know what I mean?

458
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,590
I got it, I got it.

459
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:02,950
Please wait for me.

460
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,400
I'll be back in half an hour.

461
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:10,430
Capture Yan Yun Zhi's taste.

462
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,000
Wonderful.

463
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:17,830
Let me go!

464
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:18,880

465
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,590
Release me, you gang of robbers!

466
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:21,350
Young Lady?

467
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:22,640
You robbers!

468
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:25,350
Release me!

469
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,430
I kidnapped the Yan residence's cook.

470
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:26,880
Let me go!

471
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,230
Yan Yun Zhi has loved his cooking
ever since he was little.

472
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,350
You gang of robbers!

473
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:32,470
Shut your mouth.

474
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,430
Stop talking.

475
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,190
I...

476
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,920
Is... Is this...

477
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,560
Is this how you planned
to capture Yan Yun Zhi's taste?

478
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,560
What else was I supposed to do?

479
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,920
Release him quickly.

480
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,040
It will be so embarrassing
if other people find out. Hurry up!

481
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,560
Take him away. Hurry up and take him away.

482
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,400
You really went overboard!

483
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,710
Go, go.

484
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:49,560
Get out.

485
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:49,880
Go.

486
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,190
Deputy Chief.

487
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:02,950
I've copied out the imperial rules.

488
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,000
What is it? Do you still want
to copy even more of it?

489
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:21,590
I've copied enough. I'm about
to vomit from copying so much.

490
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:27,230
I realized that my behavior in the archive earlier

491
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:29,190
was a bit excessive,

492
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,640
so I would like to make it up to you.

493
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,350
Deputy Chief, are you free during lunchtime today?

494
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:37,190
What are you planning to do now?

495
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,680
I want to cook a meal for you.

496
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,350
I always get a little anxious

497
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,520
whenever I talk about my brother

498
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,710
so it's not surprising
that I offended you, Deputy Chief.

499
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,560
Although I don't know why

500
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,070
you still deny it,

501
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,110
I realize that you must have taken good care

502
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:54,520
of my brother when he was in the Imperial College.

503
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,520
So I would like to cook you a simple meal

504
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,710
to thank you on behalf of my brother.

505
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,520
Is that all right?

506
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,950
You say that you want to cook a meal for me,

507
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,400
but you're actually trying to trick me, right?

508
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,680
Are you scared?

509
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,040
You must be joking.

510
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:15,470
Why would I be afraid of you?

511
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,070
All right, I'll see you later.

512
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:21,760
I'm busy.

513
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,280
I'll see you in the kitchen.
Come a little earlier.

514
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,760
Did I agree to that?

515
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:26,800
Don't be late.

516
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,830
She wants to win favor with Deputy Chief

517
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,310
to win the bet against my older sister.

518
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:40,070
It won't be that easy.

519
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,350
She wants me to take the bait.

520
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,160
That's impossible.

521
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:51,710
Deputy Chief.

522
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,680
You're just in time. Come on.

523
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,160
Are you trying to burn this whole place down?

524
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,830
This is a quick stir-fry cooking method.

525
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:00,640
Of course, there will be a few little flames.

526
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,520
However, there's no need to worry.

527
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,190
When you're cooking, just focus on that.
Why were you yelling?

528
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,520
Yelling helps to improve the atmosphere

529
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,640
and makes the cooked dishes taste different.

530
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,640
Why don't you try it?

531
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,640
Do you want the Imperial College
to burst into flames?

532
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:09,800
Extinguish the fire quickly.

533
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,680
And clean up this place.

534
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:11,710
Don't linger in the kitchen.

535
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,350
You should just try it.

536
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,590
You wasted your time cooking,

537
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,310
but it doesn't mean that I should
waste my time eating it.

538
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,560
This... This... What is this?

539
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:28,680
Those are chickens.

540
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:30,160
Nonsense! Of course, I know that.

541
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,760
But what are the chickens doing here?

542
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,560
Oh, please. If the chickens
weren't supposed to be here,

543
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,160
do you expect them to grow out from the ground?

544
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:36,760
Hurry up and go over there.

545
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,110
Don't let them come here.

546
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:38,830
Go there.

547
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:41,830
Go!

548
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:47,520
Go, go over there.

549
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:50,000
I got it.

550
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,950
Deputy Chief, you must have

551
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,710
a phobia of feathers.

552
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,000
The most intimidating person
in the Imperial College,

553
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,920
the great demon, Deputy Chief Yan

554
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:03,760
is actually afraid

555
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,070
of chickens.

556
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,560
It looks like it's time to teach you

557
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,760
what it means to honor and respect your teachers.

558
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,870
Come on, come on.

559
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,360
What are you doing?

560
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,800
As the Deputy Chief, you actually...

561
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,190
Shield me!

562
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:25,670
You're actually...

563
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,230
Be quiet.

564
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,320
You're afraid of chickens.

565
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:28,280
I can't believe it.

566
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,080
Stop talking. Shield me.

567
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,120
I've been shielding you for a long time.

568
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,800
I can't stand it. They're too close.

569
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:00,760
How did it go?

570
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,870
It's done. Let's go.

571
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,000
Deputy Chief.

572
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:14,670
I was wrong.

573
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,040
I shouldn't have made fun of you.

574
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,520
I promise not to

575
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,000
tell anyone else about what happened.

576
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,190
It doesn't matter.

577
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,630
Go ahead and reveal it if you dare.

578
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,760
After all, everyone who knows this secret of mine

579
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,840
has already passed away.

580
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,670
Also, once you're almost done copying,

581
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,670
take all those things of yours away.

582
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,800
I don't want to see them.

583
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,870
You should still try some.

584
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,040
Just one bite.

585
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,870
I told you, take them away.

586
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,390
Fine, but don't blame me for being ruthless.

587
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,280
You must be hungry.

588
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:04,840
It's delicious.

589
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:08,560
It's so good.

590
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,950
All right, you should eat it then.

591
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,360
Once you're full, you'll have enough strength
to endure more punishment.

592
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,230
Go on.

593
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:17,840
Eat up.

594
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:10,910
What is it?

595
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:13,910
Since you've finished eating, shouldn't you
hurry up and accept your punishment?

596
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,950
Deputy Chief, what's so interesting
about this book?

597
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:20,760
Are there any pictures of flowers?

598
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,360
What are you saying?

599
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:28,870
Where are you going?

600
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:30,670
Who said that you could leave?

601
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,150
Why did you close the door?

602
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,870
Why are you locking the door?

603
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,910
It's windy. I'm worried that you'll catch a cold.

604
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:43,080
I dislike the heat. Go and open the door.

605
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,470
I'll fan you.

606
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:47,870
Sang Qi, what are you doing?

607
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:48,710
Do you still feel hot?

608
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,360
Stop this nonsense.

609
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,520
Are you still refusing to stop?

610
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:58,230
Let me sit on your seat for a short while.

611
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:58,950
What are you trying to do?

612
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,430
I want to sit on your chair.

613
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:01,190
Sang Qi, you!

614
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:03,190
It's soft and there's no fur.

615
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,950
Shouldn't you place an animal's hide on your seat?

616
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,430
It's going to end up poking someone.

617
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:07,190
Don't leave me no choice.

618
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,910
I'm warning you one last time.

619
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:10,320
Get up quickly.

620
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:12,800
Get down.

621
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,120
Hurry up.

622
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:15,150
Did you hear me?

623
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,280
Get down from here.

624
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:17,630
Get down!

625
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:18,390
Hurry up!

626
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:19,000
Deputy Chief.

627
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:21,910
Are you inside?

628
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,230
What is all this noise coming from your room?

629
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,800
It's nothing.

630
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,560
Scholar Feng, do you need anything?

631
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:30,390
Deputy Chief, are you free right now?

632
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:33,560
Let me come inside
and discuss several matters with you.

633
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,120
No. I'm organizing some documents.

634
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,800
Why don't I go over and look for you later?

635
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,800
Get down from here.

636
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,470
Hurry up and get down!

637
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:51,120
Sang Qi.

638
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:52,470

Young Master.

How is it?

649
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,430
Just as you expected, Miss Sang was poisoned.

650
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,120
But when we tested the food with a silver needle,

651
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,280
there were no traces of poison in it.

652

No traces of poison?

655
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,080
Miss Sang...

656
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:01,430
Miss Sang has been unconscious
ever since she returned home.

657
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,470
Several famous doctors in Bianjing

00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:07,320
I've heard that Imperial Physician Wen
is skilled at removing poison.

660
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,120
Go and get him quickly.

661
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,230
I've searched for him,

662
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,150
but Imperial Physician Wen has just left the city.

663
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:12,120
Left the city?

664
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:12,870
Prepare the horses.

665
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:13,520
Yes.

666
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:18,150
(Yu, I couldn't save you back then.)

667
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,280
(But this time, I won't let anything
happen to Sang Qi.)

668
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:38,520
Mr. Sang.

669
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:41,230
Mr. Sang.

670
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:44,670
How is Qi?

671
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:47,040
The imperial physician
is doing all he can to treat her.

672
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:50,760
Grand Commandant.

673
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,190
How is it?

674
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,000
Miss Sang's pulse is uneven
and she has been severely poisoned.

675
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,040
There's nothing more that I can do.

676
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,430
How could this be?

677
00:40:58,710 --> 00:40:59,910
Is there no other way?

678
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,360
Imperial Physician Wen who is skilled
at removing poison should be able to help.

679
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:06,910
Unfortunately, he has taken his leave
and left for his hometown today.

680
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:08,230
I'll send someone to go after him now.

681
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,040
I'm afraid that he won't make it in time.

682
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:14,560
Master.

683
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,560
- Mr. Sang.
- Master.

684
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:20,230
Mr. Sang, this is a rare
medicine from my home.

685
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:21,320
It should be able
to dull the effects of the poison.

686
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:22,800
Use it on Sang Qi quickly!

687
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,230
Yes.

688
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:26,800
Hurry up and find Imperial Physician Wen.

689
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,360
Yes, Master.

690
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,040
Imperial Physician Wen is here!

691
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,520
Quickly!

692
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:38,600
Imperial Physician Wen is here. He's here.

693
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,520
Imperial Physician Wen, please save her.

694
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,190
Deputy Chief Yan, you are terribly impolite.

695
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:45,080
You actually kidnapped me
while I was on my journey.

696
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,150
I... I will personally visit you
and compensate you another day.

697
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:47,950
Imperial Physician Wen, please save her quickly.

698
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:49,670
Fine, I'll go and save her first.

699
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,560
Where is the patient?

700
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,710
She's right there. Inside the house.

701
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:52,800
Hurry, hurry.

702
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:59,040
Deputy Chief Yan.

703
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,360
How did you manage
to bring Imperial Physician Wen here?

704
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,560
I heard that Imperial Physician Wen
was skilled at removing poison,

705
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:06,150
so I sent people to look for him at his residence.

706
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:08,080
We heard that Imperial Physician Wen
was on the way back to his hometown,

707
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:08,840
so we pursued him all the way there.

708
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:10,120
Only then did we manage to find him.

709
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:12,950
What about you, Yan San Lang?

710
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,870
I rushed over when I heard

711
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:15,560
that your daughter was poisoned.

712
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,080
This incident must be thoroughly investigated
because it happened in the Imperial College.

713
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:21,230
Both of you, thank you.

714
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,560
Zhuo Wen Yuan, Zhuo Wen Yuan.

715
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,470
