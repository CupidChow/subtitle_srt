Speak. Don't hesitate.

00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,880
on time.

44
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,630

00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,190
in the warehouse,

49
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,080
and in the Imperial College

50
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,190
are all missing.

51

What...

52
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,080
Who did this?

53
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,470
Who can be this capable

54
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,800
and capture all my spies like this?

55
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,520
Young Master.

56
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,670
My spies in the Imperial College

57
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,600
said

58
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,000
they saw Yan San Lang.

59
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,030
What? He's awake?

60
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,800
Oh, no. It's a trap.

61
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,800
Yan San Lang didn't just regain consciousness.

62
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,910
He must have woken up much earlier.

63
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,800
He has even cleared Yan Yun Zhi's name.

64
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:35,110
Yan Yun Zhi's surrender

65
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,720
was just an act!

66
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,470
I thought

67
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,720
the death of Sang Qi would destroy his morale.

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,910
It seems like he won't go down without a fight.

69
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,270
Young Master,

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,880
we're not sure what His Majesty thinks of this.

71
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,830
I think it's better to lay low.

72
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,030
I can gather everyone

73
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,080
and...

74
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,830
It's not time to admit defeat!

75
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:08,670
Tell everyone

76
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,390
to burn all invoices here.

77
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,630
Arm ourselves before heading out.

78
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,160
If it's just a false alarm,

79
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,630
we can then tell everyone

80
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,000
that we're on a hunting trip.

81
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,200
If Yan Yun Zhi is planning to catch me red-handed,

82
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,230
then I'll also fight back.

83
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,920
I can take his life easily

84
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,670
under the name of treason.

85
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:35,390
And this time, I'll make sure he's dead.

86
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,390
Yes.

87
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,760
Then about your wife and your in-laws...

88
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,070
I was ready to sacrifice Xizhao,

89
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,640
let alone Grand Tutor Song.

90
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,270
Someone

91
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,640
has to be the scapegoat after all.

92
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,790
Noted.

93
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,110
I'll get it done now.

(Grand Tutor's Residence)

95
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,070
As per the order of Yan Hua
from the Prefecture Court,

96
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,390
we're here to arrest Grand Tutor Song

97
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:55,000
to assist us in our investigation.

98
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,350
The Governor of the Prefecture Court?

99
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,880
Why should my father entertain him?

100
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,200
Due to the serious nature of the matter,

101
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,040
we await Grand Tutor Song's cooperation.

102
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,670
Can my father

103
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,720
come back alive then?

104
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:12,720
Is he going to be

105
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,320
the scapegoat for everything?

106
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,950
I will not

107
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:20,110
allow you to arrest anyone
from the Song family as you wish.

108
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,640
Then you are forcing my hands.

109
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,270
We were classmates in the Imperial College.

110
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,070
We fought many times,

111
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,070
so there's no use to play nice now.

112
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,670
We were just bickering

113
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:37,790
and we never drew weapons.

114
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,040
Yan Yan.

115
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,670
I knew we would face off each other eventually,

116
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,720
but I didn't know it would be like this.

117
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,640
I see no point in discussing further.

118
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,510
This is our destiny.

119
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,550
Is this your final decision then?

120
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,600
You would be in my way?

121
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:56,880
All right.

122
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,880
I have always wanted

123
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,270
to fight you for real anyway.

124
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,200
This is between us.

125
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,000
Do not intervene.

126
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,790
Yes!

127
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,270
You guys too.

128
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,600
No one moves an inch.

129
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,600
Today

130
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,880
is the day Yan Xiao Lang and I settle our score.

131
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,320
Yes!

132
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,310
(Grand Tutor's Residence)

133
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,390
Song Luo Tian!

134
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,110
Song Luo Tian.

135
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:34,440
Am I dying?

136
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,320
I feel cold.

137
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,520
I'm going to die, aren't I?

138
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,350
Just stop talking.

139
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,760
No, if I don't say it now,

140
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,280
I will miss my chance forever.

141
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,760
Yan Yan, we might have crossed each other a lot

142
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,670
in the Imperial College,

143
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,320
but those times

144
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,000
are fun and unforgettable.

145
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,200
I didn't want things

146
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,400
to turn out this way.

147
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,960
I merely wanted to protect my parents.

148
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,400
If I die today,

149
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:16,400
then I guess I'll die the proper way.

150
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,080
I'll be free.

151
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,150
Wait, I'm about to draw my last breath.

152
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,670
Why are you so cold-hearted?

153
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,470
It didn't even land on the lethal area.

154
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,150
The heart is at this side.

155
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,400
It was just a graze.

156
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,470
You won't die from it.

157
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,470
You're overly pampered

158
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:39,710
and rarely got injured,

159
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,320
so you thought this was a fatal wound.

160
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,000
I won't die?

161
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,350
Then what I said...

162
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,080
What I said...

163
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,440
It's okay. I heard nothing.

164
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,320
I will

165
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,880
protect your family.

166
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,910
If they did something wrong,

167
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,200
they should bear the consequences.

168
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,910
But if it's not related to them,

169
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,000
then I won't let them die without reasons

170
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,280
like Qian Jiu did.

171
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:06,910
Take him away.

172
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:07,880
Yes.

173
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,790
Let's go.

174
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,880
You're late.

175
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,670
Yan Yun Zhi, you're one tenacious bug.

176
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,710
Seems like Yan Sang Lang
regained consciousness.

177
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,710
You surrendered yourself
and begged for a swift death

178
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,400
so that I'd let my guard down.

179
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,880
You finally got it.

180
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,880
But it's too late.

181
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,880
You haven't defeated me yet.

182
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,840
Why are you fleeing the city

183
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,230
in a rush then?

184
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,350
I'm on a hunting trip.

185
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,710
What a coincidence.

186
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:23,910
Me too.

187
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,880
And I just found my prey.

188
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,520
Yan Yun Zhi.

189
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,790
You really think you can

190
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,110
stop me?

191
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,000
Don't underestimate me.

192
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,960
It's quite obvious

193
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,760
who's outnumbered here.

194
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:01,590
Why? You want to create a scene on your way

195
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:02,910
back to Bianjing?

196
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,200
I can always kill you

197
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:09,150
and then deal with your cronies

198
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,280
later.

199
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,590
I'll still be hailed as the patriotic
Official Zhuo.

200
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,880
Yan Yun Zhi.

201
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,200
You only have your meddlesome self to blame
in the first place.

202
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,230
If you didn't insist on investigating
the death of Sang Yu,

203
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,790
you wouldn't find out everything.

204
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,470
The salt route will operate as usual

205
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,080
and my wealth will be accumulated slowly.

206
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,520
I could have been your brightest student

207
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,960
who would ace his exams
and lead a successful life.

208
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,400
And during Chinese New Year,

209
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,000
I might pay you a visit.

210
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,520
Isn't this wonderful?

211
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,470
But you just had to be nosy.

212
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,670
You just had to dig out the truth

213
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,320
and force me to do this.

214
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:46,790
You colluded with unscrupulous parties
to profiteer

215
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,350
from salt smuggling and tobacco trades.

216
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,110
Oh my, you sure gave fancy names

217
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,320
to what's essentially crimes.

218
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,080
It doesn't matter if you know now.

219
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,880
Yan Yun Zhi,

220
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,000
you shall die

221
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,080
with this secret.

222
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,550
So you asked for backup from the Sang family.

223
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,550
My father doesn't need to be here.

224
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:53,080
I'm more than enough.

225
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,710
Sang Qi, you're still alive.

226
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:03,840
(We already knew about the poisonous pouch.)

227
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,080
(We were just playing along.)

228
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,640
Take the medicine and you'll be fine.

229
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,200
Thanks, Physician.

230
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,280
Feeling better?

231
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:13,760
Miss.

232
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,710
Your lips are pale

233
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,440
and sweat gathers on your nostrils.

234
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:21,350
Those are the symptoms of deteriorating health.

235
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,670
Are you unwell?

236
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,910
Not necessarily.

237
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,590
But I've been feeling fatigued easily.

238
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,470
Come on, let me read your pulse.

239
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,550
What's the matter, Physician?

240
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:47,280
You've been poisoned.

241
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,000
Poisoned?

242
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,320
Miss, think hard.

243
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,280
Is there anything unusual

244
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,910
about your diet lately?

245
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,520
Nothing.

246
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:11,030
What about the things you keep
at close quarters all the time?

247
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,110
Unless...

248
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,080
This pouch was away from me once.

249
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,150
Miss, this is the poison powder from Xizhao.

250
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,590
In high concentrations too.

251
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,710
If you carry it every day,

252
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,280
you will feel nauseous
and lose the ability to taste.

253
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,790
Worst comes to worst, you'll be bedridden and die.

254
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,670
Noted, Physician. I'll take care of it.

255
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:07,760
Can you keep this a secret?

256
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,790
Sure.

257
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,550
Lian Pian. See the physician off.

258
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,150
Yes.

259
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,910
I'll take my leave.

260
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,520
There's only one possible explanation.

261
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,790
Zhuo Wen Yuan tinkered with my pouch.

262
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:26,150
But Qian Jiu is already dead.

263
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,880
Why go through such a hassle?

264
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,150
In a way, it still makes sense.

265
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:32,710
He definitely

266
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:35,350
has something to do with Qian Jiu.

267
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,640
But you found this pouch at the outskirt.

268
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,710
He can still wiggle his way out.

269
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,550
Then we'll play along.

270
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,440
Once he thinks he got everything figured out

271
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,550
and becomes complacent,

272
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,230
he'll make a mistake.

273
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,350
That will be

274
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,280
the opening for our retaliation.

275
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,280
Finally decided to show yourself?

276
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,320
Let me in.

277
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:04,960
(Funeral)

278
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,520
Let me see her for the last time.

279
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,470
I will follow you afterward.

280
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,830
(Thanks to the Pseudocide Pill from Miss Su,)

281
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,040
(I could fool Zhuo Wen Yuan)

282
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,400
(with my fake death.)

283
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:42,640
So itchy.

284
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,190
Young Lady.

285
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:43,880
Lian Pian.

286
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,520
Is your face very itchy?

287
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,830
Perhaps the side-effect of the Pseudocide Pill?

288
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:48,280
Let me see.

289
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,070
I'm fine. Let's go.

290
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,000
My death

291
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,830
would explain why Deputy Chief
surrendered himself.

292
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,430
And I provoked you in the cell

293
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:02,920
because I knew

294
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,190
you wouldn't kill me straight away.

295
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,560
You will keep me alive

296
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,000
until the day your plan comes to fruition.

297
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:11,920
And then,

298
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,280
we followed your new salt route

299
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,280
to find the rest of your people.

300
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,470
We also found where you stashed your fortune.

301
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,280
Sang Qi.

302
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,230
You lied to me again.

303
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,110
Why the poker face?

304
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,950
Did my intention to kill you

305
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,640
squash all hopes you had for me?

306
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,040
Zhuo Wen Yuan,

307
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,640
you kept mentioning our childhood.

308
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:47,950
But the current you

309
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,680
is so different from the one I grew up with

310
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,430
in the frontier fortress.

311
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,230
The current you

312
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,800
are just a stranger to me.

313
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,470
In that case,

314
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,520
let's submit ourselves to our destiny.

315
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:14,560
Qi, the final chapter of our story

316
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,520
is long overdue.

317
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,880
For the love and resentment all these years,

318
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,310
let's end it.

319
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,110
Qi, don't listen to him.

320
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:35,160
If you wish.

321
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:36,830
Don't worry.

322
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,430
Everything ends here.

323
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,190
Just come back with me.

324
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,280
Qi, I'm too far gone.

325
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,640
I'll return you

326
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,400
the life I owed you.

327
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,400
Young Master!

328
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,800
(Qi, I'm too far gone.)

329
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,230
(I'll return you)

330
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:34,830

The case is crystal clear.

The culprit, Zhuo Wen Yuan, is now dead

In honor of our marital bond,

359

she will be spared.

360
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,520
However, as a noble consort,
she manipulated imperial ministers

361
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,880
and framed the loyal ones.

362

Thank you for your generosity, Your Majesty.

368
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:38,710
I volunteer to follow my father

369

and reflect upon ourselves
to turn over a new leaf.

I'm happy to hear that from you.

Both of you worked really hard for this.

feel free to tell me what you like as rewards.

379
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:16,590
Your Majesty, if you put it this way,

380
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,520
I'll be hard-pressed to say anything...

381
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,560
Such moral integrity. So be it then.

382

Wait, I mean

383
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,880
I'll be hard-pressed to refuse your kindness.

384

I actually have a small request.

385

Speak.

386
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:36,000
I wish to be the Manager of the Archive
in the Imperial College.

387

That's easy.

388
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,310
I also have another important request.

389
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,350
Deputy Chief and I

390
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:46,400
would like to recruit more students.

391
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,710
We want to establish Class Hualin
in the Imperial College

392
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:51,310
so that talented women who are
thirsty for knowledge

393
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,590
have a place to do so.

394
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,710
That way, everyone can use their talent
for the greater good of the nation.

395
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,400
Please consider this, Your Majesty.

396
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,230
I'll take note of it.

397
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,230
It's indeed a serious matter,

398
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,280
so I need to think it through.

399
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,710
Your Majesty, you allowed me to study

400
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,880
in the Imperial College.

401
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:13,040
That shows that you're someone
who appreciates talents.

402
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,040
I want everyone

403
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:17,280
to experience your tolerance and generosity.

404
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,470
All right. I understand.

405
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:29,310
What about you, Yan?

406
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,520
Just tell me.

407
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:38,880
I only have one request, Your Majesty.

408
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:41,470
Please retract your decree

409
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:44,070
and annul the marriage arrangement
between Su Jie Yu and me.

410

When you were being framed,

411
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,950
I already annulled the marriage arrangement.

412
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,310
Today,

413
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:02,190
I have another arrangement for you two.

414
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,760
You two finally got together
despite all the hardship.

415
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,070
That is a feat in itself.

416
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,880
I hope you two can get married soon

417
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:12,160
and be the role model of all Bianjing couples.

418

Your best friend, White,

423
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,310
did not forget about your will

424
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:44,190
and he takes good care of me.

425
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,680
So good that I have to live with him now.

426
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:50,280
Why do you make it sound like it's something bad?

427
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:53,190
I'm the victim, Yu.

428
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:55,350
I'm practically chained to the Sang family
from the get-go.

429
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,310
Yes, you're so right.

430
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:58,470
We really can't live without you now.

431
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,710
So be a dear and be the Sang family's son-in-law.

I finally understood why you worked so hard.

435
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,920
Don't worry.

436
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:15,310
We will make sure the Imperial College

even though you're dumb, boisterous,

00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:34,680
straightforward, and stubborn,

443
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:38,590
you're still a good friend to have.

and self-centered,

448
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,920
I must admit

449
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,950
that my time in the Imperial College

450
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,310
and even in the Prefecture Court

451
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,680
was good because of you.

452

Thanks to your help,

454
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,160
His Majesty was lenient on me
and merely demoted me

to a commoner,

456

the most.

But now that he's dead,

471
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:52,280
only Miss Song was willing to cremate his body

472

I came bearing gifts from His Majesty
for your wedding.

580
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:22,600
Sang Qi, come forth to accept the decree.

581
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:23,870

00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:29,520
who inherited knowledge
from many philosophers,

585
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,600
who sought words from the Six Classics,

586
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,390
penned this decree

587
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:39,000
so that the status of Scholar is granted upon you.

588
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,430
Thanks, Your Majesty.

589
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,910
His Majesty

590
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,150
gave me a promotion?

591
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:01,630
Am I the first female scholar
in the Imperial College?

592
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,150
Correct.

593
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,520
His Majesty has also given his verbal agreement

594
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:12,630
to the idea proposed by Deputy Chief Yan
and Scholar Sang.

595
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:17,710
The Imperial College can now have a Class Hualin

596
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:19,470
to accommodate the female students.

597
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:23,280
From now on, the recruitment process
shall not discriminate

598
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,870
people of any age, any sex,

599
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:27,600
and any social status.

602
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,190

604

A female student like you

605
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:42,320
managed to earn the trust of His Majesty.

606
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,000
That's why more people are allowed to study
in the Imperial College now.
