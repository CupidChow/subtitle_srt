What are you doing?

32
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:52,950
Deputy Chief!

33
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,190
Deputy Chief, are you all right?

34
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:56,310
I'm fine.

35
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:56,830
I'll take care of him.

36
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:57,160
You just go.

37
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,630
I'm not leaving.

38
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,550
I'll stay with you.

39
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,190
Take that!

40
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:01,480
Come on!

41
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,310
Get on my back!

42
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,440
(As long as you guys are happy.)

43
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,390
Are you all right?

44
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,440
I think we got away.

45
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,630
I suppose.

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,240
- Why don't you go first...
- Why don't you go first...

47
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,630
- All right.
- All right.

48
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,520
What did you mean by that?

49
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,110
I mean...

50
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,750
You go out first.

51
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,240
I... I had no choice but to do what I did just now.

52
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,110
I didn't mean to slight you at all.

53
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,110
Please don't misunderstand.

54
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:48,360
It's fine.

55
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,550
It's not the first time you've done this.

56
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,000
Not the first...

57
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,000
Last time when I was poisoned in the study room...

58
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,270
It wasn't a dream, it was...

59
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,190
Then your mouth...

60
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:03,670
I...

61
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,440
It's fine.

62
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,270
You were poisoned.

63
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,830
It's understandable.

64
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,520
Of course, it's fine.

65
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,080
I won't take

66
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,440
such things to heart.

67
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,800
You wouldn't either, right?

68
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:21,470
Come on.

69
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,800
Let's... let's go find Master.

70
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,480
I've already taken it to heart.

71
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,790
I'm just not sure

72
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,160
if it's all right for me to do that.

73
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:48,720
Yan Yan!

74
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,350
Lian Pian!

75
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:52,950
Yan Yan!

76
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,320
What are you doing?

77
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,160
Yan Yan!

78
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:55,920
I'm fine.

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,040
I've practiced the Body-hardening Technique.

80
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,110
I can take the hits.

81
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,320
I won't let you get hurt.

82
00:04:59,320 --> 00:04:59,640
Yan Yan!

83
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,510
Yan Yan, hurry up and leave!

84
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,720
Yan Yan, hurry up and get away from here!

85
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,670
Go, Yan Yan!

86
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,720
Leave, Yan Yan!

87
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:08,920
Leave!

88
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,550
Lian Pian!

89
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,350
Sang Qi, be careful!

90
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:10,830
Lian Pian!

91
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,200
Young Lady!

92
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,440
Master!

93
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,110
I'm exhausted.

94
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,640
Get up.

95
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:18,110
Get up.

96
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,950
I heard your harvest break was about to end soon,

97
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,350
so I wanted to test your skills.

98
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,440
To see if you guys are good enough
to leave the mountain.

99
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,830
I can't have people say that I'm a bad teacher.

100
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,110
That would ruin my reputation.

101
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,200
Master,

102
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,920
it's fine if you want to test us,

103
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,040
but this is way too harsh.

104
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,390
You little brat. You aren't gifted.

105
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,510
You're just good at taking hits.

106
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,790
Of course, I have to be firmer with you.

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,200
I've already held back my hits.

108
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,830
Once you leave Lingwu Mountain,

109
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,830
if you run into trouble,

110
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,040
your enemies won't go

111
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,640
as easy on you as I did.

112
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,320
Deputy Chief.

113
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,160
You knew the man in black

114
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,720
was Master all along, didn't you?

115
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,640
I didn't conspire with him.

116
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,670
He did not,

117
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,160
but he knew it was me
the moment we fought each other.

118
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,920
He took a hit on purpose

119
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,950
and pretended to be injured
so that you would carry him away.

120
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,440
Like this.

121
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,320
I'm embarrassed on his behalf.

122
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,440
Who pretended to be injured?

123
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,670
I just didn't want to ruin your test.

124
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,200
So I gave up on purpose.

125
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,670
How would I know that Qi

126
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,390
would just carry me away?

127
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,950
So you're saying it was my fault?

128
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:19,550
Fine.

129
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,110
Next time we run into danger,

130
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,160
I'll just leave you behind.

131
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,160
Saves me the trouble to carry

132
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,510
a tall and heavy lump around.

133
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,110
Then you have to help me from now on too.

134
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,760
It's a promise.

135
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,670
Fine. Promise.

136
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,110
All right. That's enough.

137
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,510
You are my disciples, after all.

138
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,510
Let me give you a few words of blessing.

139
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,880
I hope you guys

140
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,040
will never have to use
the martial arts I taught you

141
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,160
and that you will live

142
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,760
a peaceful and carefree life.

143
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,790
This is great!

144
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,270
From tomorrow on,

145
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:45,070
I'll have peace and quiet again!

146
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:45,760
Thank you, Master!

147
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:46,950
Thank you, Master!

148
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,760
Yan Yan, are you all right?

149
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,670
I'm fine.

150
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,200
I've got the Body-hardening Technique.

151
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,320
Lian Pian, when we get back to Bianjing,

152
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,880
I'll treat you to some good food.

153
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,670
Sure.

154
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,440
You have to keep your promise.

155
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:18,830
Of course.

156
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,230
I had fun during this break.

157
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,040
Yeah.

158
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,270
Me too.

159
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,160
I had a lot of fun too!

160
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,110
No one asked you.

161
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,480
Either way, I learned a lot during this trip.

162
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,350
Deputy Chief.

163
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:43,230
Sang Qi.

164
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:44,670
I'll see you when classes begin.

165
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,390
I'm sure that after this harvest break,

166
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,640
a lot of things will have changed.

167
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,550
Things have changed.

168
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:01,480
Oh, right, Deputy Chief.

169
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,000
After classes start,

170
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,200
next semester, I...

171
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,200
Don't even think about it.

172
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,550
You won't get any special treatment.

173
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,440
Dream on.

174
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,640
We haven't even returned yet.

175
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,440
You already...

176
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,670
Deputy Chief!

177
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,390
Deputy Chief, just let me have this, please?

178
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:18,950
Deputy Chief!

179
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:22,830
(Grand Commandant's Residence)

180
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,320
Father!

181
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,760
(Grand Commandant's Residence)
Your precious daughter has returned!

182
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,000
So you still remember your father.

183
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,200
How could I forget?

184
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:42,470
Young Lady,

185
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,550
Master had already ordered the chef

186
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,080
to prepare all your favorite dishes
this morning.

187
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:49,400
I've been craving to have this reunion meal.

188
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,550
I'm so glad you prepared it, Father.

189
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,520
Come on, let's eat.

190
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,910
We can't let the food get cold.

191
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:53,960
Come on.

192
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,400
(Grand Commandant's Residence)

193
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,270
(Muyan Pavilion)

194
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:11,910
Why do I feel as if

195
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,670
you've lost weight?

196
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,590
I have?

197
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:17,910
Parents

198
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,880
always worry about their children.

199
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,440
I haven't lost weight.

200
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,470
I've gained muscle.

201
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,030
I've been training every day up there.

202
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,000
I haven't slacked off at all.

203
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,520
Is that so?

204
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:54,550
See?

205
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:57,080
I can even snatch a meatball from you now.

206
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,840
You do have improved.

207
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:01,080
But you didn't tell me that there would be

208
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,230
someone else there with you.

209
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,080
Father.

210
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,440
I didn't know Deputy Chief Yan would be there

211
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,440
before I went to Lingwu Mountain either.

212
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,470
I didn't try to hide it from you.

213
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,200
Deputy Chief Yan was there too?

214
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,230
Oh, you were talking about Yan Yan?

215
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,350
Yan Xiao Lang was there too?

216
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,590
I told you, didn't I?

217
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,400
Even if you don't mind,

218
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,400
if rumors got out about you spending
a month on a mountain

219
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,230
with a bunch of young men,

220
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,880
what do you think will happen to your reputation?

221
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,440
Don't worry, Father.

222
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,470
All of them are still unmarried.

223
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,150
They care much more about their
reputation than I do.

224
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,320
I won't tell anyone else.

225
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,200
Nonsense.

226
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,230
You're grounded.

227
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,150
You are not to leave the residence

228
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,280
without my permission

229
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,080
until classes begin again.

230
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:53,030
All right.

231
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,590
Don't pretend with me now.

232
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,110
If I find out that you snuck out,

233
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:00,790
I'd punish her.

234
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,080
She won't be able to have any meat.

235
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,760
Master, I'm innocent!

236
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,440
Young Lady,

237
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,230
I'm begging you.

238
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,840
Please be good

239
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,520
and stay home.

240
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:13,030
Have some meat.

241
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,230
If you don't want to be punished,

242
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,710
keep a close eye on her.

243
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,280
Yes, Master.

244
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,920
(Muyan Pavilion)

245
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,880
Father, have some beansprouts.

246
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,200
Here.

247
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,440
Ever since you came back,

248
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,400
you've been

249
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,320
in high spirits.

250
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,550
I guess it went well.

251
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,960
Then, let me help you.

252
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,020
(Invitation)

253
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:50,880
An invitation?

254
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,820
(Invitation)

255
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,750
(To Yan Yun Zhi, you are cordially invited
to my birthday banquet)

256
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,500
(held on 7 September at 9 AM
at Qingfeng Restaurant. From, Lan.)

257
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,320
Lan's birthday?

258
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,440
This isn't helping me at all.

259
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,230
I'll prepare a gift.

260
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
But I won't attend the banquet.

261
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,590
If I go, it might cause misunderstandings.

262
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:13,960
So be it.

263
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,400
I heard Sang Qi had been grounded
since she returned.

264
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,590
So I figured both of you
probably haven't met in a while.

265
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:22,470
She'll attend the banquet too.

266
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,760
That's why I gave you the invite.

267
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:24,790
But you don't appreciate it.

268
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,350
Never mind then.

269
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,350
The break isn't over yet.

270
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:29,880
I'll go.

271
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:31,470
I'll go.

272
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,400
Look at you.

273
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,880
You changed your mind so fast.

274
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:37,910
Yan Qi,

275
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,230
I never knew you had this side to you.

276
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,790
I'm still figuring myself out too.

277
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,030
But I never expected

278
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,550
that you would help Sang Qi and me.

279
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,230
You are Lan's brother, after all.

280
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,000
So what?

281
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,080
You aren't interested in my sister.

282
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,550
Forcing you guys together

283
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:56,550
would only cause trouble.

284
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,590
It's better for her to realize this sooner

285
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,110
and set herself free.

286
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,760
I hope so too.

287
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,960
I've already made things clear with her

288
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:07,030
that we are only childhood friends.

289
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,000
We are like brother and sister.

290
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,640
Nothing else.

291
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,110
The matter of marriage

292
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,880
is just a joke between our parents.

293
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,790
It doesn't count at all.

294
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,400
But Lan doesn't seem to take it to heart at all.

295
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,960
She still regards herself

296
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,550
as my future wife.

297
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,000
I want to clarify things in public.

298
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,910
But I'm afraid of embarrassing her.

299
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:25,760
Don't worry.

300
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,520
Clearing things up in public

301
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:30,520
will quell all of her hopes.

302
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,880
You guys

303
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,670
have a good relationship indeed.

304
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,230
It is precisely because we are close

305
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,910
that I understand her better than anyone.

306
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,590
She may appear

307
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,440
gentle and demure,

308
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,280
but she is stubborn

309
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:50,440
to the core.

310
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,520
If you don't reject her firmly,

311
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:53,880
give her hope,

312
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:56,280
and have her cling onto you,

313
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,150
that would really be ruining her.

314
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,400
That's why

315
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,000
you must be firm

316
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,150
and reject her sooner.

317
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,440
A harsh rejection

318
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,550
will truly help set her free.

319
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,960
I didn't expect that view from you.

320
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,280
Here.

321
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,200
(Grand Commandant's Residence)
(I'm happy to see you getting along)

322
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,350
(with the Su family's young lady.)

323
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,440
(Put more effort into choosing a gift for her.)

324
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,000
(Don't be negligent.)

325
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,280
(It was a kind gesture for them to invite you.)

326
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,280
Yes, Father!

327
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,280
Slow down, Young Lady!

328
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,230
Lian Pian!

329
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,320
Smell it!

330
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,110
What is this smell?

331
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,960
The fried stinky tofu stall!

332
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:44,470
This is freedom!

333
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,910
The smell of freedom!

334
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,440
Young Lady, you're too dramatic.

335
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,110
It has only been three days.

336
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,910
During which, you were either training

337
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,150
or talking to Young Master's portrait
in the study room.

338
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,550
You even went to the kitchen
and did the chef's work.

339
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,590
How were you not free

340
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,030
in this huge Grand Commandant's Residence?

341
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:03,960
Lian Pian.

342
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,520
Have a heart.

343
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,320
I

344
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,080
only stayed because of you.

345
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,200
Did you really think my father
would be able to make me stay put?

346
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,470
Thankfully, Miss Su invited us

347
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:14,150
to her birthday banquet.

348
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,590
Today, we will

349
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,080
roam the markets!

350
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,280
We will go to Qingfeng Restaurant

351
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,550
and feast!

352
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,670
We have to make up for the past three days!

353
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,400
Let's go!

354
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:28,030
Hurry!

355
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:33,750
(Peach Blossoms)

356
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,600
(Xiang Blacksmith)

357
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,110
Young Lady, it's about time, isn't it?

358
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:40,400
Young Lady,

359
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,110
you've been shopping for almost four hours.

360
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,960
We should go back soon.

361
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,880
I'm looking for a gift for Miss Su.

362
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,470
I can't just simply choose something.

363
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,350
Who would spend an afternoon in the markets

364
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,710
to buy a gift for Miss Su?

365
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,000
Besides,

366
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,550
I doubt Miss Su would like any of these.

367
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,080
I think you're just

368
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,520
having fun yourself, Young Lady.

369
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,550
Master Sang!

370
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,550
Master Sang!

371
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,440
Master Sang!

372
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,110
What?

373
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,280
Are you being chased by a ghost?

374
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,280
Even scarier than that.

375
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,030
My mother.

376
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:15,440
She...

377
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,470
She...

378
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:20,230
Go on.

379
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,400
Why aren't you continuing?

380
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,640
I'll leave my family matters aside for now.

381
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,350
What about you guys?

382
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,670
I heard Grand Commandant Sang

383
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:28,880
grounded you.

384
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,200
You knew?

385
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,280
I thought you didn't.

386
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,550
You knew, and you didn't come to help me?

387
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,230
Help you?

388
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,110
You're lucky I didn't try to get even with you.

389
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:39,880
Your father

390
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,200
sent his men to my residence.

391
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:45,080
He specifically told me not to bring you
around with me and cause trouble.

392
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,640
What gives? I'm innocent.

393
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,710
You were the one who dragged me
up the mountain with you.

394
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,550
But I'm the one being blamed.

395
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,880
So you mean you managed

396
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,320
to learn martial arts

397
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,440
up there because of me,

398
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:56,880
but it's my fault?

399
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:57,670
Fine.

400
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:58,910
Don't come with me anymore.

401
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:00,960
Don't.

402
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,760
We are martial siblings now.

403
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,710
Let's not bother about these things.

404
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:10,880
Why did Grand Commandant Sang
agree to let you guys out today?

405
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:14,040
I have to prepare a gift for Lan's birthday.
Of course, I have to use the opportunity

406
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,800
to spend some time outside.

407
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,350
You reminded me.

408
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:19,590
I haven't prepared my gift yet too.

409
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,520
Perfect. Let's shop together.

410
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,400
Let's shop together.

411
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:22,760
Sure.

412
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,230
I don't know what girls like.

413
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,040
Would you like to give me some advice?

414
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,280
Well, you sure are clever.

415
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,800
(Luofu Inn)
Each girl has her own preference.

416
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,710
Sometimes, even we can't decide ourselves.

417
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,430
Much less give you advice.

418
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,830
Well, it's still better than me
choosing one on my own.

419
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,070
You only need to tell me

420
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,310
what you like.

421
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:52,710
I...

422
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,230
What I like

423
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,350
may not be suitable as a gift.

424
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,920
Why would something you like

425
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,400
be unsuitable?

426
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,040
Then...

427
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,000
Then...

428
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,800
Then?

429
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,800
Why all the "thens"?

430
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,190
By the time you guys finish talking,

431
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,800
I'll have purchased the gift already.

432
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,280
Well, you spent a lot of time

433
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,760
dawdling around too, Young Lady.

434
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,920
Lian Pian, you talked back to me again.

435
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,470
I'll poke you...

436
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:22,920
Master Sang,

437
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,230
do you like this?

438
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,160
It suits you.

439
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:26,880
I'll buy it

440
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:27,830
for you.

441
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,190
Mister,

442
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:29,830
how much is this?

443
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,640
That's more like it.

444
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,560
That'll be three wen.

445
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:32,880
Here.

446
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,350
Thanks.

447
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,280
Here. Keep the change.

448
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:36,710
Thank you.

449
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:37,400
Here you go, Master Sang.

450
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,310
Let me know if you want anything else.

451
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:38,880
Come on.

452
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,160
Let's take a look around.

453
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,070
Young Lady.

454
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:41,760
Shoo.

455
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,680
Doesn't this look nice?

456
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,230
It's okay, I guess?

457
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,430
I'll take it.

458
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:46,950
No.

459
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,000
Don't keep buying things for me.

460
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:55,110
Miss!

461
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,430
You haven't paid for the bracelet yet.

462
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,230
They took it.

463
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,190
Why should I pay?

464
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,470
I don't care about that.

465
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,110
They took it.

466
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,280
Why should I pay?

467
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,640
You were with them, Miss.

468
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:05,800
Here. Have this.

469
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:09,470
(Wine)
Lian Pian!

470
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:10,880
(Bamboo Furniture)
Lian Pian!

471
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:12,800
You guys!

472
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,160
Lian Pian,

473
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,470
you left

474
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,350
without even paying

475
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,800
and left me behind.

476
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,310
Young Lady, I'll go and pay for it right now.

477
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:24,920
Right.

478
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,280
You go ahead and wait for me at the silk store.

479
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,190
I'll be there right away.

480
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,470
I'll go with her.

481
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:29,880
I'll go too.

482
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:31,590
Lian Pian.

483
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,160
Lian Pian, let me carry that pouch for you.

484
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,470
No.

485
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,000
Let me carry that money pouch for you.

486
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:35,640
No.

487
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,000
It's not a big deal if I buy something for you.

488
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:37,950
No.

489
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,400
(Zhou's Silk)
Lian Pian.

490
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,190
Oh, my, if it isn't Qi.

491
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,160
To think I would run into you here.

492
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,590
I was just talking to my friends about you.

493
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,710
I heard you were grounded
by Grand Commandant Sang.

494
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:07,950
Did you get into trouble again?

495
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,710
I had been away for a few days

496
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,560
and my father missed me.

497
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,310
That's why he made me
stay in the house for a few days.

498
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,470
But you, on the other hand,

499
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,110
still like to talk behind other's backs.

500
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:21,160
You'll get into trouble someday.

501
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:24,000
Well, you're sharp-tongued indeed.

502
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,950
You're the same as ever as well, Miss Song.

503
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,070
Causing trouble everywhere.

504
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,040
I'm in a good mood because I chose a good gift.

505
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,310
I can't let you ruin it.

506
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,400
For Lan's birthday?

507
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,040
I thought you wouldn't know about this,

508
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,310
seeing as you had been in the mountains.

509
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,470
I

510
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,760
put a lot of thought into this gift.

511
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,310
I'm sure Miss Su will understand

512
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,400
my efforts when she sees it.

513
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,310
The others will be moved by my cleverness

514
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,000
too.

515
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,590
Well, since you're here,

516
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,560
I'll show it to you.

517
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,000
This

518
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,000
is the Long Xiang Ink
I specially ordered from Xuanzhou.

519
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:05,800
Don't touch it!

520
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:09,640
Do you know why I chose this for her?

521
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,160
I figured you wouldn't.

522
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,950
The Su family is a family of scholars.

523
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,280
Miss Su is Bianjing's most talented
young lady as well.

524
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,710
A fine piece of ink cake

525
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,280
suits her the most, of course.

526
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,070
That's the first reason.

527
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,070
What about the second reason?

528
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:29,760
As for the second reason,

529
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,430
I hope that Miss Su will understand

530
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,070
that when she marries into the Yan family,

531
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:34,830
I am the official wife

532
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:35,590
and she is a concubine.

533
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,590
She ought to be obedient and mind the rules.

534
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,590
She mustn't use her looks

535
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,560
to seduce my husband.

536
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,350
Yin,

537
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:44,920
you've certainly thought a lot.

538
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,070
Not only that,

539
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:47,880
I think you over-think as well.

540
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,430
You don't have to praise me, Qi.

541
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,040
Oh,

542
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,350
how I hope you could be there to witness it.

543
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,520
Unfortunately, Miss Su would never invite

544
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,430
such a barbarian like you to her banquet.

545
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,680
Yin,

546
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,640
don't be too upset.

547
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:07,520
Miss Su and I have only met a few times,

548
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,230
but we get along well.

549
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:10,640
I have long received

550
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,110
her invitation as well.

551
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,190
Then, I must remind Miss Su
that she mustn't simply

552
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,470
invite anyone to the residence

553
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:16,830
when she marries into the Yan family.

554
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,350
I can't lose face as the wife.

555
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:30,070
(Grand Commandant's Residence)

556
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,640
Yan Yan,

557
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,070
we've already arrived at home.

558
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:36,920
You should go back too.

559
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:37,800
Let's go, Lian Pian.

560
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:38,880
Wait.

561
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:52,680
You...

562
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,880
What are you doing?

563
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:56,470
Take these.

564
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,280
These are all things for women.

565
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:58,880
I don't need any of them.

566
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:04,000
I...

567
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,070
I don't like them.

568
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:05,830
I don't like them.

569
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:06,520
I don't want them.

570
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,230
Don't lie.

571
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,430
You held each of these for a long while earlier.

572
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,590
From the look in your eyes,

573
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,830
you clearly like them.

574
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:13,950
I'm off now.

575
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,040
Good for you, Lian Pian.

576
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,950
Yan Yan even did this earlier.

577
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,160
Like this.

578
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,070
He is gross.

579
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,950
Young Lady.

580
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,070
I'm telling you,

581
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:30,680
I can buy

582
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,070
all these for you too.

583
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:33,470
Don't look so happy.

584
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:34,470
This is nothing!

585
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,280
Young Lady.

586
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:55,920
Young Lady,

587
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,640
what are you thinking about?

588
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,000
About Song Jia Yin.

589
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,070
Song Jia Yin?

590
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,800
Did you lose the argument earlier?

591
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:05,920
Impossible.

592
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,350
Miss Song has always lost to you in arguments.

593
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,280
Besides, you've never taken her words to heart.

594
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,800
What's going on?

595
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,800
I don't care about her.

596
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,760
I'm bothered by what she said.

597
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:17,920
This won't do.

598
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,230
I have to make a trip.

599
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,430
Where are you going?

600
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:23,230
To the Su Residence to see Lan.

601
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,040
The banquet is just around the corner.

602
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,110
Why make another trip there?

603
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,350
Because there are some things

604
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,880
that are inappropriate to be said
at her birthday banquet.

605
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,430
Young Lady.

606
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:47,070
(Jianshan Pavilion)

607
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,040
Qi.

608
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,710
It's late. Is there something you need from me?

609
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,640
Why don't we talk inside?

610
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,520
Lan,

611
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,830
I've thought about it.

612
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,400
I think I should

613
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,560
make things clear with you before the banquet.

614
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:05,680
Please go ahead.

615
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,310
We haven't known each other for long,

616
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:09,190
but you've always treated me sincerely

617
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,710
and never hid your thoughts from me,

618
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,560
so I think I should do the same.

619
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,710
Since I have some thoughts now,

620
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:18,040
I think

621
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,110
I should tell you as well.

622
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,000
Do you remember

623
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,400
the heart-to-heart talk we had?

624
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:27,310
Why did you bring that up all of a sudden?

625
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,950
Recently,

626
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,560
I spent some time with Deputy Chief
on the mountain.

627
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,830
I suddenly found out

628
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,040
that my feelings for him

629
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,800
have somewhat changed.

630
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,800
It's not like those stories
in storytelling scripts.

631
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,830
Not the mushy

632
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,000
and overly clingy feelings.

633
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,640
I think

634
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:53,070
he is like the afternoon breeze at the frontier.

635
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,920
Comfortable, relaxing,

636
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,800
and refreshing.

637
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:59,880
Like the roast lamb over a fire pit,

638
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:02,310
which smells warm

639
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,680
and fragrant.

640
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,190
No, that's not it either.

641
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,000
Like the horse milk wine in the wine pouch,

642
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,230
when you take a sip of it,

643
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,400
you feel warm and tipsy.

644
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,760
I... I don't know if I'm putting it well.

645
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,400
But anyway...

646
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:16,470
Qi,

647
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,830
are you hungry?

648
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:21,710
No.

649
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,230
I'm not.

650
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:24,830
I just think

651
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,680
I should be upfront with you about this

652
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:27,590
as you have been

653
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,400
sincere and honest with me too.

654
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,400
I'm happy

655
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,230
that you're willing to tell me this.

656
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,800
(Jianshan Pavilion)
I think

657
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,470
you need more time

658
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,040
to go through your feelings.

659
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,280
Maybe

660
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:41,070
you'll be able to find your answers

661
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:41,920
on my banquet.

662
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:51,770
(Jianshan Pavilion)

663
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,400
Greetings, Miss Sang.

664
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,680
Miss Su has been waiting for you.

665
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,590
Please come with me.

666
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:56,950
Miss Sang.

667
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,950
Miss Su has been waiting for you.

668
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,350
She already went inside.

669
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,470
I have invited only friends

670
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,830
to my birthday banquet today.

671
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,310
There are no elders here.

672
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:31,920
I only wish for everyone

673
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:34,110
to have fun and enjoy yourselves.

674
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:49,040
Please have a seat.

675
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,560
Miss Su,

676
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:59,230
this is my gift for you.

677
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,040
I especially ordered this Long Xiang Ink for you.

678
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:06,640
I hope you will like it

679
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,520
and understand what I mean by it.

680
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,590
It's a thoughtful gift, Yin.

681
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:22,470
Miss Su.

682
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,880
This is...

683
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,190
I sewed this together with Lian Pian.

684
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,680
It's a picture of the lush plains.

685
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,880
My embroidery isn't much to speak of,

686
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,710
but I put a lot of effort into this.

687
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,640
This is the best piece

688
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,950
I have ever sewed.

689
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,710
Thank you, Qi.

690
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,310
The design is unique.

691
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,110
I like it.

692
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:51,640
Wen Yuan, put it away.

693
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:58,250
Bai Shi.

694
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,040
Here it comes.

695
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,160
I knew it.

696
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,680
Young Master Yan knows that Lan
is most skilled in playing the guqin.

697
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:08,950
He will definitely choose this gift.

698
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:10,230
There's more to it than that.

699
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,350
This guqin may look ordinary,

700
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,830
but it was crafted by a well-known craftsman.

701
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,040
It is hundreds of years old.

702
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:17,160
And it was once played by a renowned guqin master.

703
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,040
It is definitely no ordinary item.

704
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:20,470
It could even be considered a prized treasure.

705
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:21,680
I heard

706
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:23,430
the Yan family prepared it well in advance

707
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,230
and spent a lot of money to acquire it.

708
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,560
The Yan family sure is generous.

709
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,350
But of course.

710
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,160
Think about it.

711
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,680
The character for guqin rhymes
with the character for love, doesn't it?

712
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,710
That makes sense.

713
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:33,070
"As harmonious as lute and psaltery".

714
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:35,640
The Yan family might be asking
for the Su daughter's hand in marriage soon.

715
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,430
Thank you, Young Master Yan.

716
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,560
This is my favorite gift today.

717
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:47,070
You're too kind, Lan.

718
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,280
I've been inspired all of a sudden.

719
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:51,880
Why don't I play a song for everyone?

720
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,160
I'm so envious.

721
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,830
Since it was a gift from Young Master Yan,

722
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,590
I think she should play "Feng Qiu Huang".
(*A phoenix's pursuit of love)

723
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,000
That's not for her to play.

724
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,110
I think she should play "Love's Longing".

725
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,430
You're right.

726
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,560
"Over

727
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,470
the mountains,

728
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:15,000
far away, the sky is high, and the rivers run cold."

729
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,400
"As the maple leaves turn red, I long for you".

730
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,880
Miss Su is a beautiful
and sophisticated young lady.

731
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:20,470
I wonder who, among here,

732
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:22,520
is the young man pursuing her.

733
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,350
(Lan has feelings for Yun Zhi.)

734
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,880
(Do you have feelings for her as well?)

735
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:32,830
Young Lady.

736
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,400
I have to tell you something.

737
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,470
My mother arranged a marriage for me.

738
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,000
I'll be making the proposal soon.

739
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,430
Lian Pian.

740
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,230
Yun Zhi.

741
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,640
Yun Zhi.

742
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,680
It's a rare opportunity.

743
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:54,830
Why don't

744
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,280
you and I play a song together?

745
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:59,560
When it comes to music temperament,

746
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:00,830
your brother

747
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,280
is superior to me.

748
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:03,710
Why don't you play with him instead?

749
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,520
You gifted me this guqin.

750
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,190
It would, of course, be most fitting
that we play it together.

751
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,310
Lan.

752
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:16,110
You and I grew up together.

753
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,520
We are like brother and sister.

754
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,000
That means

755
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,040
both Qing Xuan and I are your brothers.

756
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:24,590
Does it make a difference which one of us

757
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,710
plays it with you?

758
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,350
Besides,

759
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,950
I gave you this guqin

760
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,430
in hopes

761
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,190
that you will find your soulmate soon.

762
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:34,350
If I played it with you,

763
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,110
wouldn't that

764
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,430
go against my intentions?

765
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:43,760
Please excuse me.

766
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,400
What's going on?

767
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,070
Brother and sister?

768
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,800
Does that mean Deputy Chief Yan

769
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,400
is not willing to marry Miss Su?

770
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,520
Then Miss Su...

771
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,070
Yin,

772
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,190
why are you upset all of a sudden?

773
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,000
Deputy Chief Yan gave Miss Su

774
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:11,920
such an expensive gift.

775
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,280
How could I be happy?

776
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,760
You put a lot of thought
into your gift, too, didn't you?

777
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,110
How could that be the same?

778
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,800
My gift shows my temperament

779
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,590
and generosity as the wife.

780
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,680
Deputy Chief Yan's gift is different.

781
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:28,000
That represents his love for her.

782
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,680
She hasn't even married into the family yet.

783
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,830
If she does marry into the family,

784
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,310
she'll take advantage of his love for her

785
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,880
and make things difficult for me.

786
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,400
Miss Su doesn't appear to be someone like that.

787
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,760
You don't understand.

788
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,040
All women from prestigious families

789
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:40,950
are difficult to handle.

790
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,310
What happened?

791
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:45,230
You look upset.

792
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,760
I'm already upset, and now

793
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,760
an even more upsetting character has come.

794
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:49,830
Let's go.

795
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:52,470
Give it to me.

796
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,310
Give it back.

797
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,710
Not appreciating a person's kind intentions.

798
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I thought I would comfort her,
but instead, she talked bad about me.

799
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,710
It's not worth it.

800
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,160
It's all Deputy Chief's fault.

801
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,310
It's all his fault.

802
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,560
It's all his fault.

803
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,070
It's all his fault.

804
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,800
It's all Deputy Chief's fault.

805
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:15,080
What's my fault?

806
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:25,040
Shouldn't you be playing the guqin with Miss Su

807
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,630
in the hall right now?

808
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,080
Why are you here?

809
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:28,870
To find you.

810
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
For what?

811
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:36,360
I'm just taking a stroll around the manor.

812
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,320
I won't get lost.

813
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,910
You should go back and keep her company.

814
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,670
There are many others with her.

815
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,560
She doesn't need me there.

816
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,600
Lian Pian!

817
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:49,470
Lian Pian!

818
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,950
Lian Pian! Wait for me, Lian Pian!

819
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:53,560
Lian Pian...

820
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,560
You're the one getting married.

821
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,080
Why ask me?

822
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:55,840
Lian Pian,

823
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,430
let me explain.

824
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,600
What is there to explain?

825
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,760
Who you marry is none

826
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,840
of my concern,

827
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,470
and I don't care.

828
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,000
You really don't care?

829
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,560
Why should I?

830
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:11,080
Because...

831
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:12,710
Because...

832
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,080
Because of our relationship!

833
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:16,870
Lian Pian.

834
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,280
Young Master Yan, mind your words.

835
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,390
What relationship is there between us?

836
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,360
If there really is something,

837
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:22,840
it's only because of our families.

838
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,320
I don't have a right

839
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,230
to be concerned about your family matters.

840
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,320
Are you mad at me?

841
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,000
Why should I be mad?

842
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,910
Are you mad that I didn't put my foot down?

843
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,230
My family

844
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,670
arranged this marriage on their own.

845
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,190
Of course, I won't go along with it.

846
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,710
Then what are you going to do?

847
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:39,870
I'll drag it on for now.

848
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,190
And see how it goes?

849
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:42,870
Drag it on?

850
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,080
That's your attitude?

851
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,600
Well, to have the best

852
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,430
of both worlds

853
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:48,520
and ignore the matter at hand.

854
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,430
How clever of you!

855
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,950
- I'm not like that.
- That's not what I mean.

856
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:51,520
Lian Pian.

857
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,280
I hope you have a child soon.

858
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,910
Lian Pian.

859
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,390
I'll talk to my mother again...

860
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,040
Young Master!

861
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,360
Young Master!

862
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:00,910
Young Master!

863
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:11,630
Young Lady?

864
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,000
Deputy Chief?

865
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,280
Young Lady, why are you here?

866
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,800
It... it was a coincidence.

867
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:21,190
Deputy Chief.

868
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:23,080
How much did you guys hear?

869
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,320
From when you started explaining.

870
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,080
From when she said she refused to listen.

871
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,190
That means you heard everything!

872
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:31,560
Young Master.

873
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:33,710
Mr. Qing Xuan is looking for you.

874
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:37,390
I'll go with you.

875
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:39,080
Come on.

876
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:40,870
Young Lady,

877
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:43,150
since you were already here,

878
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,120
why didn't you say so?

879
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,870
Well, I didn't want to interrupt.

880
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:53,390
Never mind.

881
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,150
Let's go back.

882
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,190
Song Jia Yin!

883
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,910
What's going on?

884
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:10,190
Miss Su said she doesn't feel well.

885
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,360
We couldn't stay long, of course,

886
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,080
so everyone is leaving.

887
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,670
What happened to Lan?

888
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,360
Is she all right?

889
00:37:14,470 --> 00:37:15,560
She's fine.

890
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:16,360
Don't worry.

891
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,760
You're quite a strange person.

892
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,520
You were upset earlier,

893
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,150
after hearing that Miss Su's not feeling well,

894
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,000
you look so happy.

895
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,950
Miss Su says that she isn't feeling well,

896
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,870
but actually,

897
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:36,230
she is upset

898
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,040
because Deputy Chief Yan refused

899
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,000
to marry her.

900
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,430
What?

901
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,120
Both of us went to the garden earlier.

902
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,520
We missed the most exciting part.

903
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,230
Deputy Chief Yan

904
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,000
may not have said so directly,

905
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,080
but his words have implied it.

906
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:55,470
I was worried

907
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:57,150
she would seduce him

908
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,910
and make things difficult for me,

909
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:00,120
but now it seems

910
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,390
she won't even be able to marry him.

911
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:03,120
How could I not be happy?

912
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,520
I'm off now.

913
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:30,710
Young Lady,

914
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,470
what's on your mind?

915
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:38,950
I understand now.

916
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,470
I have feelings for Deputy Chief.

917
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:46,190
You have finally come around.

918
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:49,950
But

919
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,870
what do you think Deputy Chief feels about me?

920
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,470
It's hard to tell what's on his mind.

921
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,520
He changes his mind easily.

922
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:56,800
He likes to pull pranks on me

923
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,870
and often makes things difficult for me.

924
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:58,470
But...

925
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,710
On the other hand,

926
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:05,000
he helped me a lot.

927
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,230
He is considerate of me

928
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,910
and he knows what I want.

929
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,000
Given what you said,

930
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,670
I think he has feelings for you too.

931
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:17,710
That's not true either.

932
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:20,800
He always emphasizes

933
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:22,150
that he is only nice to me

934
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,230
because of my brother.

935
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:25,360
Well, that's possible too.

936
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,670
After all, Deputy Chief and Young Master
were close friends.

937
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:30,190
They...

938
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:35,470
Lian Pian,

939
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,230
whose side are you on?

940
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:38,630
I...

941
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,520
Didn't you say so yourself, Young Lady?

942
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,230
Besides,

943
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,390
it has nothing to do with whose side I'm on.

944
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:46,520
This is a matter between both of you.

945
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:49,190
Right.

946
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,040
You're right.

947
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:52,560
I'll have to find out

948
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,630
sooner or later.

949
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,670
I'll ask him tomorrow

950
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
at the Imperial College.
