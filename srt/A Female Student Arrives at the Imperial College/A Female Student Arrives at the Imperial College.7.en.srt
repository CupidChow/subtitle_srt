28
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,040
I was careless.

29
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,080
Master.

30
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,470
It hurts.

31
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:18,750
Deputy Chief, that hurts.

32
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,110
Stop pretending. I didn't even use any strength.

33
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,830
You want to fight with me
with these little tricks?

34
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,030
My father taught me this move.

35
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,360
It doesn't matter who teaches you.

36
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:27,750
What matters is can the person who uses it

37
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,080
understand and master the move.

38
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:29,960
If you're learning like this,

39
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,080
let alone your father and the expert,

40
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,270
you won't be able to learn anything from anyone.

41
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,160
Deputy Chief, can you

42
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,880
let go of me first before you talk?

43
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,190
With the performance you just showed
and you still want to learn martial arts?

44
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,550
You can't even defeat me.

45
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,160
Who will want to teach you at this level?

46
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,320
Whether they take me in or not is one thing,

47
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,000
but I'm definitely searching for him.

48
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,750
So determined?

49
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,750
Because I think

50
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,600
he's the master that Heaven sent to me.

51
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,270
It's not hard for me to learn martial arts.

52
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,720
My father can teach me.

53
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,520
Besides, our Sang family
has a whole troop of soldiers.

54
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,390
But those moves are for fighting in the war.

55
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:22,320
I know you're good too, Deputy Chief.

56
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,160
I also want to find out if there's anyone out there

57
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,390
who's better than you.

58
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,240
If I can find this expert

59
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,800
and learn martial arts from him,

60
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,440
then I won't be thrown into a panic
if I encounter any danger in the future.

61
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,270
If you behave more in your daily life,

62
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,880
you won't be caught in any danger.

63
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,440
For instance, don't come to a desolate place

64
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,600
during late night.

65
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,110
If I don't come out,

66
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,520
how can I find my master?

67
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,470
Since it's such a coincidence,

68
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,720
then why don't you send me back
while protecting me?

69
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,190
This is indeed a bit dangerous.

70
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,160
I've always been protecting you.

71
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,520
When did you protect me?

72
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,600
You heard wrongly.

73
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:12,960
I had never protected you.

74
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,080
Just now you...

75
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,470
was like this.

76
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,830
That was nice.

77
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,000
Why aren't you smiling now?

78
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,760
You know Scholar Feng, right?

79
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,600
I'll imitate him for you.

80
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,720
You know his face.

81
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,920
Always pulling a long face.

82
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:44,480
Just like this.

83
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,270
About his face,

84
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,390
every time I see it,

85
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,880
I always thought of bitter gourd.

86
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,510
If you see him wagging his head,

87
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,550
pulling a long face,

88
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,320
and if his head is turning like a sundial,

89
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,040
then he must be memorizing a poem.

90
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:07,480
Then if he keeps turning his head and frowning,

91
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:08,350
like this.

92
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,760
Then he must be scolding me.

93
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,040
Sang Qi.

94
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,110
Oh, Sang Qi.

95
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,790
Sang Qi!

96
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,350
Sang Qi!

97
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,600
Do you know

98
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,200
that ladies from those wealthy
and influential families in Bianjing

99
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,760
are all dignified and elegant?

100
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,670
You're the only one who's comic.

101
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,830
So you're saying

102
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,230
that this is what makes me special.

103
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,110
Am I right?

104
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:35,920
No.

105
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,790
Deputy Chief, remember to protect me.

106
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:56,000
Don't look anymore. He's not here.

107
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,350
I can walk on my own.

108
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:03,820
(Grand Commandant's Residence)

109
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,550
It's improper,

110
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,720
it's improper.

111
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,440
Thank you, Deputy Chief.

112
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,790
I'll invite you to come to my residence next time.

113
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,390
Hurry and go back in.

114
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,160
All right.

115
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,320
I have difficulty in walking,

116
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,040
so I have to ask you to help me.

117
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,160
Why don't you go in through the door?

118
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,510
My father is worried about my safety,

119
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,000
so he doesn't let me out of the residence.

120
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,480
If I knock on the door and wake him up,

121
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,230
not only this leg is broken,

122
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,110
the other leg will be too.

123
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,000
I am the Deputy Chief of the Imperial College,

124
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:58,880
why should I accompany you

125
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,350
to do such a sneaky thing?

126
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:01,670
White...

127
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:02,270
Stop it.

128
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,760
Hold on to me.

129
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,600
Thank you, Deputy Chief.

130
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,950
Oh, Deputy Chief.

131
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,550
Why are you different from those
Young Masters in the storytelling script?

132
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,920
I read that those Young Masters
in the storytelling script

133
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,110
just flew up in an instant.

134
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,830
Why do you still need to leverage your strength?

135
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,350
Don't tell me that you lack a bit of skill?

136
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,110
Which useless storytelling script did you read?

137
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,230
Isn't that what you asked me to read?

138
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:44,830
I really don't understand

139
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,110
why Yu let you read those books.

140
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,550
If it were me I'd let you read Di Zi Gui,
[*teaching of the Chinese philosopher Confucius]

141
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,920
so you could learn to behave.

142
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,720
It's useless now.

143
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,110
There's no turning back now.

144
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,510
Just accept your fate.

145
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,270
Your way back is

146
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,390
to wait for Grand Commandant Sang

147
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,160
to break your other leg.

148
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:14,790
Yan...

149
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,160
Yan Yun Zhi!

150
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,640
Yan Yun Zhi, you're inhuman!

151
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:23,440
You!

152
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,220
(Yan)

153
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,150
(Yan)
Young Master.

154
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,030
Bai Shi, what are you thinking about?

155
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,000
It's nothing.

156
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,400
It's just I've been with you for so many years

157
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,910
and I've never seen Young Master

158
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,110
cares about a lady so much.

159
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:04,080
You visited her in person

160
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,790
and even sent her back home in secret.

161
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,840
Even Miss Su didn't get this kind of treatment.

162
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,150
What nonsense are you talking about?

163
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:11,640
That's...

164
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,760
That's Yu's sister.

165
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,350
Can I not be serious about his sister?

166
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,670
Even so,

167
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,320
Young Master, you've indeed

168
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,030
become a little overwhelmed lately.

169
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,320
You're different than your usual self.

170
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,320
Bai Shi.

171
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,910
I haven't cared about you for too long, right?

172
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,110
You've come of age.

173
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,000
Do you have a carriage?

174
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,840
Do you have a house?

175
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:45,470
Have you met anyone with a view to marriage?

176
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,640
(Yan)
Young Master, it's late already.

177
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,230
Let's go back to the residence.

178
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:52,910
Please.

179
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:17,950
(Bamboo ware)

180
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,950
(Nanshui Pavilion)

181
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,110
Lan... Lan.

182
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,280
What a coincidence to meet you here.

183
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,110
Lan, have you had your dinner?

184
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,280
That's great!

185
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,590
I... I... It's not that I'm hungry.

186
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,910
It's because last time

187
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,000
you brought me to Qing Xuan's place to eat.

188
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,200
Let me treat you this time.

189
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,350
It can be regarded as paying back
the favor of last time, okay?

190
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,230
Then... I"ll accept your invitation.

191
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,640
Last time I didn't have a
chance to talk with you too.

192
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,000
Wen Yuan, you can go back first.

193
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,320
Tell my mother

194
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,960
that I'll have dinner with Qi tonight.

195
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:00,910
No need to wait for me.

196
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,470
Yes.

197
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,470
Please.

198
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:04,350
All right.

199
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:10,550
Please enjoy your food.

200
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,400
Thank you.

201
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,790
During my absence in Bianjing,

202
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,400
I think

203
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,150
Yun Zhi also encountered a lot of things.

204
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:20,790
Yes.

205
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:25,350
But I think there's nothing in this world

206
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,200
that can make him troubled.

207
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,760
I think he is at ease every day.

208
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,910
And you can rest assured,

209
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,400
he has good self-control.

210
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,030
He doesn't accept any women's pouch.

211
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,230
The pouch bet that you mentioned last time,

212
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,400
what is it about?

213
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,880
Can you tell me about it?

214
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,960
If you're curious about this,

215
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,550
then you have to listen to the whole story.

216
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,440
That day, when I reached Bianjing,

217
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,080
I saw Deputy Chief's carriage's horse
being startled.

218
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,200
So after I helped him stopped his carriage,

219
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,520
instead of thanking me,

220
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,320
he just stared at me fiercely.

221
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:55,670
Young Master,

222
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,640
this Miss Sang

223
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,790
dares to tell Miss Su about the pouch.

224
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,550
She's very bold.

225
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,640
Eat your food.

226
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,440
Turns out you and Yin have
this kind of misunderstanding.

227
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,350
No wonder she will call you for a bet.

228
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,110
It's just...

229
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,550
Yun Zhi's temperament is like this.

230
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,030
Although he seems cold and distant,

231
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,550
if things become difficult for you
because of him,

232
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,840
he will never sit by idly.

233
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,840
But I'm quite curious,

234
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,230
what had he gone through

235
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,960
to have such temperament?

236
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,760
Or he's like that since young?

237
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,910
Maybe not.

238
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,960
But he indeed got mature at an early age.

239
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,640
For as long as I can remember,

240
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,520
he seems to have always been like this.

241
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,000
You

242
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,320
don't know Yun Zhi long enough than me,

243
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,590
so it's normal that you don't
understand his temperament.

244
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,080
If you're interested,

245
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,640
I'll tell you more next time

246
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,520
about our experience.

247
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:53,670
If only there were two girls

248
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,000
who could love me like this, that'd be great.

249
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,350
You might choke if you keep eating like a wolf.

250
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,320
I shouldn't have gone out with you today.

251
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,960
Lan, you should have it.

252
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,960
I'm already full.

253
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:09,350
You should have it.

254
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,400
It's just a sweet lotus root.

255
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,000
You don't need to be so polite. Lan, you can eat it.

256
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,840
Then thank you, Qi.

257
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,670
Qi is such a generous and hearty girl.

258
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,790
Oh, right. Lan.

259
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,640
We only talked about Deputy Chief

260
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,640
for so long just now.

261
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,520
I'm actually quite curious about one thing.

262
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,230
Don't restrain yourself.

263
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,520
You care about him so much.

264
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,640
Is it because you have an engagement

265
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,440
or both of you like each other?

266
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,960
It's...

267
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,200
I like him.

268
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,520
Wha... Why?

269
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,080
Although he always faces people
with a poker face,

270
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,670
he's not a cold-hearted person.

271
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,440
It can be said

272
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,110
that he is a caring and considerate person.

273
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,000
If others did not complete something perfectly,

274
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:10,350
he will perfect everything

275
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,670
without anyone knowing.

276
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,590
But he won't tell either.

277
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:16,400
However, that's his temperament.

278
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:19,400
He's not Yan Yun Zhi if he would say it out loud.

279
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,030
Are we talking about the same person?

280
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:27,840
Or maybe,

281
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,320
he's only Yanluo Wang in the Imperial College.
[*the ruler of the underworld]

282
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,710
Although we only know each other for some time,

283
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,670
I feel like we hit it off well with each other.

284
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,320
In my eyes, Lan,

285
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,550
you're gentle, virtuous, and very talented.

286
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:46,590
In other words,

287
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,670
you're a good lady who deserves
to be respected and loved.

288
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,110
Deputy Chief too.

289
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:52,440
He's my brother's best friend.

290
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,440
He's also my respected teacher.

291
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,760
However, I have to remind you.

292
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,640
What are you thinking?

293
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,320
Why do you have to like Yan Yun Zhi?

294
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,640
I... I...

295
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,640
I know I'm a little abrupt.

296
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,590
I.. What I mean is...

297
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:15,030
Lan, you can still reconsider a bit.

298
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,470
Didn't you say it yourself just now?

299
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,550
Deputy Chief looks like a piece of brick

300
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,910
on the appearance,

301
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,470
just like everyone owes him money.

302
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,910
But as soon as you get closer to him,

303
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,400
he indeed won't keep his poker face,

304
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:26,640
but he keeps verbally attacking you.

305
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,840
How annoying!

306
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,400
Lan, you have such a good temper.

307
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,150
You might be bullied by him!

308
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,910
After hearing your words,

309
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,400
on second thought,

310
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,080
he seems to be like this.

311
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:39,710
Usually, he seems well educated
and knowledgeable,

312
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,880
but sometimes he is really annoying.

313
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:42,840
Besides,

314
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,760
let me tell you. Deputy Chief, he...

315
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,550
What about him?

316
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,670
Never mind!

317
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,280
It's bad to talk about people behind their backs.

318
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,230
But if it's only the two of us, it'll be okay, right?

319
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,150
It'll only be just between us. I won't spread it out.

320
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,840
Deputy Chief loves to set people up.

321
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,760
He just likes to watch the fun.

322
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:11,790
You...

323
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,520
What you mean is

324
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,550
Yun Zhi often deliberately makes fun of people?

325
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:23,320
However, this is just my guess.

326
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,470
Although Deputy Chief seems

327
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,590
like a good man on the outside,

328
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,790
he's really mean on the inside.

329
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,350
Lan, you're a nice lady.

330
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,150
Don't be held back by him.

331
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,280
Although I understand

332
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,150
that this kind of thing still depends on your own,

333
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,790
I can only give you a little suggestion

334
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,670
for your reference.

335
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,640
And here I thought...

336
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,350
I will consider what you've said.

337
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,910
But since we've talked until this,

338
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:57,080
I often see that the Zhuo's family
and the Yan's family's sons

339
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,640
are always by your side.

340
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,230
Is there anyone that you like?

341
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:04,640
Those two?

342
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,400
No, no.

343
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:07,150
Those two...

344
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:10,760
I'll tell you like this.

345
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,520
That Yan Yan

346
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,070
is like this tendon.

347
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,560
Solid and chewy.

348
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,280
Not only it's tiring when you eat it,

349
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,950
but you'll get a headache too
after chewing it for a long time.

350
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,230
This... Not a bone left!

351
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,110
Isn't there still stewed meatball here?

352
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,040
The heck there is.

353
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,560
Zhuo Wen Yuan is just like a roast chicken.

354
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,280
Crispy and smooth.

355
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,640
(It's a good dish.)

356
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,880
(But I've been eating this in the north
since I was young,)

357
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:41,950
(if you've been eating it for such a long time,)

358
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,430
it will be tasteless if you eat it daily.

359
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,920
So I don't feel any tug at my heart.

360
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,800
The metaphor you use is very interesting.

361
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,880
Then, what about Yun Zhi?

362
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:55,040
If Yun Zhi is someone you can consider,

363
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,040
how will you describe him?

364
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,160
Deputy Chief...

365
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,160
Sweet lotus roots.

366
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,590
Sweet lotus roots?

367
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,400
Yes.

368
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,880
(Don't look at us just now fighting over it,)

369
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,400
(if you think about it,)

370
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:15,350
(its skin)

371
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:17,350
(is the only delicious part
of the sweet lotus root.)

372
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,640
(You will feel greasy)

373
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,560
(if you eat the other part for too long.)

374
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,310
(It's the same as Deputy Chief.)

375
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,950
(He looks fine on the outside,)

376
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,000
(but after getting along with him,)

377
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:25,760
it's annoying.

378
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,190
Let's go.

379
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,040
Qi,

380
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,590
you're such an interesting girl.

381
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,830
You flattered me.

382
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,470
I just don't know

383
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,520
how Yun Zhi would respond to you if he knew

384
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,000
what you commented on him.

385
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,350
He doesn't know!

386
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:45,760
How could he possibly know?

387
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,000
It's just the two of us here.

388
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:51,560
Please.

389
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,160
Let's go.

390
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,280
Yun Zhi?

391
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:59,000
You're here too?

392
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,830
Deputy Chief, what a coincidence!

393
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,160
Did you dine here just now?

394
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,640
Lan and I just finished our meal.

395
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,190
It must be the fate

396
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,470
for us to meet like this.

397
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,800
Deputy Chief, which room did you dine in?

398
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:24,880
Why didn't we see you?

399
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,040
I was just right next to your room.

400
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,470
No wonder I didn't see you.

401
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,680
This wall should be soundproof.

402
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,160
Oh, right!

403
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,880
I suddenly remembered that I had things to do,

404
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,070
I... I'll go first.

405
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,000
Please send Lan back to her residence.

406
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,520
What matter do you have?

407
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,830
Indeed, I have something to do. It's urgent.

408
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,110
I have to go back immediately.

409
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:00,950
I'll be going now, Deputy Chief.

410
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:10,430
Let go.

411
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:11,680
Bai Shi!

412
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:12,760
I'm here.

413
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:13,710
Let go.

414
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,160
I think Miss Sang

415
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,560
has been studying very hard recently.

416
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,710
Let go.

417
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,830
In the name of Imperial College,

418
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,520
send one plate of sweet lotus
roots to her residence

419
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,760
as a reward to Miss Sang.

420
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:24,710
Yes.

421
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:27,680
Sweet lotus root?

422
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,310
Deputy Chief, you...

423
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:29,950
What about me?

424
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,230
I'm just taking care of you for Yu.

425
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,000
Thank you then.

426
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,800
Bai Shi, see her off.

427
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,830
Then...

428
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,590
thank you, Yun Zhi.

429
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,520
Lan.

430
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,070
I have something to tell you.

431
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:13,760
Lan,

432
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,950
thank you for helping with the
pollen investigation last time.

433
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,520
Don't mention it, Yun Zhi.

434
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,350
There's no need to make any
distinction between you and me.

435
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,190
But there are things

436
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,640
that I want to make it clear for you.

437
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,560
We don't have any engagement.

438
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,190
All this time we have always been friends.

439
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,470
We were friends three years ago

440
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,760
and it is the same now.

441
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,710
I hope

442
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,000
that you won't waste your time on me

443
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,520
and don't involve other people either.

444
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:47,760
For instance, Sang Qi.

445
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,190
Sang Qi?

446
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,680
I just met her coincidentally.

447
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,920
At the entry of Imperial College,

448
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,160
does that count as a coincidence too?

449
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,770
(Meritocracy)
(Imperial College)

450
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,760
I understand your intention.

451
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,430
But some things can't be forced.

452
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,560
You said these

453
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,070
three years ago.

454
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,680
I avoided you and went mourning.

455
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,560
I thought if I was not by your side,

456
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,590
you would miss me.

457
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:28,280
But what I didn't expect is

458
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,950
that you almost forgot my existence.

459
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:36,520
After all, it's me that's not good enough

460
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,560
and not worthy to be loved.

461
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:39,160
No.

462
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,560
It's not like that.

463
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,830
You don't have to undervalue yourself.

464
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:46,710
Does that mean

465
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,430
that I still have a chance?

466
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,520
Lan,

467
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,110
whether you're an excellent woman

468
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,950
has nothing to do with whether I like you.

469
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,800
These are two different things.

470
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,760
Do you really not care

471
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,590
about the bond we've shared for so many years?

472
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,040
It's because I care.

473
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,230
That's why I have to make it clear.

474
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,350
Then let me ask you.

475
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,920
What are your feelings for Sang Qi?

476
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:21,310
Do you...

477
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:24,800
like her?

478
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,430
I'm her teacher

479
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,160
and she's my student,

480
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,520
my old friend's sister.

481
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,000
That's it.

482
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,280
If it's only like that,

483
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:44,230
then you've done a lot of things
that you shouldn't do.

484
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:45,920
Although I just came back only a few days

485
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,710
and only met her three times,

486
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,000
I saw you

487
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,040
constantly making exceptions
and changing yourself for her.

488
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,070
The Yan Yun Zhi I know

489
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,230
has always hated being in the limelight.

490
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:03,160
But because you're afraid
that she'll make a fool of herself,

491
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,800
(you played the instrument
on stage in the public eye.)

492
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,000
You don't like to waste your time
talking nonsense.

493
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:13,070
Even with me,

494
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,070
you can't say more than a few words.

495
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:22,000
But Sang Qi, she can even bicker with you.

496
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,760
Only you are allowed to come and others are not?

497
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,680
Even not in the Imperial College,

498
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,040
you dare to speak to the Deputy Chief like this?

499
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,830
I even saved you on stage last night.

500
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,880
If you accept my pouch earlier,

501
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,560
then you don't have to bother to go on the stage.

502
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,070
I came back to town not longer than half a month,

503
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,520
but I've seen too many times

504
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,350
the two of you interacting intimately.

505
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,190
If you have no interest in her

506
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,760
and you're just taking care of her
because of Yu's entrustment,

507
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:45,830
then your behavior

508
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:48,280
has surpassed the line of friendship
between a man and a woman.

509
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,110
If it were someone else,

510
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:53,040
they have already started
gossiping behind your back.

511
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,880
I'm telling you this straightforwardly

512
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:58,000
is because it's for your own good.

513
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,190
You're smart.

514
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,000
I'm sure you'll understand what I mean.

515
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:08,350
Then, I shall take my leave first.

516
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,880
And his face...

517
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:36,190
Young Master.

518
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:40,830
What did Miss Su tell you?

519
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,230
Something is wrong with you.

520
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,590
Nothing. It's not important.

521
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:49,000
Bai Shi.

522
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:49,680
Yes.

523
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,160
I have a friend.

524
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,760
He told me

525
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,710
that he feels like he's been poisoned.

526
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,680
He can't help himself

527
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,040
but think about a girl.

528
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,070
And that girl, she's

529
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,590
always in his mind

530
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,110
and he can't get rid of her.

531
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,880
However, that girl is very odd.

532
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,640
But that friend of mine,

533
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,160
he still wants to stay by her side.

534
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,710
He wants to see her being happy

535
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:21,640
and wants to help her.

536
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,190
Is my friend hopeless?

537
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:29,880
Young Master,

538
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:32,760
I think you have feelings for Miss Sang.

539
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,920
Did I say it was me?

540
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:34,880
Did I say it was Sang Qi?

541
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,040
Young Master,

542
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,400
I was watching

543
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,760
how you're paying your attention to her every day.

544
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:40,950
Stop talking nonsense.

545
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:42,190
How is it possible that I like her?

546
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,800
She's just a very strange girl.

547
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,470
She's naughty and mischievous,

548
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,350
likes causing trouble

549
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,190
and you never know

550
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:47,280
what she's about to do next.

551
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,040
Has tons of weird tricks
and doesn't like to be discipline,

552
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,590
always with a look of "I am the master of my destiny".

553
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,640
Whenever she makes up her mind,

554
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:52,680
even a man can't be compared to her.

555
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,040
How could I like...

556
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:56,520
How could you like her?

557
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,110
Why are you still standing here?

558
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,280
Young Master, I'll take my leave now.

559
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:37,670
(Imperial College)

560
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,950
(Yan Yan)
(Sang Qi, Imperial College)

561
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,300
(Wei Zhan Hong, Imperial College)

562
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,700
(Shangguan Fan, Imperial College)

563
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:54,070
The Imperial College is this huge.

564
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:56,760
I don't believe that I couldn't find this person.

565
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:30,920
Master Sang,

566
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,110
don't be like this.

567
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,000
If I've ever done anything wrong,

568
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,040
you can just hit me.

569
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:35,800
Come on.

570
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,400
Young Master Yan, what are you saying?

571
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:44,760
I'd like to ask you for a favor,

572
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,920
so why would I hit you?

573
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,430
I'm not that mean.

574
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,830
I know you have a lot of pull,

575
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,350
so I want you to help me inquire about something.

576
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,160
Do you... know anyone?

577
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,000
You can ask Zhuo Wen Yuan too!

578
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:58,430
Doesn't he have some connections too?

579
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,760
If I'm searching for a woman,
I'll definitely ask him.

580
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:06,040
But this time around, I'm searching for an old man.

581
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:08,190
This is beyond his ability.

582
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:12,350
Sang Qi, for real?

583
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,590
So you like this type of man?

584
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,070
What are you saying?

585
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,350
I'm searching for my benefactor.

586
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:22,190
Then, I'll be his disciple
and learn martial arts from him.

587
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:26,640
The one who saved you that day
when you're attacked?

588
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:27,470
Yes.

589
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,800
I remembered that night there was no one else

590
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,680
besides you.

591
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,710
Moreover, I've never heard before

592
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:33,800
that there's someone like that in Bianjing.

593
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,040
Could it be that you have hysteria?

594
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,800
What the? You're the one who has hysteria!

595
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,950
I did hear him talking.

596
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,280
How could it be my imagination?

597
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,040
If you don't want to help, then forget it!

598
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:46,680
Wait a minute!

599
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,110
I do know a place

600
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,470
full of different kinds of
people and information.

601
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,230
I'll bring you there later,

602
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:55,160
in the meantime, we'll find
someone to inquire about it.

603
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,470
What place is that?

604
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,000
Qingfeng Restaurant!

605
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,350
I'll take my leave now.

606
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,430
Don't leave yet!

607
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,830
This Qingfeng Restaurant is not
that Qingfeng Restaurant.

608
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:06,880
I know you always eat and drink there,

609
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:10,190
but have you heard the top level
of Qingfeng Restaurant before?

610
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:12,400
A hidden spot

611
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,880
and an eye-opener.

612
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:23,220
(Qingfeng Restaurant)

613
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:24,830
Young Lady,

614
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:28,000
are you not tired of watching
the same scene every day?

615
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:31,920
I don't even know

616
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,520
how many times I need to come here in a month.

617
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,400
How can I not get tired of it?

618
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,520
Master Sang!

619
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:38,830
Let's go!

620
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,950
Why are you here too?

621
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,880
Why can't I come here too?

622
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,710
What? You don't want me here?

623
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:51,760
Welcome! Welcome!

624
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,470
Today's my treat.

625
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,350
Eat whatever you want!

626
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:55,040
Let's go!

627
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:59,150
(Qingfeng Restaurant)
(Shuiyue Shop)

628
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,520
Please go in.

629
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,160
Don't rush, Master Sang.

630
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:20,640
Welcome, please head in.

631
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,230
This place is the same as downstairs.

632
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,830
Men and women are welcome,
suitable for elderlies and kids too.

633
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,950
Even if it's your first time here,
you don't have to be overcautious too.

634
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,000
I guarantee that you'll feel at home.

635
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,430
Master Sang, did you hear that?

636
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,040
Men and women are welcome here.

637
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,310
For me, the top level of Qingfeng Restaurant

638
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,470
is the most open place in the entire Bianjing.

639
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,000
It's fine that you haven't come here before

640
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,230
and don't feel timid.

641
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,950
Follow me to pick a private room,

642
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:44,920
pay more money

643
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,110
to listen to some music.

644
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:47,920
These musicians,

645
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,560
storytellers,

646
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:49,760
and even the servants

647
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,920
are all information distribution centers.

648
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,640
If you meet enough people,

649
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:54,880
I guarantee that you'll get what you want.

650
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:56,880
I, Young Master Yan,

651
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,520
am also one of the VIPs here.

652
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:00,920
If I ask for help,

653
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:02,400
there will always be a way.

654
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:03,520
Let's go.

655
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,560
The three of you, please.

656
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,160
Please.

(Feng Ai)

658
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:11,830
Miss Qian Jiu, it's been a while.

659
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,560
How have you been?

660
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,310
Master Sang!

661
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,800
We're so lucky today.

662
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,560
We met the famous lady.

663
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:20,800
That's okay.

664
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,350
Then we'll come back next time.

665
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,000
Young Master Yan,

666
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,190
quickly wipe your saliva, please.

667
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:27,920
I...

668
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,190
Miss Qian Jiu.

669
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,590
(There's no carving tattoo.)

670
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,800
(Seems that I saw it wrongly that night.)

671
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:43,520
Master Sang,

672
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,560
seems like you know something too.

673
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,350
Even you said that you didn't know
what's the difference upstairs.

674
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,070
You know Miss Qian Jiu too.

675
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,520
Zhuo Wen Yuan!

676
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,070
Zhuo took you here before.

677
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,110
Seems like Zhuo is really an open-minded person.

678
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:00,350
Bringing his legal wife to
meet his concubine that early.

679
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,520
Shouldn't we arrange a gambling party
and play mahjong?

680
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:06,230
The winner of life.

681
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,000
Miss Sang Qi,

682
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,110
why are you dressed like this today

683
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,920
and come here to experience life?

684
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:15,800
Is this also Imperial College's
after-school task?

685
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,630
Miss Qian Jiu, you're so funny.

686
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,150
I'm here today because of some private matter.

687
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,280
I'd like to know about the identity
of a white-robed old man.

688
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:24,840
Yan Yan told me that this place is
an information distribution center.

689
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,230
So I wonder if

690
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,870
there will be some information over here.

691
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:30,950
Then I hope Miss Sang Qi can get what you want

692
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,360
and find out who you want to find.

693
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:33,150
Thank you.

694
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,000
Miss Qian Jiu,

695
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:38,670
you have the most connection here.

696
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,870
If we want to inquire about something,

697
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:42,150
who will be more suitable than you?

698
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,320
I'm sorry, Miss.

699
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:48,470
I'm sorry, Miss.

700
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,710
We will pay for everything that should be paid.

701
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:53,630
We just want to talk with you for a few minutes.

702
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:56,560
Sir and Madam,

703
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:59,760
it's not that our lady here
doesn't want to do your business,

704
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,190
but she already has a customer waiting for her.

705
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:06,120
She's incapable of being in two places at once.

706
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:08,910
Madam Zhang, it's okay.

707
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:10,120
(Feng Ai)

708
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,470
If you guys don't mind,

709
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:13,040
I can still handle it.

710
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:14,360
Please.

711
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,150
She... she can handle this?

712
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:22,120
We have three people altogether!

713
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,040
Zhuo!

714
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:29,040
So the customer that Miss Qian Jiu's saying

715
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,120
is Zhuo!

716
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:34,120
Deputy Chief?

717
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,040
Zhuo... Zhuo...

718
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,360
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

719
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:39,630
Turns out that although Deputy Chief
always looks serious,

720
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:41,190
in fact, you also come to such a place.

721
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:44,630
Deputy Chief.

722
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,470
You told us that when we are free,

723
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:49,360
it's okay to go around places.

724
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,760
But if you come here secretly
to drink with Miss Qian Jiu,

725
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:52,950
then you're at fault.

726
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,120
First,

727
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,600
you've disappointed Lan's kindness.

728
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:56,600
Second,

729
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,630
you're taking away Zhuo Wen Yuan's precious.

730
00:35:59,280 --> 00:35:59,630
Am I right?

731
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,430
Please don't say that, Miss Sang Qi.

732
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:07,630
I don't have any relation with Young Master Zhuo.

733
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,390
Although rumors are saying

734
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,320
that I'll be Young Master Zhuo's concubine,

735
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,800
he didn't even propose nor give any dowry.

736
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,520
I haven't said yes either.

737
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,670
Qian Jiu, are you making
a clean break with me now?

738
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:25,870
I'm talking about business.

739
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:27,470
Young Master Zhuo,

740
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,120
we can still discuss this matter.

741
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:31,320
We just have to talk according to my principle.

742
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,040
You have to pay me more.

743
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,760
If money can solve, then it's a small matter.

744
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,320
Then can I bid too?

745
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:40,520
If it's you,

746
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:43,150
I'm afraid even if you emptied the entire
Grand Preceptor's Residence,

747
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,080
I may not promise you either.

748
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,320
Deputy Chief!

749
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:50,560
You haven't answered me!

750
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,910
I should be the one asking.

751
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,280
Why are you guys here?

752
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:57,910
Me?

753
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:59,360
I'm inquiring about some information.

754
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:00,630
I need to find out

755
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:02,230
who's that white-robed old man.

756
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,600
You haven't let go of this?

757
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,390
No,

758
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,910
I want to find him,

759
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,190
become his disciple, and learn martial arts
from him to protect the Sang family.

760
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,280
If I can't find him, I won't be over with this matter.

761
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,190
I'm sorry, this is yours.

762
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,190
Miss Sang Qi,

763
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:21,120
why don't you describe a bit more in detail?

764
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,560
Maybe I can really help you out.

765
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:27,600
He is someone who comes and goes like a shadow

766
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,430
and a man in a white robe who's good at martial arts.

767
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,870
He comes and goes without a trace!

768
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,870
But when I need him the most,

769
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:34,760
he'll suddenly appear

770
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:35,840
and protect me from danger.

771
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,910
My description is indeed a bit vain and ethereal.

772
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:54,870
Miss Qian Jiu,

773
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,950
do you have the Four Treasures of the Study here?

774
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,120
Brush, ink, paper, and inkstone.

775
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:00,630
I'll draw a drawing of the man,

776
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:02,040
so you guys can have a good look.

777
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:05,040
Madam Zhang, please prepare
the Four Treasures of the Study.

778
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:05,870
All right.

779
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,870
What attitude is this?

780
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:56,000
Now, behave yourselves.

781
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:57,870
This is a drawing

782
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:59,800
that is infused with the soul of the character.

783
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,710
Are you sure this is a drawing

784
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,190
and not a joke?

785
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,870
No, Deputy Chief, your eyes are...

786
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:08,320
are...

787
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:10,760
Your eyes are so pretty.

788
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,230
I admit that after getting out of
the Imperial College,

789
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,840
I'm indeed a bit full of myself.

790
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,950
But you cannot deny

791
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,870
that this is an irreplaceable piece of drawing.

792
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:24,870
Take a look here.

793
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:26,430
A perfect head shape

794
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:28,470
and his chic figure.

795
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:31,040
I totally captured the most vital

796
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,230
and recognizable parts

797
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,710
of this man.

798
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:36,000
Recognizable?

799
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,280
Don't you feel it?

800
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:41,230
Take a good look.

801
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:42,430
Look carefully.

802
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:45,150
Don't you feel...

803
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:49,710
Everyone, please pretend
that you never saw this today.

804
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:51,800
I can't let anyone know

805
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,950
that the student of the Imperial College

806
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,630
has such bad drawing skills.

807
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:00,600
Miss Qian Jiu,

808
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:01,950
sorry for bothering you today.

809
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,470
We will take our leave now.

810
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:05,870
You guys,

811
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,670
hurry and get up.

812
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,470
Oh, right! Miss Qian Jiu.

813
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,150
Are you sure that you really didn't see him before?

814
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:16,710
He's like this,

815
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:17,520
like this,

816
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:18,280
and holds a small knife.

817
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:21,840
Thank you.

818
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:30,560
You've even come here to collect information.

819
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:31,950
Didn't you think of

820
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:33,630
asking someone who can really help you?

821
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,470
Someone who can really help me?

822
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:37,630
Who is it?

823
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,630
Who is that resourceful?

824
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,470
Seemingly far away, but actually close at hand.

825
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:49,000
That's right.

826
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,390
The most powerful person
in the Imperial College.

827
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,630
Scholar Feng!

828
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,080
Of course!

829
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,520
Scholar Feng has lived longer than Yan Yan,

830
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,360
why did I even listen to you

831
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,190
to come to such a place?

832
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:00,080
Thank you so much, Deputy Chief.

833
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:01,600
You're right.

834
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,520
It's Scholar Feng.

835
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:07,760
Let's go! Let's go!

836
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:08,430
Qi.

837
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:10,520
Yan Yan,

838
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:12,230
you should walk Lian Pian home.

839
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,150
I'll walk Sang Qi back.

840
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:17,670
Aren't we going on the same way?

841
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,840
Besides, they're living together.

842
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,800
Madam Yan doesn't know

843
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,280
that you came here, right?

844
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,520
Miss Lian Pian, please follow me.

845
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:30,120
I will send you home safely.

846
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:30,710
Let's go.

847
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:31,560
I'll let you two chat.

848
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,670
Let's go. Let's go. Go.

849
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,150
Young Lady!

850
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:34,320
Let's go. Young Lady, I...

851
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
I'll send you home safely.

852
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,560
Let's go. Come on.

853
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,800
Why did you branch them off?

854
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,430
Do you mean it? About what you said just now.

855
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:42,910
Which one?

856
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:44,670
About Qian Jiu is my concubine.

857
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,670
I mean everything I said.

858
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,950
Do you really not care at all?

859
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,430
Zhuo Wen Yuan,

860
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:55,800
I was just kidding.

861
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,760
Then again, this is your private affair.

862
00:41:57,870 --> 00:41:59,430
I don't have any rights to comment on this.

863
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:03,150
Besides, you're not that feudal, right?

864
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:05,390
I think Miss Qian Jiu is a nice woman.

865
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,630
If you're willing to take her in,

866
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,230
it's also a blessing for the both of you.

867
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,040
That's enough! Let's go!

868
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:15,320
He doesn't understand
after I've explained for so long.

869
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,000
It's actually quite familiar.

870
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:31,000
Young Master,

871
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,000
it has been drawn like this

872
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:36,710
and you can still tell who the drawing is?

873
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:39,520
If my guessing is right,

874
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:41,600
then it really is a blessing to Sang Qi.

875
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,430
But if it's really him,

876
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:45,870
it'll be difficult to handle.

877
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:47,430
We need to think of something.

878
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:52,320
In my opinion, Young Master,

879
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,230
your love for Miss Sang is one-sided.

880
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:55,910
Even if you've done so much for her

881
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:57,120
she might not know anything.

882
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:03,670
I don't ask for that.

883
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,000
Today I went to probe Miss Qian Jiu,

884
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,600
this woman is either extremely skilled
in martial arts, shrewd and cunning,

885
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,710
or she's really just a commoner.

886
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:14,560
This matter still needs to be
investigated thoroughly.

887
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:18,630
But if Sang Qi sees her as a friend,

888
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:20,230
there is still a risk.

889
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:23,430
And also that Zhuo Wen Yuan.

890
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,120
He's obviously deeply in love with Sang Qi,

891
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:29,080
but he can still wander around in the brothels

892
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:31,470
in Sang Qi's presence.

893
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,040
You're right.

894
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,710
Do you understand what's the problem here?

895
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:35,560
Yes, I understand.

896
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:38,710
Also, deeply in love.

897
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:40,670
It sounds

898
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:41,710
a bit like jealousy.

899
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:43,080
Is this the main point I'm talking about?

900
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:46,040
Seems like you're doing well
in Sinology studies recently.

901
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,120
Young Master,

902
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:50,630
I've been following you to the Imperial College,

903
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,600
it's... it's normal to improve too.

904
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,600
In short, our top priority

905
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:00,190
is to ensure Sang Qi's safety.

906
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:02,520
We need to find a place to settle her down

907
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:05,230
and at the same time,
we need to train her in secret,

908
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:06,560
improve her martial arts skills.

909
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:10,080
If she encounters such a
problem again in the future,

910
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,670
she can still protect herself.
