that you're pretty ridiculous.

It isn't to liven things up,

that you won't play the game
of running without paying again.

should come out more.

168
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,910
Your precise plan about the tea plantation

169
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,840
had helped me solve my problem.

170
00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:00,670
If you want to be an imperial official,

171
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:04,440
I'll do my best to help you.

172
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,280
Grand Tutor, I shall thank you in advance.

173
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,350
Although Official Wei took the blame,

174
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:20,000
one can't keep secrets forever.

175
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,110
If Official Wei can't withstand
the harsh criticism,

176
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,280
the blame will shift back to me.

177
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,640
Also, it's not easy to deal with Yan Yun Zhi either.

178
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,320
If it weren't for him who discovered this problem,

179
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,840
the matters at the tea plantation
wouldn't be exposed.

180
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:42,400
I fear he won't let this matter rest.

181
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,470
If we can get rid of Official Wei,

182
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,320
there won't be any problems in the future.

183
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,840
Grand Tutor, rest assured. I'll take care of it.

184
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,270
(Imperial College)

185
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,970
(The wing blew along with elegant poetry)

186
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,230
There will be an imperial lecture
at Imperial College tomorrow.

187
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,600
(Song Qing Yun will give a lecture
at Imperial College tomorrow)

188
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,000
Grand Tutor Song will be the speaker tomorrow?

189
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,350
What gives Grand Tutor Song the right to do this?

190
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,200
How can he lecture on behalf of His Majesty?

191
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,280
Besides, it hasn't been long
since the tea plantation incident.

192
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,080
Aren't they taking this too lightly?

193
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,520
It shows that Grand Tutor Song
won the trust of His Majesty.

194
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,670
Besides, Grand Tutor

195
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,320
must have fought to speak in this lecture

196
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,470
to clear

197
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,840
everyone's prejudice against him.

198
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,000
In my opinion,

199
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,350
it's a cover-up.

200
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,230
He wants to push himself forward.

201
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,000
Whether he succeeds in his purpose

202
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:56,470
will depend on us.

203
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,840
What do you think about this?

204
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,640
(Aspiration)

205
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,200
- Nice!
- Great!

206
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:28,910
I understand.

207
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,440
We'll have everything arranged
before tomorrow's lecture.

208
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,440
Sang Qi, are you going to create trouble again?

209
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,230
It's no trivial matter.

210
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,760
Stop causing trouble already.

211
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,670
Let me tell you this in advance.

212
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,280
I'm not causing any trouble.

213
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,670
It's Grand Tutor Song who has bad luck.

214
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:52,840
- Exactly.
- She's right.

215
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,670
It's considered as heaven's will.

216
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,320
- Yes, it's heaven's will.
- Heaven's will.

217
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,840
Then, all of you must be careful

218
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,000
and don't ever let anyone have anything on you.

219
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,910
This is what a friend should say.

220
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,520
I'll repeat the things you need
to pay attention to.

221
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,200
Watch closely.

222
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,030
Yan Yan, you must be here

223
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,280
pulling onto this rope.

224
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:10,710
All right.

225
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,350
That way, Grand Tutor Song will not notice it.

226
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:12,910
Don't worry.

227
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:20,590
Since I've been appointed as an imperial official,

228
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,230
I've been doing my best to perform my duties.

229
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:30,080
I devote my entire life to serve my country.

230
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,350
It's to live up

231
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,910
to His Majesty's expectation of me.

232
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:55,200
I know some people

233
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,840
have been spreading rumors

234
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,080
deliberately to dishonor me recently.

235
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,550
All of you haven't seen much of the world yet.

236
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,590
So you're easily deluded

237
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,880
that you've misunderstood me.

238
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:11,520
I don't care anyway.

239
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:13,710
Look.

240
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,400
I'm sure you know this, right?

241
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:21,550
This tree is the famous "Evil-eradicating Cypress"

242
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,710
in the Imperial College.

243
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:29,110
It's said the fourth scorer of the imperial
examination once gave a lecture under this tree.

244
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,030
This cypress is spiritual.

245
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,840
It can distinguish between those
who are loyal and treacherous.

246
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,840
Only honest and loyal officials

247
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,440
can stand under this tree.

248
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,790
Do you understand?

249
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,230
Grand Tutor, watch out!

250
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,550
Grand Tutor, careful!

251
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,110
Grand Tutor, careful.

252
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,110
Assassins!

253
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:56,440
Careful.

254
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,320
Assassins!

255
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,080
Assassins! Catch the assassins!

256
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,150
- Hurry!
- Hurry!

257
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:03,790
Official,

258
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,880
there's a sign of this branch
being damaged on purpose.

259
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,000
I see.

260
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,910
This Imperial College
indeed harbors some talents.

261
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,710
You dare to plot against me!

262
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,550
If I don't get to the bottom of this,

263
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,030
I'll never let it go!

264
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,200
Is no one going to admit it?

265
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,150
Fine.

266
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,840
Don't blame me for not showing mercy!

267
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,200
Grand Tutor, calm down.

268
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,150
Deputy Chief.

269
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:48,840
Deputy Chief.

270
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,880
Deputy Chief, look...

271
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,960
Grand Tutor Song, I'm willing to take the blame.

272
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:08,230
Are you going to take full responsibility?

273
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,200
Grand Tutor, may you give the punishment.

274
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,550
Don't cover up for the students who did evil.

275
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,400
Grand Tutor, may you give the punishment.

276
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,350
You're certainly going to have a hard time.

277
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,710
It looks like the discipline
of the Imperial College is declining.

278
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:34,350
You show no respect to superiors and the law!

279
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,760
You even offended an imperial official.

280
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:43,280
I guess birds of a feather flock together.

281
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,470
You're to blame for this reason alone!

282
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,230
Do respect Deputy Chief!

283
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,760
Grand Tutor is humiliated.

284
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,710
It's only natural that he loses his temper.

285
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,350
Don't try to help Deputy Chief.

286
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,640
Reason does not lie in how loud a person is.

287
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:58,670
Just keep quiet.

288
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,960
Grand Tutor Song, a person should
be responsible for his action.

289
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,000
I'll take responsibility.

290
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:02,760
Quiet.

291
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:04,520
Go back.

292
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,640
I did it. It's not related to Deputy Chief.

293
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:14,470
- I did it. It's not related to Deputy Chief!
- I did it. It's not related to Deputy Chief!

294
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,710
- I did it. It's not related to Deputy Chief!
- I did it. It's not related to Deputy Chief!

295
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:20,640
- I did it. It's not related to Deputy Chief!
- I did it. It's not related to Deputy Chief!

296
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,680
- I did it. It's not related to Deputy Chief!
- I did it. It's not related to Deputy Chief!

297
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,640
How dare you? Are you rebelling?

298
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:32,350
Grand Tutor Song, I know who's the troublemaker.

299
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:34,520
Who?

300
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:39,560
After all, isn't it because of this tree?

301
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,680
Although His Majesty attested to it

302
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,590
that it's a sacred tree that specializes
in attacking treacherous officials,

303
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,590
there are times

304
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,070
this tree would make mistakes

305
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,350
and offended you, Grand Tutor Song.

306
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,760
We can simply chop down this tree

307
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,800
to appease Grand Tutor Song.

308
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,920
Am I right?

309
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,110
- Yes!
- All right!

310
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,880
Bring the tools!

311
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,280
- Let's go.
- Come on.

312
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,520
This... This... This...

313
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:01,920
You...

314
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,590
Here you go, Master Sang.

315
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,190
Let's go!

316
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:14,230
You... You...

317
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,560
Grand Tutor Song, how do you want us
to chop this tree down?

318
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,590
We can satisfy you.

319
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,230
If you're cold,

320
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,110
I can split it into firewood to keep you warm.

321
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,470
If you're tired,

322
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:30,000
we can chop it and make a bench,
chair or a wooden bed for you.

323
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,230
We can make anything that you want.

324
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,350
Anything you want.

325
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,800
If you're greedy...

326
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,190
That is all the better.

327
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,430
I'll pare it into toothpicks for you

328
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,760
and sprinkle my unique secret spices on it.

329
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,070
It tastes pretty good as you pick your tooth.

330
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:43,800
Make your choice.

331
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,000
You... All of you...

332
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,350
Outrageous!

333
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:47,920
Where are your manners?

334
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:01,920
Grand Tutor.

335
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,400
Grand Tutor should be the one who should do it.

336
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,070
Who are you to chop this tree?

337
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,000
Grand Tutor, if you may.

338
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:32,280
Outrageous.

339
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,190
Are you rebelling?

340
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,920
Are you trying to rebel now?

341
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,830
Are you trying to rebel?

342
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:39,590
You...

343
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,590
Your father wants his son to have a bright future.

344
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:41,590
So I'm giving you a chance.

345
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,310
Take it.

346
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,710
Song Luo Tian!

347
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,040
I... I...

348
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,800
You unfilial child!

349
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:51,830
What are you...

350
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,070
Listen up...

351
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:56,710
All right.

352
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:00,350
I'll report this farce

353
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,640
to His Majesty!

354
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,470
Just you wait!

355
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:05,560
Father!

356
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:06,880
Grand Tutor, calm down!

357
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,070
Father!

358
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,070
Grand Tutor, calm down!

359
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,680
Grand Tutor, calm down!

360
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:20,800
(Imperial College)

361
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,640
- Grand Tutor, calm down!
- Father!

362
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,640
Grand Tutor, calm down!

363
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,350
- Father!
- Grand Tutor! Grand Tutor!

364
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:28,590
Father!

365
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,160
Grand Tutor Song!

366
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:30,620
(Song)

367
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,110
Grand Tutor, calm down.

368
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,190
Father, I...

369
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,040
I'm going to the palace.

370
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,400
Why are you following me?

371
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,400
You unfilial child,

372
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,520
you've humiliated me.

373
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:45,590
Get lost!

374
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,110
I...

375
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:46,800
Get lost!

376
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:14,590
Deputy Chief.

377
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,750
(Aspiration)

378
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,920
Do everything according to the plan.

379
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,880
Deputy Chief, be careful with it.

380
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,470
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

381
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,420
(Report)

382
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,400
Greetings, Your Majesty.

383
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,000
The nerve you had, Yan Yun Zhi.

384
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,230
The imperial lecture was a mess.

385
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,920
There were so many petty tricks!

386
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,070
I was incompetent.

387
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,430
It's my fault that Grand Tutor was humiliated.

388
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,040
Isn't it just harassing Grand Tutor Song?

389
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,430
You can't even handle such a small matter.

390
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,280
He's driving me up the wall

391
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,350
with all his memorials all day long.

392
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,470
About the tea plantation,

393
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,920
I know the Song family is involved.

394
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,040
They took preemptive measures
and sold the Wei family out.

395
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,040
That's why Yan San Lang wasted his effort.

396
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,830
Yan Yun Zhi, I now remove you from
the position of Deputy Chief.

397
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:32,560
First, I need

398
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,430
to appease Grand Tutor Song's anger.

399
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,710
Secondly, without the position of Deputy Chief,

400
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,040
you can fully devote yourself

401
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,310
to investigating the Song family.

402
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:39,880
Your Majesty is indeed wise.

403
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,920
I shall not let Your Majesty down.

404
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,230
Remember. It's unpleasant to say this,

405
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,710
but we're carrying out a mission in the dark.

406
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,880
You must be careful.

407
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:54,350
Be sure not to get caught
by Grand Tutor Song again.

408
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,070
Yes, Your Majesty.

409
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,470
About yesterday's incident,

410
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:01,310
Grand Tutor Song will not let it go easily.

411
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,640
I don't know

412
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,110
what's going to happen to Imperial College now.

413
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:09,000
It doesn't matter.

414
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,950
The Song family abuses their power
by oppressing people.

415
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,110
We'll act accordingly.

416
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:18,040
Why are you so confident today?

417
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,400
Something bad had happened!

418
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:20,800
- What's wrong?
- What happened?

419
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,040
Why are you so anxious?

420
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,000
Deputy Chief is gone!

421
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,470
- What?
- Deputy Chief is gone?

422
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,070
Is Deputy Chief gone again?

423
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,040
With Grand Tutor Song's strong demand,

424
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:34,880
His Majesty removed Deputy Chief Yan
from his position yesterday!

425
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:37,310
- Let's go now.
- Hurry.

426
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:38,920
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

427
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,280
- Come on.
- Hurry!

428
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,190
- Hurry.
- Let's go.

429
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:46,280
Hurry!

430
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,040
- Hurry up!
- Quickly!

431
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,190
Come on, let's go!

432
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,470
(Grand Hall)

433
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,400
- Deputy Chief!
- Deputy Chief!

434
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:51,880
Don't go!

435
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,400
- Deputy Chief!
- Deputy Chief!

436
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,430
- Don't go, Deputy Chief!
- Deputy Chief!

437
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:57,430
What are you doing?

438
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,280
- Deputy Chief.
- Where's Deputy Chief?

439
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:58,950
Where's Deputy Chief?

440
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:02,160
Where are your manners?
What's with all these yellings?

441
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,350
After the trouble you caused yesterday,

442
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,470
are you not going to hold yourselves back today?

443
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,000
Is Yan Yun Zhi really not going to teach
at Imperial College anymore?

444
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,590
That's the arrangement for the time being.

445
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,070
After this, I'll be taking over.

446
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:14,920
His Majesty

447
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,560
takes Grand Tutor Song's feelings seriously.

448
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,350
Why don't we head to Grand Tutor's Residence

449
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,640
to seek justice for Deputy Chief?

450
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:22,950
I won't believe

451
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,800
that they'll do anything to so many of us!

452
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:25,950
Am I right?

453
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,190
- Yes! Seek justice!
- You're right!

454
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:27,710
You...

455
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,680
We'll get hurt if we're determined to go all out.

456
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,280
What are you saying?

457
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,430
I mean, we can overcome difficulties if we unite.

458
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:34,430
- That's right.
- Right.

459
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:35,880
Stop causing trouble.

460
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,470
I...

461
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,920
- Scholar Feng!
- Scholar Feng!

462
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,830
I've let all of you down!

463
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,710
Look at how you've upset Scholar Feng.

464
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,070
He's already close to death.

465
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,070
Deputy Chief.

466
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,710
- Deputy Chief.
- Deputy Chief.

467
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:59,590
Yun Zhi, you're finally here.

468
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,350
These students are so disobedient.

469
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,400
I can't manage them at all!

470
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,640
I came back to get some books.

471
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:10,310
When you behaved disrespectfully
towards Grand Tutor Song yesterday,

472
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,310
didn't you think of the consequences today?

473
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,520
From now on,

474
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,190
you must heed Scholar Feng's teachings,

475
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,560
and behave yourself, understand?

476
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,350
- Yes.
- Yes.

477
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:29,830
Lian Pian.

478
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:30,350
Young Lady.

479
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,920
Prepare the carriage.
We're going to Yan Residence.

480
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,110
Is there something in your eye?

481
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,280
No.

482
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,230
Father.

483
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,350
You must be hungry.

484
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,520
Let's eat.

485
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:51,640
Do you want to eat?

486
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,760
Go to Yan Residence then.

487
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,110
Okay.

488
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,190
Stop right there.

489
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:01,160
Father, without Deputy Chief Yan

490
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,520
at the Imperial College,

491
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,400
I have many questions that need answers.

492
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,470
You better don't get any wrong idea.

493
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,830
It's for my studies.

494
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,000
You're so hardworking.

495
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:09,400
Are you trying to be the top scholar?

496
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,950
Do you think I don't know what you did

497
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:13,560
to Grand Tutor Song at Imperial College?

498
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:15,880
The incident has become a laughingstock

499
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,190
among the imperial officials.

500
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,280
If I knew you'd cause such trouble,

501
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,830
I wouldn't have allowed you to study
at Imperial College.

502
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,800
From today on,

503
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:26,710
no guests are allowed to visit at night,

504
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,350
and you're not allowed to go out.

505
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:30,920
Close the doors.

506
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:31,640
- Yes.
- Yes.

507
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,640
Father!

508
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:52,560
Lian Pian.

509
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:56,070
When the light in my father's room goes out later,

510
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:56,680
we'll...

511
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,880
We'll climb over the wall from the backyard.

512
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:03,310
Young Lady, forget about me.

513
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,920
Master is already familiar
with this trick of yours.

514
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,350
Stepping on his back to leave
is the only thing left to do.

515
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,560
Lian Pian,

516
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,710
it would be great if your brain

517
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:13,000
works half as fast as your mouth.

518
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:23,470
Why are you here?

519
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:26,950
Mr. Zhuo, how did you get in here?

520
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:28,350
You can chase anyone out,

521
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,950
but your Young Lady's husband, right?

522
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:31,920
Stop talking nonsense.

523
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,880
What are you doing here?

524
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,160
I'll take you out to relieve boredom.

525
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:37,830
- Let's go.
- Go.

526
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:38,400
Come.

527
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,680
Young Lady. Young Lady!

528
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:43,640
Wait...

529
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,400
(Qingfeng Restaurant. Shuiyue Shop)

530
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:51,070
What do you think Deputy Chief

531
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,710
is like after being dismissed from his post?

532
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:54,880
If you ask me,

533
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:57,110
he may appear expressionless,

534
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,920
but he could be emotional

535
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:02,190
and crying at Chancellor Yan's leg.

536
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,430
I don't think so.

537
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,310
He might be thinking
of some awesome tricks at home.

538
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:06,950
Think

539
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,230
about what he did to us in the past.

540
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:09,760
Do you think a tricky man

541
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,040
like him would stay at home doing nothing?

542
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:18,230
What do you think Deputy Chief would look like

543
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,070
when he rubs his feet at home?

544
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,800
How would he rub his feet?

545
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,800
Would he do this

546
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:24,470
or this?

547
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:26,280
He rubs them like this!

548
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:28,520
Master Sang, you're just in time.

549
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,230
Zhuo.

550
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:33,040
Why don't we visit Deputy Chief at Yan Residence?

551
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,190
Calm down.

552
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:45,470
You must learn how to calm down at this age.

553
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:50,880
Although the dismissal of his position

554
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,920
is not a small matter,

555
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,950
is Yan Yun Zhi someone

556
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,430
who worries about gains and losses?

557
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:57,430
He is not.

558
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,520
He might be enjoying his quiet time

559
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,190
and doesn't want us to bother him, right?

560
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,000
You usually draw Deputy Chief's attention.

561
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,560
Why are you suddenly

562
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:11,760
being indifferent to his situation now?

563
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:13,070
No, I...

564
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,520
That's right.

565
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,280
Master Sang, shouldn't you be the most anxious one?

566
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,830
I... I'm like the rest of you.

567
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:26,000
I was guessing.

568
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,920
I think Deputy Chief

569
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,710
is just like that.

570
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:32,040
If we rush over to his place,

571
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,230
what if Deputy Chief isn't happy about it?

572
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,070
All of you know very well

573
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:36,520
that Deputy Chief Yan is unpredictable.

574
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,310
It's hard to guess at all.

575
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:40,350
I don't want our good intentions
to cause any trouble.

576
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:40,800
Am I right?

577
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,920
If you insist on going,

578
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,280
I can go along.

579
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Then, let's...

580
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:53,560
- Go!
- Go!

581
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:54,560
Let's go.

582
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,000
I really want to see

583
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,040
how Deputy Chief rubs his feet.

584
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,280
Let's go.

585
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:02,680
(There goes another problem.)

586
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,520
(It's going to be inconvenient if it gets
in the way of the Deputy Chief's investigation.)

587
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:09,900
(Qingfeng Restaurant)

588
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,710
Do you think Deputy Chief went to the mountain

589
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,040
to see Master for consolation?

590
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:18,920
Listen,

591
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:20,640
if you dare go to the mountain to see Master,

592
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,710
he'll punish you by asking you to do
stake exercise until the chicken crows.

593
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,190
Forget about it then.

594
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,040
I think that's enough for today.

595
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,110
While we exhaust ourselves looking
for Deputy Chief,

596
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:33,880
he could be...

597
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,880
(Shangshui Bathhouse)
He could be getting a rubdown at the bathhouse.

598
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,560
Am I right?

599
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:38,310
Let's go back.

600
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:39,830
Come on, let's go back.

601
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:40,400
(Shangshui Bathhouse)
Let's go.

602
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,020
(Shangshui Bathhouse)

603
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,800
That's right! We haven't searched the bathhouse.

604
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:49,280
Master Sang, it's inconvenient
for a lady to enter this place.

605
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:51,430
But I've been here before.

606
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,110
I'll go.

607
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:52,680
Wait, Yan Yan.

608
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,470
Yan Yan!

609
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,110
It's called...

610
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:54,760
Trust me.

611
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,040
You came up with anything
because you're desperate.

612
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:56,520
(Shangshui Bathhouse)
Trust me.

613
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,190
Why would Deputy Chief be in the bathhouse?

614
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,350
You're unbelievable.

615
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:03,040
Think about it. Is it impossible?

616
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,590
Stop...

617
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,190
Why are you looking for me?

618
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:17,470
What an indecent man.

619
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:18,830
(Juyaxuan Tea house. Shangshui Bathhouse)

620
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:19,800
What did you say?

621
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:22,350
It hasn't been long since I left Imperial College.

622
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,000
But you already started to call me that.

623
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:27,830
Deputy Chief, turns out you are here.

624
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,800
Stop calling me Deputy Chief.

625
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,470
Just call me by my name.

626
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,160
Yan...

627
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:37,760
Deputy...

628
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,560
Yan... Yan,

629
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:43,640
they've been looking for you for a long time.

630
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:46,400
It's his fault

631
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:47,920
for dragging me around for a stroll.

632
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:51,070
I only wanted to relieve your boredom.

633
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:53,920
He came to my side house

634
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:56,560
to play guqin and paint.

635
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:00,400
He ended up finishing all my wine.

636
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,920
I brought him here to sober up.

637
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:05,680
I tried dragging him inside,
but he refused to enter.

638
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,230
Oh, come on.

639
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:06,470
I...

640
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,710
One can only give up being a gentleman
if he wants the rubdown.

641
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,470
Yan Yan, you know it.

642
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:14,800
Then, pay me for the wine.

643
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:15,710
I do.

644
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,110
I can drink with you,

645
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:19,110
but I won't pay you back for the wine.

646
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,110
Catch it.

647
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:29,640
From today on, we're best friends.

648
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:33,280
We'll have fun and drink wine together.

649
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,830
We won't be asking Qing Xuan to join.

650
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,110
To be honest,

651
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:42,950
I'm tired of being your Deputy Chief.

652
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,920
Seeing students like you...

653
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,430
I finally escaped from this suffering,

654
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:49,560
and I'm no longer your Deputy Chief.

655
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,880
In the future, we'll have ample time

656
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,520
to come out for fun and drink wine.

657
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,590
But we can't bring you along, Sang Qi.

658
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,000
It's okay.

659
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,520
From now on, you can hang out with me.

660
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,350
Stop standing there. Let's drink.

661
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:08,710
Let's drink.

662
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,310
All of you...

663
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,800
Now, you've seen him, right?

664
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:13,190
The Deputy Chief...

665
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,870
I mean the former Deputy Chief
is doing better than all of us.

666
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:19,870
Let's go back to our homes.

667
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,280
Aren't you guys...

668
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:31,520
Yan,

669
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,760
instead of choosing other days,

670
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,320
and now that we're friends,

671
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:38,040
why don't we continue having fun together?

672
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:38,670
Let's go.

673
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,150
Do you find the homework is not given enough?

674
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,120
Wait a minute...

675
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:02,520
Was I taken for a ride?

676
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,390
Is anyone here?

677
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,870
(Stable and Prosperous)

678
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,230
Someone!

679
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,430
Bring out all the wine!

680
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,230
What's going on?

681
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,470
You reeked of alcohol.

682
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,230
It's nothing but a position of Deputy Chief
of the Imperial College.

683
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:23,800
Do you have to lose yourself
over losing this position?

684
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,360
Bai Shi, bring the wine.

685
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,430
Bring the wine for me.

686
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,560
If you don't bring the wine here,

687
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,760
you're going to...

688
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,040
Bai Shi, bring the wine.

689
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:37,760
Hurry!

690
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,280
Qi Lang, overcome your shortcomings
and be respectful.

691
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,600
You'll ruin the Yan family's reputation
if you go on like this.

692
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,360
Behave yourself!

693
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,230
Stop drinking already.

694
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,040
No, stop drinking.

695
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,600
You used an empty jar to make a fool out of me.

696
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,230
Enough already.

697
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,040
Let's go, Bai Shi.

698
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,080
Go to my room and bring out the wine!

699
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,390
(Stable and Prosperous)

700
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:58,760
Qi Lang!

701
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,120
Let's drink!

702
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,280
Young Master, according to the informant,

703
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:13,760
the troop escorting Official Wei this time

704
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,710
has already left Bianjing.

705
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:16,600
You can rest assured

706
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,600
that Official Yan has sent people to protect him.

707
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,800
Keep an eye on them at all times.

708
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:23,040
It's the map that Official Yan
asked me to give you.

709
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,560
(Bianjing. Sizhou)
It's the route taken for the exile.

710
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,620
(Hongzhou. Jingzhou)

711
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:28,630
Jingzhou?

712
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,190
Bai Shi.

713
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:30,910
Yes, Young Master.

714
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,670
Deliver a message to Qing Xuan for me.

715
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:36,670
Tell him that I want to invite him
to have fun out of town

716
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,080
and let him prepare to pick me up from the residence.

717
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:40,840
Yes, Young Master.

718
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,350
(Jianshan Pavilion)

719
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:51,870
Miss Su.

720
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,670
Bai Shi, what is your purpose here?

721
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,470
Is Qing Xuan home?

722
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,040
He's already resting.

723
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,670
You can tell me if there's anything.

724
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,280
Well, Miss Su.

725
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:03,280
My Young Master is inviting him
to go sightseeing out of town.

726
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,150
He wanted to ask Qing Xuan to pick him up in person

727
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,470
from the residence.

728
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,710
All right, I understand.

729
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,630
Thank you for that, Miss Su.

730
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,870
(Xinglong Sundry Shop)

731
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:25,760
Deputy Chief Yan is no longer
at the Imperial College.

732
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,150
But I don't see your homework getting lesser.

733
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,190
After Yan Yun Zhi left,

734
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:32,080
there is still Scholar Feng.
Have you forgotten about him?

735
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,120
After Scholar Feng started
managing Imperial College,

736
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,520
things have become stricter.

737
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,670
We study all day and write all night.

738
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,910
You can say that I study really hard,

739
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:40,870
unlike Yan Yan,

740
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,840
who can sleep in any class. My gosh.

741
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:44,840
Yan Yan?

742
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,670
(Wine)
He's a carefree person

743
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,190
to treat the Imperial College like his home.

744
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,080
He can sleep anywhere he wants.

745
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:55,950
What is this called again?

746
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:59,600
Something about in the eye of the beholder.

747
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,710
Young Lady, stop talking nonsense.

748
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,360
It's "beauty"!

749
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:05,560
I'm sorry.

750
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,390
I'm sorry. Hold this for me. I'm so sorry.

751
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,870
I'm so sorry.

752
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:11,430
It's all right.

753
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:11,840
Wen Yuan?

754
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,950
Greetings, Miss Sang Qi.

755
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:13,670
Let's go.

756
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:16,630
Lan.

757
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,760
Qi, it's been a while.

758
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,760
It's been a while.

759
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,560
Lan, you're preparing so many things.

760
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,560
Are you going back to the villa for some time?

761
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:30,390
No, are you rushing me to go back?

762
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,800
I was only kidding.

763
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,800
Don't take it seriously.

764
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,280
Yun Zhi invited me to go sightseeing
out of town tomorrow.

765
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:42,080
I'm out here to prepare some
of his favorite snacks.

766
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,280
(Out of town? Don't tell me...)

767
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:50,710
It's been a while
since I last saw Deputy Chief Yan.

768
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,910
How is he doing lately?

769
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:55,600
He's quite comfortable at home,

770
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,710
but the elders are anxious.

771
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,280
But I think

772
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,000
it's good for him to rest for a while.

773
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,390
Before this,

774
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:04,150
he was so busy with his work
at the Imperial College.

775
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:08,040
I rarely have time to be alone with him.

776
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,910
(Looks like Lan knows nothing.)

777
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:16,000
This is great.

778
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,470
Since he has the mood to go sightseeing,

779
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:20,840
it means he's not upset about being dismissed.

780
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,670
That's good to hear.

781
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:25,870
I haven't finished my errand.

782
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,600
I'll invite you to come over
to the residence some other day.

783
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:41,040
Someone must be jealous.

784
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:42,520
Don't talk nonsense.

785
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,910
It isn't the time to think
about this small matter.

786
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:15,670
Come in.

787
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,910
Mr. Zhuo. Miss.

788
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,760
Official Wei has been escorted out
of the Bianjing border.

789
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,760
It's said

790
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:30,910
many people were watching along the way.

791
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:34,190
I fear we won't get a chance at Official Wei.

792
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,670
It doesn't matter.

793
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:39,000
We have more people in Jingzhou.

794
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,120
Things will be under control.

795
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,520
Qian Jiu, go to change

796
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,670
and prepare to take the hostage.

797
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:47,870
