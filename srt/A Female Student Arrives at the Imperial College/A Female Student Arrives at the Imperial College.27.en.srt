(Muyan Pavilion)
Qi,

29
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,550
what are you...

30
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,910
I'm making pastries for my father.

31
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:43,760
So he can have freshly made pastries

32
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,440
when he comes back later.

33
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,040
In that case,

34
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,080
I should do my part too.

35
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,120
Let me help you.

36
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,590
Do you know how to make pastries?

37
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,310
I don't,

38
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,230
but I can learn.

39
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,440
Young Lady,

40
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,310
I'll check on the stove in the kitchen.

41
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,000
Wash your hands first.

42
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:06,910
I'll let you knead the dough.

43
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,510
Kneading the dough is the hardest part.

44
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:09,310
All right.

45
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,800
I saw someone do it before.

46
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,470
I think this is how I should do it.

47
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,110
That's not right.

48
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:18,630
I'll show you.

49
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,390
Watch closely.

50
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,910
Fold the dough backward and push it forward.

51
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,520
Repeat the same process.

52
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,190
Knead until you reach the end and flip it over.

53
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,550
Then...

54
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,160
Like this?

55
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,600
Right?

56
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,360
Deputy Chief,

57
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,000
don't you think this is indecent?

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,830
Not at all.

59
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,670
I hope our days will be like this

60
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,000
in the future.

61
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,240
As a couple, doing things together

62
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,360
and getting along happily.

63
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,800
Won't that be nice?

64
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,390
But...

65
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,630
Qi,

66
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,830
I'll figure something out
about the marriage bestowal.

67
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,720
Today,

68
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,240
let's wait for your father's return happily.

69
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Don't let anything upset you.

70
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,320
I think I'm getting the hang of it.

71
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,470
No, you don't.

72
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,110
You have to knead it like this.

73
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,080
Master Sang!

74
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,360
Master Sang!

75
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,080
Deputy Chief, you're here too.

76
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,360
Yan Yan, what brings you here?

77
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,270
How are your parents?

78
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,550
The case is closed.

79
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,550
They've already returned home.

80
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,390
Why aren't you keeping them company at home?

81
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,270
My father said

82
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,670
Grand Commandant was framed for speaking up

83
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:43,830
for the Yan family.

84
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,600
He wanted to visit personally.

85
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,670
But he was not well, so he asked me to come.

86
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,470
Where's Grand Commandant?

87
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,910
Later,

88
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,910
Yan San Lang will send him back.

89
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,550
I'll leave after he has returned.

90
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,800
My father especially instructed me

91
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,670
to thank him in person.

92
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,030
Just now, you two were...

93
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,520
Just now,

94
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,440
I was teaching Deputy Chief how to make pastries.

95
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,720
Making pastries is a bit complicated,

96
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,240
so I had to teach him by hand.

97
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,160
Yes, exactly.

98
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,800
It turns out you want to please
Grand Commandant Sang too.

99
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,750
Doesn't that mean

100
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,270
I should be doing something as well?

101
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,510
Where's Lian Pian?

102
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,640
In the kitchen.

103
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,950
I'll help out in the kitchen.

104
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,000
I'll head to the kitchen.

105
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,200
You can continue.

106
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,000
Please continue.

107
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,920
Smell this.

108
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,200
It smells delicious.

109
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:36,790
Qi Lang!

110
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:39,720
Grand Commandant Sang!

111
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:40,670
Father!

112
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:42,270
Father!

113
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,720
Father.

114
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,640
Father,

115
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:46,830
look at you.

116
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:47,720
You've lost weight.

117
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,830
I don't think so.

118
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,510
Your beard has grown white

119
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,880
and your belly is already flat.

120
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,000
Stop it.

121
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,230
Official Yan told me

122
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,600
that you had been busy with my case

123
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,790
during these times

124
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,040
and you even sought justice for Yu.

125
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,110
Thank you.

126
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,350
Grand Commandant Sang, please don't say that.

127
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,070
It's the least I could do.

128
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm overwhelmed by your praise.

129
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,160
What are you doing?

130
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,390
Why did you hit him?

131
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,720
I wasn't just being nice and polite.

132
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,230
I appreciate his effort
from the bottom of my heart.

133
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:26,320
Allow me to thank you for your gratitude,
Grand Commandant Sang.

134
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,110
It's exhausting speaking to you people.

135
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,950
I'm going to rest in my room.

136
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,920
Drink with me later.

137
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,480
Sure.

138
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,160
Official Yan, join us.

139
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,790
I want to thank you too.

140
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,200
I still have official duty to attend to.

141
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,830
I'll visit some other day.

142
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,550
I'll send Official Yan off.

143
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,760
Go on.

144
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,440
Come here.

145
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,550
Let me see.

146
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,510
Father!

(Grand Commandant's Residence)

San Lang.

149
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,480
(Grand Commandant's Residence)

150
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,600
Qi was around,

151
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,920
so it wasn't convenient to bring it up.

152
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,110
Do you mean Zhuo Wen Yuan?

153
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,230
What happened to Xizhao and Qian Jiu

154
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,070
shows that this man is meticulous and vicious.

155
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,510
He'll never let this matter rest.

156
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,950
There will be another storm.

157
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,070
I'll continue with the investigation.

158
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,200
I think the same too.

159
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,760
I will keep an eye on him

160
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,790
and investigate secretly.

161
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,230
Only you and I know of this matter.

162
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,320
We must never let Qi find out about this.

163
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,110
Let me know if you have any clues.

164
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,550
I'll join you in your operation.

165
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,230
All right.

166
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,390
I'll make the preparations now.

167
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,440
Qi Lang, I'll be leaving then.

168
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,920
Today is a family feast.

169
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,390
There are no outsiders here.

170
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,440
No need to restrain yourself.

171
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,640
When I was not around,

172
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,550
it must be hard on you all.

173
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,440
Congratulations

174
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,320
on your safe return, Grand Commandant Sang.

175
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,640
Here's to you.

176
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:03,790
What kind of liquor is this?

177
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,550
It's so bitter.

178
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,040
It's the liquor Master brought back
from the frontier fortress.

179
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,760
We couldn't bring ourselves to drink it.

180
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,790
Why?

181
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,830
Can't you get accustomed to
having Sang family's liquor?

182
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:13,760
Yes. I can get accustomed to it.

183
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:18,920
I can get used to this.

184
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,160
Grand Commandant Sang,

185
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,440
I'd like to toast to you again.

186
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:26,550
Here.

187
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,480
All right.

188
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,320
Let's start eating.

189
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,390
Here, eat this.

190
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,640
Have this too.

191
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,950
Eat more.

192
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,200
Look how skinny you've gotten.

193
00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,720
Sit.

194
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,600
The extermination of Xizhao

195
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,270
put an end to one thing that bothered me.

196
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,720
Even if the Prefecture Court
hadn't made their move,

197
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,880
I'd have to get rid of them sooner or later.

198
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,070
But I heard

199
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:18,320
that Prefecture Court wants to dig deeper
into Xizhao's case.

200
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:19,670
Aunt, rest assured.

201
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,230
I've already taken care of it.

202
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,320
They have no evidence,

203
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,440
so they won't be able to dig up anything.

204
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,830
You're getting more and more reliable now.

205
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,000
By the way,

206
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,390
I heard His Majesty had released Sang Wei

207
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:36,950
and reinstated his position.

208
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,400
How are you going to deal with this?

209
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,200
Aunt, don't worry.

210
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,590
The show must go on.

211
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,200
(Imperial College)

212
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,120
(Appoint People by Abilities)

213
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,200
From today on,

214
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,200
Deputy Chief, Manager Sang,

215
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,550
and I

216
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,910
are preparing to recruit students.

217
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,280
The students of the last cohort
achieved outstanding results.

218
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,710
The response was good.

219
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,960
In Bianjing,
many youths of the age to start studying

220
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,080
want to study at the Imperial College.

221
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,710
I've sent the new enrollment regulations prepared
by the Deputy Chief

222
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,590
to the Ministry of Personnel for review.

223
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,670
I'm sure

224
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,350
we'll have a reply soon.

225
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,110
From now on,

226
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,230
Imperial College will accept students

227
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,030
regardless of their status, backgrounds

228
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,280
and gender.

229
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,670
As long as they want to study,

230
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,280
anyone can enroll in the Imperial College.

231
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,960
That's right.

232
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,470
There will also be a female class.

233
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,880
The curriculum will be the same as other classes',

234
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,440
and there will be regular assessments too.

235
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,640
The results of the assessment

236
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,000
will be published together
with the other students.

237
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,400
This method

238
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,350
can also

239
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,150
encourage students to study.

240
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,110
Deputy Chief.

241
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,400
Deputy Chief, Scholar Feng,

242
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,670
the official from the Ministry of Personnel
has arrived.

243
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,000
That was quick.

244
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,910
Is it that
the new regulations have been approved?

245
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:14,790
Wen Yuan,

246
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,840
are you here to give us the good news?

247
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,910
You don't come to visit me at all.

248
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,590
Scholar Huo,

249
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm on official duty.

250
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,520
We'll reminisce some other day.

251
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:27,960
All right.

252
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:33,760
After discussion, the Ministry of Personnel
found the new regulations of the Imperial College

253
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,640
to be inappropriate.

254
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,400
The enrollment of students

255
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,960
should be based on quality instead of numbers.

256
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,520
There are many talented young people

257
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,550
among the sons of officials in Bianjing.

258
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:48,280
It's unnecessary to recruit so many students.

259
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,030
As for the admission of female students,

260
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,590
it's even more unruly.

261
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,400
In short,

262
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,520
the new regulations are whimsical.

263
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,200
I hope all of you here will draft a new one.

264
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,400
Zhuo Wen Yuan,

265
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,710
you're doing this to spite me.

266
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,520
I'm only responsible
for relaying the ministry's decision.

267
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,440
If there's any objection,

268
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,710
you're welcome to appeal
to the Ministry of Personnel.

269
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:17,550
That's all.

270
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:25,590
It looks like

271
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,710
it's hard to get approval

272
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,470
from the Ministry of Personnel.

273
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,280
We need to think it over.

274
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,590
What now?

275
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,000
Zhuo Wen Yuan is unbelievable.

276
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,200
He starts dictating once he has power.

277
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,760
He's clearly doing this
to make things difficult for us.

278
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,440
Now isn't the time to be upset because of him.

279
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,150
What we have to do is to draw up

280
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,710
more convincing new regulations
as soon as possible

281
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,470
so the rest of the officials of the ministry
can change their minds.

282
00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,640
You're right.

283
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,760
Even if Zhuo Wen Yuan's doing great
at the Ministry of Personnel,

284
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,400
but he can't control everything, right?

285
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,790
As the saying goes,
enough sincerity can move mountains.

286
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,200
I don't believe I won't be able to convince

287
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,280
those officials at the Ministry of Personnel.

288
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:12,320
Qi,

289
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,520
go back to the archive first.

290
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,670
Let me find a way to deal with this.

291
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,760
Don't overwork yourself, then.

292
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,080
I won't.

293
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,080
Qi Lang.

294
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,910
San Lang, did you find anything?

295
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,520
I received a tip-off

296
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:40,440
that Zhuo Wen Yuan

297
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,760
will be meeting an important person
outside the city tonight.

298
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,470
To keep the operation a secret,

299
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:46,110
I'll only take a few trusted people
with me tonight.

300
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:46,960
I hope

301
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,520
we can find his weakness this time.

302
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:49,710
Zhuo Wen Yuan is cunning.

303
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,280
In case of any accidents,

304
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,910
I'll go along with you tonight.

305
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:53,760
All right.

306
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,570
(Grand Hall)

307
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,400
Deputy Chief,

308
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,760
why didn't you have lunch?

309
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,150
Qi.

310
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,400
I had my lunch already.

311
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,280
Bai Shi sent it to me.

312
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,320
When did you get into the habit of eating alone?

313
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,960
I was worried all the time that you skipped a meal.

314
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,080
All right.

315
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,000
I'll buy you lunch tomorrow

316
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:21,760
to make up for you.

317
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,200
Really?

318
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,400
I'll choose the restaurant, then.

319
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:24,880
Okay.

320
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:25,840
By the way,

321
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:29,000
we have to hurry with the new regulations.

322
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,150
I need you to sort out the ancient records
of the achievements

323
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,110
of the students of humble backgrounds and female students this afternoon.

324
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,320
With these ancient records,

325
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,110
I'll do my best to convince
the Ministry of Personnel.

326
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,910
Do I have to copy the ancient records?

327
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:41,440
Time is pressing.

328
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,110
It's best if you submit it to me tomorrow morning.

329
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,470
I never expected that I would still need
to copy ancient records

330
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,710
after I became a manager.

331
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,520
But don't worry.

332
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,200
For you,

333
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,590
I'll submit it to you tomorrow morning.

334
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,150
I'll be counting on you, Manager Sang.

335
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,000
I'll get going if there's nothing else.

336
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:56,520
Go.

337
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,470
Qi!

338
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:14,760
What is it?

339
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:18,910
For tonight's family dinner,

340
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,400
my parents will definitely rush me
about the bestowal marriage.

341
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:22,960
It's annoying.

342
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,910
Why don't...

343
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,790
Why don't you hide at my residence?

344
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:33,400
My father has been in poor health lately.

345
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,350
I should not upset him.

346
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,790
Then, talk with them nicely

347
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,880
and don't argue with them.

348
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:41,910
Okay.

349
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,400
I'll get back to work, then.

350
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,550
All right.

351
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:18,640
San Lang,

352
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,470
are you sure of this information?

353
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,640
I believe so.

354
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,590
Didn't you speculate

355
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,230
that there was another mastermind behind Xizhao?

356
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,840
My informant

357
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,670
told me clearly

358
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,590
that he has important evidence
regarding the mastermind.

359
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,150
Is this informant trustworthy?

360
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,000
He may not be a decent person.

361
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,470
Just a ruffian.

362
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,230
But

363
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,110
he's really well-informed.

364
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,400
He helped me out a lot in the past.

365
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,230
Halt.

366
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:44,520
San Lang,

367
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,030
this could be a trap.

368
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,640
I was suspicious of Sang Yu's death.

369
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,400
I've been investigating this matter for years

370
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,590
and received much help
from the Prefecture Court.

371
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,710
I can proudly say that in Bianjing,

372
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,280
no one knows Xizhao better than I do.

373
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:01,910
But even so, I was only guessing

374
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,640
that there was someone else behind Xizhao.

375
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:04,790
But your informant

376
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,640
was too certain about it.

377
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,200
I fear...

378
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,200
Who's there?

379
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:38,800
San Lang!

380
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:41,110
San Lang!

381
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:42,680
Watch out!

382
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,800
Copying the records really exhausted me.

383
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:33,350
Young Lady,

384
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,830
you just finished investigating the case,

385
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,760
and you're busy
with matters at the Imperial College already.

386
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:37,880
Can't you rest for a few days?

387
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,950
You're not invincible, you know?

388
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,430
You should rest after you've finished eating.

389
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,110
I'm so tired!

390
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,560
Anything good for supper?

391
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,640
Yan Yan,

392
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,640
what are you doing here

393
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,880
instead of going home for dinner?

394
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,640
By the way,

395
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:53,590
didn't you say

396
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,560
you'd accompany your parents?

397
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,830
My mother said Lian Pian had spoiled me with food.

398
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,640
The food at home no longer looks appetizing to me.

399
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,000
So she told me to have dinner here.

400
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,800
My mother even said
the pastries you made were delicious.

401
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,280
Really?

402
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:08,110
Did you send pastries to Madam Yan?

403
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,110
I made too many when Master came home that day.

404
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,760
So I let Yan Yan bring some home.

405
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,880
Not bad, Lian Pian.

406
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,430
I should learn to do that.

407
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,640
Why did you come back so late today?

408
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,280
It's all Song Luo Tian's fault.

409
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,230
He's always late for his shift and leaves early

410
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,760
so I miss the time for meals.

411
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:30,830
By the way,

412
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,760
I saw Deputy Chief left the city just now.

413
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,350
Official Yan brought some men along too.

414
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,230
Is there an operation?

415
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,280
Deputy Chief left the city?

416
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,680
Are you sure it was him?

417
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:42,680
Yes.

418
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,310
Didn't you know?

419
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,190
I was wondering why he was behaving oddly today.

420
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,830
Don't tell me...

421
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:53,710
Yan Yan, follow me.

422
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,160
We'll be back soon.

423
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,950
(Qingxin Hall)

424
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,880
(We just received the news.)

425
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,070
(Our men found Official Yan still breathing)

426
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,000
(at the city's outskirts.)

427
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,800
(But he's severely poisoned.)

428
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,110
(Deputy Chief's whereabouts)

429
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,800
(is unknown.)

430
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,040
Careful!

431
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,400
Did Deputy Chief really fall from here?

432
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,470
That's what the soldiers at the scene said.

433
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:47,590
What about Yan San Lang?

434
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,190
He's still unconscious.

435
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,160
Let's search for him down there.

436
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:55,680
Go!

437
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,310
Keep searching!

438
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,070
Yes, sir!

439
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,680
Deputy Chief Yan!

440
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,400
Deputy Chief!

441
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,070
Deputy Chief!

442
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,350
Deputy Chief!

443
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,710
- Deputy Chief Yan!
- Deputy Chief Yan!

444
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:15,230
Deputy Chief!

445
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:15,880
Yun Zhi!

446
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,880
Deputy Chief!

447
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:17,760
Deputy Chief Yan!

448
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:19,710
Deputy Chief!

449
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:20,430
Deputy Chief Yan!

450
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:21,190
Deputy Chief!

451
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,191
Yan Yun Zhi!

452
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:23,662
Deputy Chief!

453
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,110
Deputy Chief!

454
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,310
Deputy Chief!

455
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,560
Deputy Chief Yan!

456
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,640
Deputy Chief!

457
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,680
Deputy Chief Yan!

458
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:33,680
Sang Qi!

459
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,040
Deputy Chief!

460
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,040
I'm fine. Keep looking for Deputy Chief.

461
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:36,590
Calm down.

462
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,760
Don't lose yourself just yet.

463
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,070
How can I calm down at this time?

464
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,880
Many days have passed.

465
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,230
If we're late, he won't survive.

466
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,830
Don't say that.

467
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,880
No news

468
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,040
is good news.

469
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,000
Deputy Chief has excellent martial arts.

470
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:49,560
Maybe he's no longer in danger

471
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,640
and currently recuperating somewhere.

472
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,160
Deputy Chief Yan!

473
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,400
I hope so.

474
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,110
But Yan San Lang is...

475
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:54,590
Sir!

476
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:55,640
Sir!

477
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:59,230
We found this pouch at the river beach.

478
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:04,560
This is for you.

479
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,070
Where did you find this?

480
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,000
The river beach over there.

481
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,800
Deputy Chief Yan!

482
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,400
Lead the way!

483
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,000
Let's go.

484
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,830
This way!

485
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,110
Hurry!

486
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:16,350
Quickly!

487
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,350
Did you find anything else?

488
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,680
We've searched the surroundings multiple times.

489
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,400
But there was no sign of Official Yan.

490
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,110
Where are you going?

491
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,040
I want to check out the area down there.

492
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:44,800
Qi,

493
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,070
I know you're anxious.

494
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,880
But we've been searching for days

495
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,950
without resting.

496
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,230
Forget about me and my men.

497
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,560
You won't hold on much longer.

498
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,470
But Deputy Chief is...

499
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,230
Listen to me.

500
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:54,470
Go home first.

501
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,950
If Director Chief really...

502
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,560
To search along the river

503
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,470
isn't something just a few of us here can complete.

504
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:02,800
I'll get more men here.

505
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:03,590
Besides,

506
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,310
we're not the only team doing the searching.

507
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:06,710
Let's go back to the Prefecture Court first.

508
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,920
Maybe there's good news.

509
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,600
(Tea)

510
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,190
Song Luo Tian!

511
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:28,760
Song Luo Tian!

512
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,950
Any news about Deputy Chief?

513
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,160
No,

514
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,920
but Wei Zhan Hong

515
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,400
died

516
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,640
in the prison of the Prefecture Court.

517
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,070
He's dead?

518
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,920
The Prefecture Court is heavily guarded.

519
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,430
How did this happen?

520
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,590
I haven't had time to investigate.

521
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,160
But the one who can break into
the Prefecture Court and commit the murder

522
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,310
is by no means an ordinary person.

523
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:01,880
What about Official Yan?

524
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:02,710
How is he?

525
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,760
Official Yan is out of danger.

526
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,160
(Tea)
But he's still unconscious.

527
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,520
His Majesty has sent an imperial physician

528
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,430
to treat him.

529
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,070
With Official Yan away,

530
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,920
no one is in charge of the Prefecture Court now.

531
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,470
His Majesty has thought of this

532
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,640
and sent Official Xiao
from the Court of Judicial Review

533
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:22,070
to be the acting Governor of Prefecture Court.

534
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,710
But when I left just now,

535
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,880
the officer who survived

536
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,160
along with Official Yan woke up.

537
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,470
Official Xiao is doing the interrogation now.

538
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,470
Bai Shi went over too, I think.

539
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,560
Bai Shi?

540
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,000
Why did he go there as well?

541
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,230
Just look at him.

542
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:39,470
It'll be a waste of time asking.

543
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:41,680
Let's check this out ourselves.

544
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,550
(Prefecture Court)

545
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,160
Nonsense!

546
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,430
That's pure slander!

547
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:04,880
Sir...

548
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,880
(Silence. Avoidance)

549
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,680
I'm Left Capital Inspector
of Prefecture Court, Yan Yan.

550
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,560
Greetings, sir.

551
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:11,190
Manager of the Archive
in Imperial College, Sang Qi.

552
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:11,920
Greetings, sir.

553
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,430
You're here just in time.

554
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,950
I've just cleared up the case
of the assassination of Official Yan.

555
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,560
The assailant has been identified.

556
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,680
Who is it?

557
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,160
Yan Yun Zhi.

558
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,710
That's impossible.

559
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,160
Bai Shi.

560
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,950
Young Master is framed.

561
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:35,520
Sir,

562
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,760
is there any evidence to prove

563
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,760
that Yan Yun Zhi injured Yan San Lang?

564
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,000
To convict someone,

565
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,800
we need witnesses and evidence.

566
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,760
Of course.

567
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,000
This officer is the witness.

568
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,760
I didn't have to explain anything to you.

569
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,110
But since you have a close relationship
with Yan Yun Zhi

570
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:55,560
and I'm not someone
who only listens to one side of the story.

571
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,710
There's no harm in telling you anyway.

572
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:58,470
You,

573
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,350
repeat what you said about what happened that day.

574
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:02,400
Yes, sir.

575
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,310
Sir,

576
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,950
I received an order

577
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,680
to follow Official Yan

578
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,520
out of the city to search for
the remaining rebels of Xizhao.

579
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,680
The operation was supposed to be secretive.

580
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:14,110
Yan Yun Zhi suddenly caught up with us

581
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,190
when we were about to leave the city gate.

582
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,160
I thought Official Yan asked Yan Yun Zhi for help.

583
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,400
But I was surprised to see them arguing.

584
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,710
When we got out of the city

585
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,350
and had just arrived at the city's outskirts,

586
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,880
we were besieged by a group of men in black.

587
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,000
We were caught off guard.

588
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,950
In confusion, we managed to hold our ground

589
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,400
yet Yan Yun Zhi suddenly turned against us.

590
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,070
(He not only wounded the two soldiers next to him,)

591
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:43,430
(but he also...)

592
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,560
(He also attacked Official Yan.)

593
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,040
Yan Yun Zhi,

594
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:56,520
what are you doing?

595
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,590
Governor,

596
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,310
isn't it obvious?

597
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,280
You're one of Xizhao.

598
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,000
You finally realized it.

599
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:09,830
Well, it's understandable.

600
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,470
If you have the ability,

601
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,830
you wouldn't ask me
to help you solve cases all the time.

602
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,880
Why didn't you tell me?

603
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,190
I never did.

604
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,430
You're too slow.

605
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,160
You never investigate it.

606
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:21,880
I told you

607
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,000
not to leave the city today.

608
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,000
But you insist on doing so.

609
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,400
Don't blame me for not showing any mercy then.

610
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:39,310
Heaven is watching, and there will be retribution.

611
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,400
Yan Yun Zhi,

612
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,520
I suggest you think this through.

613
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,280
Put down your weapon and surrender.

614
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,800
I may spare you and let you live.

615
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,160
Yan San Lang,

616
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,040
you know too much.

617
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:54,430
(Wait.)

618
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,000
You said Yan Yun Zhi said it.

619
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,350
But it doesn't sound

620
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,350
like something Deputy Chief would say.

621
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:06,830
Sir,

622
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,760
Yan Yun Zhi is a low-profile person.

623
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:10,950
He never talked wildly.

624
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,800
Everyone at the Imperial College
can attest to this.

625
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,190
You may question them.

626
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,160
I think

627
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,590
what this person said is not true.

628
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:22,000
Are you hiding something?

629
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,310
What's wrong with you?

630
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:33,760
Sir,

631
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,710
I suddenly have a terrible headache.

632
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:38,430
It was a late night

633
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,880
and a sudden attack.

634
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,040
I suffered a serious injury.

635
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:45,040
Now, I'm feeling dizzy.

636
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,880
I may not be able to remember things clearly.

637
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,400
In short, this is generally the case.

638
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,532
Yan Yun Zhi indeed joined forces
with the remaining rebels of Xizhao

639
00:28:52,532 --> 00:28:53,160
to plot against Official Yan.

640
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,400
It's the truth.

641
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,230
I mean every word I said, sir.

642
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,400
You mean every word you said?

643
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,800
Not to mention us as his friends,

644
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:02,950
just about everyone in the Prefecture Court

645
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,590
knows Yan Yun Zhi got entangled
with the evil Xizhao

646
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:08,160
while investigating my elder brother's
cause of death.

647
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,160
Yan Yun Zhi's contribution cannot be forgotten.

648
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,800
Why would he collude with Xizhao
to injure Yan San Lang?

649
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:15,520
That's right.

650
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,950
As far as I know,

651
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,190
Deputy Chief and Official Yan are bosom friends.

652
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,110
Why would he attack him?

653
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:28,070
Sir,

654
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,800
this is his one-sided story.

655
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:32,190
Deputy Chief's whereabouts remain unknown now,

656
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:33,000
and we can't verify anything.

657
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,520
We can't completely trust this witness.

658
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,310
We need physical evidence too.

659
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:38,920
Of course.

660
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:42,880
Sir,

661
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,920
this is the ledger found

662
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,800
in Yan Yun Zhi's study.

663
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,760
Manager Sang is only half right.

664
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,520
Yan Yun Zi indeed worked with Yan San Lang

665
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,000
in investigating Xizhao.

666
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,950
But he did it

667
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,680
not to exterminate Xizhao

668
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,430
but to observe
Yan San Lang's investigation progress in secret.

669
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,760
When investigating the ledger

670
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,430
(Silence)
handed over by Wei Zhan Hong previously,

671
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:13,040
Yan San Lang already noticed

672
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,920
that there were financial transactions
between Yan Yun Zhi and Official Wei.

673
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,950
I've seen that ledger.

674
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,280
It has nothing to do with Deputy Chief.

675
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,760
You can't see the connection

676
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,590
because there's another ledger.

677
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,070
Another ledger?

678
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:25,800
Yes.

679
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,710
The one in Official Xiao hands right now.

680
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,640
There are two ledgers.

681
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,040
One in the open, the other in the dark.

682
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,800
(Ledger Transaction Records)

683
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,430
The records in the ledger from Yan Yun Zhi's study

684
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,470
and those in the ledger
which Wei Zhan Hong handed over

685
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:39,110
are of one-to-one correspondence.

686
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,950
How did you know?

687
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,040
Qian Jiu.

688
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,280
Sir,

689
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:53,760
Qian Jiu is a Xizhao spy.

690
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,000
But I didn't realize it before.

691
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,640
So it was indeed my mistake.

692
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,160
But also because of that,

693
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,070
I know her very well

694
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:02,710
from being acquainted with her.

695
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,160
After I knew her true identity,

696
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:08,310
I recall the times I spent with her.

697
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,110
I discovered all sorts of
unusual behavior of hers.

698
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,110
She mentioned Yan Yun Zhi's study more than once.

699
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:17,350
That's why I offered to search his study today.

700
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,680
As expected,

701
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:20,400
I found this secret ledger.

702
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,520
Did you find anything in the ledger?

703
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:24,710
Sir,

704
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,350
it's recorded in this ledger

705
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,470
that Yan Yun Zhi sold the plot of land
to Official Wei.

706
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,680
The handwriting and ink in the ledgers

707
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:31,880
are not what have been copied recently.

708
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:32,710
It should be real.

709
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:35,590
Sir,

710
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,640
all these are just speculations.

711
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,470
It's not solid enough.

712
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:41,760
We all know

713
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:44,000
Xizhao is very useful in secret operations.

714
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:46,070
Why would Yan Yun Zhi want
to get rid of such a great helper?

715
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,190
Qi,

716
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:51,470
this is how terrifying
Yan Yun Zhi's scheming can be.

717
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,230
Think about it.

718
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,710
From Song family's tea plantation to Official Wei.

719
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,280
From Wei Zhan Hong

720
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,470
to the final extermination of Xizhao,

721
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:02,950
he was always at the scene.

722
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,760
Every time he was involved,

723
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,230
the clues always led to a dead end.

724
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,830
If we think about it carefully,

725
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,230
Yan Yun Zhi wasn't helping with the investigation.

726
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:14,350
He was helping Xizhao clean up their trails

727
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:16,160
and confusing the imperial court.

728
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:20,470
Qi,

729
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:23,000
all the information

730
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,590
and the so-called truth you got

731
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,470
was investigated by Yan Yun Zhi.

732
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,160
He was the one who told you.

733
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,190
He instilled all the information

734
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,000
you know into your head.

735
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,160
Don't you find it suspicious?

736
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,070
Zhuo Wen Yuan,

737
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,470
these are just your speculations.

738
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,400
As long as Official Yan wakes up,

739
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,560
everything will be clear.

740
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:48,680
How's Official Yan now?

741
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:49,880
Sir,

742
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:52,000
the imperial physician has diagnosed the Governor.

743
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:54,160
The situation doesn't look optimistic.

744
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,040
Official Yan is still unconscious.

745
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:57,880
He's relying on acupuncture
and medicine to prolong his life.

746
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,430
We don't know if he'll wake up.

747
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,400
In that case,

748
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,560
we can't just wait.

749
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,070
We must find Yan Yun Zhi no matter what.

750
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,280
As for his identity...

751
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:14,800
Just in case,

752
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,350
how about we treat him as a fugitive first?

753
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,070
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

754
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:18,230
Zhuo Wen Yuan, what do you mean?

755
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:20,400
Are you trying to list Deputy Chief
as a wanted criminal?

756
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,590
That's also a temporary policy.

757
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:25,640
Enough!

758
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,000
Stop making noise.

759
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,680
Just do as Official Zhuo said.

760
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,310
Spare no effort to cure Official Yan.

761
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:33,230
Take Bai Shi into custody at the same time

762
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,950
and order the arrest of Yan Yun Zhi.

763
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:35,710
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

764
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,000
Sir!

765
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,310
Dismissed!

766
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,000
Sir!

767
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:40,880
Sir, listen to me!

768
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:41,590
Sir!

769
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,020
(Order without confusion.
Be compassionate to victims)

770
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:37,710
(Prefecture Court)

771
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,390
Young Lady.

772
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,760
How's Official Yan?

773
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,040
Have you found Deputy Chief?

774
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,000
Don't ask me.

775
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:48,000
My mind is blank.

776
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I don't know anything.

777
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,560
Let's go home first.

778
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:52,670
Wait here for me.

779
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,630
I'll get the horse carriage here.

780
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:00,150
Qi,

781
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:02,430
are you all right?

782
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,760
Thank you for your concern, Mr. Zhuo.

783
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,040
Why are you being so polite to me?

784
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:11,190
Let me send you home.

785
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,120
No, thanks.

786
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:22,289
(Prefecture Court)

787
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:25,000
Young Master,

788
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,840
Yan San Lang is so lucky

789
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:28,470
to escape from death.

790
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:29,670
If he wakes up,

791
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,120
things will be unfavorable to us.

792
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:34,320
Shall I...

793
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:34,760
No rush.

794
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,560
When we got rid of Wei Zhan Hong,

795
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:39,230
we already took a lot of risks.

796
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,360
(Prefecture Court)

797
00:35:40,391 --> 00:35:43,017
People from the Prefecture Court
can solve crimes.

798
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,430
I fear they might be aware of it.

799
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,150
They would

800
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:48,800
be watching Yan San Lang closely now.

801
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,080
It won't be easy to kill him.

802
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:52,470
Forget it.

803
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:54,040
We'll talk about this later.

804
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:55,390
Yes, sir.

805
00:35:56,026 --> 00:36:08,884
(Prefecture Court)

806
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:36,910
Qi.

807
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:38,760
Qi.

808
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,670
Why are you sleeping here?

809
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:47,360
You'll catch a cold.

810
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,230
Deputy Chief.

811
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,950
Where did you go?

812
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:59,360
When are you coming back?

813
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:01,470
Don't rush when you're faced with difficulties.

814
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,710
All you need to do is resting well now.

815
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,800
After you have enough rest,

816
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,630
I'll show up next to you.

817
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,630
Don't lie to me.

818
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:14,320
I'm so tired when you're not around.

819
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:17,120
I won't lie to you.

820
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,150
Come on.

821
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,630
Don't leave me.

822
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:06,870
Deputy Chief!

823
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,120
Young Lady, you're awake.

824
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:20,430
Young Lady,

825
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:22,080
when you came home yesterday,

826
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,470
you've been sleeping until just now.

827
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,430
Is it because you were too tired lately?

828
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,470
You must take care of yourself.

829
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,470
I made you chicken soup.

830
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,120
Drink it while it's hot.

831
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,230
I have no appetite.

832
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,190
I'm very confused.

833
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:38,430
I need to go to my brother.

834
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:39,800
Young Lady.

835
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,470
Brother,

836
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:57,600
what should I do now?

837
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,560
We don't know if Deputy Chief is still alive.

838
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:01,230
Yan San Lang is still unconscious.

839
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,430
What happened outside the city

840
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,320
remains a mystery.

841
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,630
I really have no clue at all.

842
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,190
With this mess

843
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:11,520
and my state of mind,

844
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,630
I can't tell what's true and what's false.

845
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:15,910
Brother,

846
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,360
can you give me some signs?

847
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,390
Young Lady.

848
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:34,840
Young Lady.

849
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,190
Young Lady!

850
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,430
Young Lady, what's wrong?

851
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:44,710
Young Lady.

852
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:48,670
Help!

853
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,360
Young Lady has fainted!

854
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:52,800
Young Lady!

855
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:58,600
How is she?

856
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:15,000
Physician,

857
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:16,950
how's Young Lady?

858
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,840
She's troubled by thoughts
and suffers from retrograde qi and blood flow.

859
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,390
She needs to recuperate well.

860
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:24,360
That's what the other physicians said.

861
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,800
But she's been resting for so many days.

862
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,320
Why is she not getting any better?

863
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,710
Well...

864
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,320
Don't worry.

865
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,320
This is a famous physician I hired.

866
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:35,910
His diagnosis won't go wrong.

867
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,000
Besides, illnesses go away slowly.

868
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,080
Recovery doesn't happen overnight.

869
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:42,800
Follow the physician
to get the prescription first.

870
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:44,120
Okay.

871
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:58,870
Qi,

872
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,710
why are you still holding this pouch?

873
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,520
Shall I keep it for you?

874
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,080
It was Deputy Chief's.

875
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,560
He's gone.

876
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,840
Why do you still keep this pouch?

877
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,040
I'll be with you from now on anyway.

878
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,120
Give it to me.

879
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:19,080
Qi,

880
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:20,910
I know you have a lot of misunderstandings

881
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:22,000
about me these days.

882
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,000
But to me,

883
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,000
you're still my best friend.

884
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,040
I'm also the one you can count on the most.

885
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:37,230
If you need anything in the future,

886
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:38,710
you can just tell me.

887
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:43,600
I'll do my best to fulfill it.

888
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:52,120
Take good care of yourself.

889
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:56,710
I'll visit you often.

890
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:23,560
Physician,

891
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,230
how serious is Sang Qi's illness?

892
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,320
Apart from severe anxiousness,

893
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,080
from her pulse,

894
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,190
there's a sign of toxin invading her body.

895
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:42,430
Young Master.

896
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:48,910
How did it go?

897
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:51,560
Young Master, I was incompetent.

898
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:53,120
We've taken care of Yan San Lang.

899
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:55,670
But Yan Yun Zhi was injured and fell off the cliff.

900
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,000
No trace of him so far.

901
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:01,560
I only found this.

902
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,040
The pouch he carried with him at all times.

903
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,150
Jing Mu,

904
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,760
bring me the white porcelain bottle

905
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,760
