Deputy Chief?

31
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,080
Why are you here?

32
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:01,040
I saw you following Jing Mu.

33
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,230
I followed because I was worried.

34
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,230
You followed me again.

35
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,230
What do you mean by "again"?

36
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,120
I already know anyway.

37
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,550
It's fine if you deny it now.

38
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,400
I'll settle this with you
after we get out from here.

Zhuo Wen Yuan!

42
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,550
Stop shouting.

43
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,630
He'd have answered if he could hear you.

44
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,830
He should be asking for help now.

45
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,360
Deputy Chief, your hand is injured.

46
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,160
Let me see.

47
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,470
I'm fine.

48
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,270
No.

49
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,320
You must treat injuries right away.

50
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,800
Listen,

51
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,910
you better don't rip your clothes
to bandage it for me.

52
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:50,550
I...

53
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,240
You... You... You...

54
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,270
I...

55
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,190
Don't worry.

56
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,670
I won't rip my clothes.

57
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,160
Do you know how expensive my clothes are?

58
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,720
No, but I don't want to know either.

59
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,390
My clothes will be put into good use.

60
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,030
So troublesome.

61
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,160
Scholar Huo said

62
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,670
if we run into this kind of situation,

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,160
we must keep ourselves warm.

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,520
Look!

65
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,000
Lighting a fire using clothes

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,190
sure is easy to ignite.

67
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,000
It's burning pretty quick.

68
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:38,720
I'm smart, right?

69
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,470
Are you a fool?

70
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,320
Studying seems to make you even more foolish.

71
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,190
You burned your clothes.

72
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,910
How long do you think your clothes can burn?

73
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,320
How long can the fire last?

74
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,320
Won't wearing your clothes keep you warmer?

75
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:58,910
You're right.

76
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,080
I started to feel a bit cold when you said that.

77
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,470
But I...

78
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,110
Don't look at me like that.

79
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,190
You're the one who foolishly burned your clothes.

80
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,270
Don't eye my clothes.

81
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:15,960
Don't even think about it.

82
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,720
How petty.

83
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,440
Heroes in storytelling scripts

84
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,240
aren't like this.

85
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,520
The beautiful ladies in storytelling scripts
aren't like you either.

86
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:45,920
Indeed.

87
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,230
Fine. Come over.

88
00:04:59,200 --> 00:04:59,950
Just come over.

89
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,110
I never said I'd lend my clothes to you.

90
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,510
Sit down. We'll take cover under it together.

91
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,830
I hope Zhuo Wen Yuan and the rest

92
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,270
can come and rescue us quickly.

93
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,350
Rest assured.

94
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,720
The manor is not far from here.

95
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,720
They'll come right away after he finds them.

96
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,550
Just rest for now.

97
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,160
Your hand...

98
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,390
It's fine. Don't mind about it.

99
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:08,040
Go a little lower. A little bit more.

100
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,390
Yes, that's it.

101
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,200
Stay that way, all right?

102
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,510
A little lower.

103
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,270
Keep your hands up.

104
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,600
Exactly. Stay this way.

105
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,760
Not bad.

106
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,110
Master Yan!

107
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,000
Young Master, careful!

108
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,070
Master Yan!

109
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,110
Master Yan!

110
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:24,440
Master Yan.

111
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,230
You're back.

112
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,440
Where have you been?

113
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,000
Sang Qi is trapped in the cave.

114
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:28,830
What?

115
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:30,640
What happened?

116
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,390
Qi and I wanted to take shelter
from the rain in the cave.

117
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,110
But there was a landslide out of the sudden.

118
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,000
To save Qi, Deputy Chief Yan, who was passing by,

119
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,230
fell into the cave along with Qi.

120
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,950
The mouth of the cave is now
blocked with the rubble.

121
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,440
We must save them quickly.

122
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,830
Are you saying Yun Zhi and Sang Qi are trapped?

123
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,350
Yes.

124
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,110
Do we have tools?

125
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,320
We must save them quickly.

126
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,720
Tools?

127
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,550
I think there are a few hoes in the manor.

128
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,830
Hoes. Hoes.

129
00:06:58,830 --> 00:06:59,550
Ah, yes!

130
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,110
A pickaxe is the most suitable to dig out rubble.

131
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:02,760
Where is it?

132
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,040
Let me think about where is it.

133
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,230
I think it's in the backyard.

134
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:06,760
Yes.

135
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,000
Let's go.

136
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,760
It's in the backyard.

137
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,510
Master,

138
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,160
I thought the pickaxe

139
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,640
was in your room.

140
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,390
Of course, I know that.

141
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,390
I don't need you to tell me.

142
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,230
Why didn't you tell them?

143
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,230
Won't it delay the rescue?

144
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,510
What do you know?

145
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,720
I know this mountain like the back of the hand.

146
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,510
It's just the cave in the back of the mountain.

147
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,160
No one dies from being trapped
for a couple of days.

148
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,830
This incident can give my foolish nephew

149
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,390
some time.

150
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,440
This foolish child

151
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,000
has been the same since he was a child.

152
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,640
He will never tell if he likes anything.

153
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,160
He only keeps it bottled up.

154
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,320
If I didn't use this moment

155
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:40,070
to give him a push,

156
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,320
he'd have ruined any good opportunity.

157
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,670
What opportunity?

158
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,880
Can I go...

159
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,110
You are

160
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,510
foolish and have a big mouth.

161
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,480
Don't mess around if you don't know anything.

162
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,110
Come over here.

163
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,670
Over here.

164
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,110
Continue with your horse stance.

165
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,000
Get down.

166
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:56,880
That's right.

167
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,110
Lift your head!

168
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,920
Chest up! Stick out your bottom!

169
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,160
A little lower.

170
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,230
That's it.

171
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,350
Nice!

172
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,670
Go a bit lower.

173
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,550
Good.

174
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,510
Stay like this for two hours.

175
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,000
Don't shake! Don't shake!

176
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,950
Since we can only wait,

177
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,480
stop thinking about going out.

178
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,510
You can tell me now.

179
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,350
About what?

180
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:49,030
About you went after the imperial physician
for me, set up the fireworks,

181
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,910
and protected me in secret.

182
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,350
You don't have to deny it.

183
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,710
Master and Bai Shi have sold you out.

184
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,350
These two big mouths.

185
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,880
When I first enrolled at Imperial College,

186
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,670
I thought you made things difficult

187
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,840
for me like the rest.

188
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,110
But I didn't expect

189
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,960
you were helping me

190
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,030
fight for equal opportunities secretly.

191
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,150
You cared about my life and death

192
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:23,200
and remembered the things I liked,
which I said casually.

193
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,590
You respect my ideals

194
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,880
as well as my habits.

195
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,150
It's not hard to treat someone nicely.

196
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,960
What was hard

197
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,710
is using the way she likes to treat her nicely,

198
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,790
respecting her,

199
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,110
and always thinking from her views.

200
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,400
You're indeed the "White",

201
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,840
who's an obedient, clingy,

202
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,520
considerate, sensible, and well-behaved person
whom my brother had mentioned.

203
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,320
How dare you say that?

204
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,000
No manners.

205
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:01,670
Call me Deputy Chief.

206
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,030
I was only

207
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,320
taking care of you

208
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,280
because you're Yu's younger sister.

209
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,280
You're welcome.

210
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,790
Look at you!

211
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:15,320
I... I was praising

212
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,350
and complimenting you.

213
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,470
But you always

214
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,670
show that air of Deputy Chief.

215
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,710
My praises are meaningless.

216
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,640
Are you cold?

217
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,790
You still talk so much when it's cold.

218
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,590
Rest a while first.

219

00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,000

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,440
Zhuo Wen Yuan!

340
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:48,640
Zhuo Wen Yuan!

341
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,910
- Young Master!
- Zhuo Wen Yuan!

342
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:50,640
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

343
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:56,960
Wider. Wider.

344
00:15:57,470 --> 00:15:57,910
Good.

345
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,200
All right, shoulders down.

346
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,840
Train by yourself. I'll go to see my nephew.

347
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,550
All right.

348
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,910
Don't slack off!

349
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:07,910
All right!

350
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,080
All done, Young Master.

351
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,080
My good nephew.

352
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,400
Let me see.

353
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,640
You won't die from a small injury like this.

354
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:25,760
Why?

355
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:28,080
Does this small injury like this

356
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,280
make you a bit regretful?

357
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,470
Of course not.

358
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,230
You're still my own nephew.

359
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,960
So you knew I am your nephew.

360
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,520
I thought you don't know.

361
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,710
If you knew,

362
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,030
Qi and I wouldn't be trapped

363
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,230
in the cave all night.

364
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:41,230
No need to thank me.

365
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,110
Did you have a great night?

366
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:46,790
What do you think?

367
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,440
I'm going to practice martial arts downstairs.

368
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:58,350
Young Master, are you feeling better now?

369
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,320
It was all good

370
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,840
until an unwelcome person showed up.

371
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,150
I was trapped in the cave all night

372
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,280
in hunger and cold.

373
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,030
I didn't even fall ill.

374
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,880
But he fell right there.

375
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,470
What are you doing?

376
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:15,640
Young Master,

377
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,110
he has his plan. We also have a countermeasure.

378
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:19,520
Isn't it gaining sympathy?

379
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:20,710
We can do the same too.

380
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:21,950
What?

381
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:24,880
Wait here.

382
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,830
I'll get a wheelchair for you.

383
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:27,430
Come back, don't you go.

384
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:33,110
I would never do anything like gaining sympathy.

385
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:33,800
But...

386
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,070
I've always been an upright person.

387
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,310
I'm going to check on Qi.

388
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:42,430
Qi.

389
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,280
How could it be so serious?

390
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,430
What did the physician say?

391
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,760
Well,

392
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,950
Young Master was so anxious

393
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,710
that he caught a cold.

394
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,520
That's why he's ill now.

395
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,040
If it's serious,

396
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,070
he should leave the mountain
to recuperate properly.

397
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:15,880
The mountain is not good enough.

398
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,310
I'll send you down the mountain.

399
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,680
Qi, you're willing to go down the mountain with me?

400
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,190
I'll send you down and come back here.

401
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,430
The physician said

402
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,520
I need a quiet rest.

403
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:32,920
Going through the trouble of going
up and down the mountain

404
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,880
will only affect my illness in a bad way.

405
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:38,920
Exactly.

406
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,040
Miss Lian Pian,

407
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:42,190
I need you to take me to the kitchen.

408
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,950
I need to brew Young Master's
medicinal concoction.

409
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,160
The kitchen is...

410
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,400
The kitchen is towards the east
after you get out of the door.

411
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,920
I just arrived here,

412
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,680
so I'm not sure of the cardinal points.

413
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,680
I still need you to lead the way.

414
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:54,680
What?

415
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,430
If all of you don't know the direction,

416
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,350
how are you supposed to run errands?

417
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,920
Are you and Bai Shi under the same tutelage?

418
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,110
If you may, Miss Lian Pian.

419
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:14,560
Yan Yan,

420
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,160
do you know where Sang Qi is?

421
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,830
I saw her taking Lian Pian to see Zhuo Wen Yuan.

422
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:20,560
Zhuo Wen Yuan?

423
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,160
Bai Shi.

424
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:34,560
You...

425
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,520
Qi,

426
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,920
when you were trapped in the cave last night,

427
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,920
do you know how much I was worried about you?

428
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,800
I remember when I was young,

429
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,710
we were trapped there when we went out together.

430
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,880
I still ended up sending your back to the camp.

431
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,800
From that moment, I swore

432
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,520
- that no matter what...
- No matter what,

433
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,070
I'll take care of you all.

434
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:08,880
Zhuo Wen Yuan,

435
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,190
now you're not well,

436
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,280
you shouldn't put so much strain on yourself.

437
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,760
Behave and let others take care of you.

438
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,280
Deputy Chief,

439
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,710
is your hand okay?

440
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,350
I thought it was a flesh injury.

441
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,590
Why are you using a sling?

442
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,680
My foundation is not as good as yours.

443
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,710
After suffering in the cave all night,

444
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,640
you have the energy to worry

445
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,590
about your classmate instead of resting.

446
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,400
Seeing how you care about each other,

447
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,920
I'm pleased.

448
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,040
Young Master, don't forget

449
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,310
that you're supposed to be injured.

450
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:45,400
You sounded high-spirited.

451
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,640
Deputy Chief,

452
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,760
you're still unwell.

453
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,430
So don't move around too much.

454
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,830
I'm fine.

455
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,400
You don't have to trouble yourself.

456
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,110
With Qi here,

457
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,520
she'll take good care of me.

458
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:06,880
Qi,

459
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,400
I suddenly have a bitter taste in my mouth.

460
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,830
I want some dessert soup.

461
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:11,920
Dessert soup?

462
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,470
All right, wait here.

463
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,590
I'll make it right now.

464
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:16,640
Deputy Chief,

465
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,590
you should go back and sleep.

466
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,920
I'm going to make some dessert soup.

467
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,430
It's okay. Go ahead. I'll take care of him.

468
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,470
Qi is not here.

469
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,350
Do you feel a lot better now?

470
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,800
Compared to you, we're just the same.

471
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:44,710
I thought you wouldn't pretend to be ill
to gain sympathy.

472
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,110
Turns out you're the same.

473
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,710
I only used a sling for my hand.

474
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:50,680
I never said something was wrong with me.

475
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,430
You're just as impressive.

476
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,000
When it comes to changing excuses,

477
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,640
I'm put to shame.

478
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,160
Zhuo Wen Yuan,

479
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,950
Sang Qi's time on the mountain is very precious.

480
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,880
I hope she can learn something.

481
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,830
Learn martial arts to protect herself.

482
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,000
If you can't go down the mountain for another day

483
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,160
because of this injury,

484
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,190
I'll have to take care of you for another day.

485
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:12,800
Deputy Chief,

486
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,280
for you to put so much effort,

487
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,920
I'm afraid it's not good if it gets out.

488
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,190
I put in the effort to take care of my student.

489
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:22,160
What is wrong with that?

490
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,430
The effort that I meant...

491
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,160
I don't mean the effort you put into me.

492
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,310
But Sang Qi.

493
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:38,310
Even if you're the Deputy Chief
of the Imperial College,

494
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,350
Sang Yu's best friend,

495
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,640
and his senior,

496
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,640
all these statuses combined

497
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,920
are not enough for you to
lower yourself like this.

498
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,070
What you think

499
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,430
is also what I think.

500
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,160
I'll pursue once I have made up my mind.

501
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,430
I'll never let you get your way.

502
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:11,680
Dessert soup is ready.

503
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,350
There are many fresh fruits on the mountain.

504
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,590
I made it pretty quickly, right?

505
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,880
Here you go, Bai Shi.

506
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:17,880
Thank you, Miss Sang.

507
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:18,640
Deputy Chief.

508
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,040
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

509
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,710
Qi,

510
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,000
I suddenly felt a pain in my arm.

511
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,680
I can't lift it.

512
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,830
Can you feed me?

513
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:32,830
All right.

514
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,350
Qi,

515
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,160
it's okay. I can feed him.

516
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:37,040
Deputy Chief, it's inconvenient for you.

517
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:37,640
Let me feed him.

518
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,920
Qi, it's okay. Men and women are different.

519
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,400
It's okay.

520
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,310
It's not convenient for Zhuo Wen Yuan
to let you feed.

521
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,350
It's okay.

522
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:41,680
Let me do it.

523
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,070
I can feed him.

524
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,560
It's okay.

525
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,310
Zhuo... Zhuo Wen Yuan doesn't want you to feed him.

526
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,040
I can just feed him.

527
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:45,640
Let me do it.

528
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:46,800
- Just give it to me.
- Give it to me.

529
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,190
It's okay.

530
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:47,950
Let Qi do it.

531
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:48,230
Never mind, I can feed him.

532
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:48,640
Let me do it.

533
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,190
He already said he doesn't want to...

534
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:53,280
It's okay.

535
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:53,680
It's okay.

536
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,520
We still have another bowl.

537
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:57,680
You finished it pretty quick.

538
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,110
It's okay.

539
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,070
I can make some more.

540
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,350
Sang Qi.

541
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:05,830
It's okay. It's only dessert soup.

542
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:06,920
I can do it myself.

543
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,520
Bai Shi, stay here.

544
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:10,950
Me?

545
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,470
Keep them company.

546
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:16,160
Bai Shi,

547
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,680
keep an eye on Zhuo Wen Yuan.

548
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,470
I'll check on him.

549
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,350
Deputy Chief.

550
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,560
Sang Qi, you don't have to explain.

551
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:50,350
I...

552
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,800
We're not at the Imperial College,
so I'm not the Deputy Chief.

553
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:54,280
You're not a student too.

554
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,800
I have no right to meddle in your affairs.

555
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,430
Whatever you want to do,

556
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,350
whoever you want to take care of,

557
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,520
or how you manage your time is your own affair.

558
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,190
But don't forget

559
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,710
the reason you came here.

560
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:06,830
Deputy Chief,

561
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,280
you should be explaining it to me

562
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,000
instead of me explaining, right?

563
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,520
Your hand is fine.

564
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,920
Why did you use this sling?

565
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,430
Do you want me to worry about you?

566
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,230
Were you worried about me?

567
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,350
Wait.

568
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,040
You're missing the point.

569
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:28,070
I meant,

570
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,710
why did you use the sling when your hand is fine?

571
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:34,230
Practice martial arts.

572
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:35,070
What kind of martial arts?

573
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:35,800
Iron head martial arts.

574
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,400
The training goes like this.

575
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,520
Slip this sling

576
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,590
under your arm, bring it over the back of the neck,

577
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,160
and pull in the opposite direction.

578
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,560
It's used as a support in training your neck.

579
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,000
The same principle with tying

580
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,280
sandbags to your hands and legs.

581
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:49,800
Like this.

582
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:51,880
See?

583
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:56,430
You are becoming more and more capable

584
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,430
of talking nonsense now.

585
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,400
I wasn't talking nonsense.

586
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,560
I've already told you the methods.

587
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,160
It's up to you if you want to believe it.

588
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,520
Dessert soup is ready.

589
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,110
Since you're so energetic,

590
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:14,950
you can take it to Zhuo Wen Yuan.

591
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,880
He did make dessert soup.

592
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:44,070
(Yu. Oh, Yu.)

593
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,920
(We're friends, right?)

594
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,710
(Why did you)

595
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:48,760
(give me such a difficult problem?)

596
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:52,830
(Now, I'm in real trouble.)

597
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,950
(I can't eat or sleep well.)

598
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:56,640
(What do you want me to do)

599
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:59,040
(with my relationship with your sister?)

600
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,310
(People from the Sang family)

601
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:04,710
(are born to restrain me.)

602
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,310
Wait a minute.

603
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:14,800
I came here with her.

604
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,830
I was also trapped with her in the cave.

605
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,070
Young Master.

606
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,800
Besides, when she made dessert soup,

607
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,470
she didn't forget my portion.

608
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,310
She still cares about my injury.

609
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,000
She should have a place for me in her heart, right?

610
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:26,430
Young Master.

611
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,880
When did you arrive?

612
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,800
I've been calling out to you since just now.

613
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:39,000
You seemed to be immersed in something.

614
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:46,040
You didn't even hear me calling you.

615
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:46,640
I...

616
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
I told you to keep them company.

617
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,800
After Miss Sang finished making dessert soup,

618
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,560
she asked Jing Mu to take care of his Young Master.

619
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:57,350
Miss Sang also instructed me

620
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,470
to bring you a bowl of dessert soup.

621
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,040
I don't want to drink it.

622
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:02,230
If you want, you can drink it.

623
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,830
I do want to have it.

624
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:06,590
But!

625
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:07,350
There is a but.

626
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,310
Seeing how you're losing your mind,

627
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,400
I'd rather die of hunger

628
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:12,710
than having it.

629
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,230
Young Master, please enjoy it.

Yes, Young Master.

Young Lady, what's wrong?

666
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,470
Did Master punish you again?

667
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,710
It's not related to martial arts.

668
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:30,950
So are you thinking about him?

669
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,880
I wasn't thinking about Yan Yun Zhi.

670
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,680
I never said it is Deputy Chief.

671
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,950
I thought you were thinking

672
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,040
about Young Master Zhuo's illness.

673
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,680
You admitted it yourself now.

674
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:44,590
Fine, I was thinking about Yan Yun Zhi.

675
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,160
But I was curious.

676
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,280
I don't understand

677
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,710
what kind of person he is.

678
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,560
My brother told me

679
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:53,590
to go to White if I have problems.

680
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,190
But I didn't expect

681
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,680
that he would be my biggest problem.

682
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,560
You see,

683
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,280
in the beginning,

684
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,950
he was the one who refused to accept my pouch

685
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,520
and didn't want to let me win.

686
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,710
Later, he was the one

687
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,880
who showed up unexpectedly
and saved me from the crisis.

688
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:09,920
He was the one who was

689
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:12,430
careful and considerate
and helped me pull through.

690
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,830
He is also the one

691
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:16,310
who is unpredictable and emotional.

692
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,710
Lian Pian,

693
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,040
do you think

694
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,400
he has a twin?

695
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,800
Why does he seem like

696
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,110
a different person whenever I see him?

697
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,880
Anyway, I think

698
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,350
Deputy Chief always looks the same.

699
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:30,710
I don't think he has any twins.

700
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:34,710
It is so annoying.

701
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,800
The more I think, the more it gives me a headache.

702
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,880
It's giving me a headache.

703
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,470
I'm going out for some fresh air.

704
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,280
If you're sleepy, just sleep first.

705
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,040
Are you out for some fresh air too?

706
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,950
The night wind is cold.

707
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,590
It's not good for your injury.

708
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:23,280
It's okay since I pretended anyway.

709
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:34,950
I was so worried about your injury

710
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:36,230
that I said something wrong.

711
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,040
Don't take it to heart.

712
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,880
Were you worried about me?

713
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:43,310
Of course, I was.

714
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,800
You got hurt because of me.

715
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,310
If anything bad

716
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:50,520
happens to you,

717
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,350
I will...

718
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,560
What will you do?

719
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,266
I...

720
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:58,110
I will take care of you until you die.

721
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:05,400
I...

722
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,400
I... I'll take full responsibility.

723
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:09,400
I won't abandon you.

724
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,230
I want you to swear.

725
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,520
I swear.

726
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:23,350
At least, you have a conscience.

727
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:31,710
Does your injury still hurt?

728
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,400
It's all better now.

729
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:38,520
Help me take it off.

730
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,070
I was teasing you.

731
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,430
Young Master, we have a problem.

732
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:22,470
The cargo in the south is being held.

733
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,390
Noble Consort Zhuo already
knows about this matter.

734
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:26,320
She asked

735
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,870
why you didn't get things done in time.

736
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:30,150
She's asking you to enter the palace

737
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,560
to discuss the solution to this problem.

738
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,120
I can't leave now.

739
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:35,390
If I leave the mountain now,

740
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:38,120
I will have no chance with Sang Qi.

741
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:38,630
Young Master,

742
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:40,230
why do you still want to stay

743
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:41,320
when something has happened?

744
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:42,760
What about Noble Consort Zhuo?

745
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,080
When Qian Jiu made her move on Miss Sang,

746
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:46,670
it was indeed arbitrary.

747
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,080
But now, I'm afraid...

748
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,800
Yes, if you leave the mountain

749
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,710
under such circumstances,

750
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,430
you might lose Miss Sang.

751
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,150
But if you don't leave this mountain,

752
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,150
you'll certainly lose Miss Sang.

753
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:02,470
I understand.

754
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:04,560
We'll leave tomorrow.

755
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:11,050
(Lingwu Manor)

756
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,390
Zhuo Wen Yuan,

757
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,800
are you feeling better now?

758
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,080
Why are you leaving in a hurry?

759
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,710
There's only a cause of my illness

760
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:32,430
and no cure for me here.

761
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,280
It's better to go back and be more at ease.

762
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,840
All right, I'll see you when the school term begins.

763
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:40,470
Are you not asking me to stay?

764
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,760
Why would I make you stay?

765
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:44,950
You should go back and recuperate.

766
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,470
I'll see you when the school term begins.

767
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,630
Take care of him.

768
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,760
He seems not right.

769
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:07,950
I went to the mountain

770
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:10,080
to watch Yan Yun Zhi's movement.

771
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:12,390
He will not be making any move soon.

772
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:14,840
I guess he doesn't have enough evidence.

773
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,150
He has no clue to follow now.

774
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:21,710
Do you need to worry
about someone like Yan Yun Zhi?

775
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:23,760
Stop giving your excuses.

776
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,870
Do you think I don't know

777
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:27,230
the reason you stayed on the mountain?

778
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,950
I can't hide anything from you at all.

779
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,320
I'll let it go this once.

780
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:36,520
If you delay my plan,

781
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,230
don't blame me for being ruthless
despite our relationship.

782
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,000
I'll remember that.

783
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,080
You're still young.

784
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,600
Maybe to you,

785
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,600
a love affair is a top priority.

786
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,040
But in front of our great cause,

787
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:53,190
this kind of love affair means nothing.

788
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,120
After you've achieved success,

789
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,230
you can just choose any ladies you want.

790
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:01,870
Speaking of which,

791
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,040
Song Jia Yin, the daughter of the Song family,

792
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,280
is your age, right?

793
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,390
Yes.

794
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,190
The Song family is known to change sides
according to situations.

795
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,040
But marriage will win them over.

796
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:16,600
Aunt,

797
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,760
I don't want to give up

798
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,230
on Sang Qi just yet.

799
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,120
The Sang family has military forces.

800
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:23,670
Perhaps it's more advantageous for us

801
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:24,710
to bond with the Sang family.

802
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,630
Since the beginning of the dynasty,
His Majesty values scholars than the military.

803
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:31,040
It's the same even if His Majesty
respects the Grand Commandant.

804
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,120
Moreover,

805
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,190
Sang Wei is a very stubborn person.

806
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,630
Are you capable of persuading him to work with us?

807
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,520
Can you afford to be responsible if it backfires?

808
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:42,710
Aunt,

809
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:45,910
give me some time.

810
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:50,840
I'll give you

811
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,840
until you graduate from
the Imperial College with honor.

812
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,390
You'd better consider

813
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:57,190
the marriage then.

814
00:37:58,870 --> 00:37:59,630
As for people like the Sang family,

815
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,800
it doesn't matter

816
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,000
if they are your friends or not.

817
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:05,280
But the Song family is the one,

818
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,870
which you should maintain good relationships.

819
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:15,360
I understand.

820
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,760
Since your school term has not started yet,

821
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,190
go to the south

822
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,760
to solve the salt route problem.

823
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:22,560
Yes.

824
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:25,280
Let me advise you on one thing.

825
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,320
If you want to achieve great things,

826
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,910
emotion is the worst thing.

827
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,630
Emotion is the most meaningless
and weakest thing

828
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:32,670
in the world.

829
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:33,800
Do you understand?

830
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,520
If you can't be resolute,

831
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,560
I can help you.

832
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:49,670
I know what to do.

833
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:48,080
Qi.

834
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,000
Qi!

835
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:52,630
Mr. Yan.

836
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:53,470
Where's Qi?

837
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:55,390
She's practicing sword in the back mountain now.

838
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:59,600
My mother sent someone up the mountain
to tell me to go back.

839
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:01,150
I want to ask you and Qi

840
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,560
if you want to come with me.

841
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:04,670
She looks pretty happy these few days.

842
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:06,760
She doesn't seem to want to leave.

843
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:10,000
So do I.

844
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,520
I feel comfortable here.

845
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,870
It's too bad that I can't disobey my mother's order.

846
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:18,320
What about you? Are you going back?

847
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:19,710
Me?

848
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:22,390
I'll follow Young Lady's wishes.

849
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,840
I'll go wherever she goes.

850
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:25,080
I'll stay if she wants to stay.

851
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:28,120
You and Qi are two different people.

852
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:29,520
I want to know what you think.

853
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,000
If you want to stay a few days,

854
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:33,670
I'll ask my mother

855
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:34,800
if I can delay it for a few days.

856
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,280
Are you saying if I want to stay
despite Young Lady leaving,

857
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,800
you're going to keep my company for a few days too?

858
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,040
Of course.

859
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,120
Really?

860
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:45,800
Don't you believe me?

861
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,390
It's that I don't believe you.

862
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,560
I just...

863
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:52,000
Help me clear this.

864
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:56,190
What is this?

865
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:01,320
Come on.

866
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:02,710
Attack head-on.

867
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,670
Let me see how much you've improved

868
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:05,870
after practicing on the mountain.

869
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,910
All right, I won't hold back.

870
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:53,190
You said it was a small test.

871
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:55,230
How am I supposed to defeat you
if you did your best?

872
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,190
When facing a strong opponent,

873
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,080
you must be serious.

874
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,000
I was respecting you.

875
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:02,520
I still can't get close to you
after practicing for so long.

876
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:04,080
How meaningless.

877
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:06,950
Well, not really.

878
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:17,950
I did it.

879
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,190
But it'll be better if it's an inch deeper.

880
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,000
It'll be even better if there's blood.

881
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,840
What nonsense are you spouting?

882
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,600
Are you trying to kill your...

883
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:30,760
Are you trying to kill your Senior?

884
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:39,910
