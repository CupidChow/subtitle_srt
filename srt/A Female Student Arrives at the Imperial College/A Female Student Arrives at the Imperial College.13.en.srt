=Episode 13=

28
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,230
Why are you...

29
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,360
Who is it?

30
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,080
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

31
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,590
Over there.

32
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,760
Lie down quickly.

33
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,190
Don't speak.

34
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,000
If you have something to say, just say it.

35
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,960
You don't have to worry about anything.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,600
You're lying on my hair.

37
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm... I'm sorry.

38
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,550
Deputy Chief, what are you doing here?

39
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,190
I'm feeling tipsy,

40
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,800
(Fu Lai Qing tea)

41
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,080
so I came to chew on some tea leaves

42
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,190
and sober up.

43
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,270
Frankly, I've been rather curious.

44
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,800
Why do we always get trapped together

45
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,910
whenever it's just the two of us in a room?

46
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,160
This would sound like an exaggeration, even if
it was written in the storytelling scripts.

47
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,670
How could it be such a coincidence?

48
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,320
It must be the will of Heaven.

49
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,470
The will of Heaven?

50
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,390
Sang Qi.

51
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,000
Sang Qi.

52
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,000
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

53
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,110
You should go first.

54
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,670
Why are you here?

55
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:47,830
No particular reason.

56
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:48,520
Let's go.

57
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,030
Come on.

58
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,000
Let's go back, let's go back.

59
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,750
Deputy Chief is here too.

60
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,080
Both of you were...

61
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,240
Deputy Chief said he was feeling slightly tipsy,

62
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,030
so he came here to sober up.

63
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,750
I happened to pass by.

64
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,360
It's true.

65
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,000
It looks like Deputy Chief is drunk indeed.

66
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,470
But it would be better to just call a servant

67
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,520
for matters like these.

68
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,240
Both of you entered the tea room in the
Grand Tutor's Residence without permission.

69
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,160
That's highly inappropriate.

70
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,080
Now that nobody else is here,
you should hurry up and leave.

71
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,630
If someone discovers you here,

72
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,960
they'll assume that you came here
to steal something.

73
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,720
That's right. Let's go.

74
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,670
Young Master.

75
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,550
Have you received a reply?

76
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,070
Young Master.

77
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,670
Official Yan said that he would fully
cooperate with your decisions.

78
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,880
It's time to solve the mystery.

79
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,350
Everyone.

80
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:08,390
We're going to work in the tea
plantation tomorrow.

81
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,870
(The wind blows and carries a beautiful poem)

82
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,350
That's wonderful!

83
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,950
- We're going to work in the tea plantation.
- We're going to the tea plantation.

84
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,670
That's amazing.

85
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,390
Zhuo Wen Yuan, aren't we just
going to work in the tea plantation?

86
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:20,950
It's not like we're graduating.

87
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,350
Why are they so happy?

88
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,950
As long as they don't have to study,

89
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,790
(Carries a beautiful poem)
that's enough to make them leap with joy.

90
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,480
Just treat it as if you're seeing
the graduation scene in advance.

91
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,000
I really don't understand.

92
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,950
It's not like we lack holidays
in the Imperial College.

93
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,350
Moreover, the harvest break has just ended.

94
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,160
What is there to be so excited about?

95
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,230
You don't get it at all.

96
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,600
This isn't just any other holiday.

97
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,270
We initially thought that we would
be forced to study

98
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,000
in the classroom before
the imperial examination.

99
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,790
We never expected that we could relax
for a few days during this busy period.

100
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:44,270
Isn't that right?

101
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:45,600
Yes, that's right.

102
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,720
If you put it that way,

103
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,070
then we should definitely be happy.

104
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,440
Don't rejoice too early.

105
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,390
This time, you're going to work
on the tea plantation.

106
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,790
I didn't plan this trip for you to have fun.

107
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:01,390
Rather, I want you to experience
the farmers' hardships.

108
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,640
At the same time, don't disappoint your scholars
for all their painstaking efforts.

109
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,270
Go to bed earlier when you return today.

110
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,510
Conserve your strength and store up energy.

111
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,920
We'll leave early in the morning tomorrow.

112
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,350
Yes.

113
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,600
Everyone, let's get ready early.

114
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,040
- Come on.
- Let's go.

115
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,920
Pack your things. Hurry up and pack your things.

116
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:23,950
I haven't decided what to bring tomorrow.

117
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,390
Bring everything, especially delicious things.

118
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,720
All right, let's all bring something to eat.

119
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,160
(Tranquility)

120
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,600
Come on, let's go.

121
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,870
(Class Yellow)

122
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,790
(A Place for the Talented)

123
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:34,720
Hurry up!

124
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,320
What nice things did you bring?

125
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,550
This.

126
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,070
Song.

127
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,670
You're a newlywed.

128
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:50,640
Why didn't you take leave
to spend time with your wife at home?

129
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,270
Why do you insist on working
in the fields on the hill?

130
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,760
You're making things hard for yourself.

131
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,350
It's rare for all of us at the Imperial College
to go on a trip together.

132
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,040
It's much more interesting
than just staying at home.

133
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,550
Don't worry.

134
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,160
The Song Tea Plantation is on the same hill.

135
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,640
The long-term farmworkers
are always at my disposal.

136
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,760
We won't have to exhaust ourselves.

137
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:07,880
Besides,

138
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:11,000
it's not as though Deputy Chief
can force us to do manual labor.

139
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:12,550
What a joke.

140
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:13,950
You have a point.

141
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,350
Catch it.

142
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,160
Don't just focus on having fun
when you're on the hill.

143
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,550
Help me take good care of the Young Lady

144
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,390
and take care of yourself as well.

145
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,070
Don't worry.

146
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:35,600
Qi.

147
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:36,760
Here you go.

148
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:39,670
I got you some sweet rice cakes.

149
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,040
I woke up early and lined up just to buy it.

150
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,920
Mr. Zhuo, you took your time and arrived late

151
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,160
just to buy this.

152
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:44,670
That's not all.

153
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,000
There are many other things in my carriage.

154
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,760
You should ride with me later.

155
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,480
Can I ride with you?

156
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,600
What does it have to do with you?

157
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,640
This is too oily.

158
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,880
You should eat it instead.

159
00:07:58,970 --> 00:07:59,930
(Imperial College)

160
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,790
Deputy Chief is here.

161
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:01,600
Let's go.

162
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:02,880
Come on.

163
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,720
Keep your things properly.

164
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,300
(Imperial College)

165
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,480
You're going to do manual labor on this trip,

166
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,160
so you're not allowed
to bring anything unnecessary.

167
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:19,920
What?

168
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,640
That means I can't bring any of these things.

169
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,670
Besides that, our destination
is not far away this time.

170
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,110
So we will be hiking up the hill on foot

171
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,040
and tempering ourselves at the same time.

172
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,070
Hiking up the hill on foot?

173
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,760
Is he punishing us?

174
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,200
I brought all these things for nothing.

175
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,080
Young Masters.

176
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,670
Please leave behind the items
that are too inconvenient to bring for now.

177
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:43,710
The Imperial College will take
good care of it for you.

178
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,440
Go on. Hurry up.

179
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:51,440
- Forget it.
- So be it.

180
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,960
Here you go.

181
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,670
Sang Qi, look.

182
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,030
Qi.

183
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:48,880
Qi!

184
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,670
Sang Qi, are you all right?

185
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,320
Yan Yan!

186
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,350
Are you all right, Qi?

187
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,280
Come on, get up.

188
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,030
Get up quickly.

189
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:55,550
I must have sprained it.

190
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:56,640
It hurts.

191
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,030
Can you still walk?

192
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,550
No, you shouldn't walk for now.

193
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,150
I'll carry you.

194
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,110
Yan Xiao Lang.

195
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,200
Your leg has just healed fully.

196
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,520
Let me do it instead.

197
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,080
I'm always carrying Qi at the frontier anyway.

198
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,670
It's the other way around.

199
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,710
That's why it's time for me to repay my debts.

200
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,440
When a student is injured,
their teacher must bear the responsibility.

201
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:14,150
Deputy Chief.

202
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,150
Why don't you ask Sang Qi if she agrees to this?

203
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,150
I don't think it's appropriate
to drag someone away without warning.

204
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,760
This hilly path is surrounded by deep waters

205
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,760
and you are carrying your luggage.

206
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,110
Do you want Sang Qi to get injured again
if your stamina runs out

207
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,590
and another accident happens?

208
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:25,590
You!

209
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,470
That's right.

210
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,760
Deputy Chief is right.

211
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,350
It will be more troublesome
if you get injured as well.

212
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:32,880
Isn't that right, Deputy Chief?

213
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:33,670
All right, let's go.

214
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,470
Everyone, let's hurry up and continue our journey.

215
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,280
Yes, Deputy Chief.

Everyone.

234
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,080
In a short while, we'll assign you to your room
based on the room numbers on the sticks.

235
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,200
Once you reach your room,
make sure to rest properly.

236
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,400
We'll start doing the heavy work tomorrow.

237
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,320
Yes.

238
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,400
All right, hurry up and draw lots then.

239
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,790
Yes.

240
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:40,470
Ouch, my shoulders.

241
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,550
I get tired just thinking about it. Truly.

242
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:48,760
Look.

243
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,000
Let me see yours.

244
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,150
Sang Qi.

245
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,080
You don't have to draw lots.

246
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,440
You're a girl, so it would be very inconvenient.

247
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,550
You can have your own room.

248
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,880
Thank you very much for your care, Deputy Chief.

249
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:21,590
Yan Xiao Lang, why do you look so worried?

250
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,000
I'm in the same group as Song Luo Tian
and Wei Zhan Hong.

251
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,280
Zhuo.

252
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,840
Why don't we switch with each other later?

253
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,400
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.

254
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,000
I have not drawn lots.

255
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:34,670
I really hope to get the room
that is right next to Qi's room.

256
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,080
Don't you know that bandits might make trouble

257
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,350
at these secluded and deserted hills
in the middle of the night?

258
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,670
I want to be there to protect her.

259
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:44,790
"I want to be there to protect her".

260
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,960
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

261
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,000
You will be in the same room as me.

262
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,590
I'm going to add one more rule.

263
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,520
Nobody is allowed to enter
anyone else's room at night.

264
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,320
Those who break this rule
will be severely punished.

265
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,200
All right then.

266
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:12,960
Yan Xiao Lang.

267
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,790
I agree to switch rooms with you.

268
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:15,790
Forget it.

269
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,550
I'll stay with Song Luo Tian instead.

270
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,080
Didn't you say that you don't want
to be in the same room as him?

271
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:21,910
I think that Song Luo Tian

272
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,590
is much better than Deputy Chief.

273
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,080
Let's go and look for Sang Qi. Come on.

274
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:38,400
It's here, Zhuo.

275
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,110
Deputy Chief seems stern on the outside,
but he has a kind heart.

276
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,910
He said that he wanted to put us to the test

277
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,350
and gave us such tough conditions,

278
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,550
but he secretly

279
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,110
arranged such a nice room for us.

280
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,150
He even prepared this rouge and powder.

281
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,280
Deputy Chief must have prepared
rouge and powder

282
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,960
for all his students.

283
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,110
I suddenly feel rather tired.

284
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,280
I'm going to rest for a little while.

285
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,470
Why don't the both of you return first?

286
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,520
Hurry up and go back.

287
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,790
Yan Yan, I'm warning you.

288
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:17,670
If you don't go back now,

289
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,760
Song Luo Tian is going
to finish your whole fruit platter.

290
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:20,760
Go on, go on.

291
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,911
My fruit platter!

292
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:24,550
See you then.

293
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:43,750
(Good health and longevity)

294
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,550
Deputy Chief, I want to speak to you.

295
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,400
Go on then.

296
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,790
Deputy Chief, I can tell
that you're pressing on at every stage

297
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,110
and exerting great effort
and thoughts to do so many things.

298
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:05,960
But aren't you worried
that it's just one-sided love?

299
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,350
I'm not worried.

300
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,350
Everything that I do

301
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,400
is done without expecting anything in return.

302
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,840
Then you must be blinding yourself.

303
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,790
Isn't it the same for you as well?

304
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:30,200
Do you think that Qi will choose you?

305
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,080
I don't know.

306
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,470
I'm just going to go all out.

307
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,590
And you're still going to use your status
as Deputy Chief?

308
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:47,280
Are you saying that you want a fair fight?

309
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,670
That's fine with me.

310
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:54,960
All right then.

311
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,000
It's late. Let's go to bed.

312
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,820
(A place for the talented)

313
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,350
Stop fighting!

314
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:31,280
Don't fight. Stop it!

315
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,080
You had my fruit platter.

316
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,880
Stop it. Stop fighting.

317
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,470
You got into a fight again?

318
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,110
He finished the entire fruit platter in the room.

319
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:41,670
But he refuses to admit it.

320
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,000
You're just trying to pick a fight.

321
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:43,910
What fruit platter?

322
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,080
I even never saw it.

323
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,080
But there was a fruit platter from the start.

324
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,030
In fact, there were five and you ate of them!

325
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,000
Yes, that's right.

326
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:48,910
You!

327
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:49,640
There were five fruit platters!

328
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,640
The fruit platters were there from the start.

329
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,110
You must have eaten them.

330
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,590
What happened to the five fruit platters?

331
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,470
Deputy Chief is here.

332
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:54,960
Hurry up.

333
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,280
Greetings, Deputy Chief.

334
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,280
We're going to start doing the heavy work today.

335
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,320
Over here, you are no longer students.

336
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,560
You are a tea farmer.

337
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,000
Your three meals in a day

338
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,760
and all the other rules
will be according to the tea plantation.

339
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:17,680
Today, you are going

340
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,640
to get rid of the weeds,
loosen the soil, and pick tea leaves.

341
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,680
In the afternoon, we will make arrangements
to roast the tea for everyone.

342
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,680
If there is anything that you don't understand,

343
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,800
the tea farmers are here

344
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,160
to give you some guidance.

345
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,280
All your tools are here.

346
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,070
Come and take them.

347
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:38,760
Thank you very much.

348
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,040
Here, take this.

349
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,950
Deputy Chief, are you coming too?

350
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,190
To be worthy of being called your teacher,

351
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,470
I must practice what I preach.

How did you do it so fast?

356
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,800
You're faster than all of us.

357
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:23,950
Where did you learn how to do this?

358
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,800
Zhuo, you're so fast.

359
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,040
That's right, Zhuo.

360

I'm fine. I'm fine.

375
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,560
Put it down.

376
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,830
Thank you, Deputy Chief.

377
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:13,830
Qi.

378
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,350
Let's go and rest in the arbor over there.

379
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:19,430
Thank you, Deputy Chief.

380

My Young Master.

381
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,590
Why are you troubling yourself?

382
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,190
There's no need for you to do this.

383
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,070
Young Master, the way I see it,

384
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,830
you should just be honest with Miss Sang.

385
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,070
Look,

386
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:48,590
no matter what you do,

387
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,000
there will be challenges everywhere.

388
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,710
If you try and guess her feelings every day,

389
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,590
you'll end up stressing yourself
physically and mentally.

390
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,560
That's terrible.

391
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,400
Now is not the time.

392
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,310
Once we have finished investigating the matters
at the Song Tea Plantation

393
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,830
and solved all this trouble,

394
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:03,920
I will tell her everything.

395
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,470
Bai Shi.

396
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,190
There are too many people watching
during the daytime.

397
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,680
We will start examining again later at night.

398
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,350
Yes, Young Master.

399
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,110
What are you holding?

400
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:13,000
It's nothing.

401
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,760
Do you have any more?

402
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,800
No, I don't.

403
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,350
Are you sure?

404
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,470
Then what is this?

405
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:20,160
Give it to me.

406
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,350
Sang Qi.

407
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,470
I brought a wild fruit for you

408
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:38,520
to help you cool down.

409
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,560
Thank you, Deputy Chief.

410
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:44,590
Here you go.

411
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,000
Deputy Chief, you've worked hard.

412
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,000
You should eat it instead.

413
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:53,470
I have one too.

414
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,350
Sang Qi.

415
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,680
Guess who's here?

416
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,280
Lian Pian's here.

417
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:09,310
How did you know?

418
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,280
Of course, I'd know.

419
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,070
I recognize this box.

420
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:11,640
Moreover,

421
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,190
your face is about to burst into a smile.

422
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,680
How could I not know who is here?

423
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,880
Lian Pian is here to give you some food.

424
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:17,950
Where is she?

425
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,680
She's waiting for you under the arbor.

426
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,160
Young Lady.

427
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,830
Our work this morning is nearly finished.

428
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,710
You should go and rest.

429
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,280
Thank you very much, Deputy Chief.

430
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:31,350
Let's go.

431
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:31,920
Come on.

432
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,710
Let's go. Hurry up!

433
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,640
Lian Pian!

434
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:40,880
Young Lady.

435
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:41,710
Look.

436
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,110
I've prepared so many desserts for you.

437
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,400
There's even tea.

438
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,950
Young Lady, have some tea.

439
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,230
Lian Pian, you said that you came to see me,

440
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,430
but all the desserts you brought
are Yan Xiao Lang's favorites.

441
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:08,160
Well, his wounds have just healed,

442
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,830
so I happened to bring some desserts for him too.

443
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,070
You just happened to do it?

444
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,560
They're all his favorites.

445
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,040
You didn't bring any that I like.

446
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,950
I'll bring more for you next time, all right?

447
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,280
Young Lady, please don't be angry.

448
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:22,640
Please don't be angry.

449
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,470
Oh, right.

450
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,800
Why haven't I seen Mr. Zhuo today?

451
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,880
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

452
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,680
I must admit that you're skilled
at getting rid of weeds,

453
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,830
but you pick tea leaves like an amateur.

454
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,880
Deputy Chief, you're not that good
at picking tea leaves either.

455
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,400
It's almost the same as mine.

456
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,680
You only say that because you can't tell that
they were carefully chosen for their quality.

457
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:58,760
Deputy Chief, the tea leaves that you picked

458
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,040
look rather average to me.

459
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,110
Nothing special.

460
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:09,560
The right way to pick tea leaves
is by lifting them.

461
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,160
Using your fingers to tear them off
is the worst way to do it.

462
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,110
I avoided the ends of the leaves
when I picked them

463
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,830
to make sure that the tea plant's new shoots
for the next season were not affected.

464
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:15,590
Meanwhile, you

465
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,560
were clearly short-sighted.

466
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,680
Deputy Chief.

467
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,190
You couldn't even dodge that.

468
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,520
That's so troublesome.

469
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,280
I finally understand

470
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,350
why Deputy Chief refused to marry Miss Su Jie Yu.

471
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,680
Apparently, there was a painful secret behind it.

472
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,640
No wonder both of them
are always at each other's throats lately.

473
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:04,880
Stop it. Stop making up rumors!

474
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,280
That's enough.

475
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,470
If both of you want to keep talking nonsense,

476
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:08,680
you should go and write some
storytelling scripts.

477
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:11,470
Lian Pian.

478
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,070
Let's go over there and take a look.

479
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,430
All right. Let's take a look.

480
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:16,160
Come on, let's go.

481
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,310
Lian Pian, weren't you here to visit me?

482
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,470
Hey! I...

483
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,000
I'm telling you. The both of them are not just...

484
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,110
Since everyone has been hard at work,

485
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,520
once we have roasted the tea leaves
in the afternoon,

486
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,710
we will let all of you taste the tea,

487
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,350
so you can enjoy the fruits of your labor.

488
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:40,110
That sounds great!

489
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,070
Students.

490
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:43,190
Later on,

491
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,470
please bring me

492
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,350
the tea leaves that you picked by yourself.

493
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,430
Once the tea leaves have been roasted,

494
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,350
I will give you some of the finished product

495
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,350
so that you can try the tea leaves
that you picked.

496
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,640
It will have a distinct taste
compared to the teas

497
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,950
that you usually drink.

498
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,470
Great.

499
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,920
- Great!
- That's amazing.

500
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,640
Deputy Chief, since we're going to taste the tea,

501
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,800
we must pay attention to certain things.

502
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,560
However, how can we do this without a tea master?

503
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,160
That's right.

504
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:04,800
None of us knows how to perform a tea ceremony.

505
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,230
We shouldn't ruin this excellent tea.

506
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,310
Why don't we let Sang Qi be the tea master for now?

507
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,920
Lian Pian can help her as well.

508
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,230
Yes!

509
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,800
You want me to make the tea?

510
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,160
Sang Qi.

511
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,230
Do you know how to perform a tea ceremony?

512
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,710
I...

513
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,280
You won't have to work if you make the tea

514
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,110
and Lian Pian can stay too.

515
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,190
You can just pretend to do it later.

516
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:33,800
Get lost.

517
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:34,430
As you wish.

518
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,950
My older brother taught me
how to perform a tea ceremony years ago.

519
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,470
I... I can give it a go.

520
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,350
Yes, I can try.

521
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,190
In that case, it's settled.

522
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:01,710
Young Lady.

523
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,350
I brought some water from the well for you.

524
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,880
Do you still remember how Young Master
taught you to make tea?

525
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,350
Pretty much.

526
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,470
Rinse the cup, put in the tea leaves, wash them,

527
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,920
let it brew, and finally serve the tea.

528
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,520
Let's go.

529
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:25,590
Qi.

530
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:26,560
Brew my tea leaves first.

531
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:30,520
Deputy Chief.

532
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:31,880
I was here first.

533
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,710
Respect your elders.

534
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:35,110
Don't you know this simple practice?

535
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,070
Is this what you meant by being fair?

536
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,070
Fine.

537
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,520
Sang Qi will decide then.

538
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,590
Sang Qi, brew my tea.

539
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,950
No, brew mine.

540
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:44,400
Actually, brewing tea...

541
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,350
Brew my tea.

542
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,190
As for the tea...

543
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:46,830
That's enough!

544
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,520
Will you go so far just to brew tea?

545
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,640
To be honest, your behavior

546
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,560
is scaring me a little.

547
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:58,560
Yan Yan.

548
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,230
Present!

549
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,000
Let me brew your tea.

550
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:05,110
I wanted Lian Pian to do it for me.

551
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:08,560
Get lost.

552
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,350
All right.

553
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,400
In that case,

554
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,350
you can brew my tea.

555
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,400
But this...

556
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,800
A tea ceremony

557
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,950
is supposed to be an elegant affair.

558
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:19,640
Isn't that right?

559
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,430
We should just stay calm
and not be impatient. All right?

560
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:21,950
Stay calm and don't be impatient.

561
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,040
- Deputy Chief!
- Deputy Chief!

562
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,000
Deputy Chief! Deputy Chief!

563
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,680
Come on.

564
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,920
Don't you know martial arts?

565
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,310
Why didn't you deflect it?

566
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:14,000
Are you all right? Is it still scalding?

567
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,520
Does it still hurt?

568
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:18,470
Say something.

569
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,800
Are you all right?

570
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:23,160
I'm fine.

571
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:24,800
Soak it here for a little while.

572
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,310
(Braving the cold)

573
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,800
Young Lady, I can tell

574
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,350
that Deputy Chief Yan is really
interested in you.

575
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,190
Didn't you also say

576
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,070
that he has been acting weird lately?

577
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,640
Don't tell me that you still don't understand?

578
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,680
Of course, I understand.

579
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:46,160
I'm also aware that he treats me well.

580
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:50,470
But I'm not sure

581
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:52,880
if he's just doing it

582
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,280
because I'm his old friend's younger sister,

583
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,560
his student,

584
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,830
or his martial sister.

585
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,310
If you want to know the answer,

586
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,070
you can't just rely on guessing.

587
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,680
Young Lady, I'm leaving now.

588
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,760
Take care.

589
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:07,800
Please take care of yourself as well.

590
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:11,770
(Braving the cold)

591
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,350
(Good health and longevity)

592
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,920
Deputy Chief! Deputy Chief!

593
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:54,590
Come on.

594
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:57,880
Don't you know martial arts?

595
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,160
Why didn't you deflect it?

596
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,710
Young Master.

597
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,800
We have walked one whole round
and examined the area.

598
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,400
Did you discover anything?

599
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,590
The soil here is moist,

600
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,760
so it's unsuitable for the plants
that grow in Xizhao.

601
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,310
Could it be that we mistakenly went
to the wrong place?

602
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:32,190
I have a feeling that it's somewhere nearby.

603
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,470
We just haven't discovered it yet.

604
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,160
Then we should go elsewhere and take a look.

605
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,400
Bai Shi.

606
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,190
Yes.

607
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:38,950
They will probably strengthen
their defenses at night.

608
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:39,710
Be careful.

609
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,110
Let's split up.

610
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,070
Yes, Young Master.

611
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:02,830
Deputy Chief.

612
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,640
Sang Qi.

613
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,230
It's really late. What are you doing here?

614
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,070
Deputy Chief, is your hand all right?

615
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,280
It's fine now.

616
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,400
That's good.

617
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:34,000
Deputy Chief, why did you protect me
instead of taking care of yourself?

618
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,950
Because you inherited your tea
ceremony skills from Sang Yu.

619
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,470
I didn't want his special skills
to be lost forever.

620
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,110
(I see. So it was still for my brother's sake.)

621
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:46,830
Qi.

622
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,590
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

623
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,680
It's so late. You should be in bed.

624
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,760
Why are you out here?

625
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,560
I could ask you both the same thing, Deputy Chief.

626
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:54,680
I couldn't sleep at night,

627
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,470
so I came out to take a walk

628
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,680
and ran into Deputy Chief.

629
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,590
I couldn't sleep as well,

630
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,590
so I came out to stretch my legs.

631
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:02,400
Qi, why don't we do this instead?

632
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,470
I'll go for a walk with you.

633
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,110
It's late, don't walk around.

634
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,000
You have to work again tomorrow.

635
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,680
Go back earlier and get some rest.

636
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,880
Qi, don't wander around
in the middle of the night anymore.

637
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,520
What will you do if you encounter a bandit?

638
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:16,880
Anyway,

639
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,800
Deputy Chief and I can send you back together.

640
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:25,830
Let's go.

641
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:41,310
It's so early.

642
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:42,470
Good morning.

643
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,830
Good morning, Deputy Chief.

644
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:48,800
Today,

645
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:50,920
you will continue to work
according to the tea plantation's schedule.

646
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,190
You must be attentive
and you cannot slack no matter what.

647
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:55,160
Go on.

648
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:57,470
Yes.

649
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,520
Come on, liven up.

650
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,830
It's time to work.

651
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:13,590
Young Master.

652
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,710
I'll go and work with the students
at the border of the tea plantation.

653
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,280
Is it time for us to put our plan into action?

654
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:19,110
Yes, let's do everything according to the plan.

655
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:20,040
Understood.

656
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,000
Put in more effort.

657
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:48,110
How is Song Luo Tian so relaxed?

658
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,520
Isn't he worried about getting punished
if we don't finish our work?

659
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,160
There will be time for him to cry.

660
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,800
Liu.

661
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:57,710
Young Master.

662
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,190
Tell a few of them to come over.

663
00:33:59,190 --> 00:33:59,830
Yes, Young Master.

664
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:02,190
San, Hu, Niu, and Liu.

665
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,070
All of you, come over here.

666
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,190
Hurry up.

667
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,310
Are you asking to be punished?

668
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,920
Get rid of all the weeds here for me.

669
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:10,070
Song Luo Tian.

670
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,760
Are you taking advantage of them to slack off?

671
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:13,590
I'm using my brain.

672
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,360
You can ask your servants to come and help too.

673
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:17,950
I'm not as shameless as you.

674
00:34:17,950 --> 00:34:19,670
I would not cruelly exploit
the long-term farmworkers.

675
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,670
It's not my fault that your family
doesn't own a tea plantation.

676
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,150
Get rid of the weeds quickly.

677
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,800
Get rid of the weeds

678
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,800
and throw them at Yan Yan.

679
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,670
He could use the fertilizer.

680
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:29,470
Song Luo Tian.

681
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:30,800
Are you asking for a beating?

682
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,630
Do you think I'm scared of you?

683
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:32,630
Come on. Bring it on!

684
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,520
Get me some tools.

685
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:36,190
I will rely on what I have to take you down today.

686
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:39,760
Song Luo Tian and Yan Xiao Lang
are about to go at it again.

687
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,390
Aren't you going to advise them?

688
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:44,760
No.

689
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,710
Yan Yan, you must be insane.

690
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,230
I have so many people on my side.

691
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,870
Didn't you ask me to come over?

692
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:55,600
You're a coward now?

693
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,870
Why would I be afraid of you?

694
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,670
Wei Zhan Hong.

695
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,120
Don't hold me back! I'm going to...

696
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:04,560
Hit him!

697
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:05,390
I...

698
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,630
I'm going to teach you a lesson.

699
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,670
If you say so.

700
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,230
Song Luo Tian, you dare to hold it, huh?

701
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,710
Come on.

702
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:14,950
Hit him.

703
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,190
Teach him a lesson. Come on!

704
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:17,470
Hit him, hit him!

705
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,150
Do it.

706
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:18,910
Why don't you hit me over here?

707
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:19,870
Don't hold me back!

708
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:20,670
I'm going to beat him up.

709
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,600
Come on, hit me.

710
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:22,870
Hit him.

711
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,360
Do it.

712
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,040
Calm down, calm down.

713
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,800
Song Luo Tian, are you crazy?

714
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,520
You're fighting again.

715
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,470
Song, you're classmates.

716
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,430
Must you really do this?

717
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:38,360
Yan Yan, I...
I'll teach you a lesson sooner or later!

718
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:41,230
If you have guts, you'd better
not return to the room.

719
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:43,280
Fine, I'll wait for you in the room.

720
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:45,600
Let's go.

721
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:50,560
Idiot.

722
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:57,870
Here you go.

723
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,280
Miss Su, you came just in time.

724
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,000
And you even brought so many tasty dishes for us.

725
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,390
Yes, thank you very much, Miss Su.

726
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:09,000
I knew that you were working hard
on the plantation,

727
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,280
so I came over to visit.

728
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,280
Everyone, please help yourselves. Don't be shy.

729
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:13,600
Let's eat.

730
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:22,360
Qi.

731
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,320
Why do you look so worried today?

732
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:24,950
You're acting strange.

733
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,390
No, I'm not.

734
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,760
Perhaps I'm just too tired.

735
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:29,760
You should return to your room and rest

736
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,390
after lunch.

737
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:32,000
I'll inform Deputy Chief
that you've taken your leave in a while.

738
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:32,870
- There's no need.
- Please don't be shy.

739
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,040
Have some more.

740
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,950
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

741
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:43,360
Qi, you're back.

742
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,280
I purposely prepared the food you like.

743
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:46,430
Please have a seat.

744
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,190
I made these flaky pastries by myself.

745
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:52,840
This looks really good.

746
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,520
Please try it.

747
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,080
Thank you very much.

748
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,950
Greetings, Deputy Chief.

749
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,040
Yun Zhi, you're back.

750
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:08,800
Please have a seat.

751
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:15,120
Yan Yan.

752
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:23,360
Something exciting is about to begin.

753
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:24,560
I think so too.

754
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:50,390
Why aren't you eating?

755
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,710
Don't let Lan's efforts go to waste.

756
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,520
Qi. Yun Zhi.

757
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,470
Could it be that you don't like these dishes?

758
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,950
How could that be? It's delicious.

759
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:05,800
Yes, it's delicious.

760
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,950
We have more work to do in the afternoon.
Make sure that you eat more.

761
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,190
Thank you, Deputy Chief.

762
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:22,710
Zhuo, you should eat as well.

763
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:34,630
Yun Zhi.

764
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,760
I heard that the students of the Imperial College
suddenly came to work in the tea plantation.

765
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:40,910
Moreover, this plantation is nearby
the Song Tea Plantation.

766
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,520
So I guessed that working on
the tea plantation was just an excuse

767
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,870
while the real reason that you're here
is to investigate the case.

768
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,760
That's why I purposely rushed here to help you.

769
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:49,800
Yun Zhi.

770
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,840
(Good health and longevity)
Is there anything that I can do?

771
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:58,840
Lan.

772
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,870
From now on, it would be better

773
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:03,120
if you did not involve yourself
in the matters that concern me.

774
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:06,760
Yun Zhi, I'm worried about you.

775
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,230
I've already made myself very clear.

776
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,080
It's very inconvenient for you to be here.

777
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,000
Perhaps you should return to Bianjing now.

778
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,870
Song Luo Tian, get up right now.

779
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:53,870
What are you doing?

780
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,280
I don't care about what schemes you're plotting.

781
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,910
But unless you're a coward, you'd better not
be planning some tricks here.

782
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:58,520
I dare you to finish our fight in the open.

783
00:39:58,630 --> 00:39:59,630
Are you insane?

784
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,150
It's the middle of the night. Why aren't you asleep?

785
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,620
(Su)

786
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:32,910
Young Lady.

787
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,950
Deputy Chief Yan is so insensitive.

788
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:37,230
Young Lady, you humbled yourself to this level.

789
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:38,840
However, not only was he ungrateful

790
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,040
he even chased you away.

791
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,430
Perhaps Yun Zhi

792
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,360
was busy with certain matters.

793
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,840
Young Lady, you're even making excuses for him.

794
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:50,760
I've heard that Deputy Chief

795
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,080
made special arrangements
for Sang Qi to have her own room.

796
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,230
He shows great concern for her.

797
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:57,320
Sang Qi may also have developed feelings
for Deputy Chief by now.

798
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:59,560
If they continue getting involved
with each other like this,

799
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,760
I worry that...

800
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,360
Who is it?

801
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,870
Miss Sang, your food is here.

802
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,150
Zhuo Wen Yuan, why are you here?

803
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,080
I noticed that you looked really worried today,

804
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,630
so I purposely asked someone

805
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,390
to order drunken fish and vintage wine
from Qingfeng Restaurant for you

806
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:38,950
to cheer you up.

807
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,390
I'm not hungry.

808
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:43,430
Don't let anyone else see this.

809
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:48,600
Why are you just staring blankly?

810
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,560
You get to witness a beautiful scene on a fine day

811
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:51,910
with a handsome man and vintage wine.

812
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:52,560
What else do you want?

813
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:54,950
Come on, have a drink with me.

814
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,710
I told you. I'm not hungry
and I don't feel like eating.

815
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:00,190
In that case, I'll enjoy the meal by myself.

816
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,080
Can't you enjoy it by yourself in your own room?

817
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,080
I sneaked all this food and drinks here.

818
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,360
We cannot let Deputy Chief find out.

819
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,560
If I go back now, I will end up exposing myself.

820
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:13,360
I'll leave once I have finished eating.

821
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:14,360
I won't delay your bedtime.

822
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:16,120
Will you really leave once you're done?

823
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,150
If you have something to say to me,

824
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:21,870
that's fine too.

825
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:23,080
I can chat with you for a little while.

00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:24,230
I have nothing to say to you.

827
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:27,910
Then why don't you tell me

828
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,080
about what happened to you recently?

829
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,230
Nothing much.

830
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:35,040
Perhaps I'm just a little tired.

831
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:40,000
Who could that be at this hour?

832
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,710
Don't tell me that Deputy Chief is here
to check the rooms?
