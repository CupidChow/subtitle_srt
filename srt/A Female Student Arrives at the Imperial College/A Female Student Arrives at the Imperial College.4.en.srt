Imperial Physician Wen is here.

29
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:42,910
Quickly.

30
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,440
Imperial Physician Wen is here.

31
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,480
Imperial Physician Wen is here.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,270
Imperial Physician Wen, save her.

33
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,160
How rude of you, Deputy Chief Yan.

34
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,760
You whisked me halfway.

35
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,510
I...

36
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,160
I'll apologize to you another day.

37
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:56,870
Now please save her.

38
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,310
Alright.

39
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,550
I'll save her first.

40
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,510
Now where's the patient?

41
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,510
-Inside.
-In the house.

42
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,510
Hurry.

43
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,870
Deputy Chief Yan.

44
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,270
How did you bring Imperial Physician Wen here?

45
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,510
I heard that he's good at detoxification,

46
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,160
so I sent someone to the mansion to look for him.

47
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,960
Then I was told that Imperial Physician Wen
was on his way to his hometown,

48
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,800
so I followed him all the way.

49
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,110
That's how I found him.

50
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,910
What about you, Yan San Lang?

51
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,670
I rushed back as soon as I heard

52
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,440
that your daughter was poisoned.

53
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,830
It happened in Imperial College.
It must be thoroughly investigated.

54
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,190
Thank you both.

55

Zhuo Wen Yuan.

56
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:33,320
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

57
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,520
How is she?

58
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,160
(Qi.)

59
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,800
(Get well soon.)

60
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,080
I just don't get it.

61
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,190
It says it's a laxative.

62
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,830
How did it get Sang Qi poisoned?

63
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,390
Were you the only one there

64
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,160
when it happened?

65
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,470
Of course I was.

66
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,440
Even I have no idea...

67
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,360
what happened.

68
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,270
Song.

69
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,910
My father put a lot of effort

70
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,110
to send me to the Imperial College.

71
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,630
You have to help me.

72
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,160
I don't want to be kicked out

73
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,030
because of this.

74
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,160
Stop panicking.

75
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,190
They haven't found anything on us.

76
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,720
Now keep calm.

77
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:17,750
Hurry up.

78
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:19,190
See your father.

79

(Muyan Pavilion)

81
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,830
Imperial Physician Wen
detoxified Sang Qi, didn't he?

82
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,600
Why is she still in a coma?

83
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,640
Qi Lang.

84
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,390
Is Sang Qi's case

85
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,670
just like Sang Yu's?

86
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,070
Yes.

87
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,510
Both are hallucinogenic.

88
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:03,920
Qi Lang.

89
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,760
They've started investigations.

90
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,550
The meals are used as evidence

91
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,550
and are locked away
at the Imperial College's cold storage.

92
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:10,920
You know that.

93
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,390
The powder from the crime scene,

94
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,160
has Prefecture Court figured out what it is?

95
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:19,510
I haven't heard from them.

96
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,350
I have a friend who's into pharmaceuticals.

97
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,270
I'll write a letter to her for help.

98
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:30,830
Qi Lang.

99
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,760
You caught a wind chill last night.

100
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,040
You should go home and rest early.

101
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:34,880
I'll stay here.

102
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,110
I'm fine.

103
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,640
I'll leave when Sang Qi stabilizes.

104
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:40,920
You should leave now.

105
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,200
In that case,

106
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,670
I'll go back to Prefecture Court.

107
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,950
You're still here, Deputy Chief.

108
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,790
How's Sang Qi doing?

109
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,350
She woke up briefly.

110
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,760
Then she went back to sleep.

111
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,950
Deputy Chief, I'm going to fetch some warm water.

112
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,440
Please take care of her.

113
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,000
Brother.

114
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:15,640
Brother.

115
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,550
Brother, I don't feel so good.

116
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,390
Brother.

117
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,480
Am I dead?

118
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,830
Deputy Chief.

119
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,110
I...

120
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,600
I heard you hum my brother's song.

121
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,920
There's no mistaking it.

122
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,720
I'll just be frank.

123
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,480
I know your brother, Yu.

124
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,830
Then why didn't you say so?

125
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,790
I'll explain later.

126
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,600
For now, let's put this aside.

127
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:37,830
I could study well at the Imperial College.

128
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,550
But when I am home, I'm seriously ill.

129
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,350
It happened suddenly.

130
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,710
You got poisoned after your meal,

131
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,840
and fainted in my study.

132
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,200
Poisoned?

133
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,200
Who would poison me?

134
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,520
Maybe they were aiming at me.

135
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,520
So...

136
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:01,640
You have enemies?

137
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,550
I once helped Prefecture Court
in their investigation.

138
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,400
I might have offended someone in the process.

139
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,840
Did you find the poisoner?

140
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:09,350
Not yet.

141
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,590
But the authorities have
already locked the food evidence

142
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,280
in the Imperial College's cold storage.

143
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,520
We'll get to the bottom of this.

144
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,550
Okay.

145
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,710
When I recover,

146
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,200
I'll join you to find the poisoner.

147
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,350
Put that thought to rest.

148
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,440
Your health matters more now.

149
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,520
You must get better soon.

150
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,230
Master Sang!

151
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,400
Master Sang!

152
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,350
Master Sang!

153
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,030
Keep it down!

154
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:37,640
Hey.

155
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,670
You are so crass.

156
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,760
Who are you?

157
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,320
Don't you recognize me?

158
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,960
I'm the best friend of your Young Lady.

159
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,790
Step aside.

160
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,110
How rude of you

161
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:52,960
to break in like this.

162
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,790
You don't look like a friend of hers.

163
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,150
Are you an impostor?

164
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,200
Zhuo, she doesn't even recognize me.

165
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:00,670
How is Sang Qi?

166
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,280
She's asleep.

167
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,550
Deputy Chief is watching over her.

168
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,200
Deputy Chief is inside?

169
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,550
Let me go and have a look.

170
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,550
Why he can go in,

171
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,440
but not me?

172
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,710
You flipped my basin,

173
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:14,640
so you have to pick it up for me.

174
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,440
Do I have to?

175
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,960
Or you're not going anywhere.

176
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,110
Step aside.

177
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:19,640
Nope.

178
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,350
Step aside!

179
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:20,880
I won't!

180
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,760
Fine, just you wait.

181
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,000
Out of my way!

182
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,440
Why are you so reckless?

183
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,470
Go away!

184
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,080
Fine.

185
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,280
Deputy Chief.

186
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,400
Back then, my brother...

187
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,470
You're here too, Deputy Chief.

188
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,640
Have you found the culprit?

189
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,790
Qi didn't make any enemies
when she first came to Bianjing.

190
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,960
Who could've done such a thing?

191
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,590
Zhuo Wen Yuan,

192
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,080
you're well informed.

193
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,350
Did you come across

194
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,470
anyone suspicious on the day of the incident?

195
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,230
No.

196
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,710
I'll get someone to investigate later.

197
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,230
Qi, are you okay?

198
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:23,790
Did you take your medicine?

199
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,670
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

200
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,520
Take good care of her.

201
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,080
Sang Qi, I have to go now.

202
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,870
(Grand Hall)

203
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,150
(Dear Lan)
(I have a request for you.)

204
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:58,280
(Recently, I encountered
several poisoning incidents,)

205
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,110
(which I found very strange.)

206
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,320
(Very strange)

207
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,750
(A poem wrote to describe Deputy Chief)

208
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,150
"Deputy is stationed for years."

209
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,400
"Chief goes after the sun."

210
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,230
"Is it not pleasure to the forest?"

211
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,440
"In all the universe there is glory."

212
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,880
"Human heart is for one to judge."

213
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,710
"Deputy Chief is inhuman".

214
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:53,520
Bai Shi.

215
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,350
Yes?

216
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,670
(To Lan)
Send this letter to Nanshan Manor.

217
00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,710
It's urgent.

218
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:00,960
To Miss Su?

219
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,230
Yes, Young Master.

220
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:14,520
Here.

221
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,230
Lian Pian.

222
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:22,710
Stop feeding me.

223
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,320
I'm much better now.

224
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,760
Are you?

225
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,670
You look pale to me.

226
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,350
Have some more.

227
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,110
No.

228
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,880
I am not poisoned that badly.

229
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,640
Besides,

230
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,080
my body is tough.

231
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:33,710
By the way,

232
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,350
remember to help me get packed.

233
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,910
I'm going back to school tomorrow.

234
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,000
No, you're not.

235
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,910
The Imperial College is closed today.

236
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,470
What's there to learn on New Year's Day?

237
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,280
It's today?

238
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,400
Why didn't you say so?

239
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,470
Just lie down.

240
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,710
You're still sick.

241
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:50,640
Don't even think about going anywhere.

242
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,590
I'm going to get you something to eat.

243
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,080
(I can't enter the Imperial College
when the gates are closed.)

244
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,910
(If the culprit and the poison are still not found...)

245
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,230
(Deputy Chief could still be in danger.)

246
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:20,960
Yan Yan.

247
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,550
We are having a vacation.

248
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,550
Let's get something to drink.

249
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:24,670
Forget it.

250
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,030
See this box?

251
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,080
This is the homework my mother made me do.

252
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,470
Come on.

253
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,960
-It's just homework. It can't stop you.
-Don't go!

254
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,000
Come on, drink with us.

255
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,200
No!

256
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,280
Just a shot or two.

257
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,150
Yeah.

258
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,910
They brought in new wine, and it tastes great!

259
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,880
Come on, just a few shots.

260
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,960
My mom doesn't allow me!

261
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:45,400
Come on.

262
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,350
Leave me alone, I'm in a hurry!

263
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,590
Don't go.

264
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,820
(Xishi Pavilion)

265
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,030
(It's not sealed.)

266
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,880
Who's there?

267
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,470
The cold storage is a restricted area!

268
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:15,670
Who dares to intrude?

269
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,200
No one there?

270
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,640
Let's go.

271
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,150
I'm warning you.

272
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:45,520
Don't mess with me in this crisis.

273
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:48,880
But...

274
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,350
Are you kidding?

275
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,670
Me, messing with you?

276
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,470
I wouldn't dare to do that.

277
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,200
Besides,

278
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,840
I never messed with you.

279
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,200
So watch your mouth.

280
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,470
Just ignore my words.

281
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,880
Why are you here?

282
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,150
I...

283
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,830
I may not punish you for this.

284
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,400
But don't tell anyone else

285
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,680
that we met here.

286
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:17,560
Otherwise,

287
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,950
I'll make you copy the entire library.

288
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,040
Deputy Chief.

289
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:26,590
I'm a girl who is ready to get married.

290
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:28,040
Why would I tell anyone

291
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,560
that we're alone in the same room?

292
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,800
You make it sound like I'm...

293
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,800
Why do you have to cause so much trouble?

294
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:01,590
I don't know.

295
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,560
All I did was this...

296
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,350
Deputy Chief, look here.

297
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:16,470
What is it?

298
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:18,470
This.

299
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:19,830
What's that?

300
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:20,520
Bean sprouts.

301
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,230
What bean sprouts?

302
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,000
The bean sprouts I made that day.

303
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,310
Why didn't you say so?

304
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,280
I told you so, didn't I?

305
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:29,760
Do you have a handkerchief?

306
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,190
Give me your hairpin.

307
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,430
Could this be the poison?

308
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,640
We'll see about that.

309
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,190
There's no time to waste.

310
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,880
Let's take out this piece of evidence.

311
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,110
Let's go.

312
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,680
What's wrong?

313
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,040
I can't open it.

314
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:33,830
Hello?

315
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,350
It's no use.

316
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,280
The door is locked from outside.

317
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:40,560
Unless someone comes to help us,

318
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:41,920
we'll both freeze to death here

319
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,880
tonight.

320
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,520
Someone!

321
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,400
Anyone there?

322
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,710
Help!

323
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,830
What are you doing?

324
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,520
I'm making some noise

325
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,680
so that the guards will hear and get us out of here.

326
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:10,560
Deputy Chief.

327
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,000
Once they come, you just rush out

328
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,920
and leave me here.

329
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,470
You knocked down the back shelf just now,

330
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,830
but no people heard it.

331
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,310
Do you think there is someone

332
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,190
who can hear you whacking the door now?

333
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:21,800
You are right.

334
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,920
What should we do?

335
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,230
Before we die,

336
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,710
we should do something meaningful.

337
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,600
(Boldness of vision)

338
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:05,800
Lian Pian,

339
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,110
is Qi home?

340
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,040
No.

341
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,830
She disappeared as soon
as I came back after decocting the medicine.

342
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,310
She hasn't fully recovered.

343
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,070
Once Master finds out about this,

344
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,800
he's going to kill me.

345
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,880
Is her uniform still there?

346
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,350
Well,

347
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,430
I didn't notice it before.

348
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,190
I see.

349
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,280
Don't worry, I'll get her back safe and sound.

350
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:49,950
Deputy Chief.

351
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,310
Do you like watching fireworks?

352
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,920
Fireworks?

353
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:55,000
Yes.

354
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,310
I love watching fireworks so much.

355
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,800
They shoot up high in the sky

356
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,560
and blast into bouquets.

357
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,470
Beautiful and gorgeous.

358
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:08,000
Thinking of it

359
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,310
makes me feel warm inside.

360
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:14,520
Way warmer than eating steamed lamb

361
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,710
right off the pan.

362
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,880
Every New Year's Eve,

363
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,280
my father would take me to see the fireworks.

364
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:25,350
When I go out, I'd feel so cold.

365
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,280
And then there are the fireworks,

366
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,950
and I get all warm and cozy inside of me.

367
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,950
As if they drove away my chills.

368
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,110
It was amazing.

369
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,710
My brother loved fireworks too.

370
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,430
Don't you feel warm inside

371
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,760
when you think of fireworks?

372
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:57,040
"A thousand lanterns light up the trees
as seven blossoms of ember bloom."

373
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,520
Something like that.

374
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,640
Every year,

375
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:03,310
my brother would prepare fireworks for me.

376
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:05,950
But now...

377
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,040
Deputy Chief.

378
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,920
You're not like your usual self today.

379
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,640
You even took care of me.

380
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,040
What's so unusual about me?

381
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,160
Isn't it a teacher's sacred duty

382
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,710
to care for his student?

383
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,710

You're mad at me?

482
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,190
As Deputy Chief of Imperial College,
I even had to resort to lying

483
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:30,590
just to keep you alive.

484
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,520
So you don't lie that often?

485
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,830
I could make a list of your lies.

486
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,520
Why don't you get off and walk by yourself?

487
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,950
I'll make the list the other day.

493
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,400

It's a long story.

495
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,680
What brings you here, Deputy Chief?

496
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:34,680
I went to find evidence,

497
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,950
but accidentally got trapped in the cold storage.

498
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,680
He kindly saved me.

499
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,430
It's the authorities' job to investigate.

500
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,070

I will take you inside.

504
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,950
Return the robe to the Deputy Chief.

505
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,680
It's okay.

506
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:02,350

513
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,950
Xizhao is a thousand miles away from us.

514
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,520
Why would this poison

515
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,430
end up in ​​Bianjing?

516
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:47,830
You may leave.

517
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,680
Don't let it hurt you.

518
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:53,280
Yes, Young Master.

519
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,590
Be careful.

520
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:08,180
(These animals are artificial props)

521
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,760
(It causes swelling in the eyes
and arching of the spine.)

522
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:27,590
(It's the same poison.)

523
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:37,910
(A letter from Lan to Yun Zhi)

524
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:39,800
(New Year's Eve)

525
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,110
Great!

526
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,070
It's so beautiful!

527
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:47,110
Great!

528
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,800
So beautiful.

529
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:03,400
Good!

530
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:08,230
Whoa! Great!

531
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,350
Why did I make up such a dream?

532
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,110
Young Lady, you are awake.

533
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,800
Sounds like they're having
a blast outside. What is it?

534
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,640
Young Lady.

535
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:45,560
Today is New Year's Eve.

536
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,230
It's New Year's Eve?

537
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:49,000
So soon?

538
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:50,950
Where's my father?

539
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:53,640
Master went into the palace
to celebrate with His Majesty.

540
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,710
I see.

541
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:58,590
Then let's get ready to eat.

542
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:00,520
I almost forgot.

543
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,800
Young Master Zhuo has been waiting
for you in the pavilion.

544
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,000
Zhuo Wen Yuan?

545
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:16,910
(Muyan Pavilion)

546
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:17,430
You're here.

547
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,840
I even made a fire for you.

548
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:21,520
Come on.

549
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,190
You have just recovered,

550
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,150
so you'd better not catch a cold.

551
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:29,520
You prepared so much for me.
I appreciate that.

552
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,000
Try it.

553
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,710
Slow down. No one's stealing your food.

554
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:57,360
Is something the matter?

555
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:00,630
Are you not happy with any of my food?

556
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:02,760
No.

557
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,840
I suddenly remembered the good old days.

558
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,910
Back in those days,

559
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:10,360
my father would hold

560
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,800
a New Year's fireworks party every year.

561
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:15,800
Although the frontier fortress
was sparsely populated,

562
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:17,760
it was also lively.

563
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,840
But here in the bustling Bianjing,

564
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,280
ironically, I feel a lot lonelier.

565
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:27,120
After New Year's Eve,

566
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,080
before you know it, it's the Lantern Festival.

567
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:32,280
And when the Lantern Festival comes,

568
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,320
that's when I'd play music.

569
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,910
All right, now get over it.

570
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:44,430
Eat up.

571
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:06,370
(Muyan Pavilion)

572
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,120
Young Master.

573
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:24,230
Usually, you dislike the smoke
coming out of the fireworks.

574
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,230
But now, you're putting up so many of them.

575
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:27,800
How long are you going to do it?

576
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,320
It's as if the setter of the fireworks

577
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,710
could read my mind.

578
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:42,150
Maybe they're also telling me not to give up.

579
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:50,320
Look.

580
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,910
There's yellow, red, green, purple, blue.

581
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,120
(Yu.)

582
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,390
(I will take care of her for you.)

583
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:34,670
If you really care about me,

584
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,320
you might as well accept my pouch.

585
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,320
I beg you.

586
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,280
Why are you still thinking about this?

587
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,470
If we can really get out alive,

588
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:45,120
I'll think about it, okay?

589
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,360
Young Lady, it's time to get dressed up.

590
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,600
I've prepared your garment.

591
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:04,770
(Sang)

592
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:05,870
Well?

593
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,360
Still thinking about your pouch?

594
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,230
I've been thinking it over,

595
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,560
and I thought it was hasty of me

596
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,870
to offer my pouch like that.

597
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,870
Tomorrow, I'm officially going

598
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:17,190
to bring my pouch over to Yan's place

599
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,390
and see if he accepts it.

600
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:21,080
I know that chances are slim,

601
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,910
and he's prone to breaking promises,

602
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:24,910
but as I see it now...

603
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,560
I'm so desperate that I have to try.

604
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,180
(Sang)

605
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:39,360
Your dishes, Sir.

606
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:40,390
Please.

607
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,630
Hello, Mr. Zhuo. Please come in.

608
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,150
Please.

609
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,000
Your tea, Sir.

610
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,080
What's so difficult?

611
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,040
The Lantern Festival is around the corner.

612
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:00,670
Looks like Miss Sang Qi

613
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,280
won't be giving away her pouch.

614
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,280
I knew it'd turn out like this.

615
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,320
So,

616
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:07,390
I had the tailor sew me a new garb.

617
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:08,710
I'm going to be

618
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:10,560
dressed up splendidly for the occasion,

619
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:12,360
and we'll see how Sang Qi will react.

620
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,430
She even dared to bet with me

621
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,670
when she really couldn't afford it.

622
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,360
Do you know who Yan Yun Zhi is?

623
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,430
That's my future husband you're talking about.

624
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:22,710
He's a young master of Chancellor Yan's Residence.

625
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,230
Why would he receive a pouch
from an impudent girl like her?

626
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:28,600
But I notice that Zhuo Wen Yuan

627
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,430
is infatuated with Sang Qi.

628
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,360
Who knows,

629
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,000
she's quite an enchantress.

630
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,040
Zhuo Wen Yuan is but a distant
relative of the royal family.

631
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:38,950
He has neither wealth nor power.

632
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:40,800
I'm guessing

633
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:42,630
that he's coveting
Grand Commandant Sang's position.

634
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,120
How I despise men like him!

635
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,800
Besides,

636
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:47,710
he's a hopeless romantic.

637
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:49,630
I heard that he frequents Qingfeng Restaurant

638
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:50,630
to hang out with entertainers.

639
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,150
For a girl

640
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:55,470
who wants to spend her whole life with only one man,

641
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:56,870
a man like him

642
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,430
will probably make her miserable.

643
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:00,950
By the way, Yin,

644
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,280
how's Miss Su doing?

645
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,040
I haven't heard from her

646
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,710
in recent years.

647
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:09,000
She returned to her hometown to mourn her elders.

648
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,560
She's been stuck in Nanshan Manor for three years.

649
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,000
Her mourning period is almost over.

650
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,800
I heard that she'd return to Bianjing soon.

651
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:18,710
Miss Su is coming back?

652
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:20,800
Yin,

653
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,560
aren't you worried about that?

654
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,560
She and Deputy Chief

655
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,630
used to be widely regarded as the perfect couple.

656
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:28,670
What's there to worry about?

657
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:31,120
I am the one

658
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,150
who is predestined to go with Yan Yun Zhi.

659
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:37,320
But Miss Su isn't so bad.

660
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,280
She's well-learned

661
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,430
and kind-hearted.

662
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:44,150
Seeing how erudite and virtuous she is,

663
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:45,560
I may consider taking her in

664
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,910
as a concubine in the Yan family.

665
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,000
Well,

666
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,360
here's to your marriage
into the Yan family in advance.

667
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:01,390
(Nanshan Manor)

668
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:07,650
(Nanshan Manor)

669
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,560
Is everything in order within the city?

670
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,470
Yes, I've explained it clearly.

671
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,230
Young Lady.

672
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:41,760
Someone

673
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:43,470
left a letter in the yard.

674
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:52,950
(You fear for the river that flows
eastward because of the rain,)

675
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:59,050
(thinking it is not deep enough,)

676
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:01,850
(so you dredge it before it's too late.)

677
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,800
(Secretariat Chancellery)

678
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:12,360
Can you please inform Deputy Chief Yan

679
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,000
that Sang Qi wants to see him?

680
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:16,360
Young Master went out for an old friend.

681
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:17,520
I don't know when he'll be back.

682
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:19,120
(Secretariat Chancellery)
Please come back some other day.

683
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:39,760
Young Master.

684
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,910
You're all sullen along the way.

685
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:43,320
Is something bothering you?

686
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,120
No.

687
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,230
Young Master, the carriage is over there.

688
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:52,250
(Su)

689
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:55,630
Have a look at the floral umbrella.

690
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:57,470
Let's see what's up ahead.

691
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,120
(Deputy Chief isn't home.)

692
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:02,000
(God,)

693
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:05,040
(am I destined to lose face
at the Lantern Festival?)

694
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:13,760
Hurry!

695
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,430
Close up!

696
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:16,630
Don't get wet!

697
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:18,230
Hurry up!

698
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,040
It's so heavy.

699
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:24,280
It's raining all of a sudden.

700
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,430
How can we have

701
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:33,710
a Lantern Festival tomorrow with such weather?

702
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:34,560
Yeah.

703
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,560
It's going to make us look like drowned rats.

704
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,470
Perhaps this is to help me.

705
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,280
Yes, help me!

706
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,000
Bring it on.

707
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:47,230
Let it rain.

708
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,560
Even heavier.

709
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:06,080
Qi.

710
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,910
You seemed quite pompous to be around here.

711
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:16,320
Why are you dressed like this today?

712
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:17,320
Are you afraid of catching a cold?

713
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:19,040
I didn't expect this weather.

714
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:19,630
Besides,

715
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,320
I'd rather catch a cold

716
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:23,320
so I won't have to play guqin tomorrow.

717
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:25,280
Why are you doing this?

718
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,280
Worry not.

719
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:28,670
I have plans for you tomorrow.
