comes with a hefty price too.

173
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,920
So Xizhao cultivated these plants

174
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,830
for profiteering?

175
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:51,760
Yes.

176
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,830
In recent years, there has been news of

177
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,110
people snorting these powders near Bianjing,

178
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,920
but the seller's whereabouts elude everyone.

179
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:03,270
Can someone cultivate this plant in Bianjing?

180
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,920
The climate of Bianjing is hostile towards

181
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,070
this kind of plant.

182
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,550
If you want to cultivate it,

183
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,510
you'll need a specific environment.

184
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,200
I see.

185
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,040
I'll ask Yan San Lang

186
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,600
to follow this lead.

187
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,350
Thanks, Lan.

188
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,510
Yun Zhi.

189
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,600
You need to be extra careful.

190
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,230
Don't make me worry.

191
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:29,160
If you need my help,

192
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,640
just ask me.

193
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,160
I'll take my leave then.

194
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,440
No need to see me off

195
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:38,880
lest someone sees us

196
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,320
and spreads rumors.

197
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:03,910
Thank you.

198
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:31,880
Qi.

199
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,590
Lan.

200
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,400
Mr. Zhuo.

201
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,200
What a coincidence!

202
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,320
I didn't know Yun Zhi invited you two as well.

203
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,590
Or else, I would have stayed a bit longer.

204
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:41,790
Oh, no.

205
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,520
We weren't invited at all.

206
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,960
But I heard

207
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,150
that Qing Xuan was looking for him.

208
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,110
Qi.

209
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,760
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

210
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,440
I just came back from the south.

211
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,000
Qi brought me to Qingfeng Restaurant
to welcome me.

212
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,710
Who knew we would

213
00:09:58,710 --> 00:09:59,880
bump into Lan and you here.

214
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,910
When I just came back, rumor has it

215
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,670
that the Yan and Su family had a fallout.

216
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,960
It looks like it's fake.

217
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,320
Right, Lan?

218
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,550
Yun Zhi.

219
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,230
Judging from Mr. Zhuo's weary expression,

220
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,150
he must be exhausted.

221
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,080
Let's not disturb them.

222
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,400
Isn't that right, Qi?

223
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,960
I came to you instead of my home.

224
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,590
I'm famished.

225
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:29,710
Let's go.

226
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,640
Young Lady.

227
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,590
Young Lady, what are you doing

228
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,910
venturing out this late at night with a sword?

229
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,710
I...

230
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:25,200
I worry that my sword technique is getting rusty,

231
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,440
so I have decided to practice now.

232
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,400
Young Lady.

233
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:40,520
Did things not go well between
you and Deputy Chief Yan?

234
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,280
No, not at all.

235
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,150
We didn't even talk.

236
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,550
Didn't you say asking him is just

237
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,150
as bad as not asking him?

238
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,350
Why did you chicken out last minute?

239
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:51,880
I take it back.

240
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,880
Asking him is bad.

241
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,440
Not asking him means the answer can never hurt me.

242
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,400
Also, why are you here?

243
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,550
Why are you using a pruning shear

244
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,910
this late at night?

245
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,030
I...

246
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,910
This plant here is too tall.

247
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,280
It needs some pruning.

248
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,960
Just say you're seeing Lan.

249
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,400
Why ask Yan Xiao Lang to say that it's Qing Xuan?

250
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,960
Yes, I chickened out.

251
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,400
But why didn't you give me an explanation?

252
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:26,760
Also,

253
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,550
you rejected Lan,

254
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,710
but that doesn't mean you're into me,

255
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:31,790
right?

256
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,670
Exactly.

257
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,960
You lied to me

258
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,000
and you refused to give me an explanation.

259
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,590
Who am I to you?

260
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:55,960
That feels good.

261
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,350
Indeed.

262
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,000
What happened?

263
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,200
Yan Xiao Lang got on your nerves?

264
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,790
He didn't even have the time to do that.

265
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,880
I heard he's busy preparing for his proposal.

266
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,710
Didn't he say he'd postpone it?

267
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,150
Who knew what happened?

268
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,710
That girl is from a noble family

269
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,670
and looks pretty too.

270
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:20,470
Yan Xiao Lang must be over the moon now.

271
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,790
But him?

272
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,590
He's just a spoiled, arrogant

273
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,590
brat.

274
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,350
A dumb one at that.

275
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:27,670
He just...

276
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,200
He just has a decent face.

277
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,960
She won't like him.

278
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,710
I think Yan Xiao Lang is not bad.

279
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:38,230
He's simple,

280
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,760
unlike someone else.

281
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,000
Young Lady.

282
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,760
What happened?

283
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,400
I don't want to talk.

284
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:50,840
Let's sleep.

285
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,200
Close the door!

286
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:05,910
(Imperial College)

287
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:09,350
Lian Pian.

288
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,670
You insist on sending me to school today.

289
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,280
Are you looking for someone

290
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,760
or do you have something to tell me?

291
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,710
So who in the Imperial College
tickles your fancy today?

292
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,960
I can pair you up.

293
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,150
As long as it's not me

294
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,880
because my heart belongs to
someone else already.

295
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:32,470
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

296
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,910
Are you still drunk from yesterday's wine?

297
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,030
You're not making any sense.

298
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:38,150
See?

299
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,030
If you compare them,

300
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,960
Yan Xiao Lang feels a lot better, doesn't it?

301
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,640
If he was as good-looking as Mr. Zhuo,

302
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,590
that'd be even better.

303
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,000
So you're into Yan Xiao Lang.

304
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,840
Oh no!

305
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:53,550
Oh no!

306
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,150
Sang Qi,

307
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,350
have you heard?

308
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,590
Song Luo Tian set his horse against Yan Yan.

309
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,470
What?

310
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,030
What?

311
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:02,470
Is he okay?

312
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,080
I don't know.

313
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,840
But I heard he was gravely injured

314
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,000
and has to convalesce at home.

315
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,110
I know Song Luo Tian

316
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,280
has a bad temper.

317
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,960
He can throw tantrums in school,

318
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,400
but how dare he used his horse to hurt someone.

319
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,470
It's okay.

320
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,960
The culprit is here.

321
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,320
Song Luo Tian!

322
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,760
(A Place for the Talented)
Calm down, Young Lady.

323
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,350
Nice one, Song Luo Tian.

324
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,840
You discarded the camaraderie we all have

325
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,840
and went to hurt him.

326
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,400
What did Yan Yan do to you?

327
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,960
He crossed me repeatedly in school

328
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,670
and stuck out like a sore thumb.

329
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:42,350
Sure.

330
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,910
You confessed, at least.

331
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,280
I shall punish you on behalf of Yan Yan!

332
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:47,710
Young Lady!

333
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:48,030
Come here.

334
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:48,350
Young Lady!

335
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,110
Come here.

336
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:49,550
Young Lady!

337
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,470
Come here.

338
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:51,880
Hit me then.

339
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,670
You want to be expelled from the school,

340
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,200
don't you?

341
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,230
We're in the public.

342
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:57,910
Don't cause a ruckus.

343
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm not from the Imperial College,

344
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:04,840
so I fear nothing.

345
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:07,840
What are you doing?

346
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,350
Didn't you tell me to calm down?

347
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,000
You...

348
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,550
It was for you, not for me.

349
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:14,550
Hands off!

350
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:16,710
Song,

351
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,400
get yourself new clothes.

352
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,080
Everyone is looking at you.

353
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:21,110
But...

354
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,400
You two crossed a line!

355
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:24,840
I will...

356
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:26,350
I will bring it to the Imperial College!

357
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,350
Go ahead.

358
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,230
You're reporting this to the teachers.

359
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,080
Anyone can do that.

360
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,400
I'll do the same too.

361
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,000
Just so you know, Song Luo Tian,

362
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:32,840
I will avenge Yan Yan

363
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,590
sooner or later.

364
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:40,960
Let's go.

365
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:41,840
Let's pay Yan Yan a visit.

366
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,000
Young Master.

367
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,280
Young Master. Let them go.

368
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,590
Hands off me!

369
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:55,960
Yan Yan.

370
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,880
I heard you're about to get married.

371
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,440
So whose daughter will be ruined today?

372
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,640
Why am I so unlucky today?

373
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,910
What unlucky?

374
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,350
Don't jinx yourself.

375
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:08,200
Come on. Smile.

376
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,040
Song Luo Tian.

377
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,160
Are you asking for a beating?

378
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:14,950
Fine then.

379
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:15,880
(Imperial College)
I...

380
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:17,310
- Go to hell.
- Young Master!

381
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:18,520
- You dare to touch me?
- Young Master!

382
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,400
Stop fighting!

383
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,560
- Die!
- Young Master!

384
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,070
Song Luo Tian!

385
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:21,680
Let go!

386
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,070
Young Master!

387
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:22,400
Move!

388
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,070
Useless.

389
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,430
Trash.

390
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,710
What use does your hand have

391
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,950
if you can't even hold the reins properly?

392
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,830
There were so many people on the street,

393
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,470
but you just had to ram into Yan Yan.

394
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,430
You put me in a tough spot now.

395
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:38,430
Everyone thinks I hurt Yan Yan intentionally.

396
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:40,040
Young Master.

397
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,560
When you two were quarreling,
the horse got scared.

398
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,110
It was just an accident.

399
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,430
Besides,

400
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,110
I wasn't the one holding the reins.

401
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,470
You...

402
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,680
I couldn't do anything.

403
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,800
So you're saying

404
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,520
we bickered so much that
the horse couldn't even stand us?

405
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,000
Is that so?

406
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,560
I am the culprit then?

407
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:57,640
How dare you nod!

408
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,710
You're dismissed.

409
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,070
Yes, Master.

410
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:09,280
Yes.

411
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:27,560
I heard you wounded the son
of Grand Preceptor Yan.

412
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,000
Father.

413
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,040
I'm sorry.

414
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,950
I shouldn't have caused you any trouble.

415
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,280
Well done, my child.

416
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,310
It's time we give them a scare.

417
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,800
I need you to do something.

418
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,110
Come over.

419
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:51,920
Come here!

420
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,190
But, Father!

421
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,070
You want me to marry the woman
Yan Yan was supposed to marry?

422
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,640
I don't like her!

423
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,830
She doesn't match my status.

424
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:12,070
But she matches our family's.

425
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,350
She's from a noble family in Bianjing.

426
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,640
They are wealthy

427
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:20,070
and have shops or merchants everywhere.

428
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,710
If you can't

429
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:24,400
make a name for yourself in politics,

430
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:26,520
your in-laws should still

431
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,830
be able to grant you an affluent lifestyle.

432
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,430
We are also rich and noble.

433
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,710
Why should we rely on someone else?

434
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,160
Because things can change.

435
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,590
It's always good to have a contingency plan.

436
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:43,230
Loving parents

437
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,350
will plan the future of their children.

438
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:49,800
This is for your own good.

439
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:50,680
No.

440
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,070
But I...

441
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:51,920
End of discussion.

442
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,760
Just do as you're told.

443
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,230
Yes, Father.

444
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,470
(Grand Preceptor's Residence)

445
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,160
Hurry. Here.

446
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,070
Greetings.

447
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,110
We're here for Yan Xiao Lang.

448
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,350
This way, please.

449
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,160
Young Master,

450
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,400
you have visitors.

451
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,160
Yan Xiao Lang!

452
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,680
Why are you giving up on yourself?

453
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,310
Are you okay?

454
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,400
Lian Pian, you're here.

455
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,950
I thought I would never see you again.

456
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,880
Stop your nonsense.

457
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,230
Yan Yan, how's the injury?

458
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,760
I'm fine.

459
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:48,470
After all, I have the Body-hardening
Technique with me.

460
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,430
This injury

461
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,000
will cripple any ordinary person, but not me.

462
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,710
Rest well, Yan Xiao Lang.

463
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:55,880
We brought some medicine for you.

464
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,310
Only medicine?

465
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:00,800
Next time,

466
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,560
just bring some food.

467
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,110
As the saying goes,

468
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,160
good food cures the soul better
than good medicine.

469
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,160
What do you want to eat?

470
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:10,590
I'll cook them for you next time.

471
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,640
I have to think it through then.

472
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,230
Don't worry, Yan Yan.

473
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,640
I will avenge you.

474
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,280
It's okay.

475
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,560
It was just an accident.

476
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,640
It's not his fault.

477
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,800
Song Luo Tian already confessed
in front of everyone.

478
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,000
Why are you shielding him?

479
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,680
He only did it out of pride.

480
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,110
I know him very well.

481
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,160
He throws a tantrum,

482
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,710
but he won't do anything more than that.

483
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,590
After all, he's still the boy who cried

484
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,710
upon stepping on an ant.

485
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:35,920
Besides, look at my

486
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:36,950
physique.

487
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,190
He can never hit me.

488
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,280
He can never hurt me.

489
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:42,950
Young Master!

490
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Something bad happened!

491
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,280
The young lady you're supposed to marry

492
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,310
was snatched away by the Song family.

493
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,560
Song Luo Tian just asked for her hand.

494
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,230
Your marriage is in shamble now!

495
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:53,350
Wonderful.

496
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:54,830
Wonderful.

497
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,470
He finally did something right.

498
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:59,160
Does it hurt a lot?

499
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:00,350
I'm okay.

500
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,350
As long as you're here,

501
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,280
it's not painful.

502
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,830
Lie down.

503
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:06,350
You need to rest.

504
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:06,800
Okay.

505
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:07,880
Careful.

506
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,000
Lian Pian.

507
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,830
I'm thirsty.

508
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:21,760
Don't move.

509
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:23,040
I'll get you water.

510
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,070
Let's leave.

511
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,400
I'm craving mandarin orange.

512
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,040
Is there any?

513
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:42,710
All right.

514
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,800
I'll get one for you.

515
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:49,190
You're saying

516
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,680
that the plant is related to the Song family?

517
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,310
I want to check out the Song Residence,

518
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,110
but I have to keep a low profile.

519
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,880
I just received the news

520
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,230
that Song Luo Tian is getting married soon.

521
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,160
This might be your chance.

522
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,590
I will plan accordingly.

523
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:26,520
Reflect upon yourself.

524
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,040
Reflect upon yourself.

525
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:35,040
Reflect... upon yourself.

526
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,590
Sang Qi.

527
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,470
Deputy Chief.

528
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,590
Why are you sulking?

529
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,560
Scholar Feng just announced

530
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,760
that there would be a pop quiz this afternoon.

531
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,640
But I spent all the time
training martial arts in the mountain

532
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,110
and neglected my revision.

533
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,830
I'm trying to cram everything now.

534
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,280
If you encounter any difficulty in your study,

535
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,880
I can explain to you in private.

536
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:01,350
Really?

537
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,070
Like this one.

538
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:07,640
Deputy Chief is a busy man.

539
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,590
Let's not bother him.

540
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,640
I'm planning to do my revision too.

541
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:11,400
I can teach you.

542
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:22,280
You'll teach me?

543
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:23,400
What?

544
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,310
You don't trust me?

545
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:25,950
I...

546
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,160
Well, I do.

547
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:27,590
It's just...

548
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,590
Qi.

549
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,760
The pop quiz is around the corner.

550
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,190
Let's not waste time.

551
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,640
It's noisy and crowded here.

552
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,190
Let's head back to the classroom

553
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,880
and revise with everyone else.

554
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:44,920
All right then.

555
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,640
I should go back then.

556
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,590
The pop quiz is more important.

557
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,760
Don't worry, Deputy Chief.

558
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,230
You can leave Qi to me.

559
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,830
I will do my best to tutor her.

560
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:01,800
Let's go.

561
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,160
What are you doing?

562
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:07,590
Don't!

563
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:10,430
I know how to answer. Stop laughing!

Qi.

566
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,280
I'll send you back home.

567
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,190
I can visit your father too.

568
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,350
Well...

569
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,070
How is he?

570
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,230
Let me carry this for you.

571
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,950
This way.

572
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,800
Zhuo Wen Yuan, you're acting weird.

573
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,470
What do you mean?

574
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,760
Young Master.

575
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,950
Zhuo Wen Yuan and Sang Qi

576
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,280
are always together.

577
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,160
They go to school together.

578
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,190
They might as well go back home holding hands.

579
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,400
Say that again!

580
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,830
Are you okay, Young Master?

(Qingfeng Restaurant, Shuiyue Shop)

located strategically in a place

584
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,640
that gathers talented people
and bountiful products.

585
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,760
Just look at this tea.

586
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,040
It's the famous Gentle Rain on Western Hills.

587
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,640
It was regarded as a tribute.

588
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:41,920
Its tea leaves only bloom for two hours per year.

589
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:44,230
They are harvested at the dawn
of Tomb-Sweeping Day

590
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,040
and only the youngest

591
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,470
leaf of each tea plant will be selected.

592
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,160
There's a bug.

593
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:52,830
What bug?

594
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:54,800
A lazy slug.

595
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,280
Yan Xiao Lang,

596
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:58,190
I've been looking after you for several days.

597
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,110
When will you fully recover?

598
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,110
You frequent different restaurants
and tea shops every day.

599
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,950
It's as if you're not injured at all.

600
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,190
What? No.

601
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,830
I'm just trying to laugh through

602
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:10,950
my pain.

603
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,680
It's quite painful, actually.

Lian Pian.

605
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,710
If my wound never heals,

606
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,070
will you look after me like right now?

607
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,040
Of course not.

608
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,400
I am annoyed now.

609
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:23,590
I'm telling you.

610
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:24,830
Rest and recover quickly.

611
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:25,830
Don't make me hate you.

612
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:27,000
Finish your tea now.

613
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,040
Then, we'll head back.

614
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:30,830
I'll finish now.

615
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,760
Young Master Yan.

616
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,350
Come in.

617
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,710
I'm sorry.

618
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,520
The son of Grand Tutor Song
is getting married tomorrow.

619
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,470
Their family insisted on emptying
our restaurant to test our dishes.

620
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:42,230
We are put in a tough spot.

621
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,110
Our restaurant owner said

622
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,680
he would find you another excellent restaurant

623
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,830
and is willing to pay for your expense there.

624
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,680
Should I call a carriage to send you there?

625

Song Luo Tian!

626
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,110
First, he took my wife.

627
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,280
Now, he's taking my private room.

628
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,070
Will he be after my family's asset tomorrow then?

629
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,760
Am I being too nice to him?

630
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,430
Is he taking advantage

631
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:13,920
of my kindness and generosity now?

632
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:17,000
I'll make sure I give him something
he can't forget tomorrow.

633
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,800
Let him be, Yan Xiao Lang.

634
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:21,000
You're still injured.

635
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,640
No need to make a scene
with the Song family today.

636
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,190
I haven't even finished my tea.

637
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,230
Now, my mood is ruined.

638
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:25,950
I'm staying.

639
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,920
But the owner said they would
pay for your expenses.

640
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,680
You'll pay for this meal?

641
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,280
Can we ask for more snacks?

642
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,040
Sure.

643
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,470
As long as it pleases Young Master Yan.

644
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,350
Then pack everything for me.

645
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,430
Okay.

646
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,640

647
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:41,760
Wait.

648
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,280
You can be bought off with a few snacks?

649
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:46,160
Are you that eager to send me home?

650
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:49,470
I'm just being frugal

651
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:50,880
and economic.

652
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,110
Let's go.

653
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,040
Ouch.

654
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,000
My leg hurts.

655
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:58,520
Carry me.

656
00:28:58,830 --> 00:28:59,760
Carry yourself.

657
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Okay, okay.

658
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,400
Carry me.

Just go back.

It's normal for a teacher to send his student off.

00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,470
Hurry. Finally, I can go home.

689
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:31,190
The carriage is there!

690
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,310
Let's go home.

691
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,520
Finally. Hurry.

692
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,310
Come on, let's go.

693
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:40,520
Come on.

694
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:01,880
Deputy Chief.

695
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,160
Do you want some plant seeds, peanuts,

696
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:04,950
and some fish jerky?

697
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,430
Do you want some

698
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:08,950
kumis, candied fruits, or walnuts?

699
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,470
No thanks.

700
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,760
Can I have some?

701
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,430
Sure.

702
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:13,400
Some candied fruits.

703
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,110
Watch your step!

704
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:24,590
Thanks, Deputy Chief

705
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,470
and Zhuo.

706
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:29,830
Deputy Chief,

707
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,190
sorry to trouble you.

708
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:32,680
It's no trouble.

709
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,400
Qi,

710
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,560
you want some candied fruits?

711
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,110
I have some.

712
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,230
Delicious?

713
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,520
What do you think?

714
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,590
It's not bad at all.

715
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:51,190
Deputy Chief,

716
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,000
try some.

717
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:55,640
Deputy Chief said no just now.

718
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,880
He won't take his words back.

719
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,160
Don't force him.

720
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,190
I'll take it on behalf of him.

721
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:07,230
This candied fruit has a sharp color

722
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:09,000
and the powdered sugar looks off.

723
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:11,950
What do you mean, Deputy Chief?

724
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:14,070
Is there something wrong
with this candied fruit?

725
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,280
It has a light rotten odor to it.

726
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,830
It wasn't preserved properly,

727
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:20,680
so it's rotten.

728
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,560
Sang Qi.

729
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:22,800
How is your

730
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,190
stomach feeling now?

731
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,430
I was

732
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:26,400
okay,

733
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,590
but now that you mentioned it,

734
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,190
my stomach feels weird.

735
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,230
Let me see.

736
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,950
Let me read your pulse.

737
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,640
There's no need for that.

738
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,110
Yes, there is.

739
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:37,950
Come on.

740
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:38,830
Okay.

741
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:45,000
Give me your hand.

742
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:50,280
Deputy Chief.

743
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:51,640
I ate some too...

744
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,350
Quiet!

745
00:32:59,160 --> 00:32:59,640
So?

746
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:01,590
It's fine for the moment

747
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,760
but stay alert.

748
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,040
If you feel unwell,

749
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,230
tell me straight away.

750
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,160
Deputy Chief.

751
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,520
I had some candied fruits too.

752
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,400
Read my pulse too.

753
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,800
See if I'm sick or not.

754
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:16,280
Please?

755
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:25,830
Have some.

756
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,560
Can I have some peanuts?

757
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:30,040
I'll peel...

758
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:34,640
Here, Sang Qi.

759
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,590
Thanks, Deputy Chief.

760
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:44,160
You want some more?

761
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,280
In this mortal world...

762
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,400
Is there no place

763
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,070
in this universe for me to study?

764
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:13,040
Why can't I do my revision in peace?

765
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:15,230
Young Lady!

766
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,630
I have bad news.

767
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,940
(Agarwood)

768
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,630
People from Yan's residence said Yan Yan
brought people with him to the Song Residence.

769
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,000
Why did he go to the Song Residence?

770
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,710
He has been acting weird since yesterday.

771
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:27,910
He said he wanted to give Song Luo Tian
an unforgettable gift.

772
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:29,520
I hope it's not a fight.

773
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,950
How troublesome.

774
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,080
Let's go.

775
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:36,950
Yan Xiao Lang.

776
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,670
Today is the day I get married.

777
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:39,840
If you're here to congratulate me,

778
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:40,950
I'll welcome you.

779
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,080
If you're here to pick a fight,

780
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,280
then I won't show mercy.

781
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,670
It's your big day today, Mr. Song.

782
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:48,710
Don't get mad.

783
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,390
I'm here to present my gifts

784
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,760
and convey my best wishes.

785
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:52,630
Bring it here!

786
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:59,530
(Wedding Ceremony)

787
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,000
Congratulations!

788
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,190
(Wedding Ceremony)

789
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,520
Come here.

790
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,630
What are you doing?

791
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:11,360
Haven't you heard the old saying?

792
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,950
Destroying someone's marriage

793
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:14,000
is worse than destroying ten temples.

794
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,760
Song Luo Tian might be a barbarian,

795
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,710
but you can settle the score with him later.

796
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,390
It's not right to cause a scene

797
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,320
in a festive place like here.

798
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,600
Yan Yan, let's head home.

799
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,390
Who do you think I am?

800
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:29,230
I came here bearing gifts.

801
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,950
These are all my gifts. I'm serious.

802
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:31,760
I don't believe you.

803
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,390
Let's go.

804
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:33,950
Don't worry.

805
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:36,230
Let's sit down.

806
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,000
(Wedding Ceremony)
Song Luo Tian,

807
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,760
you would reject my gifts?

808
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,840
Don't you want to know

809
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,800
what I prepared for you?

810
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,430
(Do good deeds to bring good fortune)

811
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,000
I'm interested to see

812
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,000
what you can come up with.

813
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:51,870
Open them.

814
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,000
Come on.

815
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:09,190
Jade knee pads

816
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:11,230
for when you have to get on your knees
for a long time.

817
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,810
(Do good deeds to bring good fortune)
(Wedding Ceremony)

818
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:17,000
Bamboo floor mats

819
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,670
for when you have to sleep on the floor.

820
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,600
And the rest

821
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:26,390
are all well-thought gifts for you.

822
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,560
In case you need them in the future.

823
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:29,630
Yan Xiao Lang!

824
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,800
You did this on purpose.

825
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,120
Be patient.

826
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,390
I still have one box there.

827
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,950
Don't you want to check it out yourself?

828
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:39,630
Come on.

829
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,430
Don't be a coward.

830
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:41,360
Come on.

831
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:44,670
Open it.

832
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,280
What are they?

833
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,710
What's inside?

834
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:55,710
These are

835
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:58,360
the toys I took from you when we were young.

836
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,120
I told you I'd give them back

837
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,710
when you get married, so here they are.

838
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,120
See this?

839
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,230
See this?

840
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:09,710
I am a man of my own words.

841
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:11,320
I will deliver my promise!

842
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,840
I am a righteous man.

843
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,560
I agree.

844
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:13,800
Right?

845
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,840
Yes.

846
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,040
How should I handle them?

847
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:21,280
Put them away.

848
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,120
Hurry up.

849
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:25,190
Grant Yan Xiao Lang a seat.

850
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,120
Treat him nicely.

851
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,630
I shall honor your kindness then.

852
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:38,630
(Do good deeds to bring good fortune)

853
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:42,000
May you and your wife

854
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,600
live happily ever after

855
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:45,000
with no sorrow

856
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,910
or separation.

857
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,150
Let's go.

858
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:54,360
Let's leave.

859
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,600
Let's leave.

860
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:57,910
You actually plan to stay here
for the celebration?

861
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,280
We're here already.

862
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,320
Besides, I heard that the Song family

863
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:04,390
hired a famous chef in Bianjing.

864
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,870
Don't you want to try?

865
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:06,910
Sure.

866
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:08,470
Let's go.

867
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:09,800
Come on.

868
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:11,800
Careful.

869
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,000
You sure it's a famous chef?

870
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,080
Everyone is a guest here.

871
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:23,080
Come on. Forgo the formalities.

872
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:23,670
Sit.

873
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,470
Deputy Chief!

874
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:35,080
Sang Qi.

875
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,080
Yan Yan and you are here.

876
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:37,630
I didn't expect this.

877
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:42,870
Deputy Chief,

878
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,760
this table is for the women, the less fortunate,

879
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:48,000
and the students.

880
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,280
You're an educator.

881
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,520
You should sit there

882
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,430
with the other officials.

883
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,150
You have no idea, don't you?

884
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:56,120
That table is only for mutual praising.

885
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,190
You can only speak,

886
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,080
not eat.

887
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,760
This table is more down-to-earth.

888
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,670
Deputy Chief, you came here

889
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,800
for the food too?

890
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:05,000
That's all?

891
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,320
Deputy Chief, you're...

892
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,430
Rinsing the chopsticks

893
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,320
so that it's cleaner.

894
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,910
Classy.

895
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,000
Lian Pian.

896
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,800
I want to rinse my chopsticks too.

897
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,520
Have you rinsed yours?

898
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,000
You're so annoying.

899
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,120
Just use the chopsticks.

900
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,120
For me?

901
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:28,040
Yes.

902
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,840
You rinsed it for me?

903
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:34,800
If not?

904
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,120
Thanks, Deputy Chief.

905
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,280
Yan Yan.

906
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,280
Eat some more.

907
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,360
Can I have some wine, please?

908
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:46,800
Here.

909
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,320
You're all here.

910
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:47,950
Deputy Chief.

911
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:49,390
Greetings, Deputy Chief.

912
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:51,760
Qi, why didn't you tell me you're coming?

913
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,910
I thought you would be absent.

914
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:55,040
It wasn't my plan.

915
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:57,080
But it's all thanks to Yan Yan.

916
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:01,800
Have some, Sang Qi.

917
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,120
Let's eat.

918
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:06,710
- Redlip croaker.
- Redlip croaker.

919
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,280
Congratulations.

920
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,320
(Do good deeds to bring good fortune)
(Wedding Ceremony)

921
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,670
Congratulations.

922
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:13,670
- May you bear a child soon.
- Congratulations.

923
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:14,910
Come on.

924
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:16,080
Over here.

925
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:20,600
Drink with me.

926
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:22,520
What?

927
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,870
Drink with me.

928
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,910
There's nothing.

929
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:30,390
Come on.

930
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:31,120
Where's the wine?

931
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:34,520
No more wine?

932
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,840
Where's the wine?

933
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:36,670
There's no more wine.

934
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,080
How can it be?

935
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:41,470
Song.

936
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:43,080
It's time to cross arms and drink with your wife.

937
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:43,840
Don't make her wait for long.

938
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,190
It's impolite.

939
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:46,670
Not like she'll run away anyway.

940
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,760
It's rare that Yan Yan put his neck into the noose.

941
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:52,950
I need to settle the score with him.

942
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:54,000
Here.

943
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:55,710
Song.

944
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,280
Take this.

945
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,280
Bring it on.

946
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,190
Bring it!

947
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,280
You think I'm scared?

948
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:03,280
- Drink.
- Come on!

949
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:14,840
Good. Good.

950
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,760
Yan Yan,

951
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:17,000
your leg doesn't hurt anymore?

952
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,870
The festivity got to me

953
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,360
and cured it.

954
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,230
I chugged it.

955
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,080
Where's the Deputy Chief?

956
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:31,430
I don't know.

957
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,390
Wasn't he here just now?

958
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,870
I'm full now.

959
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:36,560
I'll get some air

960
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:37,430
and have a walk.

961
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,320
Okay.

962
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,080
Happily ever after...

963
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,040
Song.

964

Why are you...

968
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:47,600
Who's there?

969
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,470
Quick!

970
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:55,600
There.

971
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:59,670
Lie down.

972
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:00,760
