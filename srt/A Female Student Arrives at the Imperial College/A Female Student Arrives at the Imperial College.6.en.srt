Young Lady, we just reached
Grand Commandant's Residence.

37
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:26,670
It's good, though.

38
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,880
I have someone to rely on

from me isn't over yet.

Didn't I tell it all to you?

48
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,360
It's over now.

49
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,440
And let me remind you.

50
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:54,960
Keep the nickname White

What would you do?

You do have authority in Imperial College.

But outside Imperial College,

57
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,240
you have no authority.

You rarely treat me to a meal.

69
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,630
Are you going to celebrate that you passed

70
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,630
the Lantern Festival without trouble?

71

It's not just that.

Lan brought me

73
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,920
to Qing Xuan's residence yesterday.

74
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,270
I even met Deputy Chief Yan.

75
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,070
Now you call her Lan.

76
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,760
It seems you two had a great time yesterday.

77
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,920
Right.

78
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:34,760
I didn't know

79
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,920
there were many interesting people in Bianjing.

80
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,550
Qing Xuan

81
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,160

Yan San Lang

83
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,350
is upright.

84
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,000
And Lan.

85
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,550
She's an incomparable beauty.

86
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,670
How gorgeous!

87
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,040
Women in Bianjing are different indeed.

88
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,880
You didn't take the initiative to meet my friend.

89
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,640
Yet, you met all the friends

90
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,760
of Deputy Chief Yan.

91
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,230
I didn't.

92
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,760
They're my elder brother's friends.

93
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,160
I should get to know them.

94
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,550
All right then.

95
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,720
They're all very interesting people.

96
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,920
I don't have that many friends

97
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,760
to introduce to you.

Zhuo Wen Yuan.

99
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:12,670
Could you please

100
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,040
not be sarcastic?

101
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,640
I see you as my good friend.

102
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,760
Why don't you introduce your friends

103
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,760
to me as well?

104
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,670
Do you still remember Miss Qian Jiu

105
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,720
who was with me at Lantern Festival?

106
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:25,920
Qian...

107
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,390
Oh!

108
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,160
She's a gorgeous lady as well.

109
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,390
But I was in a hurry.

110
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,950
I didn't see her clearly.

111
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,760
Talking about beauty,

112
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,320
Miss Qian Jiu is more well-known

113
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,830
than Su Jie Yu in Bianjing.

114
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:42,920
If you like,

115
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,880
I can arrange for you to meet her.

116
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:47,110
It will open your eyes.

Zhuo Wen Yuan.

118
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,110
You are close

119
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,440
to Miss Qian Jiu, aren't you?

120
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,320
It's not the main point.

121
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,040
The point is, I want to show you

122
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,230
there're many interesting people around me too.

123
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:07,070
Maybe they're more interesting than those

124
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,040
around Deputy Chief Yan.

125
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,600
All right.

126
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:11,920
Okay then.

127
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,760
Imperial College opens tomorrow morning.

128
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:14,920
Let's finish early.

129
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,830
Then depart earlier.

130
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,550
Okay.

131
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,350
Fill it up.

132
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,770

(Zhuo)

135
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,020

[*A poem, Written on the Wall at West Forest Temple]

138
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,200
What a meaningful name.

139
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,320
Let's go.

140
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,440
Let's go.

141
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,110
I'll go first then.

142
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,320
Mr. Zhuo.

143
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,350
Miss Sang.

144
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,760
Miss Sang spent too much time

145
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,880
in the frontier fortress camp.

146
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,270
She called another girl beauty.

147
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,950
So I took her here

148
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,640
to see how the most well-known beauty

149
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,830
in Bianjing looks.

150
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,350
Please don't make fun of me.

151
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,160
I'm just an ordinary lady.

152
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm not that beautiful as you said.

153
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,350
If you're ordinary,

154
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:06,760
then...

155
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,390
You're a heroine.

156
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,200
Mr. Zhuo, Miss Sang.

157
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,720
Please follow me.

158
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,230
Let's go.

159
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,950
Miss Sang Qi?

160
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,270
Pardon me.

161
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,510
I smelled an unknown delicate fragrance

162
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:41,910
on Miss Qian Jiu as I came in.

163
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,000
And your lips.

164
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,910
Did you apply rouge?

165
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,520
Or was a beauty born like this?

166
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,230
It's not natural.

167
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,960
It's all fake.

168
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,200
Fake?

169
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,000
What do you mean?

170
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,710
It's our secret.

171
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,840
We can't let men know.

172
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,320
Mr. Zhuo, please help yourself.

173
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,150
Miss Sang, please follow me.

174
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,550
Help yourself.

175
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,110
If we use perfumes

176
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,400
while taking a bath,

177
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,760
the fragrance will soon disappear.

178
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,230
Rather than that,

179
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,470
I'll use perfumes to soak clothes.

180
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,640
The fragrance will last longer
and smell more natural.

181
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,080
The recipe

182
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,280
is mine.

183
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,670
It's fragrant!

184
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,910
It can distinguish you from the others.

185
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,670
And the rouge.

186
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,110
I have my way of applying it.

187
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,840
After applying the rouge,

188
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,230
cover the lips with a veil.

189
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,470
Then, apply a layer of face powder.

190
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,670
It'll be natural

191
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:00,960
and can stay longer.

192
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,790
Beauties depend on the vibe.

193
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:06,320
It's about body language.

194
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,030
Miss Qian Jiu.

195
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,640
Don't listen to nonsense by Zhuo Wen Yuan.

196
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,030
I've seen beautiful ladies

197
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,590
in the world.

198
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,760
But I think every lady is beautiful

199
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,350
in own way.

200
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:21,110
As long as she's kind and pure,

201
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,550
I'll praise her.

202
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,640
I'd like to praise you as well.

203
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,320
I used to hear about Miss Sang Qi.

204
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,960
Today only I realized

205
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:31,670
that you're the most special one

206
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,150
in Bianjing.

207
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,960
That's too much.

208
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,590
Is Miss Qian Jiu

209
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,710
that guy's concubine?

210
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:55,440
I don't deserve to serve Mr. Zhuo.

211
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,590
But I know

212
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:02,150
he has long fallen for you.

213
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,880
I wonder whether you

214
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,840
fall for him as well.

215
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,640
No, you misunderstood.

216
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,840
Mr. Zhuo and I

217
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,760
are brothers.

218
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:16,840
Merely brothers.

219
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,960
I still have some other perfumes.

220
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,280
You may try them out.

221
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,790
Thank you.

222
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,030
Miss Sang Qi.

223
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,640
There's new face powder.

224
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,350
I'll fetch some for you.

225
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,440
Miss Qian Jiu, it's late now.

226
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,350
I'm going back.

227
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,110
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

228
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,960
Zhuo Wen Yuan! Wake up!

229
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,840
Get up.

230
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:27,880
Wake up!

231
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,150
Are you done yet?

232
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,030
Yes.

233
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,030
I'm going back.

234
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,550
Let's go then.

235
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,350
Mr. Zhuo.

236
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,280
I just brewed some tea.

237
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:43,760
I'll try it next time.

238
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:46,880
No.

239
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,350
You stay here.

240
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,440
I can sit by myself. I don't need company.

241
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,350
But I...

242
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:51,960
Young Master.

243
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,440
I'll tell the carter

244
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,030
to bring Miss Sang Qi home.

245
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,000
Thank you.

246
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,760
Don't worry. I'm okay!

247
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:07,910
All right then.

248
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,520
You must be careful.

249
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,000
It's nothing.

250
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,840
All right, you don't have to see me off.

251
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,200
Miss Qian Jiu, thank you for today.

252
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,320
Let's meet again next time.

253
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,960
It's my pleasure, Miss Sang Qi.

254
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,470
I'm leaving now.

255
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:19,840
(Zhuo)
Who's that?

256
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:20,960
How dare you

257
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,640
robbed my carriage?

258
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,550
Young men.

259
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,910
It's inappropriate

260
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,640
to make a raid on the way.

261
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,670
How grumpy.

262
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,710
Let me do some exercise with you.

263
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,350
Let's go!

264
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,320
Don't go yet!

265
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,350
I just finished warming up, and yet you ran away.

266
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,710
I haven't had enough!

267
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,520
Come back.

268
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,000
Hold on, Hero.

269
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,710
May I have your name?

270
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,760
I'm just a passer-by.

271
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,840
I have no name.

272
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,550
Miss.

273
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:48,110
It's dangerous at night. You've got to be careful.

274
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,520
Is it what was mentioned
in the storytelling script?

275
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,350
Immortal descends from the sky.

276
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,920
What time is it now?

277
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,280
Why hasn't Qi come back?

278
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:18,760
Several days ago,

279
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:20,680
some trouble happened
during the Lantern Festival.

280
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,160
She still isn't afraid.

281
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,160
And you.

282
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,760
Why don't you keep an eye on her?

283
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,470
You should have urged her to come back early.

284
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,350
Master.

285
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,560
Mr. Zhuo asked Young Lady out.

286
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,880
It's not proper for me to follow them.

287
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,070
Zhuo Wen Yuan?

288
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:40,230
He's quite considerate.

289
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,560
If she's with him,

290
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,160
I can rest assured.

291
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,000
I certainly know

292
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,710
how the son of Zhuo's family feels.

293
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,760
Master, do you think

294
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,800
he can make it?

295
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,680
You know my daughter well.

296
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,310
I think Zhuo Wen Yuan is nice.

297
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,520
But my opinion doesn't matter.

298
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,070
But if he always obeys Qi

299
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,280
and lets her come back late,

300
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,000
I need to talk with him.

301
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,230
You can't teach your child well.

302
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,430
And yet talk about the others' child.

303
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:21,190
You've learned

304
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,830
all the bad things from Qi.

305
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,230
Only good at talking back!

306
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,760
Just wait and see.

307
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:27,950
As she comes back,

308
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,310
I must scold her badly.

309
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,310
I'll let her know who has the authority
at Grand Commandant's Residence.

310
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,040
Such a bad girl!

311
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:36,950
Young Lady is back!

312
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:41,040
Master, Young Lady is injured.

313
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:41,920
Father.

314
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,310
Young Lady.

315
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,110
Qi.

316
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:43,760
What's wrong with you, Young Lady?

317
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,190
Lian Pian.

318
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,070
What happened to you?

319
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,310
I'm okay.

320
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,470
Aren't you with Zhuo Wen Yuan?

321
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,230
Why didn't he bring you back?

322
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,230
Summon the physician!

323
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:52,800
Hurry up!

324
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,350
Bring my wound medicine.

325
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,520
I'm okay. It's just a skin injury.

326
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,350
I always have to worry about you.

327
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:09,880
I...

328
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,520
I know I was wrong.

329
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,430
I won't let you worry again.

330
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,950
You admit you were wrong. How rare.

331
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,830
It's rare to see you so nervous.

332
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,830
Since your brother was gone,

333
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,680
both of us have always been together.

334
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,190
Anyway,

335
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,230
don't make me worry about you all the time.

336
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,710
Aren't you with Zhuo Wen Yuan?

337
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,160
Why didn't he take you back?

338
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,040
We went together.

339
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,800
But as we were about to leave,

340
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,000
he couldn't.

341
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,400
He asked someone to send me home.

342
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,920
Little did I know I'd be raided.

343
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,680
Raided?

344
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,800
Did you see their faces?

345
00:19:58,950 --> 00:19:59,920
We have to report this incident

346
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,760
to Prefecture Court right away.

347
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,350
We need to know

348
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,920
whether their target is you.

349
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,470
Lian Pian.

350
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,040
Bring her to her room.

351
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,070
Okay.

352
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,920
Young Lady, be careful.

353
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,400
Report to Prefecture Court.

354
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:24,310
All right.

355
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,280
Young Lady.

356
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,640
You should listen to Master more.

357
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,560
He always cares about you.

358
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,680
Before you came back,

359
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,430
he firmly said

360
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,470
he'd teach you a lesson.

361
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,110
When he saw you injured,

362
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:47,520
he soon talked nicely to you.

363
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,040
Master never

364
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,070
keeps his head down for anyone,

365
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,110
except for you.

366
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,640
He gives you everything you want.

367
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,230
Would it...

368
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:08,680
Would it be her?

369
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,190
Who?

370
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,760
Young Lady, what are you thinking about?

371
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:14,560
I'm...

372
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,710
I'm thinking about a lady.

373
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,400
A lady?

374
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:24,520
Master.

375
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,950
Have you reported to Prefecture Court?

376
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,920
They've organized a special investigation.

377
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,350
They'll maintain justice for you, Master.

378
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,310
We can't just rely on them.

379
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:35,920
Pass my word.

380
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,110
I believe Sang family's soldiers

381
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,350
can catch the evil man.

382
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,200
(Grand Commandant's Residence)

383
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:48,320
(Great Momentum)

384
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:52,950
Young Lady, you're up.

385
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,710
What time is it now?

386
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,710
The school hour has passed.

387
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,640
Don't worry.

388
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,350
Master ordered someone to apply for a leave
from Imperial College.

389
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:02,830
You need to heal at home.

390
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,230
It's just a skin injury!

391
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,160
It shouldn't be.

392
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,110
Look at your leg.

393
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,950
I know you want to study hard.

394
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,920
But there's no need to rush.

395
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:15,920
All right then.

396
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,110
Young Lady, Mr. Yan wants to visit you.

397
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,040
Master Sang!

398
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,430
I'm here to visit you, Master Sang!

399
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:36,350
Why are you here?

400
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,590
Aren't you supposed to study
at Imperial College now?

401
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,950
How dare you talk so.

402
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,880
Almost everyone in Imperial College

403
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,590
knows Master Sang got raided.

404
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:46,280
Master Sang is injured.

405
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:48,160
How could I still sit back and study?

406
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,710
Let me in, quick!

407
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,160
Go away.

408
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,680
You're a man.

409
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,280
How could you enter Young Lady's room?

410
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:55,950
Anyway,

411
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:58,190
Young Lady only has a skin injury.

412
00:22:58,430 --> 00:22:59,310
She's fine.

413
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,070
She's having rest now.

414
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,590
Don't bother her.

415
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:04,920
But I brought a thing for her.

416
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,400
You don't...

417
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,190
I'll give it to her.

418
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,430
You may leave.

419
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,830
You must give it to her.

420
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,160
Well, no.

421
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,160
Why do I just leave?

422
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,670
(Chenxiang)

423
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,950
It's the fool Yan Xiao Lang.

424
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,560
He even wanted to go in.

425
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,230
No manners at all.

426
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,560
But I sent him off.

427
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:39,430
Have a good rest, Young Lady.

428
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,760
Yan Xiao Lang

429
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,430
is a Young Master of Grand Preceptor's Residence.

430
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,040
But you called him a fool.

431
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,350
Incredible.

432
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,520
What a good match.

433
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,520
You mean him?

434
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,800
I'm not worthy of him.

435
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,880
I guess your wound has healed.

436
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,310
You still can tease me.

437
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,950
My wound has already healed!

438
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,310
I'm able to run right now.

439
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,760
It's totally fine.

440
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,000
Deputy Chief Yan is here.

441
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:10,470
It's Deputy Chief Yan.

442
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,760
Yan... Yan Yun Zhi?

443
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:16,560
He must be...

444
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:18,560
He must be here with other intent.

445
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,560
Let's go. I want to wash up.

446
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,430
Deputy Chief Yan.

447
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:38,560
What brings you here, may I ask?

448
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:43,920
Your leg is injured.

449
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,520
It won't affect you in learning, right?

450
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:51,430
I knew it!

451
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,590
I heard about you being raided.

452
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,190
Prefecture Court is investigating it.

453
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,800
When you almost recover,

454
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,160
Yan San Lang is going to ask you a few questions.

455
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,430
The injury is nothing.

456
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,830
I want to know about someone.

457
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,520
I could stay alive

458
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,310
because an expert helped me.

459
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:07,470
An expert?

460
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:11,920
He descended from the sky.

461
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,950
(He moved agilely)

462
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,070
(and made quick attacks.)

463
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:16,350
(He defeated the evil man undoubtedly.)

464
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,400
Those moves...

465
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,110
They were so quick that...

466
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:25,800
Stop it.

467
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,430
Just sit.

468
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,520
Then...

469
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,350
I don't want to hear that.

470
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,920
The evil man was kicked so far away.

471
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,310
Deputy Chief, you're...

472
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,040
I'm afraid the weapon is poisonous.

473
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:53,760
Don't think too much.

474
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,040
You're a mischievous student

475
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,520
with a bad attitude.

476
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:00,800
Teachers don't like you.

477
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,430
You have no academic achievement.

478
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:06,400
And you disappoint Yu's expectations.

479
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,310
However...

480
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,640
Luckily you dodged it.

481
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:14,920
This evil man really

482
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,880
wanted to kill you.

483
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,800
So brutal.

484
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:18,680
The weapon was sharp as well.

485
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,310
Where have you been last night?

486
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:27,070
I told Zhuo Wen Yuan
that I wanted to meet Miss Qian Jiu.

487
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,830
After I left her side house...

488
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,520
Qian Jiu.

489
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,520
Side house? What's that?

490
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,640
It's called In This Mountain or something.

491
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,160
It's similar to Qing Xuan's.

492
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:47,880
Well, Deputy Chief.

493
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,310
Who do you think I've encountered?

494
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:50,640
Why did they ambush me?

495
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,230
You were poisoned first.

496
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Now you were ambushed.

497
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:54,950
Can't you just leave it alone?

498
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,160
Don't investigate that.

499
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:58,160
These won't happen if you focus on study.

500
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:00,680
Deputy Chief.

501
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:03,310
You worry too much.

502
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,110
If we just sit back

503
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,710
and let them happen,

504
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,950
what if they attack the innocent next time?

505
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,680
I doubt

506
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,680
that their targets are Zhuo Wen Yuan

507
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,640
and Miss Qian Jiu.

508
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,280
You still worry about others?

509
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:19,880
By the way, Deputy Chief.

510
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:21,710
Have you ever seen this pattern?

511
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,470
Where did you see this pattern?

512
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,430
On the shoulder of the evil man.

513
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,350
And...

514
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,560
Where else?

515
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:44,230
Why do you hesitate?

516
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,040
I'm afraid I didn't see it clearly.

517
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:47,640
And

518
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,310
on the back of Miss Qian Jiu's neck.

519
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,040
I see.

520
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,590
You don't have to worry about this.

521
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,520
I'll investigate it.

522
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,590
But rest assured, Deputy Chief.

523
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,280
Zhuo Wen Yuan won't hurt me.

524
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,400
I'm afraid

525
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:05,070
that he'll get into unknown trouble.

526
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,520
I said, don't worry about others.

527
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,400
Zhuo Wen Yuan is also my student.

528
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,400
I'll investigate this incident.

529
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:12,040
Okay.

530
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:13,880
Anyway,

531
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,640
why did you go there

532
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,590
to meet the entertainer?

533
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,350
Every person

534
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,710
has lust.

535
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:30,040
I went to see the beauty.

536
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,830
I also learned a lot.

537
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:33,950
What did you learn?

538
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,920
Apart from getting injured,
what else did you learn?

539
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,160
Let me tell you.

540
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:42,280
I think every lady is beautiful in her own way.

541
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,760
For instance, Miss Su.

542
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,710
She's brilliant

543
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,680
and knowledgeable.

544
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,920
Whereas Miss Qian Jiu

545
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,830
is elegant

546
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,590
and gorgeous.

547
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,590
And Song Jia Yin.

548
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,920
We don't get along well.

549
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:58,710
I think

550
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,160
there's something wrong with her.

551
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:02,560
But she's arrogant yet lovely

552
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,160
and energetic.

553
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,070
It's her way of being beautiful.

554
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,280
It's another kind of beautiful.

555
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,590
They're all different.

556
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,830
You don't always have to notice others.

557
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:16,640
Take a look at yourself too.

558
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,160
Lively.

559
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,560
Free and easy.

560
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,590
You're also unique.

561
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,680
The one and only troublemaker.

562
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,470
The most troublesome student I've ever met.

563
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,430
Give me back my leg.

564
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,350
Give it back.

565
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,230
Thank you for praising me.

566
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,920
It's my pleasure.

567
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,520
If there's nothing,

568
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,830
I'm going back to lie down.

569
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:51,590
Let's go.

570
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:52,560
Hold on.

571
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,470
Did you forget something?

572
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,590
Bring along your exercises and medicine.

573
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,640
Let's go, Young Lady.

574
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,770
(Grand Commandant's Residence)

575
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:26,000
Young Master.

576
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:30,590
Bai Shi.

577
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:33,040
Follow Sang Qi to and from school

578
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,110
since today.

579
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:34,950
Ensure her safety.

580
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:35,590
I...

581
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:36,950
Yes, Young Master.

582
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:57,040
Young Lady, Mr. Zhuo is here.

583
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,800
Someone visited you just now?

584
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,230
It's Deputy Chief.

585
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:05,040
He gave me many good gifts.

586
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,710
Study despite being injured, he said.

587
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:09,950
Who exactly dared

588
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,190
to lay a hand on you?

589
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:12,640
If he's caught,

590
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,430
I won't let him off!

591
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,040
All right.

592
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:20,000
I've heard of it many times.

593
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,920
If you want to take revenge for me,

594
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,590
you should

595
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:24,310
come after my father.

596
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:27,710
He's been swearing these two days.

597
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,800
Maybe he's still...

598
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:29,400
By the way,

599
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,520
did both of you meet any danger last night?

600
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,000
Is Miss Qian Jiu fine?

601
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:34,950
We're fine.

602
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,310
It's all my fault.

603
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,160
If I brought you back,

604
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,430
I wouldn't let you injured.

605
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,520
I'll take you to and from school every day

606
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,590
to ensure your safety.

607
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,430
You don't have to.

608
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,880
The evil man is highly skilled.

609
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,280
If you're with me,

610
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,520
you'll sacrifice too.

611
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:54,680
There's no need.

612
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,070
Qi.

613
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:58,230
Do you really think that I'm weak?

614
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,070
Forget it.

615
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,280
Don't pretend in front of me.

616
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,590
We've fought when we were young.

617
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:02,950
What do you think?

618
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,800
Don't worry.

619
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,040
I'm going to Imperial College tomorrow.

620
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,160
As usual.

621
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,560
Rest assured.

622
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:11,590
Okay.

623
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:13,640
Let me know

624
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:14,350
if you need any help.

625
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,560
I'll help you with all.

626
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:16,560
Okay.

627
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:26,120
(Unique symbol of Xizhao)

628
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,400
The carved pattern seen by Sang Qi

629
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,310
is the unique symbol of Xizhao Group

630
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:30,640
to identify their members.

631
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,680
Whoever with this pattern

632
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,070
(A man of great evil who betrays country)
is either a traitor

633
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,560
or a trader of the black market.

634
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,800
Or a killer.

635
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,040
In short, they're all stateless.

636
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:41,800
It's hard to investigate.

637
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,430
A few years ago,

638
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:46,560
the imperial court once ordered
to arrest Xizhao members.

639
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:48,680
After several times of arrests,

640
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,160
Xizhao has lost much of its spirit.

641
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,190
Although the main members have been arrested,

642
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:54,520
the leader is still nowhere to find.

643
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,190
No one knows the leader's identity.

644
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,710
It seems the arrests were not thorough.

645
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,710
They came back again.

646
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:02,830
Oh, right.

647
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:03,800
San Lang.

648
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:07,710
Don't investigate Qian Jiu first.

649
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,400
She has long stayed at Qingfeng Restaurant.

650
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,920
There's a lot of people.

651
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,590
I'm afraid

652
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,710
Sang Qi will be in danger again.

653
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:15,560
Understand.

654
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:16,680
I'll report to His Majesty

655
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:17,920
another day.

656
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,830
I'll inform Grand Commandant Sang as well.

657
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,560
Qi Lang, you must be careful.

658
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:24,640
We should learn the lesson from the past.

659
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,430
I don't want Sang family to get into any trouble.

660
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:33,880
But no matter how well-prepared I am,

661
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,560
they can always seize every opportunity.

662
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,590
If Sang Qi can protect herself...

663
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:41,070
It'd be great

664
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,710
if someone with better martial arts skills than me

665
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,110
is willing

666
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,110
to teach Sang Qi.

667
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,760
Better than you?

668
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,430
We could hardly find someone in Bianjing

669
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,230
who's able to compete with you.

670
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,880
Then let's find out of town.

671
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,520
As long as we won't be in danger.

672
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,220
(Grand Commandant's Residence)

673
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,190
Master Sang.

674
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:35,910
Walk slowly.

675
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:36,630
Let me take it.

676
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,230
Thank you.

677
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:37,840
Master Sang.

678
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,230
Why don't you rest for a few more days?

679
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,040
You came today.

680
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,360
Why should I rest more?

681
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,800
To make those who ambushed me feeling honored?

682
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,390
That's why I said

683
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,230
not to show off.

684
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,150
You may attract

685
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,560
evil people.

686
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,560
No one shows off more

687
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,360
than your Song family.

688
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:53,870
You're right.

689
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:54,950
Sang Qi.

690
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,600
You should've looked for me
to tell fortune the other day.

691
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,360
I knew you'd encounter a fatal disaster.

692
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,120
You never predict good things.

693
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,520
Sang Qi, tell us all.

694
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:05,600
How did you make it through that night?

695
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,630
Right.

696
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,230
Do you want to listen to the whole story?

697
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,360
Yes.

698
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:12,760
Go away.

699
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:24,190
That was a dark night.

700
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:26,150
I was asleep in the carriage.

701
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,040
The evil man suddenly appeared

702
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,950
from the bamboo grove.

703
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,910
He knocked the carter out just by a hit.

704
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,120
And then?

705
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:39,150
How can I stand

706
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,800
such an immoral raid?

707
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,190
Of course not!

708
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,040
(I jumped out of the carriage
and fought with him.)

709
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,910
(I had only one faith at that moment.)

710
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:52,840
Justice wins over evil.

711
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,280
How good.

712
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,360
Awesome.

713
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,470
Incredible.

714
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:00,470
How amazing.

715
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:02,190
Deputy Chief.

716
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,080
Let's go.

717
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,280
I'm not done yet!

718
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,320
Which part did you stop at?

719
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,280
The class already started.
You're still telling the story.

720
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:13,280
Have you finished reciting the text?

721
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:15,230
Deputy Chief.

722
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,360
Sang Qi.

723
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:17,390
Don't mention the incident

724
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:18,800
to others again.

725
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:21,760
Okay.

726
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:31,470
Go ahead.

727
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,360
Study things to acquire knowledge.

728
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:44,190
Acquire knowledge through the study of things.

729
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:47,600
With knowledge, one will be sincere.

730
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:51,230
Sincere ones will be upright.

731
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,840
Upright ones will cultivate themselves.

732
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,870
Once cultivated, the family becomes ordered.

733
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:04,080
Once the family becomes ordered,
the country becomes organized.

734
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:09,120
Once the country becomes organized,
the world becomes peaceful.

735
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:13,280
Whether the emperors or the folks,

736
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,390
each should take self-cultivation
as the foundation.

737
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,760

all of these are not going to happen.

Be careful.

857
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:58,870
I'm leaving.

858
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:00,430
Careful.

859
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,760
Master's word is ignored.

860
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,040
It's swept aside.

861
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,120
Expert.

862
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:34,710
Please let me be your disciple.

863
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:46,230
Deputy Chief.

864
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:49,760
Deputy Chief, why are you here?

865
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:50,670
What's wrong with me?

866
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:51,840
This...

867
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,190
Why is it you?

868
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:56,390
Why can't it be me?

869
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,120
What are you doing here?

870
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,230
I should ask you that.

871
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,360
Your injury isn't severe enough?

872
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:04,320
You want it to be more severe?

873
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,800
Hey, don't say so.

874
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:08,670
I'm here to learn martial arts from a master.

875
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:10,150
I didn't see the expert.

876
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,950
And yet I asked to be your disciple.

877
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:14,230
I'm your Deputy Chief.

878
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:16,360
What's wrong with that?

879
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:18,950
It's been late. You should go back.

880
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:20,120
Listen.

881
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:21,430
Don't think about it again.

882
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:23,280
There's no one living in the mountain.

883
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,150
The expert you mentioned

884
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:25,560
might be a passer-by.

885
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:29,080
Deputy Chief.

886
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:31,230
Since you know it well,

887
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,760
why don't you tell me the way?

888
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:36,520
Go back home.

889
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,150
I was careless.

890
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:02,710
