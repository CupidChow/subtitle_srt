Did I hear that correctly?

142
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,110
It is the most prestigious academy
of Song Dynasty.

143
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,000
It usually recruits young noblemen

Everything starts somewhere.

148
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,880
I can make my case with His Majesty

149
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,270
and ask him to send me there

150

It is the wish of my late brother.

154
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,470
He wanted me to inherit his ambition

155
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,000
and study at the Imperial College.

00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,470
then I'll find someone to raze this place.

165
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,000
you were that bold as to

166
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,320
tell me your real name.

167
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:18,790

00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,080
Miss Song.

172
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:27,760
Mind your words.

173
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,590
She is the daughter of Grand Commandant Sang,

174
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,710
Sang Qi.

175
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,960
Oh, so you're a girl

176
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,960
who spent all her life by the frontier fortress?

177
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,710
No wonder you're not familiar with the city rules.

178
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:43,080
You embarrassed me in front of my future husband.

179
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,760
Qi Lang.

180
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,440
Since when are you wedded?

181
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,470
She's calling you her future husband already.

182
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,200
Also,

183
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,910
you are supposed to concede
the last bottle of wine to the ladies.

184
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,400
I paid first.

185
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,640
So that girl was Sang Qi,

186
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,200
the younger sister of Sang Yu?

187
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,640
Meeting her in person is much better
than believing the rumors.

188
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,110
I don't care if you're the daughter
of the Grand Commandant.

189
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,910
Even if I can't do anything to you,

190
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,320
this restaurant still

191
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,760
owes me an explanation.

192
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,030
She might have a pretty face,

193
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,030
but she has nothing in her brain.

194
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,710
All she does is throwing tantrum.

195
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,440
Give me a break already.

196
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,030
Exactly.

197
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,910
What are you two talking about?

198
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,400
It's a compliment.

199
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,000
Miss Song, I was complimenting you.

200
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,880
Your grace and beauty are mesmerizing.

201
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,790
Of course.

202
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,640
You appeared in front of me several times
and caused trouble.

203
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,710
Are you just trying to get my attention?

204
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,840
Not at all.

205
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,640
Even if you are, you should give up.

206
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,520
If you cross me, you'll have to pay for it.

207
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,880
Take this waiter away.

208
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,760
Wait.

209
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,640
Miss Song.

210
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,790
This waiter here has a family.

211
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,080
Why do you have to be this heartless?

212
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,400
How I deal with him has nothing to do with you.

213
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,320
Also,

214
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,400
his mistake was

215
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,280
that he allowed you to ruin my plan.

216
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,110
Tell me then, Miss Song.

217
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:11,000
How did I ruin your plan?

218
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,840
If you can spare him,

219
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,320
I can help you do

220
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,590
whatever you planned to do.

221
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,910
Entertain me then.

222
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,280
Miss Sang,

223
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,400
let's make a bet, shall we?

224
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,400
Make Yan Yun Zhi take your pouch.

225
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,150
Yan Yun Zhi?

226
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,230
Who is he?

227
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,910
The young man who alighted from the carriage.

228
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,710
Oh, that man.

229
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,910
That young gentleman
who struggled to open his eyes

230
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,840
and who couldn't talk?

231
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,880
What an apt description.

232
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,910
I am both handsome and dashing.

233
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,080
Never have I gotten such remarks before.

234
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,400
This is infuriating.

235
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,960
The Lantern Festival will be the deadline.

236
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,030
If you can't make Yan Yun Zhi

237
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,590
keep your pouch by then,

238
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:18,080
then you shall get on stage and perform in public

239
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,710
like those entertainers.

240
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,520
What do you think?

241
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,760
You will be the laughing stock in Bianjing.

242
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,790
And if he keeps my pouch?

243
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,710
Then I'll be the one performing.

244
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:31,080
I will apologize to you in front of everyone

245
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,200
in Bianjing.

246
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,520
And I'll promise to never bother you anymore.

247
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:38,280
Allow me to remind you, Miss Song.

248
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,200
If Qi loses the bet

249
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,550
and has to perform during the festival,

250
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:45,350
your ears might suffer.

251
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,840
I will still watch her performance.

252
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,280
Shopkeeper.

253
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,280
Bring pen and paper. We'll write it down.

254
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,000
No need for that.

255
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:53,230
I am a woman of my own word.

256
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,910
Everyone here is the witness.

257
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,110
I agree with this bet.

258
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,230
All right.

259
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:02,150
I'm waiting.

260
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,280
Yin.

261
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,710
Yan Yun Zhi refused your pouch.

262
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,710
Why give yourself another rival?

263
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,590
I need a lousy copycat for my own good.

264
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,230
How can he appreciate my beauty

265
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,790
without seeing someone ugly first?

266
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:28,790
Where should I find this Yan Yun Zhi?

267
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,590
It's just to give him my pouch.

268
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,230
Why do I have to wait till the Lantern Festival?

269
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,230
Qi,

270
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,550
I thought applying to the Imperial College

271
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,790
was already tough enough for you.

272
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,520
But no, you outdid yourself this time.

273
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,710
What do you mean?

274
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,440
Who is Yan Yun Zhi actually?

275
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,080
Yan Yun Zhi,

276
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,760
one of the Four Bachelors of Bianjing.

277
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,960
The other three are Qing Xuan, Yan Xiao Lang,

278
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,110
and me.

279
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,230
You?

280
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,470
The standard is not very strict, is it?

281
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,910
The hardest bachelor to impress

282
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,520
is Yan Yun Zhi.

283
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,000
He's just a secondary son
of the Chancellor,

284
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,880
but he's a polymath.

285
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,670
In terms of appearance, he's second to me.

286
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:12,880
He doesn't like those
who readily offer themselves to him.

287
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,840
If you want him to take your pouch,

288
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,000
you can start by
learning how to play the guqin now.

289
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,910
No worries.

290
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,150
There's no nut I can't crack.

291
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,960
I know.

292
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,590
Speak of the devil.

293
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:31,760
Let's see how you fare.

294
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,440
Go ahead.

295
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,760
Mr. Yan.

296
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:43,230
We met twice in one day.

297
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:44,640
How fortuitous.

298
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,230
Please take my pouch.

299
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:50,910
In Bianjing,

300
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,880
giving a man your pouch
means you have feelings for him.

301
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:53,670
No.

302
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:54,550
Not at all.

303
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,400
Don't misinterpret this.

304
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,880
I don't have feelings for you.

305
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,790
Likewise.

306
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:58,760
Wonderful.

307
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,790
Someone who can't open his eyes

308
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:03,760
and can't speak

309
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,320
does not deserve the love

310
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,710
of Miss Sang here.

311
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,230
You're too humble.

312
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,760
You just have to widen your eyes like this.

313
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,910
Look, such piercing eyes.

314
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,030
Everyone can see them now.

315
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,280
Beautiful eyes.

316
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,440
You have no shame.

317
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:27,790
Is this how people
who live by the frontier fortress act?

318
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,200
You were talking behind my back

319
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,640
and now, you want me to take your pouch?

320
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:32,760
What are you trying to do?

321
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,280
Well, I...

322
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,230
I just came here from the frontier fortress.

323
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,550
My accent is still there.

324
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,000
It shows when I speak.

325
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,200
I didn't talk behind your back.

326
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,470
It's impossible.

327
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,840
Impossible.

328
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,080
Yes. Yes.

329
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,470
Today is not my day.

330
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:59,710
Two weirdos in one day.

331
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:02,080
It's because you talked behind his back.

332
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,150
No, I didn't.

333
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,080
I'm talking in front of him now.

334
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,790
Look at him.

335
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,400
Song Jia Yin and he are a match

336
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,710
made in heaven.

337
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:11,230
Perfect match.

338
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,000
It's not like he understands anyway.

339
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,080
Compliment him.

340
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,030
Pretend you're complimenting him.

341
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:16,910
Compliment. Compliment.

342
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,150
Dummy.

343
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,200
Silly.

344
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,400
But I do understand.

345
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,470
I was on duty in Shudao once.

346
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:26,840
I've learned a few words.

347
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,470
Then... is there still a chance

348
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,080
between us?

349
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,320
Only if I've lost my mind.

350
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,280
Only if you've lost your mind...

351
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,230
Thanks for the tip, Sir.

352
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,230
It's mine!

353
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,880
So that's how you'll impress him?

354
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,960
What is wrong with today?

355
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,400
The Lantern Festival is still days away.

356
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,350
Yan Yun Zhi will

357
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:12,000
take my pouch eventually.

358
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,280
My gosh.

359
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,230
I haven't settled my main business,

360
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:19,110
and now, I have a bet to worry about.

361
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,560
Main business?

362
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,880
Are you still trying to enroll
in the Imperial College?

363
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:27,430
I am a woman of my word.

364
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,520
I will study there.

365
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:32,950
It will be tough.

366
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,680
Did I smell roast lamb?

367
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:39,830
Yes.

368
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,830
Let's go. Time to feast.

369
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:42,520
Let's go.

370
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:47,500
(Grand Commandant's Residence)

371
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,920
(Father)

372
00:17:52,920 --> 00:18:08,800
(Father, can you ask His Majesty to give me
permission to study at the Imperial College?)

373
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,850
(I grant Sang Qi, daughter of Grand Commandant Sang,
the permission to study at the Imperial College.)

374
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,470
(Royal Decree)

375
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:15,920
Ridiculous!

376
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,040
How ridiculous!

377
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,520
Throughout my life,

378
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:23,430
I have never heard of a woman
being permitted to have official education.

379
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,110
If Grand Commandant Sang

380
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:28,640
asks His Majesty to let her daughter
study in Imperial College,

381
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,950
then one day, her daughter can rise

382
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,190
to the same position

383
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,350
as us!

384
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,040
That's right.

385
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,430
Deputy Chief.

386
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,880
I have discussed this with other scholars.

387
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,190
We need to give Sang Qi an exam.

388
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:47,070
Imperial College is no place for anyone.

389
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,310
Yes, exam!

390
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:53,470
But the current batch of students

391
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,830
is all recruited from other public academies.

392
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,110
They did not take any entrance exams.

393
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,430
Why does Sang Qi have to take one?

394
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,880
Just because she's a woman?

395
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:04,950
Besides, if we have all agreed

396
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,430
to recruit our very first

397
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,430
female student,

398
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,110
why be extra harsh on her?

399
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,590
I...

400
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,430
Deputy Chief,

401
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,760
Scholar Feng is just being careful.

402
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:19,310
Recruiting a female student is unconventional

403
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:20,400
so we have to convince the public.

404
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:21,950
Please think twice, Deputy Chief.

405
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,280
Please think twice, Deputy Chief.

406
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,070
I did think this through.

407
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,880
Education should be ever-evolving.

408
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,040
We shouldn't think inside the box.

409
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,230
If Sang Qi has great academic potential,

410
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:38,040
then we cannot
be extra critical of her just because

411
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,230
she's a woman

412
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,470
and refuse her application.

413
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,230
If we do that, a talent will be wasted.

414
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:47,590
In that case, Deputy Chief,

415
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:51,760
all the more reason to give her an exam.

416
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,310
If Sang Qi fails,

417
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,920
it means she is not smart enough.

418
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,950
She will then

419
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:59,070
not be given the chance to study
in the Imperial College.

420
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:01,680
And if His Majesty wants to hold us accountable,

421
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,880
we can give him a proper answer.

422
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,110
Don't you think so?

423
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,000
Yes.

424
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,710
If this is what you want, dear scholars,

425
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:12,710
then

426
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,230
let's see if Sang Qi

427
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,680
has

428
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,430
what it takes or not.

429
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,070
Exam?

430
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,590
Only me?

431
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,920
They are just trying to make things harder for me.

432
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,950
I already told you it'd be tough.

433
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:31,190
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

434
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,230
If you can study at the Imperial College,

435
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,950
it means you must have some study tips.

436
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,160
Tell me, please.

437
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:40,520
Rome was not built in a day.

438
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,920
I really can't help you this time.

439
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,040
Father.

440
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,400
Brother.

441
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,830
I failed you two.

442
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:03,000
I failed the Sang family.

443
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,590
I failed our ancestors!

444
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,800
I failed all the lamb soup with flatbreads

445
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,830
as well as the candied fruits I ate
for more than a decade. I...

446
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,070
Enough.

447
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:12,800
You'll tell me?

448
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,280
Yes. Sit down.

449
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,430
I can't take the exam for you,

450
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,880
but I'm familiar with those teachers

451
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,710
in the Imperial College.

452
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,110
You just have to understand them and write

453
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,830
what they want to see.

454

And now, you give me an exam

which is Grand Commandant Sang's family.

didn't he?

00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:26,590
in the Imperial College

555

since its founding.

556
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:29,800
Nonsense!

557
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,710
A woman studying in the Imperial College?

558
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:32,710
Has the world gone mad?

559
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,470
It will tarnish the reputation of this college.

560
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:34,950
Exactly!

00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:36,310
No way Scholar Feng

562
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:37,470
or Deputy Chief will agree to it.

563
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,680
And not just that,

564
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,280
will His Majesty agree to it?

565
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,470
Sang Qi came to the Imperial College yesterday

566
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,760
and passed the entrance exam.

567
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,710

Aren't you the eldest son of the Grand Preceptor?

570
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,000
How can you not know of this?

571
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:55,590
She's the daughter of Grand Commandant Sang.

572
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:57,230
She grew up with him and now,

573
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:59,880
she's old enough for a marriage.

574
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,400
That's why she was sent back to Bianjing.

575
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,920
Whether she is old enough for a marriage...

576
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,430
Exactly!

577
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:04,760
is none of your business.

578
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:06,710
Why? You want to ask for her hand?

579
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,070
She doesn't want to study in her own house

580
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,880
and instead, she came to

581
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,190
the Imperial College where only men study.

582
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:14,590
The way I see it,

583
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,280
she's here to pick a suitor.

584
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,070
A suitor?

585
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,710
She thinks we're just her playthings.

586
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:19,640
Who does she think we are?

587
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,160
Exactly.

588
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,640
This is the first day of school.

589
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,520
A girl

590
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,430
took our spotlight just like that.

591
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:26,040
She's plotting something.

592
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,560
Who says women can't study
in the Imperial College?

593
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:31,230
But this is the first time we have

594
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:32,280
a female student here.

595
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,280
Let me divine.

596
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:38,920
So?

597
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,040
What's the result?

598
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:40,800
It's...

599
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:42,230
Great Misfortune.

600
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,040
Great Misfortune?

601
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:46,070
This is bad.

602
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:48,470
A female student in the Imperial College?
This is immoral!

603
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,040
But...

604
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:50,830
Let me divine again.

605
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:55,190
Now, I'm interested to know

606
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,800
what kind of girl she is.

607
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,040
Me too.

608
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,880
Let's show her how we do things

609
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,590
in the Imperial College!

610
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,520
Let's leave.

611
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:06,680
Let's go.

612
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,800
- Let me divine.
- Let's go.

613
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,950
Just let me divine again!

614
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:09,680
Go!

Sang Qi.

621
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,710
Present the gift.

622
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,350
As a student,

623
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,640
this is my sincerest greetings, Deputy Chief Yan.

624
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,110
Sang Qi.

625
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,590
Do you know

626
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,230
what giving a man your pouch means?

627
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:32,710
Yes,

628
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,230
it means I have feelings for you.

629
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,880
But this is not what I meant.

630
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,680
What do you mean then?

631
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:42,760
It means we are just teacher and student.

632
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,880
It's a gift.

633
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:48,760
Deputy Chief Yan,

634
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,710
this is a gift from your student.

635
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,640
You have to accept it.

00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,160
Record this.

638
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,560
Today, Sang Qi gave me

639
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,560
one ink brush case as my student.

640
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,920
Stupid trick.

00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:29,920
(Grand Hall)

642
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:34,880

Deputy Chief.

644
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,710
Deputy Chief.

645
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:20,470
Even though the handiwork is still wanting,

646
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:22,040
please accept my gift.

647
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,590
Will you let this go?

648
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:26,350
When a girl gives away her pouch,
it's usually filled with love.

649
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,590
But you.

650
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:28,710
You will force it down someone's throat.

651
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,470
If you were an assassin,

652
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:31,590
I would have died from

653
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,350
your arrows,

654
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,000
scaring tactics,

655
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,190
and suffered from a stroke
due to your stubbornness.

656
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,830
I had to use

657
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,070
unconventional means or else

658
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,880
it's not special enough to get your attention.

659
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,350
You really have no shame.

660
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:46,640
Deputy Chief.

661
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,070
For the past encounters we shared,

662
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:51,830
take this pouch, please.

663
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,640
We do not share any past encounters.

664
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,470
Take your pouch away.

665
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:57,950
I'll bring you to the classroom.

666
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:00,000
(Class Sky)

667
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,640
The Imperial College will categorize everyone
based on their potential

668
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,230
into Class Sky, Terre, Black, and Yellow.

669
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,400
All students should respect
the teachers and help each other.

670
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,400
Do not do anything out of the line.

671
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,110
Understood?

672
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,040
This is Class Sky.

673
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,400

00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,590
Stay here if you dare.

679
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,190
This is your classroom.

680
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:31,920
Class Yellow.

681
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,190
Hurry!

682
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,710
Quick!

683
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:36,550
(Let's learn some poems)

684
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,940
(Class Yellow)

685
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,310
Go in.

686
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,280
Do I

687
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,000
really deserve this?

688
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:50,800
Remember this.

689
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,310
Respect your teacher

690
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,400
and behave.

691
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:01,750
(Class Yellow)

692
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,470
Why is she assigned

693
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,950
to Class Yellow?

694
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,070
And I thought she was smart.

695
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,040
So you're Sang Qi?

696
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,110
She ignored me.

697
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:03,430
Why did he come to Class Yellow?

698
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:04,800
I know, right?

699
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,000
Why is he here?

700
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,110
What is he doing here?

701
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:12,760
Isn't he in Class Sky?

702
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,830
- Why did he come here?
- I know, right?

703
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:15,190
Why is he here?

704
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:17,800
Zhuo,

705
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,320
why did you come to our class?

706
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,630
From now on,

707
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,040
I'm part of Class Yellow.

708
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,040
Did I hear you correctly?

709
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,040
Why did you choose Class Yellow

710
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,710
instead of staying in Class Sky?

711
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,080
I'll go back if I get any trouble.

712
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:35,390
(Let's learn some poems)

713
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:36,390
Why are you here?

714
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:37,760
To be your classmate.

715
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,120
To be my classmate?

716
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:42,390
No.

717
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:42,670
You

718
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:44,360
should head back to your class.

719
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:46,150
You want me to go back?

720
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,760
Easy.

721
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,710
Ace the exam

722
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,800
and get into Class Sky. We'll go back together.

723
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,840
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

724
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,800
Deputy Chief asked for you in the main hall.

725
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:24,840
Deputy Chief.

726
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,150
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

727
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,320
You rank

728
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,320
first in Class Sky.

729
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:36,040
You'll most likely

730
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,190
get into the top three, or even the first,
in the imperial exam.

731
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,950
Why do you wish to go to Class Yellow?

732
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:43,080
You're destroying your own future.

733
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:44,670
You once said that

734
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,630
we shouldn't study merely for glory and fame.

735
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,280
I remember your teaching by heart, Deputy Chief.

736
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,470
Class Sky, Terre, Black, and Yellow.

737
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:54,910
You went from the first class to the last class.

738
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,760
Is your aunt aware of this?

739
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,280
Deputy Chief.

740
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:00,840
This is but a small matter.

741
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:02,560
No need to tell her.

742
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:05,520
Allow me

743
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,600
to ask you this then.

744
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:09,120
Why?

745
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:13,390
Allow me to ask you too, Deputy Chief.

746
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,600
Sang Qi is a woman.

747
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:18,000
It is not easy for her
to enroll in the Imperial College.

748
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,280
Why are you making it tougher?

749
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,360
You think I'm harsh on her?

750
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,710
Sang Qi might not be qualified for Class Sky,

751
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,560
but with her result

752
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,520
and her family background,

753
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,630
she's more than enough for Class Terre.

754
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,000
To study

755
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,670
is to be humble.

756
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,630
There are many women who stay at home

757
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:42,910
but only she has the chance to study.

758
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,760
If she cannot be a role model for other girls,

759
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,840
then

760
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,870
no other girl

761
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:49,710
will dare to take a step into this college.

762
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:53,600
I understand your intention, Deputy Chief.

763
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,760
However,

764
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,950
Sang Qi is not someone who gives up easily.

765
00:36:59,150 --> 00:36:59,950
I shall take my leave.

766
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,250
(How are you, Qi?)

767
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:10,320
Qi?

768
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,280
Yu.

769
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,320
To which girl

770
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,000
are you writing this letter?

771
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,670
Stop teasing.

772
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:15,950
She's my younger sister.

773
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:18,520
I want to recommend her to study here.

774
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:19,870
What do you think?

775
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,950
I think you must be joking.

776
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:23,470
A woman in a school?

777
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:24,710
Wake up already.

778
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:25,710
I'm serious.

779
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,630
If Qi ever comes back to Bianjing

780
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,910
and enrolls in the Imperial College,

781
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,280
please take good care of her for me.

782
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,800
She's your younger sister, not mine.

783
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,800
I don't know her.

784
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:35,040
You know my health condition, don't you?

785
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,320
I don't know if I can live to see that day.

786
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,000
Yu.

787
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,280
I can promise you,

788
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,430
but you need to stop your nonsense.

789
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:43,080
Okay.

790
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,600
I can rest assured then.

791
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,720
(Grand Hall)

792
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:08,430
Deputy Chief.

793
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:12,040
Is he taking a nap?

794
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:14,390
I'll come in then.

795
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,430
Deputy Chief!

796
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,430
Deputy Chief,

797
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:37,870
why do you want to suicide?

798
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:44,600
This is...

799
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:47,910
Bai Shi.

800
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:48,710
Yes?

801
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,800
Inform the Prefecture Court that

802
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,320
the victim might have used a broad
strip of cloth to hang himself.

803
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:54,560
That's why there's no suspension mark
by his earlobe.

804
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,120
Yes, Young Master.

805
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:58,710
Deputy Chief.

806
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,520
So you're helping the Prefecture Court
to investigate a case.

807
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,320
Why are you laughing?

808
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:11,760
And why are you here?

809
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,520
Well,

810
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:17,560
I haven't seen you in a day.

811
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:18,840
I've missed you

812
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,390
so I came here for a visit.

813
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:22,760
Worry about your study.

814
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:24,520
Getting into this college

815
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,360
is just the beginning.

816
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:28,040
You're saying that

817
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,910
you might expel me?

818
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,360
What do you think?

819
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:34,360
Don't worry, Deputy Chief.

820
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,840
I will work hard

821
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,670
so that your plan will fail.

822
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,080
I hope so.

823
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,710
If there's nothing,

824
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,430
I'll head back to study then.

825
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,360
Wait.

826
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:49,950
Take your thing with you.

827
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:16,630
Where did you go?

828
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,430
I went to find Deputy Chief.

829
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:21,470
He is still not taking your pouch, I bet.

830
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:22,630
He won't take it.

831
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:23,320
He was hanging himself.

832
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:24,670
What?

833
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,120
Deputy Chief attempted suicide?

834
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,600
Then...

835
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,470
Is he okay?

836
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:30,760
He's well. Don't worry.

837
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,670
He couldn't be better.

838
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:35,000
Qi.

839
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,430
What happened?

840
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:36,360
Suicide?

841
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,000
Qi!

842
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,390
(Enrich my knowledge, restrict me with formality)
You will have better job prospects!

843
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:38,910
Thanks, Meng.

844
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:39,800
Let me divine for you too.

845
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,630
I have something to tell you.

846
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,150
What thing?

847
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:42,760
Don't tell anyone.

848
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,700
(Classroom)

849
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,670
Scholar, I need to tell you something.

850
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,600

Why?

853
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,080
I need to tell you something.

854
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:50,950

My bad.

00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,320
My bad.

862
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:09,910
Who said that?

863
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:10,840
I don't know either.
