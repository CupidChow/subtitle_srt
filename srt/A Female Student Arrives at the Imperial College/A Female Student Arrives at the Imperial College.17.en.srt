Qi,

32
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,360
if you don't want me to leave,

33
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,270
I won't go.

34
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,590
I haven't fulfilled my brother's last wish.

35

Besides, the matters in Xizhao are not solved yet.

You can't leave...

37
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:58,680
I'm asking you a question.

38
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,400
Go... go away!

39
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,630
Do you want me to go away?

40
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:11,870
No...

(Cenotaph of the beloved son, Sang Yu)
I was telling

42
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,550
it to go away, but it refused.

43
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,470
Then answer me.

44
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,110
I don't want you to leave.

45
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,110
I want you to stay.

46
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,750

If you don't mind,

51
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,750
I'll like to take these back to paper my wall.

52
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,800
It looks like Deputy Chief Yan's departure
from the Imperial College

53
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,720
has had a huge impact

54
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,910
on the students' studies.

55
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,110
We don't know when Deputy Chief Yan will return.

56
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,190
Do we have any other way?

57
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,910
Although I'm quite respectable
among the students,

58
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:39,880
they

59
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,470
may not care if I teach them.

60
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,390
However, if they're doing this on purpose,

61
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,520
I'll still report this matter to His Majesty.

implored for the return of Yan Yun Zhi)

69
00:04:10,896 --> 00:04:12,176
- It's exciting to sign.
- I know, right?

70
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,470
Zhuo, come here quickly.

71
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,160
I'll...

72
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,270
Watch my spot.

73
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:23,830
Bring him here.

74
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,510
Come here.

75
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,950
Zhuo, sign your name.

76
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,040
Stand here.

77
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,790
I should leave...

78
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,440
Zhuo, if you don't sign,

79
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,790
there will be no end to our sufferings

80

with Scholar Feng here.

81
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,320
Just sign it.

82
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,070
Just sign.

83
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:42,920
It's just signing your name.

84
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,550
She's right.

85
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,160
It's almost our turn.

86
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,830
Line up.

87
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,440
It's our turn soon.

88
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,950
It's exciting to think about signing it.

89
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,320
You're right.

90
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,250
(Students' names)

91
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,790
May I know to what purpose Your Majesty

92
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,160
summons me to the palace?

93
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,500
(Students' names)

94
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,070
All the teachers and students
of the Imperial College jointly remonstrated

95
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,110
to call upon the return of Yan Yun Zhi
to the Imperial College.

96
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,390
What do you think about this, Grand Tutor Song?

97
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,000
(Report)

98
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,550
Well...

99
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,550
This matter isn't under

100
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,600
my scope of responsibility.

101
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,670
Your Majesty can make the decision.

102
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,270
When Yan Yun Zhi was chased
out of the Imperial College,

103
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,640
you were the one who insisted upon it.

104
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,950
I think

105
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:51,880
education is not a trivial matter,
which shouldn't be based on feelings.

106
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,670
Ultimately, it should be based
on actual achievements.

107
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:56,510
If the number of passing students

108
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:00,390
in the imperial examination this year
doesn't exceed that of the previous years,

109
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:05,720
it'll be meaningless even if Yan Yun Zhi returns.

110
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,640
Good! Grand Tutor, you have a point.

111
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,440
We shall take this year's imperial
examination as the test.

112
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,640
We shall see if Yan Yun Zhi is qualified

113
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,000
to be the Deputy Chief of Imperial College.

114
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,480
(The wind blows and carries a beautiful poem)
Do you think this will work?

115
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,320
I have no idea.

116
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,950
It had been a while
since we submitted the petition.

117
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,670
Why is Deputy Chief not back yet?

118
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,510
Perhaps His Majesty found it troublesome

119
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,790
and had sent back the petition.

120
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,510
He has the temperament of a child.

121
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:47,270
He will believe you if you say that.

122
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,110
That's right. Don't try to scare me.

123
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,550
Deputy Chief.

124
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,480
It's Deputy Chief.

125
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,040
- Deputy Chief is back!
- Deputy Chief is back!

126
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,040
Deputy Chief is back!

127
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,070
Who's worried about me?

128
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:06,390
- Deputy Chief!
- Deputy Chief!

129
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,950
You're finally back!

130
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
We missed you so much!

131
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:09,880
Deputy Chief,

132
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,270
our suffering has ended.

133
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,670
Exactly!

134
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,510
This response is not what I expected.

135
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:16,550
Deputy Chief,

136
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,230
you must not forget our friendship.

137
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,350
I was the one who told them

138
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,350
to sign the petition for His Majesty.

139
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,200
He's right.

140
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,110
Everyone looks energetic.

141
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:28,920
It looks like Scholar Feng taught you well.

142
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,230
Now that I have returned,

143
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,950
I'll certainly create a new environment
for all of you.

144
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,760
Follow me to the main hall.

145
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:36,600
Let's go!

146
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,760
- Let's assemble at the main hall!
- Assemble at the main hall!

147
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,270
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

148
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,370
(We has talents now and here)

149
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,990
(Autumn leaves floating all over the courtyard)

150
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,880
His Majesty has agreed to let me stay
at the Imperial College.

151
00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,640
Really?

152
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,720
- That's great!
- That's good!

153
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,920
- That's wonderful!
- Great!

154
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,270
- Great!
- That's terrific!

155
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:07,160
- Great!

156
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:13,160
However,

157
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,880
the condition is that this year's
imperial examination result

158
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,070
must exceed those of the previous years.

159
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,230
Exceed previous years?

160
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,070
What about me?

161
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,350
It's impossible.

162
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,320
Don't fret.

163
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,110
We have Class Sky, have we not?

164
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,670
Heaven favors them, right?
What's so hard about that?

165
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,480
I can't believe you said that.

166
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,590
How am I not the favored one?

167
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,440
I didn't focus

168
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,640
on my studies, that's all.

169
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,320
I could beat all of you.

170
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,110
This is an important matter
to the Imperial College.

171
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:57,230
We must not rely on the ability of Class Sky.

172
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,200
Scholar Feng and I have discussed this matter.

173
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,350
From today on,

174
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,760
Class Sky and Class Yellow
will study in the same classroom.

175
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,110
Class Terre and Class Black
will be in the same classroom.

176
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,320
We're all classmates and friends.

177
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,910
We should encourage each other.

178
00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:13,000
The hard days are coming again.

179
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,910
Let's help each other.

180
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:16,670
I will stick to Class Sky.

181
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,080
Let's help each other.

182
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:29,640
Let me carry it.

183
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,350
Thank you.

184
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:34,550
Watch your hands.

185
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,200
Brother, I'll be counting on you after this.

186
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:08,900
(Achievements are brilliant.)
(All learners should follow the rules.)

187
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,760
I can't believe this is the solution!

188
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,200
This is wonderful.

189
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,790
We both have parents.

190
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,440
Why are you so outstanding?

191
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:24,520
It pays to work hard.

192
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,590
To compare with you, I'm not as handsome as you.

193
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,080
You're even good with words.

194
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,110
He's so refined!

195
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:45,100
(Textbook)

196
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,790
Zhuo Wen Yuan,

197
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,110
it's going to be an extensive study from now on.

198
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,080
Don't worry about me.

199
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,280
I'm going to delay your studies.

200
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,760
Since you've studied here,

201
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,640
I've already decided to abandon myself
from progressing.

202
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:58,230
But I did it willingly.

203
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,470
I owe you one, then.

204
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,470
Sang Qi.

205
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:08,960
Deputy Chief,

206
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,080
there are some problems with your composition.

207
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,760
Go to my study, and I'll explain it to you.

208
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,280
All right.

209
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:14,400
Deputy Chief,

210
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,670
it's self-study time.

211
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,400
If you want to play favorites,

212
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,320
you'll have to wait until I finish explaining
the topics to Sang Qi.

213
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,000
Since Sang Qi has some problems,

214
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,030
I can explain them to her.

215
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,350
Deputy Chief, I have problems
with my composition too.

216
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,150
Why don't Sang Qi and I go to your study,

217
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,960
and you can explain it to both of us?

218
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:35,960
You must believe in yourself.

219
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,350
Your composition is good.

220
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,790
I've already decided

221
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,590
to put it up as a first-class model.

222
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,200
Thank you, Deputy Chief.

223
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,790
But I want to keep improving.

224
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,230
Otherwise, someone will rob the top position.

225
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,200
Zhuo Wen Yuan,

226
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,550
the Deputy Chief is busy.

227
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,400
He rarely has the time to give me a lecture.

228
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,440
I'll come back later.

229
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,670
I'll return in a while, okay?

230
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,200
You finished it so soon.

231
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,030
Not bad.

232
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,840
The writing is coherent and clear.

233
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,640
You included all the main points
I mentioned just now.

234
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:57,280
Deputy Chief,

235
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,400
will I be able to be listed
for the examination with this?

236
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:03,880
Qi,

237
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,790
being listed in the imperial examination
isn't the most important.

238
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,790
It's a test for me this time.

239
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,110
It's also a test for you

240
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,760
to confirm if women can study in public schools.

241
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:21,760
Be confident.

242
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,110
We still have time.

243
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,440
Other than you,

244
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,710
I hope all students at the Imperial College

245
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:30,000
will gain a higher level of knowledge
when that time comes.

246
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:33,470
By the way,

247
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,590
you haven't told me the update

248
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,520
after they killed the Wei family in Jingzhou.

249
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:40,880
There's no clue yet.

250
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,520
For the time being,

251
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,350
you should do your duty as a student.

252
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,470
We'll discuss the rest next time.

253
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,000
You're right.

254
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,400
I've been preparing

255
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:50,670
for this moment for so long.

256
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,280
I must not waste my effort.

257
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,520
Speaking of which, what do you want to do

258
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,110
after the examination is over?

259
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,440
I want to have a sumptuous meal

260
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,910
and tell everyone about us.

261
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,350
When it comes to this matter,

262
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,110
how can a lady be the one telling it?

263
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:09,880
Let me do it instead.

264
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,670
I've already given it some thought.

265
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,640
I think I should say it.

266
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,320
If you said it,

267
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,520
the public would say

268
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,840
you're taking advantage of me
because of your position.

269
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,230
If I said it

270
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,350
openly,

271
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,320
we don't have to fear anyone.

272
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,910
I didn't expect you to think so carefully.

273
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,470
I'll let you decide.

274
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,640
Also, I need to go to the mountain.

275
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:30,400
Go to the mountain?

276
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,030
Lingwu Mountain?

277
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:32,520
Yes.

278
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,520
I want to tell Master

279
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,110
that I'm not only his student.

280
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,960
I'm also his nephew's wife,

281
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,320
so he'll stop making fun of me again.

282
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,150
If he dares to make fun of you again,

283
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,080
I'll pull off his beard for you.

284
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:48,350
Deputy Chief,

285
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,840
time flies.

286
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:52,910
There's one that's even faster.

287
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,670
After the imperial examination is over,

288
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:58,880
will you accept my hand in marriage?

289
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,520
I'm not telling you.

290
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:05,550
Qi,

291
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,520
if you have trouble with your studies,

292
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,470
you can ask me.

293
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,590
Don't ask other men.

294
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:17,400
Is someone having dumplings?

295
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,790
I smell a strong sour vinegar scent.
[*means "jealous"]

296
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,030
Promise me.

297
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:23,960
All right.

298
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,620
(Qingfeng Restaurant)

299
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,710
Give me one catty of beef.

300
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,760
Another one catty of trotters.

301
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,550
Also, a jar of wine.

302
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,550
That's all.

303
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,440
Take your time.

304
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:39,910
All right.

305
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:44,880
Qi Lang.

306
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,710
I mean Deputy Chief Yan.

307
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,200
I can finally call you Deputy Chief Yan again.

308
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,470
After returning to the Imperial College,

309
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,350
I guess it's harder for you
to come out and drink with me.

310
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,350
It's rare for you to treat,

311
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,520
so I'll naturally come.

312
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:02,550
How did it go?

313
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,670
It's as expected.

314
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,320
Father and son of Wei family
have close ties to Xizhao.

315
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,590
The coroner found

316
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,400
a tattoo on Official Wei's shoulder.

317
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,760
He was a mole that Xizhao planted

318
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,840
in the imperial court for many years.

319
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,670
Although we don't know
if Wei Zhan Hong is still alive,

320
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,670
he was involved in the incident
where Sang Qi was poisoned

321
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,400
at the Imperial College.

322
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,640
He's related to this matter.

323
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,710
They're trying to poison me.

324
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,910
Will they be safe if I die?

325
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:26,880
That's not all.

326
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,880
I think they plotted against
the Wei family first,

327
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,030
so they'll take the blame.

328
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,880
After that, they waited for you
to protect him in the dark

329
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:33,640
before taking action.

330
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,520
That way, they'll get rid of the Wei family

331
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:36,790
and you at the same time.

332
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,280
If I died in the wilderness like Official Wei,

333
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,440
I wouldn't be able to prove my innocence.

334
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,080
I fear I would be set up

335
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,080
as Xizhao's accomplice too.

336
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,230
After such a huge commotion,

337
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,760
the imperial court is investigating
this matter seriously.

338
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,320
As of late,

339
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,440
they won't be taking any action now.

340
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,350
In any case,

341
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,840
we must handle this carefully.

342
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,000
Since there is no more lead on Xizhao,

343
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,400
we should change our direction

344
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:04,150
and focus on the Song family.

345
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,880
They'll definitely give themselves away.

346
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,150
Qi Lang, you've changed.

347
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,470
You would have risked your life
to investigate it in the past.

348
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,400
Don't tell me...

349
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,590
Don't tell me you've gone soft

350
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:16,760
after being bullied by Grand Tutor Song.

351
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:17,800
Listen,

352
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:19,160
I'll look down on you if it's true.

353
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,190
Someone like you

354
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,070
should stay single for the rest of your life.

355
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:26,520
I...

356
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:27,520
Don't implicate the ladies.

357
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:59,560
Mr. Zhuo, since we suffered a setback in Jingzhou,

358
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:02,190
it's your first time coming to my side house.

359
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:08,110
Are you blaming me for being incompetent?

360
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:12,110
It's hard to deal with Yan Yun Zhi.

361
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,640
Don't take it to heart.

362
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,160
It was not a total loss anyway.

363
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,310
At least, we still have a bargaining chip
in our hands.

364
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,110
But...

365
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,400
we must lay low for the time being.

366
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:27,640
Yes.

367
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,640
After Yan Yun Zhi returned to
the Imperial College,

368
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,280
the upcoming imperial examination

369
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,040
has restrained his energy

370
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,230
and mine.

371
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,040
I need to be the top scholar,

372
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,760
(Aspiration)
so I won't let my aunt down.

373
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,470
With your talent,

374
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,830
you'll definitely rank first.

375
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,470
I must inform you one thing in advance.

376
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,640
We didn't make our move on Yan Yun Zhi

377
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,280
or Sang Qi

378
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,350
because we didn't want to cause more trouble.

379
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:08,000
But if they interfere with us again,

380
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,920
be it the son of the Chancellor,

381
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,110
or the daughter of the Grand Commandant,

382
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,430
we'll execute them on the spot.

383
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,280
Even if you put in some good words for them,

384
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,710
it wouldn't work either, I'm afraid.

385
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,280
I've told you

386
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,760
that Sang Qi is my bottom line.

387
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,110
You shall not harm her.

388
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,160
To make sure our cooperation goes smoothly

389
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,040
is also my mission.

390
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,400
If there is such a day,

391
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,400
perhaps

392
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,040
you and I will go against each other.

393
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,470
Are you sure you want to do this?

394
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,400
I won't joke about anything related to Sang Qi.

395
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,040
This wine is tasteless. Farewell.

396
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,230
Look, there are new rules.

397
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,830
It's too harsh.

398
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,800
(Imperial Rules)
How is this possible?

399
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:23,710
It's horrible.

400
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,310
What is it?

401
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,350
Make way. Let me read it.

403
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,110
Read it.

Imperial rules?

405
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,590
Today, Deputy Chief has announced

406
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,470
the new regulation for the extensive study
at Imperial College.

407
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:37,170
(From today onward, study time will be extended
to four hours every day and night.)

408
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,680
From today onward,

409
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,710
study time will be extended
to four hours every day and night.

410
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,520
Each class will have a scholar on rotation.

411
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,280
There will be a daily quiz.

412
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:51,070
To maintain good physical strength
in the examination hall,

413
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,310
the physical class will change
to group exercise.

414
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:58,520
All students should not bring any playthings
that will affect their studies.

415
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,830
Punishment for violators.

416

You did not.

497
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,560
I never get tired of looking.
Why would that be annoying?

498
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,400
This is for you.

499
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,190
The imperial examination is coming up soon.

500
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:15,350
I hope everything goes smoothly for you.

501
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,800
Do I have to thank you?

502
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:23,520
You already said it just now.

503
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:27,920
During this extensive study,

504
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,560
the students' results have
improved significantly.

505
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,830
The answers on the examination paper

506
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:34,880
are almost the same as the standard answers.

507
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,400
Does that mean you're doing a good job?

508
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,280
No,

509
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:41,710
I never treated education as my job.

510
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:44,560
Although the students have improved,

511
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,070
you still don't understand

512
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,190
the true meaning of education.

513
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,110
How so?

514
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,880
The scholars and I taught students
the rules of propriety

515
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,310
and contributed to the people next.

516
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:57,280
It's not simply to gain fame.

517
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:57,710
Yes,

518
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,280
if it's for the sake of fame,

519
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,800
it'll be enough to have good grades.

520
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:04,310
But the imperial court does not need such people.

521
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,560
What should we do then?

522
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,160
Although the students are young,

523
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,830
many are ambitious.

524
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:14,350
Of course, I understand this.

525
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,880
I graduated from the Imperial College too.

526
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:19,680
I entered the examination hall
to contribute to the people.

527
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:21,710
But when I received my designation,

528
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,590
I realized everything had only just begun.

529
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:26,000
The road ahead is long and full of obstacles.

530
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:29,110
I hope all of you

531
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:31,560
will use the knowledge and truth
you studied at the Imperial College

532
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:35,230
to continue to inspire you
and not forget your original aspiration

533
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,800
when you're confused.

534
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,800
Thank you for your advice.

535
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,520
In recent days, students have studied hard

536
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,110
to prepare for the exam.

537
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,000
At that time, it's expected to see them
giving their all at the examination hall.

538
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,070
The Imperial Examination Hall
has also been arranged

539
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,110
and strengthened the invigilator system

540
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,430
to ensure the fairness of the examination.

541
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:05,000
I'm still puzzled by what
Deputy Chief Yan has said.

542
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:09,160
It has always been male candidates who take part
in the Imperial College's examination.

543
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,710
Now, we have Sang Qi.

544
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:14,280
Sang Qi cannot enter the examination hall.

545
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:16,830
It's all in vain, no matter how hard
a woman works.

546
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:17,950
Don't tell me

547
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:18,590
(Memorandum)

548
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:23,190
that a woman also wants
to seek an official position.

549
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,760
My daughter, Sang Qi...

550
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,520
If a woman can assume an official post,

551
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,560
it's naturally a good thing.

552
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,470
It proves that her ability

553
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,520
is not inferior to or it's even
superior to that of men.

554
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,430
I think if Sang Qi participates
in the examination,

555
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,560
it'll be an inspiration to women
all over the world.

556
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:44,400
Everyone can thrive by learning.

557
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,800
I concur.

558
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:49,400
Sang Qi studied hard for days.

559
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,710
She doesn't seek any title

560
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,920
but only asks to enter the examination hall.

561
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:57,190
This is also to fulfill my late son's last wish.

562
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,830
There's no need to discuss this matter.

563
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,710
Just carry it out, as Director Chief Yan has said.

564
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:06,710
Sang Qi is permitted to join the examination.

565
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,110
Thank you, Your Majesty.

566
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

567
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:22,920
Sang Yu,

568
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,640
I'm going to the examination hall
for the exam tomorrow.

569
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,400
Your unfulfilled wish,

570
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,800
I'm going to fulfill it for you.

571
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,680
Watch over me, so everything goes well.

572
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:44,110
(Grand Aspiration)

573
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:44,880
Qi!

574
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,760
(The gold day of dawn)

575
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:48,920
Lian Pian, where's Qi?

576
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,280
Young Lady is in Young Master's room

577
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,520
talking to him.

578
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:52,950
In that case,

579
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,350
I won't bother her.

580
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:56,230
I've custom-made some writing materials for her.

581
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:56,880
Help me give these to her.

582
00:28:59,040 --> 00:28:59,920
Tell her

583
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,400
that I'll wait for her at the entrance
of the Imperial Examination Hall.

584
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,280
So she won't enter the examination hall alone.

585
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:04,470
Thanks.

586
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:36,470
Young Lady, Mr. Zhuo delivered these last night.

587
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:39,430
I think I should tell you.

588
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,190
Keep it. I already have the writing materials.

589
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,000
I'm not going to change them anymore.

590
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,780
(Imperial Examination Hall)

591
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,190
Qi,

592
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,040
if you want to stop,

593
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,400
just throw the brush

594
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,470
and walk out openly. Don't force yourself.

595
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,760
Father, what are you talking about?

596
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:22,000
Young Lady, I made you some snacks.

597
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,640
Give it to me.

598
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,190
You must not go hungry.

599
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,800
You won't have energy if you're hungry.

600
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,560
The doors are opened.

601
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,400
- Let's go.
- Come on.

602
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,000
Good luck.

603
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,710
I'm going in now.

604
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:31,590
(Imperial Examination Hall)
Do well in your examination.

605
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,230
I wish you success in your examination.

606
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:33,950
Thank you very much.

607
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,800
It's time.

608
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,400
Let's go in together.

609
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,590
Don't push yourself too hard.

610
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,040
Let's go.

611
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:48,950
Master Sang!

612
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,470
Yan Yan.

613
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,760
I didn't sleep all night

614
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,070
to prepare these for you.

615
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:57,950
Look at them.

616
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,110
I don't hope for anything else.

617
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,640
With your kind thoughts,

618
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,310
I'll succeed on my first try

619
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:05,560
and repay you.

620
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,070
I don't buy that nonsense.

621
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,710
I just hope you and Young Lady

622
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,520
to be safe and everything to go smoothly for you.

623
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,710
As for fame or position,

624
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:12,920
I never seek a luxurious life.

625
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:15,110
Go in quickly.

626
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,590
Let's go.

627
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,350

628
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,040
I'm going in now.

629
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:20,800
Good luck.

630
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:27,430
What's wrong?

631
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:31,400
Before we go in, should we say something

632
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,950
like "don't forget me when you're rich"?

633
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,160
Remember to be calm.

634
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,160

- They're coming out.

661
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,560
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

662
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:07,710
Young Master.

663
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:09,520
Let me carry these for you.

664
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,590
Be patient.

665
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:12,310
Zhuo Wen Yuan.

666
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:14,110
Although you're in Class Yellow,

667
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:15,760
I'm most optimistic about you

668
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,360
among the students in this batch.

669
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,230
I have high hopes for you.

670
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,150
How do you feel?

671
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:22,190
I did my best as always.

672
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,560
You're calm. Your future is expected.

673
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,320
Director Chief is right.

674
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,080
Seeing how confident you are,

675
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,560
I feel relieved.

676
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,520
- Deputy Chief.
- Deputy Chief.

677
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,760
- Scholar Feng.
- Scholar Huo.

678
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:36,430
- Well done.
- How did it go?

679
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,320
I did my best, like always.

680
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,080
Me too.

681
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,760
As long as you're efforts were not in vain.

682
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,560
- Here they come.
- They're coming.

683
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,230
Let's go.

684
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,320
Yan Yan!

685
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:49,760
Yan Yan, how did you do?

686
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,000
I think I did pretty well.

687
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:52,950
I wrote everything the teacher taught me

688
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,950
into the test paper.

689
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,280
That's great.

690
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,430
I didn't wane at all.

691
00:34:58,710 --> 00:34:59,430
How did you do?

692
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,230
I did my best as usual.

693
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:02,360
That's great.

694
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:04,560
You did your best like always?

695
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:04,870
What...

696
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,560
Isn't that hopeless?

697
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:06,800
You...

698
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,320
Yan Yan.

699
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:08,600
Stop talking nonsense.

700
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,470
It's difficult to do one's best
in the examination.

701
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:13,560
I wasn't speaking nonsense.

702
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:15,040
I don't know about the rest.

703
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,710
If we look at it seriously,

704
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,040
you won't pass even if you did better

705
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,470
than you always did.

706
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:22,600
Enough already.

707
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,950
Both of you started bickering
since you entered the Imperial College.

708
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:27,230
You're about to graduate,
but you two are still at it.

709
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,430
When you're all on your official career,

710
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,760
you'll know

711
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:34,910
how precious friendship is

712
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:37,470
between classmates at this moment. Understand?

713
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:41,280
Why is Young Lady not out yet?

714
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,950
I think she'll be out soon.

715
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:51,390
Qi!

716
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:53,710
Deputy Chief.

717
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:54,520
Qi.

718
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,520
Why did you keep your head down all the way?

719
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,710
Didn't you do your best?
