you’d propose to me again tonight.

Not yet. There’re many people at the fair.

He’s better now.

Who told you he’s here though?

88
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,960
Well, I…I took Meaw to the Loy Kratong festival at Pho Chai.

89
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,800
But when we got there, the commotion was everywhere.

90
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,740
Then someone told me Jom was hurt. So, I called Mum and told her too.

91
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,180
You should’ve talked to me first.

92
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,620
Look what happens now.

93
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,130
How’s Jom? Is he okay?

94
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,220
The doctor said he’s safe now.

95
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,020
But he might have to stay here tonight.

96
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,740
Just to make sure there isn’t any concussion.

97
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,540
[Sigh] My dear Jom.

98
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,760
It’s all because of you, Mum.

99
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,700
Haven’t I told you so many times…

100
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,960
that I don’t want him to be a village chief?

101
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,400
Instead of telling him to change his mind and come back home to stay with me,

102
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,940
you even encouraged him to be a village chief.

103
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,860
And look what happens now? Someone wants to hurt him.

104
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,180
What if he’s dead or becomes a cripple, who’d be responsible for that?

105
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,260
Mum, please calm down.

106
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:54,340
What if I tell you that the one who should be responsible for this…

107
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,340
is Paisarn?

108
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,060
Will you believe me?

109
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,180
What do you mean, Miss Nart?

110
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,860
What does Paisarn have to do with this?

111
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:10,100
You do know that Paisarn…

112
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,940
wants to win the auction for a road construction project around Pho Chai dam.

113
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,100
But Chief Jom is the only person…

114
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,900
who tries to prevent Paisarn from getting this project.

115
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,600
Do you have any proof that he’s involved?

116
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,260
Don’t worry, the police will definitely find some evidence.

117
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:33,940
What I want to know is…if Paisarn is really behind this,

118
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,620
what will you do?

119
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,740
Then I’d be thankful to him.

120
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,380
for making Jom realized that being a village chief…

121
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,540
is really good for nothing.

122
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,540
I’ll go talk to him now.

123
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,940
I’m sorry but Jom is not fully recovered right now.

124
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,530
And you’re also very upset.

125
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,160
Why don’t you come visit him again tomorrow?

126
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:03,140
It’s none of your business. I’m going to talk to my son.

127
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,260
I know I can’t stop you…

128
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,130
since I’m just someone who’s living under his roof.

129
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,000
But I’m saying this as someone whose life Jom has saved many times.

130
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,400

132
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:31,600
Mother, please don’t mind him.

133
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:37,300
I know. He’s like this because he’s worried sick about his son.

134
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,020
But that’s all right.

135
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,900
when Jom gains consciousness and feels better,

136
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:47,220
I’ll try talking him into quitting being a village chief.

137
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,700
I’ll give it a try.

138
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,180
Please go back home first.

139
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,220

Don’t say anything.

147

149

00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:33,730
That's all right

151
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:35,530
Hmm.

152
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,900
Mr. Jomkwan’s relative, please come with me.

153
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:42,730
Yes.

154
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,460
Heng is right though.

155
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,560
If Jom hadn’t become a village chief,

156
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,780
he wouldn’t have got hit like this.

157
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:07,820
That’s not true. Jom has decided on his own to become a village chief.

158
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,060
You had nothing to do with it.

159
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,700
Is everything all right, Yo?

160
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,930
Yes, Jom is sleeping.

161
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,900
I must apologise to you too, Granny.

162
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:47,940
Chief Jom is like this partly because of me.

163
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,900
Huh? Why, Mummy?

164
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,460
What do you have to do with this?

165
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:59,060
As far as I’m concerned, Chief Jom has never had any enemy before.

166
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:03,020
But since the auction for the road construction project has been going on,

167
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,380
many troubles stirred up.

168
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:11,660
That’s why I think Paisarn must be behind this. He must’ve hired someone to hurt Jom…

169
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,660
…to threaten me to withdraw from this auction.

170
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,700
Oh, he’s so mean.

171
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,400
Yes.

172
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,700
Then, should we tell Uncle Kla to go arrest Paisarn?

173
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,060
That’s good.

174
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:27,540
Headman Kla will never let him get away.

175
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,000
Are we going to leave Jom here alone though?

176
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,130
I’ll stay here with him, Granny.

177
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,620

00:22:38,445 --> 00:22:44,565
Nothing at all. Just tell me which farm and I’ll send my team to demonstrate it.

356
00:22:44,565 --> 00:22:47,765
For those who agree to register with us, we’ll keep a record of their data.

357
00:22:47,765 --> 00:22:51,645
Once the agricultural products are ready, I can also help distribute them.

358
00:22:51,925 --> 00:22:54,325
You only have to say it. I’m always willing to help.

359
00:22:54,325 --> 00:22:55,965
And for those things I’ve just told you,

360
00:22:56,305 --> 00:22:59,745
the farmers or your villagers won’t even have to pay a penny for it.

361
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:03,445
Wouldn’t it be a loss for you then?

362
00:23:03,675 --> 00:23:08,045
Not at all, Granny. My team and I sincerely want to help the farmers here.

363
00:23:08,505 --> 00:23:10,275
That’s very kind of you.

364
00:23:12,445 --> 00:23:15,885
If you have no problem with it, I’ll go survey the area first.

365
00:23:15,885 --> 00:23:18,445
After that, you can start telling your villagers, okay?

366
00:23:18,945 --> 00:23:19,745
That’s great.

367
00:23:36,045 --> 00:23:38,485
Let’s get in the car, sweetie.

368
00:23:45,045 --> 00:23:48,145
Sweeite, please wait here. Daddy has to say bye to Uncle Jom first.

369
00:23:52,405 --> 00:23:55,725
You don’t have to come out here. You’re still not recovered yet.

370
00:23:56,745 --> 00:23:57,545
It’s okay.

371
00:23:58,605 --> 00:24:00,605
Am I making you feel uncomfortable?

372
00:24:01,405 --> 00:24:04,245
Of course not. Why would I feel uncomfortable?

373
00:24:04,525 --> 00:24:07,885
You’re here to help the villagers. I should feel glad and grateful.

374
00:24:08,275 --> 00:24:10,245
Well then, see you tomorrow, Jom.

375
00:24:10,645 --> 00:24:11,445
Yes.

376
00:24:22,505 --> 00:24:23,645
Where’s Yo?

377
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:41,205
What’s wrong with you?

378
00:24:41,705 --> 00:24:44,405
Do you really believe Tee is here just for work?

379
00:24:47,745 --> 00:24:51,205
Have you ever heard a teaching by the monk…

380
00:24:51,645 --> 00:24:57,165
that if you’re too stressed, your mind would imagine things and you’ll only be in suffering.

381
00:24:58,745 --> 00:25:00,805
Don’t suddenly play an abbot.

382
00:25:00,805 --> 00:25:02,685
Honestly, do you believe him?

383
00:25:02,685 --> 00:25:04,685
I definitely don’t.

384
00:25:05,245 --> 00:25:07,645
He has just divorced his wife and now he’s here to see you.

385
00:25:07,945 --> 00:25:08,745
Why would he do that?

386
00:25:10,005 --> 00:25:14,085
Honestly, I’m not sure either.

387
00:25:14,275 --> 00:25:16,145
Tee is the company owner.

388
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:18,485
He actually doesn’t have to come all the way here himself.

389
00:25:19,245 --> 00:25:21,005
Why do you think he’s here then?

390
00:25:22,875 --> 00:25:25,325
I don’t know too.

391
00:25:25,605 --> 00:25:28,725
But let’s just believe him for now.

392
00:25:28,805 --> 00:25:30,165
Don’t overthink too much.

393
00:25:31,205 --> 00:25:35,125
Fine. But if he’s here because of you and not for work,

394
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:37,205
I hope you know what to do.

395
00:25:37,205 --> 00:25:39,245
I don’t want to see you hurt again.

396
00:25:39,605 --> 00:25:41,325
I know.

397
00:25:54,685 --> 00:25:56,405
[Sigh]

398
00:26:00,045 --> 00:26:05,165
[Phone ringing]

399
00:26:15,805 --> 00:26:16,605
Hi, Dad.

400
00:26:16,805 --> 00:26:19,005
Hey, how is it, son?

401
00:26:19,275 --> 00:26:21,445
Huh? How is what, Dad?

402
00:26:22,445 --> 00:26:24,845
I just talked to Grandma Chan.

403
00:26:24,845 --> 00:26:27,365
She told me Chief Jom got ambushed, right?

404
00:26:27,845 --> 00:26:28,645
That’s right.

405
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,525
But he’s fine now.

406
00:26:30,805 --> 00:26:32,705
The police are tracking down the culprit.

407
00:26:33,075 --> 00:26:36,885
That’s good. Your mum and I have something to talk to you.

408
00:26:36,885 --> 00:26:38,805
We want you to come back home.

409
00:26:40,605 --> 00:26:41,405
Why?

410
00:26:41,875 --> 00:26:45,525
I sent you to stay there because of Sack.

411
00:26:45,525 --> 00:26:48,965
But now everything is settled, why would you still want to be there?

412
00:26:48,965 --> 00:26:52,645
Come back home so that you can prepare for your study in the US.

413
00:26:52,675 --> 00:26:54,285
Come home, dear.

414
00:26:54,285 --> 00:26:56,845
Even Chief Jom got ambushed.

415
00:26:56,945 --> 00:26:59,205
If you keep staying with him like this,

416
00:26:59,245 --> 00:27:00,645
you might get caught up and get hurt too.

417
00:27:01,275 --> 00:27:02,505
I want to stay here.

418
00:27:04,645 --> 00:27:06,345
Huh? What’s wrong with this kid?

419
00:27:06,675 --> 00:27:08,405
Months ago, you kept saying you wanted to come home.

420
00:27:08,675 --> 00:27:10,945
Now that we want you to come home, you just want to stay there.

421
00:27:13,045 --> 00:27:13,965
Well…

422
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:18,565
Is it because you’re having a crush on someone in Pho Chai?

423
00:27:18,565 --> 00:27:20,005
Aren’t you?

424
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:24,045
Hmm? How did you know?

425
00:27:24,045 --> 00:27:27,205
Why wouldn’t I? I’m your father.

426
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:30,485
There are only a few reasons to keep a rascal like you there.

427
00:27:30,485 --> 00:27:31,125
Am I right?

428
00:27:31,125 --> 00:27:32,245
Well, yes.

429
00:27:33,675 --> 00:27:35,805
I have someone that I like here.

430
00:27:35,875 --> 00:27:36,675
Ha!

431
00:27:37,005 --> 00:27:37,845
Who’s it, dear?

432
00:27:37,845 --> 00:27:39,165
A friend at school?

433
00:27:40,045 --> 00:27:40,845
No, Mum.

434
00:27:41,245 --> 00:27:44,445
Then who’s it?

435
00:27:45,405 --> 00:27:48,445
Can I tell you later? Please give me some time.

436
00:27:48,725 --> 00:27:51,245
And I’ll introduce this person to you when we’re home.

437
00:27:51,405 --> 00:27:54,525
It’s serious this time, huh?

438
00:27:54,805 --> 00:27:57,765
You’ve never invited anyone home before.

439
00:27:57,805 --> 00:27:59,805
Why can’t you introduce this person to us now?

440
00:28:02,075 --> 00:28:04,205
I’m afraid you might not like this person.

441
00:28:04,505 --> 00:28:07,685
Aww, don’t worry about that.

442
00:28:08,245 --> 00:28:11,285
As long as this person is good enough,

443
00:28:11,285 --> 00:28:14,325
if you like them, your dad and I would also like them.

444
00:28:16,405 --> 00:28:17,205
Thank you.

445
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:28,675
Whom are you calling now?

446
00:28:29,005 --> 00:28:33,005
I’m calling Chief Jom. I’ve left our son under his care.

447
00:28:33,005 --> 00:28:35,765
He should know who this person Yo is so head over heel with is.

448
00:28:35,805 --> 00:28:40,405
Honey, wouldn’t that make it look like we’re not trusting our son?

449
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:44,285
But what if he’s having a crush on a mafia’s daughter?

450
00:28:44,285 --> 00:28:46,725
What would we do then?

451
00:28:46,905 --> 00:28:51,925
Didn’t you say so that our son seems a lot more mature now?

452
00:28:51,925 --> 00:28:56,005
He’s been through a lot lately. I honestly believe…

453
00:28:56,005 --> 00:28:59,805
such experience would make him more discreet and thoughtful.

454
00:29:00,875 --> 00:29:02,685
Please give him one more chance.

455
00:29:03,275 --> 00:29:04,075
Please.

456
00:29:04,745 --> 00:29:05,545
Mhm.

457
00:29:09,705 --> 00:29:15,645
That’s right. Jom is my boyfriend. I can’t keep sitting here pouting about it.

458
00:29:34,275 --> 00:29:37,205
I couldn’t find you in your room.

459
00:29:37,205 --> 00:29:38,805
So I thought you might be here.

460
00:29:41,005 --> 00:29:42,345
Can I kiss you?

461
00:29:49,445 --> 00:29:50,745
What are you saying, Yo?

462
00:29:51,805 --> 00:29:53,205
I want it to be our first kiss…

463
00:29:53,475 --> 00:29:55,285
after we’ve agreed to be together.

464
00:29:58,305 --> 00:30:00,085
There isn’t anyone around.

465
00:30:42,275 --> 00:30:43,245
Stop it, Yo.

466
00:30:58,205 --> 00:30:59,005
Why?

467
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:01,075
Don’t you want to do it?

468
00:31:02,505 --> 00:31:03,875
It’s not about wanting it or not.

469
00:31:04,205 --> 00:31:05,645
I think we should make it proper first.

470
00:31:06,145 --> 00:31:08,105
I heard you talking to your parents earlier.

471
00:31:09,645 --> 00:31:11,905
I think we should tell them about us first.

472
00:31:13,005 --> 00:31:15,125
Are you afraid my parents wouldn’t agree with us?

473
00:31:15,305 --> 00:31:16,905
You already heard them, didn’t you?

474
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:19,245
They said if I love anyone,

475
00:31:19,875 --> 00:31:20,945
they’d love them too.

476
00:31:21,845 --> 00:31:23,205
It’s not like that, Yo.

477
00:31:24,505 --> 00:31:27,645
If we want to be together, we should make it more proper.

478
00:31:28,645 --> 00:31:30,705
We have to tell our parents about us.

479
00:31:31,845 --> 00:31:32,905
We have to ask for their approval first.

480
00:31:33,875 --> 00:31:36,045
Are you sure it’s not because of that guy?

481
00:31:36,275 --> 00:31:37,475
What do you mean?

482
00:31:53,045 --> 00:31:54,525
[Sigh]

483
00:31:55,505 --> 00:31:56,275
Yo…

484
00:31:56,275 --> 00:31:57,075
Yo!

485
00:31:58,845 --> 00:32:00,525
Yo. Yo!

486
00:32:02,165 --> 00:32:05,125
[Phone ringing]

487
00:32:06,145 --> 00:32:07,205
Yes, Uncle Kla?

488
00:32:07,605 --> 00:32:08,965
Jom.

489
00:32:09,285 --> 00:32:12,165
I’m calling to tell you that the police have issued an arrest warrant on Yod.

490
00:32:12,605 --> 00:32:13,645
Why is it so fast?

491
00:32:14,045 --> 00:32:17,245
It’s not for the incident at the fair.

492
00:32:17,245 --> 00:32:22,725
For that, Inspector Wichai must thoroughly investigate the crime scene one more time first.

493
00:32:22,725 --> 00:32:27,485
This arrest warrant is for the burning down of Joi’s farm.

494
00:32:27,605 --> 00:32:28,945
Where’s Uncle Yod now?

495
00:32:29,275 --> 00:32:32,405
We still can’t find him. He’s not at home too.

496
00:32:32,705 --> 00:32:35,945
I’m now helping Inspector Wichai at a checkpoint.

497
00:32:38,405 --> 00:32:40,045
Are you sure about what Todd told you,

498
00:32:40,645 --> 00:32:43,845
that the police have been looking for you since early morning?

499
00:32:43,845 --> 00:32:46,275
Of course. Why on earth would I lie to you?

500
00:32:47,075 --> 00:32:51,305
But I’m afraid the police would find out soon that we were the one who ambushed Jom.

501
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:55,445
If they are going to flee from this village,

502
00:32:55,965 --> 00:32:58,845
they’d definitely use this route.

503
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:01,805
The target is here. Get ready.

504
00:33:02,005 --> 00:33:02,805
Okay.

505
00:33:04,005 --> 00:33:04,675
Found him.

506
00:33:04,675 --> 00:33:05,475
Hmm..

507
00:33:05,805 --> 00:33:07,875
I have to go. They’ve found Yod.

508
00:33:08,005 --> 00:33:09,245
Yes, please be careful.

509
00:33:15,945 --> 00:33:18,845
Hey, is that a road fixing or a police checkpoint?

510
00:33:19,145 --> 00:33:21,045
Fuck! It’s a checkpoint.

511
00:33:22,005 --> 00:33:24,875
Make a U-turn now. Turn right here.

512
00:33:25,345 --> 00:33:26,205
Stay still.

513
00:33:26,645 --> 00:33:27,505
Huh? Still?

514
00:33:29,405 --> 00:33:32,275
Hey, hey, hey! Why are you getting a gun?

515
00:33:32,505 --> 00:33:33,605
To shoot your father, maybe?

516
00:33:33,605 --> 00:33:35,075
Then, put it back.

517
00:33:35,645 --> 00:33:36,805
Why are you fidgeting?

518
00:33:37,845 --> 00:33:38,905
Stay calm.

519
00:33:39,305 --> 00:33:40,105
Okay.

520
00:33:40,305 --> 00:33:41,405
Let me handle this.

521
00:33:42,075 --> 00:33:42,905
Your show, Boss.

522
00:33:53,845 --> 00:33:54,645
Hello, sir.

523
00:33:55,605 --> 00:33:56,875
Where do you think you’re going?

524
00:33:57,445 --> 00:33:59,275
Other people are cleaning up after the fair,

525
00:33:59,505 --> 00:34:01,965
don’t you want to help them a bit?

526
00:34:02,275 --> 00:34:09,325
I was about to do that. But then this brat’s mother ate something weird and couldn’t stop shitting since this morning.

527
00:34:09,345 --> 00:34:11,245
I’m taking him to see his mother or else she might die first.

528
00:34:11,505 --> 00:34:11,965
Really?

529
00:34:11,965 --> 00:34:12,485
Yeah.

530
00:34:13,725 --> 00:34:17,485
Anyway, why setting up a checkpoint here?

531
00:34:17,645 --> 00:34:21,965
Well, the inspector just wants to be sure everything is safe and sound.

532
00:34:22,165 --> 00:34:25,365
Since you’re here, can you cooperate and let the police get their work done?

533
00:34:25,365 --> 00:34:28,845
Park your car on the left side there.

534
00:34:28,845 --> 00:34:31,045
Let’s get it done so that you can go do your things.

535
00:34:31,275 --> 00:34:36,085
My name is Mr. No Problem. I’ll even let them test my urine.

536
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:38,005
You got it.

537
00:34:38,275 --> 00:34:39,445
That’s good.

538
00:34:39,805 --> 00:34:41,005
Come here.

539
00:34:41,105 --> 00:34:42,085
Go after him!

540
00:34:42,085 --> 00:34:42,925
Quick!

541
00:34:45,285 --> 00:34:46,645
Go get him!

542
00:34:57,245 --> 00:34:59,245
[Sigh]

543
00:35:23,805 --> 00:35:27,245
Okay. I’ll talk to you later then.

544
00:35:28,605 --> 00:35:31,505
If you’re not done yet, I can leave first.

545
00:35:32,105 --> 00:35:35,205
I’m done. Uncle Kla just wanted to tell me about the culprit.

546
00:35:35,845 --> 00:35:37,105
You were talking to Uncle Kla?

547
00:35:37,445 --> 00:35:38,925
Who do you think I was talking to?

548
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,045
Is there anything?

549
00:35:43,505 --> 00:35:46,085
Nothing. You should get some rest.

550
00:35:46,205 --> 00:35:47,275
I’ll get some rest too.

551
00:35:59,145 --> 00:36:01,845
That guy, Tee – what is he to you?

552
00:36:09,475 --> 00:36:12,285
It’s okay if you don’t want to tell me.

553
00:36:12,805 --> 00:36:14,145
Tee is my ex.

554
00:36:20,545 --> 00:36:22,075
You don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to.

555
00:36:23,475 --> 00:36:28,205
It’s fine. But are you sure you want to hear it?

556
00:36:37,305 --> 00:36:39,245
I want to be in every moment of your life.

557
00:36:41,305 --> 00:36:42,805
Even if it’s something I don’t want to hear,

558
00:36:43,405 --> 00:36:47,085
I promise I’ll try my best to be a good listener.

559
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:51,045
How about we go talk somewhere else?

560
00:36:51,565 --> 00:36:54,765
Think of it as our first date.

561
00:36:58,105 --> 00:37:01,675
[Next Break]
I met Tee during my university years.

562
00:37:01,805 --> 00:37:02,875
When did you start to have feelings for each other?

563
00:37:03,275 --> 00:37:06,075
When he came to tutor me in my room.

564
00:37:09,085 --> 00:37:12,765
[My Sweetheart Jom]

565
00:37:32,618 --> 00:37:36,978
[My Sweetheart Jom]

566
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:42,218
Watch “My Sweetheart Jom” for free on YouTube.

567
00:37:43,018 --> 00:37:44,618
It’s quite good to be out here like this.

568
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:46,018
What a nice weather.

569
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:48,538
Why do you keep beating around the bush?

570
00:37:48,978 --> 00:37:52,138
Is it because you don’t want to tell me about you and Tee?

571
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:55,298
Do you really think that?

572
00:37:56,738 --> 00:37:57,898
Am I right then?

573
00:37:59,498 --> 00:38:00,298
No.

574
00:38:02,378 --> 00:38:03,658
It’s not that I don’t want to.

575
00:38:05,018 --> 00:38:06,498
I really want to tell you.

576
00:38:07,578 --> 00:38:09,378
But I also want to stargazing with you.

577
00:38:10,978 --> 00:38:12,698
I want it to be our first date.

578
00:38:16,298 --> 00:38:17,098
A date?

579
00:38:30,938 --> 00:38:31,738
I’m sorry.

580
00:38:32,818 --> 00:38:34,418
I was being too jealous.

581
00:38:35,738 --> 00:38:37,978
I thought you didn’t want to tell me about him.

582
00:38:38,538 --> 00:38:42,218
I met Tee during my university years.

583
00:38:43,418 --> 00:38:45,178
I was bullied by the sophomores.

584
00:38:45,858 --> 00:38:47,618
It was him who came to my rescue.

585
00:38:49,498 --> 00:38:52,058
That was when we started to grow a senior-junior bond.

586
00:38:52,858 --> 00:38:54,498
But it was just that, nothing more.

587
00:38:57,658 --> 00:38:59,218
When did you start to have feelings for each other?

588
00:39:01,778 --> 00:39:04,658
When Tee came to tutor for my exam in my room.

589
00:39:13,178 --> 00:39:14,258
Your room?

590
00:39:17,698 --> 00:39:20,578
But then, I…

591
00:39:27,938 --> 00:39:29,538
Then…

592
00:39:30,138 --> 00:39:31,418
Then?

593
00:39:31,458 --> 00:39:33,098
Then…

594
00:39:33,378 --> 00:39:34,298
things got quite out of hands.

595
00:39:34,458 --> 00:39:35,338
Are you sure you still want to hear it?

596
00:39:35,578 --> 00:39:36,938
Geez.

597
00:39:37,418 --> 00:39:38,858
Stop teasing me.

598
00:39:39,338 --> 00:39:40,578
What did he do?

599
00:39:41,618 --> 00:39:42,458
He kissed me.

600
00:39:45,858 --> 00:39:46,938
What did you do then?

601
00:39:49,098 --> 00:39:51,738
I just ran out of my room.

602
00:39:52,538 --> 00:39:53,218
Huh?

603
00:39:54,738 --> 00:39:56,898
I thought it would be like those romantic scenes in a movie.

604
00:39:57,338 --> 00:39:59,498
I thought you two would finally get intimated.

605
00:40:00,338 --> 00:40:01,418
I was so shocked back then.

606
00:40:01,898 --> 00:40:03,018
I didn’t know what to do.

607
00:40:03,098 --> 00:40:04,218
So, I just ran away.

608
00:40:04,858 --> 00:40:06,538
But after I had some time to ponder…

609
00:40:07,018 --> 00:40:08,338
about how I felt about him,

610
00:40:09,578 --> 00:40:11,498
I finally realized that I had feelings for him.

611
00:40:12,058 --> 00:40:13,058
So, we decided to be a couple.

612
00:40:13,858 --> 00:40:14,938
Just like that?

613
00:40:17,098 --> 00:40:18,018
Yeah, just like that.

614
00:40:18,618 --> 00:40:19,938
Why should it be hard?

615
00:40:30,978 --> 00:40:31,778
Hey.

616
00:40:32,738 --> 00:40:33,778
Are you mad at me?

617
00:40:37,298 --> 00:40:38,898
No, I’m not.

618
00:41:13,018 --> 00:41:15,418
Don’t you want to know how it ended?

619
00:41:18,338 --> 00:41:19,578
Not really.

620
00:41:20,098 --> 00:41:21,498
But if you want to tell me, then just say it.

621
00:41:22,458 --> 00:41:23,338
Back then,

622
00:41:24,938 --> 00:41:26,538
I had to go to study in Japan.

623
00:41:26,738 --> 00:41:27,858
It was a student exchange program.

624
00:41:28,378 --> 00:41:29,218
I had to be there for a year.

625
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:30,898
When I came back,

626
00:41:31,378 --> 00:41:35,178
Tee was already married to another woman.

627
00:41:36,338 --> 00:41:37,498
Married to another woman?

628
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:42,858
She was pregnant with his child.

629
00:41:44,178 --> 00:41:44,978
Pregnant!

630
00:41:46,258 --> 00:41:47,778
But how?

631
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:51,138
Actually, it wasn’t his fault.

632
00:41:51,418 --> 00:41:53,378
If someone was to be blame, it should be me.

633
00:41:55,178 --> 00:41:57,258
It might be because of a long distance.

634
00:41:57,258 --> 00:41:58,338
It made Tee lonely.

635
00:41:59,378 --> 00:42:00,458
He got so drunk…

636
00:42:00,698 --> 00:42:02,338
and accidentally slept with that woman.

637
00:42:03,258 --> 00:42:05,178
What an incredibly selfish excuse.

638
00:42:05,578 --> 00:42:07,098
It was definitely his fault.

639
00:42:07,978 --> 00:42:10,018
Took the credit and passed the blame to others.

640
00:42:11,738 --> 00:42:12,698
It’s all right, Jom.

641
00:42:13,378 --> 00:42:14,698
You didn’t do anything wrong.

642
00:42:14,978 --> 00:42:16,018
Don’t blame yourself.

643
00:42:21,098 --> 00:42:26,098
Wait. When you told me you were scared because I’d go to the US soon,

644
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:27,898
was it because of this?

645
00:42:31,218 --> 00:42:35,378
Jom, do you still remember when I told you…

646
00:42:36,578 --> 00:42:38,418
that my feelings for you…

647
00:42:39,378 --> 00:42:41,258
are something I’ve never felt with anyone before?

648
00:42:42,818 --> 00:42:44,738
I’m a loyal lover.

649
00:42:46,258 --> 00:42:47,818
And I’ll never look at anyone else but you.

650
00:42:56,378 --> 00:42:57,178
What’s wrong?

651
00:42:58,778 --> 00:42:59,938
Don’t you believe me?

652
00:43:00,338 --> 00:43:01,458
I can swear it if you want.

653
00:43:01,618 --> 00:43:02,698
Don’t, Yo.

654
00:43:03,778 --> 00:43:04,738
You don’t have to swear.

655
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:08,018
It’s not that I don’t believe you.

656
00:43:10,138 --> 00:43:11,618
But it’s the future we’re talking about.

657
00:43:12,698 --> 00:43:14,338
We don’t know what will really happen.

658
00:43:15,698 --> 00:43:19,138
I think we should rather…

659
00:43:19,978 --> 00:43:21,338
do the best for today and this moment.

660
00:43:22,178 --> 00:43:23,418
Let’s take it slow.

661
00:43:24,218 --> 00:43:25,258
You don’t need to swear on anything.

662
00:43:30,778 --> 00:43:31,778
Where are you going?

663
00:43:33,058 --> 00:43:34,138
I’m going home.

664
00:43:35,098 --> 00:43:37,418
I have to study for exams tomorrow.

665
00:43:37,658 --> 00:43:39,898
Who would be responsible if I fail?

666
00:43:48,138 --> 00:43:49,698
What’s wrong with this puppy?

667
00:43:55,458 --> 00:43:56,578
Hello, sir.

668
00:43:57,258 --> 00:43:59,018
I hope you still remember…

669
00:43:59,018 --> 00:44:03,018
that we have an appointment to discuss about the auction today.

670
00:44:03,018 --> 00:44:03,938
[Call disconnected]

671
00:44:03,938 --> 00:44:04,538
Sir?

672
00:44:05,898 --> 00:44:07,018
What the hell?

673
00:44:14,858 --> 00:44:15,658
Hello?

674
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:17,658
Haven’t I told you not to call?

675
00:44:17,898 --> 00:44:19,538
Awwww.

676
00:44:19,778 --> 00:44:22,458
But you’re so cute. I miss you, Boss.

677
00:44:22,458 --> 00:44:24,218
[Laughing]

678
00:44:25,058 --> 00:44:26,418
Listen, Boss.

679
00:44:26,618 --> 00:44:30,098
I need that money we used to talk about.

680
00:44:30,778 --> 00:44:31,618
Also,

681
00:44:32,338 --> 00:44:35,458
I need you to help clear the case for me.

682
00:44:37,178 --> 00:44:39,138
What are you talking about?

683
00:44:39,338 --> 00:44:43,098
What do you mean, Boss?

684
00:44:43,698 --> 00:44:47,138
Those rubbish you were babbling about.

685
00:44:47,938 --> 00:44:51,218
Why should I give you money?

686
00:44:51,418 --> 00:44:54,298
And why do I have to clean up after you?

687
00:44:55,578 --> 00:44:57,138
Listen, Boss.

688
00:44:58,218 --> 00:45:01,098
If you don’t help me or give me money,

689
00:45:01,738 --> 00:45:03,378
I’m going to talk to the police.

690
00:45:03,378 --> 00:45:04,978
Do you know what that means?

691
00:45:05,218 --> 00:45:07,298
I’m going to tell them everything.

692
00:45:08,138 --> 00:45:11,498
I’ll tell them who ordered me to burn those farms,

693
00:45:11,778 --> 00:45:15,738
take away the villagers’ property,

694
00:45:15,738 --> 00:45:17,778
or even hit that village chief on the head.

695
00:45:18,018 --> 00:45:20,258
The real culprit is you, Boss.

696
00:45:20,258 --> 00:45:21,418
Got it?

697
00:45:21,898 --> 00:45:23,898
[Laughing]

698
00:45:24,498 --> 00:45:25,778
Go ahead then.

699
00:45:26,538 --> 00:45:28,098
Do you have proof?

700
00:45:29,018 --> 00:45:30,498
And even if you do,

701
00:45:30,938 --> 00:45:33,458
do you really think the police can do anything to me?

702
00:45:33,698 --> 00:45:35,258
You’re a fucking bastard.

703
00:45:35,738 --> 00:45:37,498
You used me, right?

704
00:45:40,658 --> 00:45:43,258
Don’t make it sound so disgusting like that.

705
00:45:44,098 --> 00:45:49,218
The more you say it, the more it shows that you’re…stupid.

706
00:45:50,098 --> 00:45:53,058
I hope this is the last time we talk.

707
00:45:54,458 --> 00:45:55,378
Never call me again.

708
00:45:56,698 --> 00:45:58,818
Fuck you!

709
00:46:01,178 --> 00:46:03,298
Fine, you want it this way, huh?

710
00:46:03,658 --> 00:46:04,298
Fine!

711
00:46:04,578 --> 00:46:06,338
I’m going to take you down with me!

712
00:46:07,858 --> 00:46:10,898
Chai, go get the car.

Where are you going, Boss?

714
00:46:14,018 --> 00:46:15,818
To see Mayor Jae, of course.

715

Oh, it’s you.

719
00:46:40,058 --> 00:46:41,658
Good evening, Miss Anongnart.

720
00:46:42,778 --> 00:46:45,938
Seeing you’re also here, this means you already knew…

721
00:46:46,338 --> 00:46:47,418
whom I have an appointment with.

722
00:46:47,858 --> 00:46:50,818

724
00:46:54,338 --> 00:46:57,138
Great. Now that you know,

725
00:46:57,218 --> 00:46:59,898
do you still want to compete with me for the auction?

726
00:47:01,458 --> 00:47:04,138
It’s still not too late to withdraw.

727

729
00:47:14,818 --> 00:47:16,298
is rather you.

730
00:47:17,858 --> 00:47:21,618
Do you know why the mayor didn’t show up?

731
00:47:25,178 --> 00:47:28,058
It’s because he already knew…

732
00:47:28,298 --> 00:47:31,658
about those filthy things you did just to win this auction.

733
00:47:32,898 --> 00:47:36,218
The mayor doesn’t want to be involved with those crimes.

734
00:47:39,778 --> 00:47:42,378
Now, do you realise…

735
00:47:42,778 --> 00:47:46,618
who would actually win this auction?

736
00:47:50,498 --> 00:47:52,858

And Uncle Jom is kind too.

754

Then, you must hurry on and finish playing and go to bed early.

00:57:23,138 --> 00:57:24,298
It’s him, isn’t it?

899
00:57:24,538 --> 00:57:27,258
The one you said you didn’t have the guts to confess to.

900
00:57:31,298 --> 00:57:32,978
But I did it finally.

901
00:57:33,898 --> 00:57:36,218
And he said yes.

902
00:57:37,258 --> 00:57:38,058
What do you think?

903
00:57:38,778 --> 00:57:39,578
About what?

904
00:57:40,418 --> 00:57:41,898
About you and him?

905
00:57:42,178 --> 00:57:45,538
I just think that you’re the one who teach me…

906
00:57:46,778 --> 00:57:52,258
that love knows no bounds.

907
00:57:53,018 --> 00:57:54,378
Geez.

908
00:57:54,858 --> 00:57:55,658
Geez.

909
00:57:56,698 --> 00:57:57,738
Geez.

910
00:57:58,098 --> 00:57:59,418
Is it true, Yo?

911
00:58:01,178 --> 00:58:01,978
Move aside.

912
00:58:02,218 --> 00:58:05,338
If you mean me and Jom being together…

913
00:58:06,658 --> 00:58:07,298
Yes,

914
00:58:08,098 --> 00:58:09,418
it’s true.

915
00:58:10,258 --> 00:58:13,178
I’m so sorry though…

916
00:58:13,458 --> 00:58:15,178
that I didn’t tell you earlier.

917
00:58:15,258 --> 00:58:16,378
Why would you feel sorry?

918
00:58:16,818 --> 00:58:18,378
I’m actually happy…

919
00:58:18,378 --> 00:58:20,058
that you turned me down…

920
00:58:20,058 --> 00:58:22,538
because you like him.

921
00:58:22,858 --> 00:58:24,058
Also,

922
00:58:24,338 --> 00:58:25,858
I already have someone that I like.

923
00:58:34,618 --> 00:58:35,858
Geez, what the heck?

924
00:58:37,938 --> 00:58:39,698
So? What about you?

925
00:58:41,778 --> 00:58:45,058
There was a power outage that night, right?

926
00:58:45,538 --> 00:58:46,578
And the crowd was in panic.

927
00:58:46,938 --> 00:58:49,298
I was afraid they might run into her.

928
00:58:49,298 --> 00:58:50,578
So, I went to hold her.

929
00:58:51,178 --> 00:58:52,098
After that, I…

930
00:58:52,218 --> 00:58:53,538
You kissed her?

931
00:58:53,618 --> 00:58:54,658
No!

932
00:58:54,658 --> 00:58:55,738
I didn’t kiss her!

933
00:58:55,978 --> 00:59:00,018
After that, Prae and I were texting each other all night.

934
00:59:02,818 --> 00:59:03,778
Cool, man!

935
00:59:05,138 --> 00:59:06,618
What about you?

936
00:59:06,858 --> 00:59:07,978
How’s it going so far?

937
00:59:14,458 --> 00:59:15,658
[Next Break]
Where’s Jom?

938
00:59:15,778 --> 00:59:18,418
He went out with Tee to talk to the villagers.

939
00:59:18,498 --> 00:59:19,098
Yo!

940
00:59:19,098 --> 00:59:21,098
Geez, what’s rush?

941
00:59:21,098 --> 00:59:22,058
Yo!

942
00:59:25,338 --> 00:59:29,338
[My Sweetheart Jom]

943
00:59:49,159 --> 00:59:53,519
[My Sweetheart Jom]

944
00:59:53,879 --> 00:59:58,759
Watch “My Sweetheart Jom” for free on YouTube.

945
00:59:58,879 --> 01:00:00,319
[Juea]: How’s my sugarcane farm?

946
01:00:00,679 --> 01:00:01,719
The view is very lovely.

947
01:00:02,159 --> 01:00:03,959
Is this the first lot of planting?

948
01:00:04,119 --> 01:00:05,799
No, the second one.

949
01:00:06,159 --> 01:00:08,679
I have to replant them next year.

950
01:00:09,319 --> 01:00:13,719
Then, tomorrow I’ll have my team surveying the area with the drone.

951
01:00:13,719 --> 01:00:14,919
So that we can see the whole area first.

952
01:00:14,999 --> 01:00:16,639
That’s a good idea. Thank you.

953
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:20,799
Do you want to go eat something at my place?

954
01:00:21,039 --> 01:00:23,039
I want to repay you for your kindness.

955
01:00:23,719 --> 01:00:24,799
It’s not a big deal at all.

956
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:27,199
I’m doing this because I really want to help.

957
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:30,039
Maybe next time then.

958
01:00:30,359 --> 01:00:32,679
Tee and I still have to attend the village meeting.

959
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:34,039
Okay then.

960
01:00:34,279 --> 01:00:35,719
Bless you, Mister.

961
01:00:35,959 --> 01:00:38,799
It’s been a while since our village last welcomed someone with a good heart like you.

962
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:41,199
- Thank you so much.
- I’ll see you later.

963
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:49,159
Are you doing this sugarcane project…

964
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:50,639
because of your wife?

965
01:00:51,999 --> 01:00:52,999
What?

966
01:00:53,679 --> 01:00:55,359
Why would you say that?

967
01:00:56,799 --> 01:01:00,759
I think you’re doing this because of Miss Pannipa.

968
01:01:01,879 --> 01:01:04,479
You want to keep yourself busy so that you won’t be thinking about her.

969
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:07,079
No, Jom.

970
01:01:08,279 --> 01:01:11,439
I’m doing this project because I really want to help the farmers.

971
01:01:11,679 --> 01:01:13,439
About Nipa,

972
01:01:14,759 --> 01:01:17,359
our relationship didn’t start with love since the beginning.

973
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:19,159
I’m not surprised it ended like this.

974
01:01:19,479 --> 01:01:24,559
We both tried our best, but we’ve also had enough with each other.

975
01:01:24,879 --> 01:01:30,519
This is the best solution for her and I. And for Jaoka too.

976
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:34,839
But from what I see, Jaoka is a good girl.

977
01:01:34,959 --> 01:01:36,719
I can tell you’ve raised her well.

978
01:01:37,719 --> 01:01:38,679
That she has been raised with love.

979
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:42,079
That’s because I used to give you my word.

980
01:01:43,919 --> 01:01:48,719
Do you still remember…when you told me to look after Nipa and the baby as best as I can?

981
01:01:50,759 --> 01:01:53,479
I want you to take good care of your daughter because you love her.

982
01:01:55,159 --> 01:01:57,479
Not because of the promise you gave me.

983
01:02:02,519 --> 01:02:03,999
I think we should get going.

984
01:02:04,519 --> 01:02:06,999
The villagers are probably waiting.

985
01:02:21,959 --> 01:02:24,199
[Granny Chan]: Yo, are you back?

986
01:02:24,399 --> 01:02:25,159
Hi, Granny

987
01:02:25,159 --> 01:02:25,959
Hi, dear.

988
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:27,439
Where’s Jom?

989
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:32,239
He went out with Tee to talk to the villagers at the village center.

990
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:36,599
Hey, I’m not done talking yet. Where are you going?

991
01:02:37,079 --> 01:02:38,079
Yo!

992
01:02:38,679 --> 01:02:39,679
Yo!

993
01:02:39,679 --> 01:02:42,399
Geez, what’s the rush?

994
01:03:10,839 --> 01:03:14,639
My company would like to test the efficiency of the new model of a sugarcane harvester…

995
01:03:14,959 --> 01:03:17,319
in order to collect data for further product improvements.

996
01:03:17,319 --> 01:03:22,039
Usually, we’d make an offer to the farm owner…

997
01:03:22,039 --> 01:03:24,359
to use our sugarcane harvester for free without any charge.

998
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:30,839
If you have any questions, please feel free to ask away.

999
01:03:31,639 --> 01:03:36,519
What about villagers who do not own any farm or land?

1000
01:03:37,559 --> 01:03:41,679
Some farmers do not own the land. They rent it for planting crops.

1001
01:03:42,199 --> 01:03:45,599
Have you also discussed this with your company?

1002
01:03:46,719 --> 01:03:48,999
As a matter of fact, it’s actually not possible.

1003
01:03:49,639 --> 01:03:53,279
However, for the people of Pho Chai, I’ve already informed my company…

1004
01:03:53,279 --> 01:03:57,039
that all of you will get to use the sugarcane harvester for free.

1005
01:03:57,039 --> 01:03:58,959
Yay!

1006
01:04:12,239 --> 01:04:15,279
You’re such a good village chief. You know what your people want.

1007
01:04:17,639 --> 01:04:18,759
I’m not that good.

1008
01:04:19,519 --> 01:04:22,679
But their smiles are my happiness.

1009
01:04:23,399 --> 01:04:26,879
And my happiness is seeing you smile.

1010
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:32,399
What’s wrong?

1011
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:38,759
I’m still a bit dizzy.

1012
01:04:38,759 --> 01:04:40,239
Probably not fully recovered yet.

1013
01:04:40,519 --> 01:04:42,079
I’ll drop you home then.

1014
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:44,359
It’s too dangerous if you suddenly feel dizzy in the middle of the road.

1015
01:04:44,439 --> 01:04:46,559
It’s okay. I think I can manage.

1016
01:04:47,479 --> 01:04:48,279
Thank you.

1017
01:04:48,679 --> 01:04:49,359
Jom.

1018
01:04:49,799 --> 01:04:51,559
You’re still stubborn as usual.

1019
01:04:52,199 --> 01:04:55,399
Remember back then when you were burning hot with fever?

1020
01:04:55,399 --> 01:04:57,199
You kept telling me you were okay.

1021
01:04:57,439 --> 01:04:59,759
In the end, I had to take you to the hospital.

1022
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:01,759
The doctor said you had dengue fever.

1023
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:04,039
Yes.

1024
01:05:04,919 --> 01:05:08,719
You do know there are thousands of sugarcane farms in Thailand, right?

1025
01:05:10,039 --> 01:05:12,039
But why do you think I chose to come to Pho Chai?

1026
01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:13,519
[Yo]: Jom.

1027
01:05:15,239 --> 01:05:16,039
Yo.

1028
01:05:16,919 --> 01:05:17,719
What are you doing here?

1029
01:05:18,199 --> 01:05:20,439
Granny said you’re having a meeting around here.

1030
01:05:20,999 --> 01:05:23,039
I came to pick you up since you’re still not fully recovered.

1031
01:05:24,399 --> 01:05:28,959
But it looks like I might be too worried.

1032
01:05:29,919 --> 01:05:30,999
I’m heading home first then.

1033
01:05:32,919 --> 01:05:33,879
Wait, Yo.

1034
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:38,839
Are you Yo? Don’t worry, I’ll take good care of him.

1035
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:40,519
Let’s go, Jom.

1036
01:05:40,879 --> 01:05:42,879
I think I’ll go back with Yo.

1037
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:46,799
That’s because…Yo is my boyfriend.

1038
01:05:51,279 --> 01:05:55,559
Aww, my boyfriend is so sweet.

1039
01:05:55,639 --> 01:05:57,279
Coming all the way here to pick me up.

1040
01:05:58,199 --> 01:06:00,159
Let’s go. What’s wrong?

1041
01:06:01,879 --> 01:06:03,959
Come on. What’s wrong?

1042
01:06:21,159 --> 01:06:22,039
What’s wrong?

1043
01:06:23,199 --> 01:06:24,759
If you’re mad, then say it.

1044
01:06:25,239 --> 01:06:26,279
Don’t just stay quiet.

1045
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:39,039
Talk to me.

1046
01:06:48,479 --> 01:06:49,679
Let me go.

1047
01:06:50,399 --> 01:06:51,639
It hurts.

1048
01:06:51,639 --> 01:06:52,439
- Let me go.
- No.

1049
01:06:52,839 --> 01:06:53,999
Let me go. Granny might see us.

1050
01:06:54,399 --> 01:06:55,519
Let me go. It hurts.

1051
01:06:57,679 --> 01:06:58,679
What’s wrong with you?

1052
01:06:59,559 --> 01:07:01,519
Oh, you two are back?

1053
01:07:02,759 --> 01:07:03,559
Yes, Granny.

1054
01:07:03,599 --> 01:07:06,279
I want to ask Tee if he wants Jaoka to have dinner here.

1055
01:07:06,959 --> 01:07:09,559
I think he’ll be here soon.

1056
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:14,479
But he said tomorrow he might have to leave Jaoka here until late.

1057
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:17,879
That’s fine. I can look after her.

1058
01:07:17,879 --> 01:07:19,759
She’s much less stubborn than Oat.

1059
01:07:19,919 --> 01:07:20,319
That’s great.

1060
01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:23,719
But honestly, I feel bad for her though. Her parents separated.

1061
01:07:24,759 --> 01:07:28,959
I can’t understand how his wife could leave her own daughter and went to live with her new husband.

1062
01:07:30,639 --> 01:07:32,559
I don’t know too, Granny.

1063
01:07:33,519 --> 01:07:36,079
Since my graduation, I haven’t been in touch with him until now.

1064
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:42,079
Tee is also a good father. He loves his daughter so much. But his wife is kind of weird.

1065
01:07:42,479 --> 01:07:46,079
Isn’t it wrong to just leave them and be with the new guy?

1066
01:07:46,679 --> 01:07:47,159
Yes.

1067
01:07:49,479 --> 01:07:52,239
Yo, what’s the matter? Why are you upset?

1068
01:07:52,879 --> 01:07:56,399
It’s nothing. I just don’t understand some lessons in the textbook.

1069
01:07:57,119 --> 01:07:59,319
I want Jom to help explain it to me.

1070
01:07:59,479 --> 01:08:01,919
Oh, go on then. Go and help him.

1071
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:02,879
Go help Yo.

1072
01:08:03,159 --> 01:08:05,439
Just ask him if you don’t understand anything.

1073
01:08:05,439 --> 01:08:06,639
Off you go

1074
01:08:06,639 --> 01:08:07,399
Bye, Granny.

1075
01:08:32,359 --> 01:08:34,039
Are you okay, Yo?

1076
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:19,119
I’m sorry.

1077
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:25,279
Yo.

1078
01:09:28,199 --> 01:09:29,199
What’s wrong?

1079
01:09:37,239 --> 01:09:38,919
Are you mad at me?

1080
01:09:43,399 --> 01:09:44,959
I’m not mad at you.

1081
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:48,319
I’m mad at myself.

1082
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:53,319
I’m mad that I’m just a kid and couldn’t do anything for you.

1083
01:09:54,599 --> 01:09:55,719
But Tee…

1084
01:09:56,399 --> 01:10:02,639
Tee is a matured man with a good job.

1085
01:10:03,119 --> 01:10:08,519
But look at me, I can barely finish high school.

1086
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:13,399
Jom…

1087
01:10:15,919 --> 01:10:17,479
I’m scared.

1088
01:10:24,679 --> 01:10:25,959
It’s all right.

1089
01:10:28,639 --> 01:10:29,919
Don’t be scared.

1090
01:10:33,239 --> 01:10:34,399
You know what?

1091
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:38,319
Tee might have a good job.

1092
01:10:41,479 --> 01:10:45,679
But he doesn’t have what you do.

1093
01:10:48,839 --> 01:10:49,959
Do you know what it is?

1094
01:11:03,319 --> 01:11:06,759
He doesn’t have a nose like this.

1095
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:10,679
A cute mouth like this.

1096
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:13,159
Or a pair of eyes like yours.

1097
01:11:16,559 --> 01:11:19,559
Tee is not someone who’s waiting for me to come home every day.

1098
01:11:22,159 --> 01:11:23,959
Not someone who’s always worried about me.

1099
01:11:25,799 --> 01:11:29,599
Most importantly, he’s not my boyfriend.

1100
01:11:34,999 --> 01:11:39,759
The perfect one for me…is right in front me now.

1101
01:11:41,479 --> 01:11:46,199
There might even be someone who’s ten times better than Tee, but I still don’t care.

1102
01:11:47,079 --> 01:11:49,839
Because the one I like is you.

1103
01:11:53,039 --> 01:11:54,599
And you’re my boyfriend.

1104
01:11:56,319 --> 01:11:57,759
Don’t be scared, my puppy.

1105
01:12:03,479 --> 01:12:05,999
Is my boyfriend such a crybaby?

1106
01:12:09,439 --> 01:12:11,719
Don’t say something sentimental then.

1107
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:17,079
When I heard the word ‘like’ from you,

1108
01:12:18,079 --> 01:12:19,999
my tears started welling up.

1109
01:12:22,399 --> 01:12:25,759
But can you change from ‘like’ to ‘love’ instead?

1110
01:12:27,239 --> 01:12:30,639
I give you an inch, and you want a mile, huh?

1111
01:12:30,639 --> 01:12:31,479
Jom.

1112
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:36,759
Please, Jom.

1113
01:12:39,319 --> 01:12:40,119
No.

1114
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:43,559
I’m not going to spoil you with that word.

1115
01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:47,759
How about this?

1116
01:12:50,639 --> 01:12:55,759
You go shower first. I’ll have a look around at the house.

1117
01:12:56,359 --> 01:12:57,159
Okay?

1118
01:12:59,559 --> 01:13:01,559
Don’t be scared, puppy.

1119
01:13:02,239 --> 01:13:03,199
And don’t cry too.

1120
01:13:03,639 --> 01:13:04,439
Okay.

1121
01:13:05,079 --> 01:13:05,879
I’m off then.

1122
01:13:14,479 --> 01:13:15,279
Don’t stay up late.

1123
01:13:33,879 --> 01:13:35,799
I’ll tell you later about the check-out date.

1124
01:13:36,279 --> 01:13:38,159
I might be staying a few more days longer.

1125
01:13:38,359 --> 01:13:39,959
- Yes.
-Thank you

1126
01:14:04,679 --> 01:14:09,759
Riding your bike all the way here just to see me, I guess it must be something important.

1127
01:14:09,759 --> 01:14:14,199
I don’t know if you really came to Pho Chai for work, or if it’s just your excuse.

1128
01:14:14,919 --> 01:14:15,719
What excuse?

1129
01:14:16,639 --> 01:14:18,839
An excuse to be close to Jom.

1130
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:21,999
Jom told me everything about you.

1131
01:14:22,799 --> 01:14:25,479
If you plan to get back with Jom,

1132
01:14:26,519 --> 01:14:30,159
you should be careful because I’ll never let that happen.

1133
01:14:31,519 --> 01:14:33,919
What makes you think that you’d be able…

1134
01:14:33,919 --> 01:14:36,039
to stop me from getting back with Jom?

1135
01:14:38,039 --> 01:14:39,599
Because he likes me.

1136
01:14:40,679 --> 01:14:42,199
He used to like me too.

1137
01:14:43,359 --> 01:14:44,879
He still likes me now.

1138
01:14:45,719 --> 01:14:47,479
What he feels for you might just be a fling.

1139
01:14:48,399 --> 01:14:50,639
But when it’s time he has to decide,

1140
01:14:51,999 --> 01:14:54,639
I’m sure he’ll choose what’s the best for him.

1141
01:14:55,039 --> 01:14:55,839
And that’s me.

1142
01:14:58,599 --> 01:15:00,519
You’re just a selfish jerk.

1143
01:15:03,159 --> 01:15:03,959
What?

1144
01:15:04,399 --> 01:15:05,919
Jom only went to study in Japan for a few months.

1145
01:15:06,359 --> 01:15:10,999
But you chose to sleep with a woman, got her pregnant,
and blamed it on Jom.

1146
01:15:12,399 --> 01:15:14,359
I don’t call that love.

1147
01:15:15,319 --> 01:15:16,679
You only love yourself.

1148
01:15:17,359 --> 01:15:19,199
You only want yourself to be happy.

1149
01:15:19,519 --> 01:15:21,719
If this is not selfishness, then what else could it be?

1150
01:15:22,559 --> 01:15:23,719
You’re crossing the line.

1151
01:15:23,799 --> 01:15:25,599
A kid like you wouldn’t know anything.

1152
01:15:31,479 --> 01:15:33,039
I might be younger than you.

1153
01:15:33,399 --> 01:15:34,999
But I’m sure that my love for Jom…

1154
01:15:35,719 --> 01:15:38,359
is not less than what you have for him.

1155
01:15:41,039 --> 01:15:42,719
I’m here to tell you that…

1156
01:15:43,079 --> 01:15:46,879
I’ll protect Jom, and make sure he stays away from a selfish man like you.

1157
01:15:48,399 --> 01:15:51,239
Fine. Let’s see then.

1158
01:15:52,279 --> 01:15:53,679
Let’s see if he’ll choose you or me.

1159
01:16:37,639 --> 01:16:38,599
Looks yummy.

1160
01:16:42,119 --> 01:16:43,519
Me or the fried rice?

1161
01:16:44,719 --> 01:16:47,359
Geez, do you always have your head in the gutter?

1162
01:16:50,199 --> 01:16:51,999
Why are you in the mood for cooking?

1163
01:16:51,999 --> 01:16:54,199
Is Granny’s food not to your liking?

1164
01:16:54,639 --> 01:16:57,759
Of course not. I’m putting black magic in this fried rice.

1165
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:01,359
Love me, fall for me. Love me, fall for me!

1166
01:17:02,399 --> 01:17:04,319
Aww, you don’t have to do any black magic on me.

1167
01:17:04,759 --> 01:17:06,159
I’ve already fallen head over heel for you.

1168
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:09,719
I want to make some lunch for you.

1169
01:17:11,119 --> 01:17:15,599
I used to imagine that if I have a boyfriend, I’d cook for him.

1170
01:17:18,959 --> 01:17:22,639
Whose boyfriend is this? You’re so sweet.

1171
01:17:24,559 --> 01:17:26,479
It’s my best recipe.

1172
01:17:26,479 --> 01:17:29,159
Where were you yesterday? I didn’t see you when I came home.

1173
01:17:31,119 --> 01:17:32,999
I went to save the world.

1174
01:17:34,119 --> 01:17:34,999
Save the world?

1175
01:17:36,279 --> 01:17:37,319
What do you mean?

1176
01:17:37,839 --> 01:17:39,679
Are you keeping secrets from me?

1177
01:17:40,119 --> 01:17:40,919
No, no secrets.

1178
01:17:41,479 --> 01:17:43,759
I told you I went to save the world.

1179
01:17:45,399 --> 01:17:46,639
Okay, have fun saving the world then.

1180
01:17:47,039 --> 01:17:48,919
I better get ready to go to work. I don’t want to be late.

1181
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:50,239
Bye.

1182
01:17:54,639 --> 01:17:56,559
You’re my world.

1183
01:18:08,599 --> 01:18:10,239
Are you calling the wrong number?

1184
01:18:12,919 --> 01:18:13,839
You want to see me?

1185
01:18:15,079 --> 01:18:15,879
What is it?

1186
01:18:27,719 --> 01:18:28,679
Please listen to me first.

1187
01:18:34,919 --> 01:18:37,799
What does this mean, Mr. Yotin Sutthiwattana?!

1188
01:18:39,399 --> 01:18:40,559
Just like what you saw.

1189
01:18:41,559 --> 01:18:45,279
Jom and I are a couple now.

1190
01:18:46,159 --> 01:18:46,959
No!

1191
01:18:47,519 --> 01:18:48,959
You’re kidding, right?

1192
01:18:49,399 --> 01:18:51,719
It’s just a prank on me and Jom, right?

1193
01:18:52,719 --> 01:18:54,719
Don’t just keep quiet.

1194
01:18:55,199 --> 01:19:01,079
If you two are really a couple, Jom’s status on facebook should be the same too.

1195
01:19:01,559 --> 01:19:05,279
He’s probably busy working. He won’t have time to check it.

1196
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:09,479
If you don’t believe me, you can call Jom and ask him.

1197
01:19:12,239 --> 01:19:14,879
When? How? And why?

1198
01:19:15,239 --> 01:19:18,519
You made him like this, didn’t you?

1199
01:19:22,639 --> 01:19:24,999
I don’t know since when it has started.

1200
01:19:26,199 --> 01:19:27,879
I actually didn’t like him at first.

1201
01:19:28,679 --> 01:19:34,519
But by the time I knew it, I’ve already fallen for him.

1202
01:19:40,079 --> 01:19:43,719
But why does he like you too?

1203
01:19:47,679 --> 01:19:49,039
I don’t know.

1204
01:19:50,079 --> 01:19:56,359
I just told him I have feelings for him, and asked him to be my boyfriend.

1205
01:19:57,559 --> 01:19:58,879
Then he…

1206
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:01,479
…said yes.

1207
01:20:05,799 --> 01:20:09,639
Do you know how long I’ve had a crush on him?

1208
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:12,479
I know.

1209
01:20:12,479 --> 01:20:15,159
Why do you take him away from me then?

1210
01:20:15,159 --> 01:20:16,039
I get it.

1211
01:20:16,199 --> 01:20:17,399
Get what?

1212
01:20:17,719 --> 01:20:19,399
I’m trying to explain it to you.

1213
01:20:19,399 --> 01:20:20,319
Be quiet!

1214
01:20:21,959 --> 01:20:23,799
I don’t want to see your face anymore!

1215
01:20:24,239 --> 01:20:25,719
Get lost!

1216
01:20:27,039 --> 01:20:29,359
Go away! Go!

1217
01:20:31,999 --> 01:20:33,039
Go!

1218
01:21:11,639 --> 01:21:14,759
[Poon]: But you must promise me that you’ll never hurt her.

1219
01:21:15,879 --> 01:21:18,759
[Poon]: Fine. I’ll bring her to you.

1220
01:21:24,279 --> 01:21:27,319
Earn, I know you’re really mad at me right now.

1221
01:21:27,319 --> 01:21:28,799
But can we please talk for a second?

1222
01:21:28,839 --> 01:21:31,839
No, back off! I don’t want to talk to you!

1223
01:21:31,839 --> 01:21:33,519
Earn, listen to me.

1224
01:21:33,519 --> 01:21:34,719
- No!
- Just listen to me first.

1225
01:21:34,919 --> 01:21:36,479
Uncle Poon! Uncle Poon!

1226
01:21:36,679 --> 01:21:37,479
Are you here? Uncle Poon!

1227
01:21:38,439 --> 01:21:39,319
Uncle Poon.

1228
01:21:39,999 --> 01:21:40,799
Uncle Poon.

1229
01:21:42,319 --> 01:21:45,319
Please get the car ready. I want to go home now.

1230
01:21:45,359 --> 01:21:46,199
Yes, Miss.

1231
01:21:55,759 --> 01:21:56,919
[Next Episode]
What should I do then?

1232
01:21:57,239 --> 01:21:58,719
Should I tell her now?

1233
01:21:58,919 --> 01:21:59,719
Yes.

1234
01:22:02,359 --> 01:22:04,599
Shh! I have something important to talk to you.

1235
01:22:04,679 --> 01:22:06,639
Tee, I’m afraid I can’t go today.

1236
01:22:06,919 --> 01:22:08,159
Yo has a problem.

1237
01:22:08,159 --> 01:22:09,199
[Jom]: I have to go see him.

1238
01:22:09,479 --> 01:22:10,159
Jom!

1239
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:13,399
Uncle Poon, why are we taking a bypass route?

1240
01:22:15,159 --> 01:22:15,959
Jom.

1241
01:22:16,759 --> 01:22:18,479
Jom, help!

1242
01:22:18,959 --> 01:22:20,919
Why do you kidnap us?

1243
01:22:20,919 --> 01:22:21,639
Shut up!

1244
01:22:25,319 --> 01:22:27,959
Boo! We meet again.

1245
01:22:28,359 --> 01:22:29,239
[Yod]: Jom.

1246
01:22:29,519 --> 01:22:30,279
Yod?

1247
01:22:30,479 --> 01:22:32,719
Your kids are with me now.
