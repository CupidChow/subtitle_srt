Hi, guys!

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,260
Many people are watching now.

3
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:04,360
Just you wait.

4
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,220
What would you do if anything bad happens to Yo?

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,260
I know you’ll call me anyway.

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,060
Because tomorrow is Pa’s birthday.

7
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,400
Pa really wants you to be there.

8
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:15,900
Let’s say, I might be there in the evening.

9
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:18,300
Is it okay to lie to him like this?

10
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,130
I want you to come to my dad’s birthday party with me.

11
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,860
Just in case things get awkward.

12
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,100
Where is he now?

13
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,620
Happy Birthday, Pa.

14
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:29,660
Happy Birthday to Mr. Heng!

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,140
Thank you for your offer anyway.

16
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,140
But next time, please don’t bother.

17
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,900
Can you give me the bill, Manager?

18
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,060
Yes.

19
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,260
No!

20
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,960
You know Paisarn is willing to treat me for my birthday.

21
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,860
Are you trying to humiliate me?

22
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,860
It’s not about humiliation, Pa.

23
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,330
I know you want him to pay for your party…

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,400
because you want people to make an appeal against me.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,960
So that I’d be removed from the village chief position.

26
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,660
That’s right. So what?

27
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,700
I spent so much on your education.

28
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,730
But all you do is having your life stuck in those fields.

29
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,960
You care more about others

30
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,060
and never give a damn about your family business.

31
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,400
I really want to know,

32
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,300
what’s so interesting about being a bloody village chief.

33
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,460
Why are you so obsessed with it?

34
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,660
I have something to take care of.

35
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,460
Please don’t forget to send me the bill, Mum.

36
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,730
I’ll take care of that.

37
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,200
Don’t worry.

38
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:42,660
Please look after him for me.

39
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,420
Yes. Goodbye.

00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:54,200
Are you okay?

58
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,140
Umm…I think…

59
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,260
Maybe you should go rest first.

60
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,780
I’ll just be here and ponder about something for a while.

61
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,760
Oh,

62
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,460
are you two back?

63
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,130
Huh?

64
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,130
Yes, Granny.

65
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,620
Aren’t you already in bed?

66
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,130
Not yet,

67
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,800
I want to talk to you first.

68
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,860
So, how was it, your dad’s birthday party?

69
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,460
It was good.

70
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:44,180
Why are you looking like a sad puppy then?

71
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,660
Maybe I’m too tired, Granny.

72
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:52,260
Was there any problem while I was away?

73
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,420
Not at all.

74
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,420
Oh, there’s one thing actually.

75
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,500
Jerd came to tell me about his buffalo.

76
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:02,160
That it might be ready to give birth in a few days.

77
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,340
He wants you to call for the vet for him.

78
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,420
No problem. Maybe I should go check on it now.

79
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,340
Mhm.

80
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,620
Yotin, did anything happen at the party?

81
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:31,930
Yes.

82
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,740
[Sigh]

83
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:50,300
Hey.

84
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,900
Easy there, Chief.

85
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,740
What’s so frustrating, huh?

86
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,020
Calm down, Chief.

87
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,460
Don’t take it out on the bike like that.

88
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,660
It’s not the bike’s fault.

89
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,420
The problem is you.

90
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,420
Get yourself together.

91
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,020
The key is still in your hand.

92
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,260
How on earth will you be able to start the engine then?

93
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,860
Jeez, Chief.

94
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,140
Try to get yourself together.

95
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,940
Don’t go anywhere tonight.

96
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,540
Just do it tomorrow.

97
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,260
You won’t get there being so mad like this.

98
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:22,860
Okay.

99
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,380
Also…

100
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,740
about what happened at the restaurant.

101
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,420
I already knew about it.

102
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:38,260
I thought Pa would really forgive me.

103
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,500
But he didn’t.

104
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,460
All he wants is to get me removed from my position.

105
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,580
Your dad has gone too far indeed.

106
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:48,660
But anyway, try not to be so mad at him.

107
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,380
He’s still your…I don’t want to say it.

108
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,060
Just don’t be mad at him.

109
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,500
He did this to me.

110
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,740
But you still want me not to be mad at him?

111
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,300
Come on, just think about it like this.

112
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,940
Try to think about this part of him…

113
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,460
that he is somehow your father.

114
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,900
Parents are always worried about their child.

115
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,220
They don’t want you to struggle.

116
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,930
You usually hate his guts.

117
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:19,730
Why are you defending him now?

118
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,780
No, I’m not!

119
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,620
Jeez, Chief. You’re so stubborn.

120
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,760
Honestly,

121
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,700
I think Heng loves his sons,

122
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:29,800
so much especially you.

123
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,100
That’s why he doesn’t want you to be a village chief here.

124
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,060
He’s worried you might be struggling.

125
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,560
Understood?

126
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,160
What should I do then, Granny?

127
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,500
Oh, nothing, Chief.

128
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:52,580
Remember how furious Heng was when you first came to be a village chief here?

129
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,700
He even said that you wouldn’t be able to make it.

130
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:00,380
And look what happened? It’s been 3-4 years now.

131
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,900
Why are you stressing out now?

132
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,820
Just be a village chief here for another 10 years.

133
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,940
Ha! I can’t wait to see what kind of face he’d make.

134
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,940
You’ve been Chief here for 10 years already.

135
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,300
And you’ll be for another 10 years.

136
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,100
Wanna give it a try?

137
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,660
I’m sure you can do it.

138
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,460
Yes, Granny.

139
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,860
That’s my boy.

140
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,140
My grandson is such a good boy.

141
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,020
Alright then?

142
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:23,420
Yes.

143
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,460
Good.

144
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,400
Feeling better now, huh?

145
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,220
I’m off then.

146
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,800
I’m sorry.

147
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,460
I should’ve noticed you weren’t feeling okay.

148
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,130
I should’ve taken you home since then.

149
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:49,860
You fool.

150
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:53,960
What?

151
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,530
It’s me who has to apologize.

152
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,400
Why are you apologizing?

153
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,400
I’m the one who took you there in the first place.

154
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,700
I went there at my own will.

155
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,000
Not because of you.

156
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,980
[Stomach growling]

157
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,340
Are you hungry?

158
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,260
No.

159
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,700
I’m off to bed then.

160
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:26,100
I’m going to cook some noodles. Not sure if anyone wants to join me.

161
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:31,930
Will you make it for me too?

162
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,160
Do you want it?

163
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,780
Should I eat it?

164
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:43,860
Should I?

165
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,180
[Laughing]

166
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:51,500
3..2..1..!

167
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,420
Here you go!

168
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:53,940
Wow!!!

169
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,760
How is it?

170
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,500
Smells so good.

171
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,660
Looking good, right?

172
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,930
Wait!

173
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,100
Don’t you want a separate bowl?

174
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,500
Jeez, I can’t wait.

175
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,220
Okay, go on.

176
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,340
Easy there.

177
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,530
You hardly eat something like this, don’t you?

178
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:11,930
Who told you?

179
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:16,140
When I was still in school after I was done with the activities,

180
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,700
I only ate this kind of noodles.

181
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:18,660
Really?

182
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,380
Mhm.

00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,460
Ouch, it’s hot!

184
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,530
Yeah, careful there.

185
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,530
But that's okay

186
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:36,020
Why do you want to be a village chief here?

187
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,800
Why a village chief here?

188
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:44,100
Maybe because it’s where you can enjoy eating the best noodles in the world.

189
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,330
I don’t know what makes other people want to become a village chief.

190
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,460
Some might be because they want power.

191
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,960
Some are sent by politicians.

192
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,500
But for me,

193
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,000
I just want to forget my sadness.

194
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,800
When I get to help people in the village,

195
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,400
I feel so damn good.

196
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,460
Maybe you’re right.

197
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,060
The noodles here are better than

198
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,160
any noodles I’ve ever had.

199
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,300
There’s a secret, you know?

200
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,140
To make noodles here better than elsewhere.

201
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,400
What secret?

202
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:53,300
Noodles are like love.

203
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,260
Noodles?

204
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:00,730
Love?

205
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,730
How are they related?

206
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,980
Love is…

207
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:10,420
doing small things with great feeling.

208
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,380
Just like this noodle.

209
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,500
Although I’m having it in the middle of the field,

210
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,460
but for me…

211
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:21,740
it’s like having dinner at a fine dining restaurant.

It’s not like that.

237

I’m following you because…

238
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,100
I want to talk to you about yesterday.

239
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,100
I don’t want to get on the wrong side with you. Hey, wait!

240
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,820
Or else I wouldn’t have warned you Fluke was going to extort money from you.

241
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,560
Warned?

242
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,160

00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,100

246
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,460
It seems you also don’t like them.

It’s not like that.

248

Actually, it’s just…

249
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,500
if they don’t bully me or extort money from me,

250
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,660
they are not that bad.

251
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,400
If you say that,

252
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,800
it means they are bad.

253
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,300
Why are you still hanging out with them?

254
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,600
Because as long as I’m with them,

255
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,560
no one would dare to mess with me.

256
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,000
Fluke is like,

257
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,800
a mafia boss in this school.

258
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,700
I see.

259
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,560
So, you have to pay them for their protection.

I want to know where he’s going.

00:22:48,703 --> 00:22:52,433
So, you have to do the job for him because you can’t pay him.

368
00:22:59,473 --> 00:23:00,333
I got it.

369
00:23:01,233 --> 00:23:02,633
Let’s give this to Chief Jom…

370
00:23:02,973 --> 00:23:04,473
and tell him everything.

371
00:23:05,673 --> 00:23:06,473
No!

372
00:23:08,033 --> 00:23:10,503
If Jom finds out that I’ve skipped school to play games,

373
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:11,833
he’d kill me.

374
00:23:12,703 --> 00:23:14,233
I don’t want to get kicked out of the house.

375
00:23:15,933 --> 00:23:17,503
Please don’t tell him, I’m begging you.

376
00:23:18,573 --> 00:23:19,903
Let me finish my job.

377
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:21,933
Toey.

378
00:23:23,473 --> 00:23:25,703
Do you really think he’d keep his words…

379
00:23:26,503 --> 00:23:27,833
and let you go?

380
00:23:29,103 --> 00:23:31,303
Once he knows he can threaten you,

381
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:33,373
he’ll find other excuses and keep threatening you…

382
00:23:33,633 --> 00:23:34,973
to do this dirty job for him.

383
00:23:35,973 --> 00:23:37,273
What should I do then?

384
00:23:43,473 --> 00:23:45,153

387
00:24:07,393 --> 00:24:13,913
[Yo: It’s something serious.]

389
00:24:17,033 --> 00:24:21,313

Can I go in?

397
00:24:53,873 --> 00:24:54,673
Sure.

398

You hardly ate during dinner.

399
00:25:05,633 --> 00:25:06,703
So, I brought you some milk.

400
00:25:08,303 --> 00:25:10,473
Oh, I’m so full.

401
00:25:10,473 --> 00:25:12,473
I can’t eat anything now.

402
00:25:13,593 --> 00:25:15,113
But thank you anyway.

403
00:25:15,113 --> 00:25:16,113
Hmm..

404
00:25:35,073 --> 00:25:35,933
Quite dusty, huh?

405
00:25:36,833 --> 00:25:39,153
Yeah, I…umm…

406
00:25:39,153 --> 00:25:41,113
I hardly clean up.

407
00:25:45,073 --> 00:25:46,433
Is there anything else?

408
00:25:47,503 --> 00:25:48,773
Not really.

409
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:51,373
Get some rest then.

410
00:25:52,503 --> 00:25:54,703
Please put the glass outside after you finish it.

411
00:25:54,903 --> 00:25:55,773
To prevent ants.

412
00:25:57,173 --> 00:25:57,973
Sure.

413
00:25:59,273 --> 00:26:03,073
You go rest too.

414
00:26:06,533 --> 00:26:07,533
Goodnight.

415
00:26:08,903 --> 00:26:09,703

Why didn’t you follow me?

422
00:26:53,793 --> 00:26:55,513
Fuck.

423

Do you know how much these things cost?

428

Just die in the game.

429
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:13,433
Or do you want to die in real life too?

430
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:15,933
I’m sorry, Jo.

431
00:27:16,303 --> 00:27:18,433
I’m sorry. I won’t do it again.

432
00:27:20,773 --> 00:27:23,373

You haven’t got it?

438
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:56,173
But I already asked my guy to deliver it.

439
00:27:56,933 --> 00:27:58,633
How many times have we done this?

440
00:27:58,773 --> 00:28:00,033
Have I ever bailed on you?

00:28:01,733 --> 00:28:02,933
Yeah, yeah.

442
00:28:03,073 --> 00:28:04,373
I’ll see what I can do.

That kid we talked to at lunchtime,

445
00:28:12,573 --> 00:28:14,033
does he live in Pho Chai?

446
00:28:14,633 --> 00:28:16,633
Why didn’t he deliver our stuff to Pol?

447
00:28:18,273 --> 00:28:20,673
Have you suddenly lost your fucking mouth?

448
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:22,473
Do you know where he lives?

449
00:28:22,833 --> 00:28:24,673
Go and get it from him now.

450
00:28:25,473 --> 00:28:26,273
I don’t know where he lives.

451
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:28,103
I just know he’s in Pho Chai.

452
00:28:36,033 --> 00:28:37,303
He bailed on us.

453
00:28:41,433 --> 00:28:44,533
Did he say he’s studying at Bang Pho Wittayakom?

454

[Bang Pho Wittayakom School]

455

Jeez.

457
00:29:00,953 --> 00:29:02,313
Are you dumb?

458
00:29:03,133 --> 00:29:06,333
The letters on his uniform are BPW. Where else could it be?

459
00:29:06,773 --> 00:29:08,553
Shut up.

460
00:29:08,953 --> 00:29:10,833
I’ll kill you if we can’t get it back.

Are you going to fucking wait for it to come to you?

465

But there’s a teacher in front of the school.

466
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,033
We can’t get in.

467
00:29:34,913 --> 00:29:38,113
Wait. Excuse me, pretty?

Can you take me with you?

473
00:29:51,773 --> 00:29:54,033
I’m afraid I can’t.

474
00:29:54,033 --> 00:29:57,433
The teacher knows I don’t have a brother.

475

This guy wants to go inside too.

483

551
00:34:48,101 --> 00:34:49,421
My stuff is here.

552
00:35:01,571 --> 00:35:02,801
I’m here to return your thing.

553
00:35:05,201 --> 00:35:07,661
And also pay for what Toey owes you.

554
00:35:13,701 --> 00:35:14,981
Isn’t that too easy?

555
00:35:16,971 --> 00:35:18,841
That’s just for fixing the computer.

556
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:23,001
What about my credit I’ve lost because your brother didn’t do his job?

557
00:35:23,771 --> 00:35:24,571
How are you going to pay for that?

558
00:35:33,741 --> 00:35:35,601
I’ll give you 2,000 more then.

559
00:35:36,401 --> 00:35:39,021
That should be enough to get your credit back.

560
00:35:46,371 --> 00:35:47,171
Fine.

561
00:35:49,001 --> 00:35:52,171
I’ll let you and your brother off this time.

562
00:35:53,001 --> 00:35:54,241
So, we’re done here.

563
00:35:56,241 --> 00:35:57,101
Wait.

564
00:35:59,801 --> 00:36:03,301
You do know what exactly it is, don’t you?

565
00:36:05,061 --> 00:36:07,221
Coming here alone like this,

566
00:36:07,221 --> 00:36:08,461
aren’t you afraid at all?

567
00:36:11,001 --> 00:36:12,401
Why should I?

568
00:36:12,641 --> 00:36:13,741
I’m here to return something.

569
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:16,971
Do you want to work for me?

570
00:36:18,101 --> 00:36:19,741
I kind of like you.

571
00:36:20,641 --> 00:36:21,501
I’d rather not.

572
00:36:22,401 --> 00:36:23,301
I’m a student.

573
00:36:23,971 --> 00:36:25,201
I’m here to study,

574
00:36:25,941 --> 00:36:27,571
not to be a delivery boy for anyone.

575
00:36:55,971 --> 00:36:56,841
Student.

576
00:36:59,901 --> 00:37:00,901
Are you calling me?

577
00:37:00,901 --> 00:37:01,941
Yes, you.

578
00:37:02,641 --> 00:37:04,171
Aren’t you supposed to be in class?

579
00:37:04,441 --> 00:37:05,341
Where are you going?

580
00:37:05,801 --> 00:37:07,001
Tell us your name and class no.

581
00:37:08,171 --> 00:37:09,601
Why do I have to do that?

582
00:37:14,801 --> 00:37:16,371
Because we’re attendance officers.

583
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:17,841
Are you going to tell us now

584
00:37:23,401 --> 00:37:27,061
[Teacher Toei: I don’t know if you also behave like this in Bangkok.]

585
00:37:27,061 --> 00:37:31,221
[Teacher Toei: But you can’t do that here. Everyone must follow the rules here.]

586
00:37:31,221 --> 00:37:32,661
[Teacher Toei: Do you understand?]

587
00:37:40,141 --> 00:37:45,381
[Teacher Toei: Can you tell me now? Are you even listening?]

588
00:37:45,661 --> 00:37:46,661
Yo.

589
00:37:49,841 --> 00:37:50,701
Hello, Teacher.

590
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:51,601
Hello.

591
00:37:52,001 --> 00:37:53,941
Jom, may I have a word with you?

592
00:37:54,241 --> 00:37:55,041
Yes.

593
00:37:55,601 --> 00:37:57,101
Yo, go and wait outside first.

594
00:37:57,201 --> 00:37:58,641
I have something to speak with your teacher.

595
00:38:01,501 --> 00:38:03,181
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

596
00:38:08,701 --> 00:38:10,341
I have to apologize on behalf of him, Teacher.

597
00:38:10,741 --> 00:38:13,171
I never thought he’d be so addicted to games and even skipped classes.

598
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,701
Jom, let me ask you something.

599
00:38:29,501 --> 00:38:31,541
Is Yotin a drug addict?

600
00:38:38,741 --> 00:38:39,541
Why did you say that?

601
00:38:40,341 --> 00:38:45,701
You know that game shop isn’t actually selling games, don’t you?

602
00:38:57,571 --> 00:38:58,701
Yo.

603
00:39:01,781 --> 00:39:02,861
Toey.

604
00:39:07,301 --> 00:39:08,371
You don’t have to worry about that.

605
00:39:09,201 --> 00:39:10,601
I already returned it to him.

606
00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:12,741
Did he say anything?

607
00:39:14,801 --> 00:39:16,001
Nothing.

608
00:39:17,641 --> 00:39:19,981
Don’t go to that shop again.

609
00:39:20,541 --> 00:39:21,741
Got it?

610
00:39:22,741 --> 00:39:23,541
Yes.

611
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:26,171
What is Jom doing here by the way?

612
00:39:27,301 --> 00:39:29,901
Is it about you getting caught by attendance officers?

613
00:39:30,541 --> 00:39:31,641
Who told you that?

614
00:39:32,201 --> 00:39:38,461
My friends heard those in Grade11 said that you got caught.

615
00:39:38,461 --> 00:39:40,981
Everyone in our school would probably know it by now.

616
00:39:47,101 --> 00:39:48,541
Jeez, I’m so popular.

617
00:39:51,771 --> 00:39:53,861
I’ll confess to Jom.

618
00:39:54,461 --> 00:39:57,141
That you went there to help me.

619
00:39:57,301 --> 00:39:58,501
Don’t do that.

620
00:39:58,781 --> 00:40:02,981
If you tell him, what I just did would be such a waste.

621
00:40:03,971 --> 00:40:04,771
But…

622
00:40:08,441 --> 00:40:09,301
Jom.

623
00:40:14,541 --> 00:40:16,171
Toey, go get Todd and Oat.

624
00:40:16,501 --> 00:40:17,541
I’ll take you home today.

625
00:40:26,541 --> 00:40:27,901
What did Teacher Toei say?

626
00:40:29,241 --> 00:40:30,301
Let’s talk at home.

627
00:40:31,241 --> 00:40:32,841
Tell them to meet at the car.

628
00:41:08,541 --> 00:41:10,941
Don’t you think it’s kind of awkward in here?

629
00:41:18,001 --> 00:41:19,501
Isn’t it too quiet?

630
00:41:20,141 --> 00:41:21,201
Let’s turn on the music.

631
00:41:23,701 --> 00:41:31,341
[♪♪♪]

632
00:41:39,661 --> 00:41:45,981
[♪♪♪]

633
00:41:54,821 --> 00:41:57,901
[So lonely and alone, what to do?]

634
00:41:58,201 --> 00:41:59,141
It’s okay.

635
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:02,201
But I think it’s too quiet.

636
00:42:02,801 --> 00:42:04,301
Let’s listen to the music.

637
00:42:05,501 --> 00:42:06,621
[Please send someone…]

638
00:42:08,141 --> 00:42:10,421
[To love me]

639
00:42:10,781 --> 00:42:15,581
[I’m a troublesome kid. I can’t find a boyfriend]

640
00:42:15,581 --> 00:42:19,381
[I’d surely fall for anyone if you leave me alone]

641
00:42:19,381 --> 00:42:23,261
[So I need someone to look after my heart]

642
00:42:23,261 --> 00:42:28,101
[Can it be you? It’d be great if you love me]

643
00:42:37,641 --> 00:42:39,371
Put down your bags and go help Granny make dinner.

644
00:42:40,941 --> 00:42:44,341
As for you, go talk to me upstairs.

645
00:42:54,901 --> 00:42:58,061
It’s all right, Yo. It’s just skipping classes.

646
00:42:58,061 --> 00:42:59,901
He won’t eat your head off.

647
00:43:01,101 --> 00:43:02,141
Just stay calm

648
00:43:02,741 --> 00:43:03,541
You can do it.

649
00:43:04,971 --> 00:43:06,501
I can’t be calm because of you guys.

650
00:43:07,601 --> 00:43:09,641
Go and help Granny make dinner.

651
00:43:36,941 --> 00:43:37,841
What is it?

652
00:43:41,101 --> 00:43:42,371
What were you going at the game shop?

653
00:43:46,141 --> 00:43:48,571
I already told Teacher Toei I broke their computer…

654
00:43:49,141 --> 00:43:50,341
so I went there to pay for it.

655
00:43:54,641 --> 00:43:55,571
Are you telling the truth?

656
00:43:57,241 --> 00:43:59,771
A city boy who is so pampered like you…

657
00:44:02,141 --> 00:44:03,971
has to go play games in that kind of shop?

658
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:07,541
Just tell me honestly,

659
00:44:08,171 --> 00:44:09,141
why you were there.

660
00:44:10,171 --> 00:44:11,201
Was it to buy something?

661
00:44:14,601 --> 00:44:16,801
You think I went there to buy drugs from those junkies?

662
00:44:24,101 --> 00:44:25,301
Isn’t it true?

663
00:44:27,901 --> 00:44:29,401
That money you paid them,

664
00:44:30,241 --> 00:44:31,171
where did you get it from?

665
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:34,771
I borrowed it from a friend in Bangkok.

666
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:39,001
You’re so addicted you have to borrow from your friend?

667
00:44:41,621 --> 00:44:42,971
What do you mean?

668
00:44:44,101 --> 00:44:45,581
Addicted to what?

669
00:44:48,041 --> 00:44:49,241
You’re a drug addict.

670
00:44:52,801 --> 00:44:53,601
Aren’t you?

671
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:56,501
Just tell me honestly.

672
00:44:57,741 --> 00:44:59,301
We can fix this together.

673
00:45:01,341 --> 00:45:02,901
Answer me, Yo!

674
00:45:14,771 --> 00:45:17,201
I shouldn’t have agreed with Uncle Komet to let you stay here.

675
00:45:21,171 --> 00:45:22,741
If that’s really what you think,

676
00:45:23,941 --> 00:45:26,241
Then call my dad and tell him to pick me up now.

677
00:45:27,341 --> 00:45:29,101
I don’t want to be a burden to anyone.

678
00:45:41,841 --> 00:45:43,261
Yo!

679
00:45:45,541 --> 00:45:47,201
Come back and talk to me first, Yo!

680
00:45:47,771 --> 00:45:48,461
Yo!

681
00:45:49,701 --> 00:45:50,701
What’s going on?

682
00:45:51,701 --> 00:45:53,641
Where is Yo going?

683
00:45:58,971 --> 00:45:59,771
What’s going on?

684
00:46:09,201 --> 00:46:11,801
Do you really think he’s addicted to drugs?

685
00:46:12,941 --> 00:46:14,341
I don’t want to believe it either.

686
00:46:15,201 --> 00:46:20,141
I don’t think he’d skip classes just to play games.

687
00:46:20,171 --> 00:46:21,841
But skipping classes to go after a girl…

688
00:46:22,441 --> 00:46:23,641
That would sound more possible.

689
00:46:24,001 --> 00:46:25,101
Is this game shop,

690
00:46:25,301 --> 00:46:27,101
really selling drugs?

691
00:46:28,971 --> 00:46:32,021
Yes, the inspector told me that it’s a place…

692
00:46:32,341 --> 00:46:36,021
Jo uses to secretly sell drugs. The cops did the buy-and-bust here for several times.

693
00:46:53,841 --> 00:46:55,141
What’s wrong, Toey?

694
00:47:00,501 --> 00:47:02,171
So?

695
00:47:02,441 --> 00:47:04,541
What is Yo and Jom fighting about?

696
00:47:04,801 --> 00:47:06,781
Jom said Yo is a drug addict.

697
00:47:06,781 --> 00:47:10,141
What? Really?

698
00:47:10,141 --> 00:47:13,101
Jom said the attendance officers ran into Yo at the shop.

699
00:47:13,101 --> 00:47:14,861
He was there to buy drugs.

700
00:47:17,041 --> 00:47:18,801
Yo is a drug addict

701
00:47:19,801 --> 00:47:20,601
Mhm.

702
00:47:22,971 --> 00:47:24,101
But that’s possible.

703
00:47:24,941 --> 00:47:27,171
Otherwise, why would he go there?

704
00:47:28,241 --> 00:47:30,141
- Yeah, that’s right.
- Right?

705
00:47:30,401 --> 00:47:32,641
He also left the classroom in a hurry that day.

706
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:35,101
He’s definitely addicted to drugs.

707
00:47:35,341 --> 00:47:36,141
Possible.

708
00:47:36,401 --> 00:47:39,171
That’s why his parents took him here to quit drugs.

709
00:47:39,371 --> 00:47:40,901
That’s right.

710
00:47:41,101 --> 00:47:43,421
- That day, he even came out to eat…
-That’s enough!

711
00:47:44,041 --> 00:47:45,241
What’s wrong with you, Toey?

712
00:47:45,441 --> 00:47:46,741
Stop talking rubbish.

713
00:47:47,371 --> 00:47:49,041
Yo is not a drug addict.

714
00:48:06,601 --> 00:48:07,801
But come to think of it,

715
00:48:08,301 --> 00:48:11,141
he doesn’t look like someone who is addicted to drugs.

716
00:48:11,741 --> 00:48:12,541
Not at all.

717
00:48:12,541 --> 00:48:14,741
If it’s Pol or Leng, that’s more possible.

718
00:48:15,571 --> 00:48:17,241
Yo is not like them.

719
00:48:18,541 --> 00:48:22,541
What makes you think he’s a drug addict?

720
00:48:23,241 --> 00:48:27,401
Honestly, I don’t believe it either.

721
00:48:28,201 --> 00:48:30,571
But usually, he’s a city boy who loves to party.

722
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:32,541
Life in Pho Chai,

723
00:48:32,941 --> 00:48:34,141
might be too boring for him.

724
00:48:34,541 --> 00:48:36,701
So boring that he wants to find something exciting to do.

725
00:48:37,101 --> 00:48:39,381
Forget about those reasons first.

726
00:48:39,381 --> 00:48:42,821
I just want to know if deep down you really believe he’s someone like that.

727
00:48:42,821 --> 00:48:44,261
Someone who’s addicted to drugs.

728
00:48:44,261 --> 00:48:48,061
You’re the person who spends time with him the most.

729
00:48:48,061 --> 00:48:50,901
You should know best whether he is or isn’t.

No.

I’m right here.

782

How did you get here?

783
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:45,104
I was at the roadside pavilion earlier.

784
00:55:45,634 --> 00:55:47,834
Suddenly, two men appeared,

785
00:55:49,074 --> 00:55:50,174
and tried to hurt me.

786
00:55:50,904 --> 00:55:52,434
So, I ran into the woods.

787
00:55:53,034 --> 00:55:56,104
And probably passed out here.

788
00:55:56,634 --> 00:55:58,354
Are you hurt?

789
00:55:58,354 --> 00:56:00,674

We still don’t know how badly you’re hurt.

About the game shop,

806
00:57:51,174 --> 00:57:53,334
and also about you helping him without telling me.

807
00:57:54,874 --> 00:57:55,774
He’s innocent.

808
00:57:57,434 --> 00:57:58,704
He thought they’d let him go.

809
00:57:59,334 --> 00:58:00,704

816
00:58:29,534 --> 00:58:32,434
I don’t think so.

817
00:58:33,434 --> 00:58:36,034
I didn’t see anyone when I got here.

818
00:58:40,674 --> 00:58:42,174
But if they’re still around,

819
00:58:44,634 --> 00:58:45,594
then I’m going to…

820
00:58:47,954 --> 00:58:49,474

00:58:52,274 --> 00:58:53,174

824
00:59:10,234 --> 00:59:11,554
Come.

825
00:59:16,074 --> 00:59:18,834
From what he told me, those two still hadn’t done any harm yet.

826
00:59:18,834 --> 00:59:20,354
I’m afraid we can’t press any charges on them.

827
00:59:20,354 --> 00:59:23,154
But I’ll try to find out who they are.

828
00:59:24,434 --> 00:59:26,234
Thank you, Inspector.

829
00:59:26,374 --> 00:59:27,704
Fortunately, nothing bad happened.

830
00:59:28,274 --> 00:59:29,874
But those two surely didn’t have good intentions.

831
00:59:30,304 --> 00:59:32,474
Something like this has never happened in Pho Chai before.

832
00:59:33,274 --> 00:59:35,674
Please try to find out who they are as soon as possible.

833
00:59:35,934 --> 00:59:36,734
Yes.

834
00:59:37,104 --> 00:59:38,304
What about the game shop?

835
00:59:38,474 --> 00:59:39,974
I’ll have someone,

836
00:59:40,274 --> 00:59:41,704
do the buy-and-bust and arrest Jo...

837
00:59:41,904 --> 00:59:43,234
so that we can finally close down the shop.

838
00:59:43,574 --> 00:59:45,534
Hearing what you told me about those kids…

839
00:59:46,104 --> 00:59:47,134
makes me feel that

840
00:59:47,304 --> 00:59:49,334
I should put them behind bars as soon as possible.

841
00:59:50,394 --> 00:59:51,194
Yes.

842
00:59:57,234 --> 00:59:58,114

843
00:59:58,394 --> 01:00:01,114

844

01:00:11,574 --> 01:00:13,704
I’ll see you off here, Inspector.

847
01:00:14,674 --> 01:00:16,714
I’m leaving then. Goodbye.

848
01:00:16,714 --> 01:00:17,394
Yes.

849
01:00:26,704 --> 01:00:28,234
What are you guys doing here?

850
01:00:28,674 --> 01:00:31,904
Jom, will Yo and Toey get arrested?

851
01:00:34,634 --> 01:00:36,074
What did the inspector say?

852
01:00:38,034 --> 01:00:40,954
He said, for those guys who were trying to hurt Yo,

853
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:45,474
it shouldn’t take long to track them down since Pho Chai is a small town.

854
01:00:46,314 --> 01:00:47,474
As for the game shop,

855
01:00:48,274 --> 01:00:49,774
Inspector really admires both of you.

856
01:00:50,334 --> 01:00:51,834
He said you did the right thing,

857
01:00:52,334 --> 01:00:54,474
for not passing on those drugs to the others.

858
01:00:54,874 --> 01:00:55,774
He should be able to,

859
01:00:56,274 --> 01:00:58,734
gather more evidence and close down the shop soon.

860
01:00:58,974 --> 01:01:00,874
Yay!

861
01:01:00,874 --> 01:01:04,394
Jeez, calm down.

862
01:01:04,754 --> 01:01:09,634
Don’t be so rough on him. How lucky he’s still intact and doesn’t have anything broken.

863
01:01:09,634 --> 01:01:11,074
But his arm might be broken because of you.

864
01:01:12,104 --> 01:01:13,974
Make sure you take this as a lesson learnt.

865
01:01:14,474 --> 01:01:17,304
Never ever skip classes to play games again, got it?

866
01:01:17,774 --> 01:01:18,534
Yes, Granny.

867
01:01:19,534 --> 01:01:21,674
Told you. Why wasting time on those games?

868
01:01:22,274 --> 01:01:23,934
Kicking other people’s asses is much more fun.

869
01:01:27,354 --> 01:01:29,914
Jeez, these rascals.

870
01:01:31,774 --> 01:01:34,634
Do they even feel guilty?

871
01:01:35,434 --> 01:01:36,234
So,

872
01:01:37,034 --> 01:01:38,174
do you want to go to the hospital?

873
01:01:38,504 --> 01:01:39,774
Just in case you’re still hurt anywhere.

874
01:01:40,834 --> 01:01:41,634
No, I don’t.

875
01:01:42,574 --> 01:01:43,704
I’m fine now.

876
01:01:46,334 --> 01:01:48,074
I’ll go get some rest first, Granny.

877
01:01:59,174 --> 01:01:59,974
He’s fine?

878
01:02:01,104 --> 01:02:02,834
Does he look fine to you, Granny?

879
01:02:02,834 --> 01:02:05,594
I think he’s still upset with me.

880
01:02:05,774 --> 01:02:08,774
Listen, Chief. Saying harsh words to someone…

881
01:02:09,574 --> 01:02:11,834
is like hammering a nail on the wall.

882
01:02:12,274 --> 01:02:13,834
Even after you remove the nail,

883
01:02:14,504 --> 01:02:16,534
there’s still a hole on it.

884
01:02:20,234 --> 01:02:21,034
Yes, Granny.

Hey, when you knock,

886
01:02:41,594 --> 01:02:45,074

888

Let me think about it first.

890
01:03:06,434 --> 01:03:07,704
Are you done fixing the wound?

891
01:03:08,974 --> 01:03:09,774
I’ll do it later.

892
01:03:10,434 --> 01:03:11,334
Why later?

893
01:03:11,934 --> 01:03:12,734
Do it now.

894
01:03:13,304 --> 01:03:16,554
- Come, let me…
- No need. I can do it myself.

895
01:03:17,034 --> 01:03:18,134
You can’t see it.

896
01:03:18,534 --> 01:03:19,334
Let me do it for you.

897
01:03:20,504 --> 01:03:21,534
You can’t even reach it.

898
01:03:41,934 --> 01:03:42,734
Does it hurt?

899
01:03:46,034 --> 01:03:46,834
No.

900
01:03:57,194 --> 01:04:01,634
I’m sorry for saying that you’re a drug addict.

901
01:04:03,504 --> 01:04:04,704
[Jom: Are you a drug addict?]

902
01:04:07,304 --> 01:04:08,104
Are you?

903
01:04:09,574 --> 01:04:10,834
Answer me, Yo.

904
01:04:12,134 --> 01:04:13,934
I shouldn’t have agreed with Uncle Komet…

905
01:04:14,774 --> 01:04:16,534
and let you stay here.

906
01:04:18,274 --> 01:04:19,074
That’s it.

907
01:04:20,774 --> 01:04:21,734
I can do the rest myself.

908
01:04:24,104 --> 01:04:25,134
You can go now.

909
01:04:25,704 --> 01:04:26,974
Give me some time alone.

910
01:04:27,434 --> 01:04:28,114
Yo.

911
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:29,114
Get out.

912
01:04:32,104 --> 01:04:32,904
Yo.

913
01:04:33,934 --> 01:04:35,104
I’m really sorry.

914
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:42,104
Don’t bother apologizing for calling me a drug addict.

915
01:04:43,394 --> 01:04:45,234
Because I don’t care.

916
01:04:48,074 --> 01:04:49,734
I don’t want to stay here anyway.

917
01:04:50,574 --> 01:04:53,104
I only stay just to keep my promise with my dad.

918
01:04:56,704 --> 01:04:58,834
And don’t bother trying to be nice to me.

919
01:05:00,474 --> 01:05:02,134
Just leave me alone.

920
01:05:13,734 --> 01:05:14,534
But Yo,

921
01:05:15,574 --> 01:05:17,434
I don’t want Granny and those kids to feel awkward.

922
01:05:19,304 --> 01:05:20,134
I understand,

923
01:05:21,174 --> 01:05:22,274
if you’re still mad at me.

924
01:05:26,304 --> 01:05:30,914
But please know that I’m really sorry.

925
01:05:32,154 --> 01:05:33,674
I’m sorry.

926
01:05:35,234 --> 01:05:39,594
See? You didn’t say that because you feel sorry.

927
01:05:40,354 --> 01:05:43,994
You said it because you don’t want them to feel awkward.

928
01:05:46,104 --> 01:05:46,904
But that’s alright.

929
01:05:49,634 --> 01:05:51,074
If you really can’t stand it,

930
01:05:51,334 --> 01:05:53,634
just call my dad to pick me up right now.

931
01:05:56,874 --> 01:05:57,674
Yo!

What?

What are you doing, Sert?

936
01:06:12,374 --> 01:06:13,834
Why are you so surprise

937
01:06:13,974 --> 01:06:15,874
Chief doesn’t like it when we smoke.

938
01:06:16,174 --> 01:06:17,274
Do you also smoke?

939
01:06:17,434 --> 01:06:18,474
I’m bored.

940
01:06:18,934 --> 01:06:20,574
It’s just to kill time.

941
01:06:24,734 --> 01:06:26,274
Jom! Jom!

942
01:06:26,834 --> 01:06:27,834
Granny!

943
01:06:30,734 --> 01:06:33,304
I’m here. You’re safe now.

944
01:06:34,334 --> 01:06:35,734
Thank you, Tee.

945
01:06:39,334 --> 01:06:41,104
Who the hell is Tee?

946
01:06:41,634 --> 01:06:44,034
Todd, what’s Jom’s brother called?

947
01:06:44,574 --> 01:06:46,504
Is it Tee?

948
01:06:46,594 --> 01:06:50,314
Granny said all his siblings’ names begin with J.
