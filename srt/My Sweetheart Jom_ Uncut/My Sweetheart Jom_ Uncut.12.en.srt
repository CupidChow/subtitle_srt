Tee is my ex.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,360
You didn't do anything wrong.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,480
Don’t blame yourself.

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,440
It’s because he already knew…

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,720
about those filthy things you did just to win this auction.

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,920
Now, do you realise…

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,040
who would actually win this auction?

8
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,560
You do know there are thousands of sugarcane farms in Thailand, right?

9
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,280
But why do you think I chose to come to Pho Chai?

10
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:20,680
Yo : Jom.

11
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,880
There might even be someone who’s ten times better than Tee, 

12
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:23,920
but I still don’t care.

13
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,200
Don’t be scared, my puppy.

14
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,920
Poon : But you must promise me that,

15
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,520
you’ll never hurt her.

16
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:30,840
Poon : Fine.

17
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,040
I’ll bring her to you.

18
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,600
I know you’re really mad at me right now.

19
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,520
But can we please talk for a second?

20
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,280
Uncle Poon.

21
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,240
Please get the car ready. I want to go home now.

22
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,160
Yes, Miss.

23
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,560
From what I’ve seen, Joi’s farm is the most suitable one.

24
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,760
I agree. But before you’d decide, I also want you to have a look… 

25
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,760
at a few more farms first.

26
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:52,960
Jom

27
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,680
Have Yo told you that he came to see me last night?

28
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,960
He didn’t say anything. Why did he want to see you?

29
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,960
He told me to leave you alone.

30
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,760
So, you two are a couple now, huh?

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,800
Yes.

32
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,080
I’m asking because when you introduced him as your boyfriend,

33
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,240
I thought you did that to keep your distance from me.

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,360
I have no reason to do that.

35
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,840
I might have thought too highly of myself.

36
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,560
Jom.

37
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,800
Is there a chance that we can get back together?

38
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,760
No.

39
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,040
Tee.

40
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,320
If you had come back earlier...

41
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,560
when I still didn’t have anyone, I might have given you another chance.

42
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,640
But right now, I already have Yo.

43
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,840
And I don’t want to hurt him.

44
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,120
Because I know...

45
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,560
what it feels like to be betrayed…

46
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,400
by someone you love.

47
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,120
I think I should go wait in the car.

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,960
I know you’re upset right now.

67
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,600
But can you please listen to me first?

68
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,600
No! Back off!

69
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,800
I don’t want to talk to you.

70
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,240
Earn, please listen to me.

71
00:03:59,240 --> 00:03:59,880
No!

72
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,160
Uncle Poon! Uncle Poon!

00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,160
- Are you around? 
 - Earn, please listen.

74
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,400
Uncle Poon, please get the car ready.

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,400
-I want to go home now. 
- Yes, Miss.

00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,720
Earn.

77
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,280
Hi, Yo.

78
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,280
I’ve been thinking of you.

79
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,280
Jom.

80
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,880
I came to see Earn.

81
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,880
And I happened to hear her driver…

82
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,120
talking on the phone.

83
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,320
He seems suspicious.

84
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,000
Like something is off.

85
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,400
Are you sure?

86
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,680
Yes.

87
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,560
He said someone might want to do something to her.

88
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,800
This must be about Aunt Nart.

89
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,400
What should I do then?

90
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,920
Should I tell her now?

91
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,400
Yes, I’ll be right over.

92
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,400
Okay!

93
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,400
Tee.

94
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,040
I can’t go with you now.

95
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,280
Yo is having a problem.

96
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,840
I have to help him.

97
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,200
Wait, Jom.

98
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,920
Jom!

99
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,800
Jom!

100
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,800
Shh! I have something important to tell you.

101
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,080
What’s wrong with you?

102
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,120
I don’t want to talk to you.

103
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,720
Just…listen to me first.

104
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,600
No!

105
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,440
Let’s go, Uncle Poon!

106
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,240
Hey! What are you doing?

107
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,320
Get out!

108
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,080
What are you trying to do, brat?

109
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,400
Get out of the car right now!

110
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,040
Earn, please come with me.

111
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,120
What the heck?

112
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,840
It’s you who should get out.

113
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,440
Can’t you believe me just for once?

114
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,080
Are you going to get out or not?

115
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,080
Let’s go together.

116
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,120
If you don’t get off,

117
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,320
I won’t too.

118
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,480
Fine, you want it like that?

119
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,680
Uncle Poon.

120
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,640
Please drive somewhere far away.

121
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,520
I really want know…

122
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,920
if you’ll be able to find your way back to Pho Chai.

123
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,080
Are you sure, Miss?

124
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,360
Please do as I said.

125
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,200
Quickly, Uncle Poon. Just drive!

126
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,320
Yes, Miss.

127
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:34,200
Uncle Poon, why are we taking a bypass?

128
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,840
Well, didn’t you tell me to drive somewhere far off?

129
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,920
Oh, I forgot.

130
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,480
[Jom, I’m with Earn now. We’re on a bypass.]

131
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,000
[Tell Earn her driver looks suspicious and that she should call her mother.]

132
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,400
Whoa, Earn!

133
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,520
Have you seen this new series by Fay and May?

134
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,480
It’s going to be aired next week.

135
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,640
It’s really fun.

136
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,800
What’s wrong with you?

137
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,560
- Look! 
 - Leave me alone!

138
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,640
It’s a new series. It’ll be aired next week.

141
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,920
Ah, next week?

142
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,160
Yeah.

143
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,880
Ou..ouch! My stomach hurts!

144
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,960
- I have a stomachache. 
 - You have a stomachache?

145
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,080
Yeah.

146
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,440
Are you going to deliver a baby?

147
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,480
I need a loo!

148
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,120
A loo?

149
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,920
Uncle Poon!

150
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,680
Uncle Poon!

151
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,280
Please stop at the gas station.

152
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,560
I need to go to the loo.

153
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,440
She can’t hold it anymore.

154
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,240
But there isn’t any gas station around here, Miss.

155
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,640
there isn’t any gas station around here.

156
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,680
Temple.

157
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,040
A temple then.

158
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,400
- A temple will also do. 
 - Yeah.

159
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,560
I really can’t hold it any longer, Uncle Poon.

160
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,280
I need to go the loo right now! That’s the temple!

161
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,200
Turn left ahead.

162
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,400
- Over there! 
 - Right there.

163
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,720
Should we ask him for help?

164
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,440
Go on.

165
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,080
Excuse me?

166
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,880
Yes? What is it?

167
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,000
Run!

168
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,200
Where are you going?

169
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,880
Why are you doing this, Uncle Poon?

170
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,160
I really don’t have a choice, Miss.

171
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,960
They’ve kidnapped my grandchild.

172
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,480
If I don’t do as they say,

173
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,040
they’ll kill my grandchild.

174
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,160
Who told you to speak?

175
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,880
Get them in the car.

176
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,920
No! Let me go!

177
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,360
Don’t touch her!

178
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,520
Or what?

179
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,200
A gun?

180
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,200
Go! 

181
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,160
Get in the car!

182
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,720
Help!

183
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,480
Shut up!

184
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,480
Shut up!

185
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,040
Yes, Inspector?

186
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,080
What did you say?

187
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,480
Can he remember anything…

188
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,600
like the colour or brand of that car?

189
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,480
Okay.

190
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,240
I’ll be right there.

191
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,840
Why are you kidnapping us?

192
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,920
We don’t have anything for you.

193
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,280
- Please let us go. I want to see my mum.
- Shut up!

194
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,120
Or I’ll fucking shoot you.

195
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:24,040
Do you know who his parents are? If they find out you do this to their son,

196
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,480
you’ll be so dead!

197
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,320
I don’t give a fuck!

198
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,320
Please don’t!

199
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,720
Please calm down.

200
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,240
Just tell me whatever you want.

201
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,440
You shut the fuck up.

202
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,960
You’ll know soon what it is that we want.

203
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,360
Earn: I want to go home.

204
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,480
Hey.

205
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,840
Someone’s following us.

206
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,080
Jom!

207
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,200
- Jom? 
 - Who the fuck?

208
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,040
No! Don’t!

209
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,040
Did you fucking do this, huh?!

210
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,720
Don’t!

211
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,280
Fuck it!

212
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,840
- Don’t! 
 - Don’t shoot!

213
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,480
No! Jom!

214
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,760
Help us, Jom!

[Gunshot]

216
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,120
He’s got a gun but he’s not shooting at us.

217
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,320
He’s afraid these two might get hurt.

218
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,080
That’s our luck then.

219
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,720
Let’s get him!

220
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,360
Find something to hold on to.

221
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,240
Okay!

222
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,000
Yo! 

223
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,720
Yo!

224
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,960
Jom!

225
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,800
Yo!

226
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,640
Yo! Are you okay?

227
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:41,960
Yo!

228
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:48,960
Yo! Yo! Yo!

229
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,600
Geez, Chai. Why aren’t you picking up?

230
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,640
Hello, Mr. Paisarn.

231
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,040
Hello.

232
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,000
What’s the matter?

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,760
We suspect that you might be involved in the kidnapping case.

234
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,480
So, we’d like to ask you to come with us to the police station. 

235
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,680
Sergeant.

236
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,080
Please.

237
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,080
Let’s go.

238
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,400
[Next Break]
There she is.

239
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,000
The patient is asking for you, Miss.

240
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,320
Is Earn…

241
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,240
the girl you have a crush on?
