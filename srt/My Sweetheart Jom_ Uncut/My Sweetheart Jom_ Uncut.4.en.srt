00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:24,260
You idiot.

186
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:28,500
Have you ever asked him if he likes you too?

187
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,200
Jom, please tell this guy…

188
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,200
that you and I…

189
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,700
like each other! Huh?

190
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,980
Awww.

191
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,930
Stop imagine things.

192
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,000
Earn, are you okay?

193
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,330
No, I’m not.

194
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,700
Whatever.

195
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,360
Oh, Earn!

196
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,460
- My dear.
- Mum.

197
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:16,960
Hello.

198
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:17,960
Hello, Chief.

199
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,760
Hello.

200
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:22,260
Did my daughter cause you any trouble again?

201
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,500
Hey, I didn’t do anything, Mum.

202
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,460
I don’t know too. I’ve just arrived here.

203
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,200
What’s going on then?

204
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:37,930
Thank you so much.

205
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,900
We’re lucky,

206
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,600
the real culprit has been caught on CCTV camera.

207
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,760
You’re also lucky,

208
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,160
this time.

209
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,900
Next time, no matter how small it is, you have to let me know,

210
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:52,860
okay?

211
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,400
Thank you for saving my daughter, Yo.

212
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,800
He actually made the situation worse.

213
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,660
It wouldn’t have been such a mess

214
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:07,130
if he had stayed out of it.

215
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,560
Earn!

216
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,500
Have you thanked him yet?

217
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:13,900
It’s all right.

218
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,060
It doesn’t matter at all.

219
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,660
See, Mum?

220
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,160
He said it’s nothing.

221
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,860
Thank you, Jom.

222
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:41,530
All this is settled because Jom has cleared it up for us, isn’t it?

223
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,860
Anyway, are you free today?

224
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,900
Mum and I are going for lunch.

225
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,660
Please join us.

226
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,180
Please.

227
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,980
That’s right. Come join us, Jom.

228
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:04,160
Think of it as a favour returned for saving Earn.

229
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,730
I’m afraid I can’t go today.

230
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,700
I still have to go to Klong Lan to check on the council work.

231
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,820
Maybe some other time then, Earn.

232
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,460
I really have work to do.

233
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,760
You’re always working.

234
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,180
Come on, Earn.

235
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:27,380
He’s a village chief. He has to take care of everyone in this town.

236
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,200
Don’t worry,

237
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,460
I understand.

238
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,530
We can talk about it after the bidding is done.

239
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,500
Thank you.

240
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,930
Please excuse us then.

241
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,700
Goodbye.

242
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:41,860
Drive safely.

243
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,100
Bye bye, Earn.

244
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,730
Do we have to go Klong Lan next?

245
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,700
No,

246
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,960
I just said that as an excuse to refuse Aunt Anongnart.

247
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,600
Are you not okay with her?

248
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,420
Actually, I am.

249
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,220
Aunt Anongnart is not a bad person.

250
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,020
She’s quite nice.

251
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,780
But the problem is…

252
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:18,100
She’s the main contractor of our province.

253
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,300
Also, there are many biddings arranged by the municipality.

254
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,020
If anyone sees me having a meal with her,

255
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,260
it might not turn out well since I’m a village chief.

256
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:33,900
I thought you were afraid to be her son-in-law prospect.

257
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
She seems to like you a lot.

258
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,560
Why? Are you jealous?

259
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,100
What do you mean?

260
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,930
It’s Earn.

261
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,260
Don’t you like her?

262
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:54,360
Me?

263
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,600
Who would like that kind of girl?

264
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,530
Isn’t it you?

265
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,400
You like her, don’t you?

266
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,930
Come on, admit it.

267
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,600
Be a man and admit that you like her.

268
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:10,530
No.

269
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,400
Earn and I are close.

270
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,360
I’ve known her since she was little.

271
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,330
We’re like siblings.

272
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,780
Siblings?

273
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,900
[Phone buzzing]

274
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,100
Yes, Granny?

275
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,730
We’re going back soon.

276
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:28,960
What?

277
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,800
Fire? Where?

278
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,130
[Next Break]
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen!

279
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,200
Men, men, men, men, men… (Echoing)

280
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:41,600
Are you ready to meet our Pho Chai’s sweetheart singer?

281
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:44,340
No, no, no, no, no…

286
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:25,950
Chief. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.

287
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:26,830
It’s all right, Auntie.

288
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:32,270
You trusted me to look after our cooperative.

289
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:35,830
But I failed to take good care of it.

290
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,430
Please don’t worry, Auntie. You don’t have to apologize.

291
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:41,910
What’s done is done. Let’s rebuild it together.

292
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:45,830
So, how did the fire start?

293
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:47,430
I had no clue.

294
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,860
I was preparing refreshments…

295
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,830
for the man who came from Bangkok.

296
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,430
When I came out, the fire had already started.

297
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:58,460
The man from Bangkok?

298
00:17:58,890 --> 00:17:59,690
Yes.

299
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:01,630
Where is he now?

300
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:05,860
Oh, your Grandma Chan.

301
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,290
Granny told him to come here?

302
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:09,330
Yes.

303
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:13,490
That man from Bangkok wanted to see our cooperative.

304
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,030
So, your grandma told him to come here.

305
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:20,030
I'll call her first

306
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:21,390
I’ll take care of it.

307
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:22,730
Thank you, Auntie.

308
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,590
Thank you, Chief.

309
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:25,950
Get some rest.

310
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:26,790
Yes.

311
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,390
What’s going on?

312
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,470
I’m just wondering…

313
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,950
why a tourist came to visit here.

314
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,510
And it was when I was away too.

315
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:55,790
Jom!

316
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,330
Jom. Jom.

00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:58,270
Jom.

318
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:58,910
What is it?

319
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,830
[Panting]

320
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:03,530
Granny.

321
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:05,130
Granny what?

322
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,490
Granny is now at Uncle Yod’s house.

323
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:11,290
What a coward!

324
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,860
Wait until I find out who you are.

325
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,460
-  Granny.
- How could he do this?

326
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:17,630
Granny!

327
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,060
What happened?

328
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,090
What?

329
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,860
How’s the cooperative?

330
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,430
It’s almost burnt down but no one got hurt.

331
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:24,690
What are you doing here?

332
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,690
To see that man. Yod!

333
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:29,630
What the hell?

334
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,030
Why,

335
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,660
are you all swarming around here?

336
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,390
Why else, you bastard.

337
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:38,990
You had someone burn down the cooperative, didn’t you?

338
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:40,990
Don’t you know…

339
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:44,290
that it’s the source of income of our community?

340
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,510
Why the hell did you do it?!

341
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:50,990
Hey, watch your mouth, you old hag.

342
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,470
Why would I do that?

343
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:56,910
Jom, your crone is so old she’s gone nuts.

344
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,070
Just take her home.

345
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:00,150
Don’t let her come to talk rubbish here.

346
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:03,910
So what? I might be old but I can still kick that foul mouth of yours.

347
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,350
Do you wanna try?

348
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:08,390
You better watch your mouth.

349
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,470
How could you say that to him?

350
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,870
He’s our village chief.

351
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:15,750
Address him with some respect.

352
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:18,630
So what? When I was a village chief here,

353
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,550
did you ever show me any respect?

354
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,590
Never. You treated me like a dog.

355
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:23,690
Hey, Jom.

356
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,130
I don’t know anything

357
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,860
about the fire at the cooperative.

358
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,460
I suggest you…

359
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:31,530
to get her home

360
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,060
or else I might teach her a lesson.

361
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:34,330
Let’s go.

362
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,950
I knew you’d deny it.

363
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:41,030
Why don’t you ask,

364
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:42,690
this man then?

365
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:43,930
Hey!

366
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,190
Bring him in.

367
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,750
Move, you bastard!

368
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,390
Here.

369
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:49,990
Ouch!!

370
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,550
Damn you!

371
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,090
Do you think I’m too old and getting confused?

372
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:54,290
Here.

373
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,730
Look at him.

374
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,130
He pretended to be a tourist.

375
00:20:58,990 --> 00:20:59,860
Son of a bitch, pretending to be a tourist.

376
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,230
It’s you who burnt down the cooperative.

377
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:03,730
Acting panic and blending in with the crowd.

378
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,490
Luckily, I noticed something fishy.

379
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:06,790
So?

380
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,260
What does it have to do with me?

381
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,630
Do you have any proof that he’s my guy?

382
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,390
You want proof?

383
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,990
Fine. Come here!

384
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:16,990
Go on, Granny.

385
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:17,590
What are you doing?

386
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,710
[Hitting on the chest]

387
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,830
Stay still. Don’t’ move.

388
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,830
- Don’t move
- You’re hurting me.

389
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,670
Give me back my phone!

390
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:28,310
- Stay still
- Shut up!

391
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,390
Turn your face to me.

392
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:31,710
Hold him down.

393
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:43,550
Does it work?

394
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,750
Oh, hey!!

395
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,890
Boss, help me! They’re going to beat me up.

396
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,350
It’s me who’s going to beat you up.

397
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:53,230
I’ve never met you before, you moron.

398
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:54,190
Boss!

399
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:57,550
Who the hell are you? Get lost.

400
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,990
Just get lost!

401
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:01,750
Hey!

402
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,150
It’s private property. You can’t go in.

403
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,130
It’s okay. Let him go.

404
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:09,030
The evidence found at the crime scene…

405
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,890
is already much enough to prove that…

406
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:13,030
he ordered that man to do it.

407
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:14,590
So?

408
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:15,490
So?

409
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:16,860
Are you dumbfounded now?

410
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:18,130
Huh?

411
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:22,830
Uncle,

412
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,130
aren’t you going to say something?

413
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:25,590
They’re giving you a chance to deny it.

414
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,630
- Serve you right!
- Ha!

415
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:30,910
I know.

416
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:31,790
Sorry

417
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:41,590
You all are bastards, You hired that man to burn down the cooperative.

418
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,490
And frame me for doing it!

419
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,490
Wow, pure evil.

420
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,930
Yes, pure evil.

421
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:53,060
Just wait until the cops are here. Let’s see if you will still deny it.

422
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:53,690
That’s right!

423
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:54,950
Go on and call the cops.

424
00:22:55,070 --> 00:23:00,750
I also want to know who hired that son of a bitch to do it.

425
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,590
Uncle Yod,

426
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:06,490
let’s just talk and settle it nicely.

427
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:11,860
You know too well I have all the evidence and witnesses.

428
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:16,730
If you insist you’re not the one who ordered him to do it,

429
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:18,660
and that you’re innocent

430
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,460
just hand him over to us.

431
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:21,230
Yeah.

432
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:21,930
- Yeah.
- Hand him over.

433
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:22,530
Just hand him over!

434
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:23,690
Just hand him over!

435
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:25,630
Stop talking nonsense.

436
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,530
Fine then.

437
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:30,460
If you want him,

438
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:32,510
go and get him yourself.

439
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:38,690
I’m going to go get that bastard.

440
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:39,860
Calm down, Granny.

441
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:44,060
If we go in, we’d be trespassing his property.

442
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:47,190
I see you also know the laws well.

443
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:49,550
So, now you know…

444
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:52,660
anyone who dares trespassing my property…

445
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:56,430
I can shoot them dead like killing flies without having to go to jail.

446
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,910
Damn it!

447
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,430
It’s because you’re like this.

448
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,310
That’s why he still dares to act so arrogant.

449
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:10,550
Jeez!

450
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,630
But you heard him.

451
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,390
If we trespass his property,

452
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,490
he can press charges on us.

453
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,630
So what? Who cares if we trespass?

454
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,190
I’m getting angrier the more I talk about it.

455
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:21,290
Damn it, Chief. Why are you like this?

456
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:24,290
What if Uncle Yod really mean it about shooting the trespasser?

457
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,690
You and the kids would be in danger then.

458
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,530
Don’t worry, Granny.

459
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:32,860
I’m not going to let him,

460
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:35,090
get away and stay above the laws.

461
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:37,730
But we must have evidence and witness first.

462
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:39,930
Also, you know that

463
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:42,030
if we don’t have enough proof that he did it…

464
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,790
he might have the cops,

465
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,830
turn the right into wrong since he’s close with them.

466
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:49,510
He’s such an arrogant bastard.

467
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,230
Who the hell would be able to take him down?

468
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,270
How about this?

469
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:54,870
Why don’t you sit here and calm yourself down first?

470
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:58,110
I’ll bring you some water and sweet snacks, okay?

471
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:00,150
I’m pissed.

472
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,230
I’ll be back.

473
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,930
Talking about that bastard just pisses me off.

474
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:04,260
That son of a bitch.

475
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:09,230
What a bastard!

476
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:12,330
It really pisses me off! That damn guy.

477
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:13,460
Seriously.

478
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,330
So unfair!

479
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:16,950
Granny.

480
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:18,830
who’s that bloody Uncle Yod?

481
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:22,510
That bastard? He used to be a village chief here.

482
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:27,830
He was terrible. So arrogant and treated our people badly.

483
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,870
Everyone here was sick of him.

484
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:32,070
Jom couldn’t stand it anymore

485
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:35,710
so when the next election came, he decided to take parts too.

486
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:40,630
People voted for Jom instead of that bastard. So, it made him bitter.

487
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:44,670
He’s been holding grudges and staring to cause us trouble since then.

488
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:45,990
Talking about him just pisses me off again.

489
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,990
But why would he burn down the cooperative?

490
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,590
That’s his plan.

491
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:56,270
That bastard has to keep setting up troubles in our community,

492
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:58,350
so that people would think…

493
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:04,510
that our Jom isn’t capable enough and fails to look after people in this village.

494
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:06,870
- That son of a bitch. It’s his plan.
- Granny!

495
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,530
Please stop talking about him.

496
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:10,530
- Here, Granny.
- Why should I?

497
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:16,090
Well, haven’t you heard a saying about how you’d get old faster if you get angry easily?

498
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18,890
The angrier you get, the older you look.

499
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,290
Are you saying I’m old?

500
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:21,350
No.

501
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:24,190
Here, have something sweets. They are yummy.

502
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,390
Seriously, Chief. Are you going to let him

503
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,630
keep acting arrogant like that?

504
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,630
I was the one who started it. I asked her about Uncle Yod.

505
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:33,790
That’s good.

506
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:35,930
So that he would be careful.

507
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,590
Please don’t worry, Granny.

508
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:40,830
Of course, I have to.

509
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,690
If that Uncle Yod comes picking on us again,

510
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:43,890
we’ll give him the same taste.

511
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:44,550
There!

512
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,530
If he punches us,

513
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:47,390
we’ll punch him back.

514
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:48,230
You’ll do that?

515
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,060
If he kicks us,

516
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:50,830
I’ll kick him back twice.

517
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,390
Enough.

518
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:55,090
Have you forgotten why you’re here?

519
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,660
You’re here to finish school.

520
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,260
If you go picking a fight with anyone,

521
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:02,460
your parents would surely bite my head off.

522
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,790
Now that we talk about studying,

523
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:07,390
Alright

524
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:08,830
go changed into your uniform and show it to Granny.

525
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,490
Oh, that’s right.

526
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:11,890
That's a relief.

527
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,460
You went to get,

528
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,660
our student uniform, didn’t you?

529
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,230
Let me see how they look on you.

530
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,890
- Yes.
- Go on. Show me.

531
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,190
[Sigh]

532
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:31,030
[Drumming]

533
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:33,430
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen!

534
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,830
Men, men, men, men, men… (Echoing)

535
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:39,030
Now, it’s time you’ve been waiting for.

536
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:41,630
For, for, for, for, for…

537
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:44,230
Are you ready to mate?

538
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:45,790
Meet?

539
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,660
That’s correct.

540
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,390
[Laughing]

541
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:50,790
Are you ready to meet…

542
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:53,670
our Pho Chai’s sweetheart singer?

543
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:56,590
[Drumming]
No, no, no, no, no…

544
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,790
He said he’s ready.

545
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:00,350
Huh?

546
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:01,590
Forget it.

547
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:04,070
Please welcome our singer.

548
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:08,110
[Drumming]

549
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:14,670
[Laughing] Oh, that’s nice.

550
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:19,830
You look good in student uniform.

551
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:29,430
The uniform looks nice on you. Don’t you think so?

552
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:35,190
But I think something is a bit off here.

00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,860
Hmmm.

00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:48,750
- Weird
- Yeah.

556
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:05,590
I know why she said you look weird.

557
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:19,870
She said that because your hairstyle doesn’t go with the uniform.

558
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:21,550
You’ll look better after the haircut.

559
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,430
Or maybe weirder.

560
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,060
Don’t worry, Yo.

561
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:30,190

00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:49,610
So, he has moved to stay with his relatives here in Pho Chai.

735
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:53,810
Just so you know in case anyone is curious.

736
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:57,970
If you want to know more, just ask him yourself during lunch break.

737
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:01,890
You can sit over there.

738
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:07,650
Let’s begin our class

739
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:15,680
Guys, guys!

740
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:19,510
Should we ask him to join our gang?

741
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:23,310
For what?

742
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,510
Girls would,

743
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:27,750
only look at him then.

744
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:32,310
Try to consider his face before you say anything.

745
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:35,210
Are you bad-mouthing me, Ble?

746
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:41,680
Who said we want to take the newbie into our gang?

747
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:43,850
Fine,

748
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:45,850
didn’t say,

749
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,480
we have to do that.

750
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:51,010
I just think it’s our last year at school.

751
00:44:51,550 --> 00:44:53,210
If we have to go to the university in Bangkok,

752
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,480
then we’d have someone to take us around.

753
00:44:56,350 --> 00:44:58,210
How do you know he’d help us?

754
00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:03,710
Judging from his look,

755
00:45:05,350 --> 00:45:06,810
I think he’s quite something.

756
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:10,010
What do you think, Fluke?

757
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:25,610
One more thing, I’d like to ask for your cooperation in burning waste.

758
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:30,570
Please try to restrict the burning of paddy stubble or sugarcane field.

759
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:33,410
It’s a policy that the government would like to ask for your cooperation.

760
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:36,450
Well, well, well.

761
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:39,410
It’s easy for you to say, Chief.

762
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:44,930
Why didn’t you inform us there’s a meeting this morning?

763
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:48,610
Or do you not see me as someone in this village?

764
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:51,610
I’ve already told you since last month.

765
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:55,810
But I don’t think it should be a problem whether you’ll attend or not.

766
00:45:55,810 --> 00:45:59,610
Because no matter what I’ve informed you or told you to do,

767
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:02,250
you’ve never complied with it.

768
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:05,890
Well, that’s because we didn’t agree with it.

769
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:07,290
What to do then?

770
00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:10,350
About your restriction on burning waste,

771
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:11,850
what do you want us to do instead?

772
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:13,710
Bury it?

773
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:15,680
Where’s the machine then?

774
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:16,880
I don’t see any of it.

775
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:20,970
You just said that as if you don’t understand our problems at all.

776
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:27,970
I understand that we might not be able to fully comply with this policy from the government.

777
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:30,890
But I’d like you to try your best to cooperate.

778
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:34,050
Our biggest problem right now is PM2.5.

779
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:38,250
If we don’t try to fix it soon, our children might not have fresh air to breathe in the future.

780
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:46,480
I shouldn’t have wasted my time listening.

781
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:50,410
I thought your concern was about fire propagation.

782
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:54,450
But rather, it’s about that silly 2.5 dust.

783
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:57,690
If it were me,

784
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:00,850
I would have forbidden all burnings…

785
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:05,410
to prevent further fire accidents.

786
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:10,080
Look at what happened yesterday at the cooperative. The fire at the chicken coop.

787
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:11,450
You all heard about it, right?

788
00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:13,110
[Village people: Yes.]

789
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:15,210
I’ve been thinking about it.

790
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:21,610
Since the chicken coop at the co-op is our Pho Chai’s source of income,

791
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:29,170
I’m thinking of rebuilding a new coop for our village.

792
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,850
We’re all neighbours here, aren’t we?

793
00:47:33,110 --> 00:47:34,080

794
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:37,550

795
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:39,010

797
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:46,090
No need. It’s all right.

798
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:50,370
I’m doing this not because I want them to vote for me.

799
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:53,770
It’s because I care.

800
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:56,170
We all live in the same town of Pho Chai.

801
00:47:56,170 --> 00:47:58,050

802
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:00,370
Right?

803
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:06,690
Honestly, I wanted to tell that to you in person.

804
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:10,690
But come to think of it, I’d rather say it here…

805
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:13,290
so that everyone can be my witness.

806
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:17,290
That I’m doing this without hidden intention.

807
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:19,650
And that the Chief couldn’t accuse me later of doing this for getting more votes.

808
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:21,280
It’s nothing like that at all.

809

810

811

845
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:05,730
so much that my parents ordered me to quit it.

- Wait.

Why? He’s so happy I asked for his LINE ID, isn’t he

855

He said he used to be addicted to social media.

858
00:51:58,210 --> 00:52:00,530
So, his parents made him quit all of it.

859
00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:04,130
Did you tell him that I asked you to do it?

860
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:07,350
I did. I told him your name and also pointed out where you stood.

910
00:55:58,658 --> 00:55:59,488
Are you nuts?

911
00:55:59,928 --> 00:56:01,528
I just don’t want us to have problems.

912
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:03,428
We’re going to finish Grade 12 soon.

913
00:56:04,058 --> 00:56:05,328
What if we can’t graduate?

914
00:56:05,488 --> 00:56:06,658
Just shut up, Poe.

915
00:56:08,088 --> 00:56:09,688
Go buy me drinks as usual.

916
00:56:10,728 --> 00:56:11,728
Give me money then.

917
00:56:12,288 --> 00:56:13,728
You still haven’t paid me back last time.

918
00:56:16,058 --> 00:56:17,788
Pay for me first. I’ll pay you back later.

919
00:56:18,288 --> 00:56:19,688
Yeah, don’t be stingy.

920
00:56:20,928 --> 00:56:21,788
Okay, pal.

921
00:56:23,728 --> 00:56:24,528
Hey.

922
00:56:27,828 --> 00:56:29,028
That way, pal.

923
00:56:30,058 --> 00:56:31,468
Off you go.

924
00:56:32,488 --> 00:56:33,288
Off you go.

925
00:56:36,888 --> 00:56:37,688
Fluke,

926
00:56:38,588 --> 00:56:40,628
let’s squeeze some money out of that newbie.

927
00:56:41,588 --> 00:56:44,668
He seems rich.

928
00:57:11,988 --> 00:57:16,388
[They’re going to extort money from you. Go straight home after school.]

929
00:57:53,328 --> 00:57:54,128
What?

930
00:57:57,128 --> 00:57:59,388
You’ve got some guts earlier.

931
00:58:04,488 --> 00:58:05,928
You don’t know

932
00:58:07,188 --> 00:58:08,388
who we are, do you?

933
00:58:18,988 --> 00:58:20,258
He’s not afraid of me at all.

934
00:58:24,388 --> 00:58:26,628
You’re an idiot. Stay back.

935
00:58:28,858 --> 00:58:29,858
Let me handle it.

936
00:58:35,628 --> 00:58:39,658
I don’t care how cool you are in Bangkok.

937
00:58:42,528 --> 00:58:43,328
But here,

938
00:58:44,658 --> 00:58:45,728
I rule.

939
00:58:47,628 --> 00:58:48,428
So?

940
00:58:49,028 --> 00:58:50,588
Just get to the point.

941
00:58:51,328 --> 00:58:52,528
What do you want?

942
00:58:54,828 --> 00:58:57,628
We’re going to get some smoothie drinks after this.

943
00:58:58,588 --> 00:59:00,288
Maybe you should pay for us.

944
00:59:02,428 --> 00:59:03,428
Do you think it’s cool?

945
00:59:04,228 --> 00:59:05,288
What you’re doing,

946
00:59:05,688 --> 00:59:06,988
doesn’t make you look like a gangster.

947
00:59:07,688 --> 00:59:09,028
It’s like a “beggar”.

948
00:59:09,228 --> 00:59:10,028
Hey!

949
00:59:11,128 --> 00:59:12,188
Watch your mouth.

950
00:59:15,458 --> 00:59:16,548
Okay, bro.

951
00:59:26,128 --> 00:59:26,928
What the f***?

952
00:59:33,288 --> 00:59:34,688
You refuse to buy us drinks?

953
00:59:35,458 --> 00:59:37,388
Then I guess we have to beat you up instead.

954
00:59:43,188 --> 00:59:46,748
Aww, you carry a handkerchief, mister?

955
00:59:48,058 --> 00:59:50,548
Do you carry loose powder too?

956
00:59:52,028 --> 00:59:52,828
Give it back.

957
01:00:00,628 --> 01:00:01,468
Okay.

958
01:00:12,388 --> 01:00:13,228
Oops, I dropped it.

959
01:00:14,858 --> 01:00:16,288
Don’t worry, I’ll get it for you.

960
01:00:26,288 --> 01:00:27,488
Jeez, it’s dirty, man.

961
01:01:30,668 --> 01:01:33,588
Stop! Stop! What’s going on?

962
01:01:33,588 --> 01:01:34,308
Stop!!!

963
01:01:35,388 --> 01:01:36,068
Stop it, both of you!

964
01:01:36,068 --> 01:01:37,748
Stop! Stop!!!

965
01:01:37,748 --> 01:01:39,828
Stop!

966
01:01:39,828 --> 01:01:41,548
What’s going on?!

967
01:01:43,628 --> 01:01:47,548
1 2 3 4 5 … 6 7

968
01:01:56,388 --> 01:01:58,348
Granny, what are you doing?

969
01:01:58,988 --> 01:02:01,388
3 4.

970
01:02:01,428 --> 01:02:02,788
Granny! Granny!

971
01:02:02,788 --> 01:02:04,468
Oh, Chief, you’re here?

972
01:02:06,488 --> 01:02:07,488
Since when?

973
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:09,388
Just now, Granny.

974
01:02:09,728 --> 01:02:10,348
What?

975
01:02:10,588 --> 01:02:12,228
I just got here, Granny!!

976
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:13,588
-What? Can’t hear you!
- Granny!!

977
01:02:13,588 --> 01:02:14,428
What?

978
01:02:14,488 --> 01:02:16,748
Turn it down so we can talk!

979
01:02:16,748 --> 01:02:18,028
What? Can’t hear you!

980
01:02:18,328 --> 01:02:21,148
Turn it down so we can talk!

981
01:02:21,228 --> 01:02:23,288
Oh, okay. Hang on.

982
01:02:23,728 --> 01:02:25,188
Or just turn it off.

983
01:02:25,488 --> 01:02:26,858
What did you say?

984
01:02:28,928 --> 01:02:30,458
Now, that’s better.

985
01:02:30,928 --> 01:02:36,388
That damn Yod went to make a ruckus at the meeting this morning.

986
01:02:36,788 --> 01:02:38,028
I can’t believe it.

987
01:02:38,128 --> 01:02:39,258
What a bastard he is.

988
01:02:40,058 --> 01:02:42,428
Jeez, has he gone nuts or what?

989
01:02:42,858 --> 01:02:45,658
He sees black as white and right as wrong. What the heck?

990
01:02:46,128 --> 01:02:47,888
He’s so terrible just like,

991
01:02:48,258 --> 01:02:49,948
what you said, Chief.

992
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:55,868
That’s why I’m here dancing my anger off. That bastard!!

993
01:02:55,868 --> 01:02:56,948
Here you go.

994
01:02:56,948 --> 01:03:00,028
So tired.

995
01:03:00,268 --> 01:03:01,188
Careful, Granny.

996
01:03:06,088 --> 01:03:08,668
-Granny.
- I’m choking.

997
01:03:13,428 --> 01:03:15,328
So, what is it?

998
01:03:16,858 --> 01:03:17,728
He keeps causing troubles.

999
01:03:18,088 --> 01:03:19,858
That son of a bitch.

1000
01:03:20,488 --> 01:03:24,348
Anyway, have you visited Muan?

1001
01:03:24,868 --> 01:03:27,028
Didn’t that bastard say he would rebuild the chicken coop for her?

1002
01:03:28,228 --> 01:03:28,988
Is it done?

1003
01:03:29,858 --> 01:03:30,988
Not yet, Granny.

1004
01:03:32,658 --> 01:03:34,548
I came here right after the meeting.

1005
01:03:35,348 --> 01:03:38,628
But I’m worried Uncle Yod might offer something to Aunt Muan.

1006
01:03:40,058 --> 01:03:42,228
What do you mean?

1007
01:03:43,688 --> 01:03:48,668
Uncle Kla told me that our district will have a bidding for dam construction.

1008
01:03:49,188 --> 01:03:50,748
It will be built in our Pho Chai town.

1009
01:03:51,748 --> 01:03:55,748
If that’s the case, the value of Aunt Muan’s land will surely increase.

1010
01:03:56,828 --> 01:03:59,108
There! I knew it!

1011
01:03:59,108 --> 01:04:03,588
He had someone burn down the chicken coop because he wanted the land there.

1012
01:04:04,658 --> 01:04:07,588
Jeez, that asshole is such a sly.

1013
01:04:08,188 --> 01:04:11,588
So bloody horrible. I really want to slap him.

1014
01:04:11,828 --> 01:04:13,058
But I’m still not sure about it.

1015
01:04:13,628 --> 01:04:15,188
We might have to gather more information.

1016
01:04:15,588 --> 01:04:18,868
Damn him. What a horrid bastard he is!

1017
01:04:20,268 --> 01:04:21,828
Move, move!

1018
01:04:25,468 --> 01:04:26,468
Yes, Teacher Toei?

1019
01:04:28,088 --> 01:04:28,888
What?

1020
01:04:29,288 --> 01:04:30,528
Yotin got into a fight?

1021
01:04:31,228 --> 01:04:32,258
Okay, I’ll be right there.

1022
01:04:32,888 --> 01:04:33,388
Granny,

1023
01:04:33,388 --> 01:04:34,288
Now, what should we…

1024
01:04:34,488 --> 01:04:35,728
Yo got into a fight. I have to go now.

1025
01:04:35,828 --> 01:04:36,728
What? Yo!

1026
01:04:38,428 --> 01:04:41,028
Jeez, why are grown-ups so full of problems?

1027
01:04:41,228 --> 01:04:42,708
So troublesome.

1028
01:04:42,708 --> 01:04:46,468
If you see that bastard anywhere, come and tell me right away.

1029
01:04:55,188 --> 01:04:56,028
Hello, Teacher.

1030
01:04:56,588 --> 01:04:57,388
Hello.

1031
01:04:57,628 --> 01:04:59,288
Yotin, your guardian is here.

1032
01:05:02,728 --> 01:05:03,528
Yotin,

1033
01:05:03,988 --> 01:05:04,928
I don’t know

1034
01:05:05,228 --> 01:05:06,888
whether you or Tanawat started it first.

1035
01:05:07,058 --> 01:05:09,188
-Are you going to fire me? / - Yo!

1036
01:05:10,828 --> 01:05:11,628
Why?

1037
01:05:12,388 --> 01:05:14,128
I just want to know how you’ll punish me.

1038
01:05:14,828 --> 01:05:15,888
If you’re going to fire me,

1039
01:05:16,328 --> 01:05:17,458
I’ll just go home now.

1040
01:05:20,988 --> 01:05:23,888
A small fight doesn’t get you to resign from school.

1041
01:05:25,128 --> 01:05:26,658
Let’s say I’ll give you a chance this time.

1042
01:05:26,988 --> 01:05:28,988
I’m not going to send you to the Discipline Office yet.

1043
01:05:30,228 --> 01:05:32,028
But next time,

1044
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:34,188
please try to control yourself more.

1045
01:05:34,588 --> 01:05:35,388
Can you do that?

1046
01:05:39,928 --> 01:05:40,728
Yes.

1047
01:05:42,908 --> 01:05:43,988
I apologize for him, Teacher.

1048
01:05:45,088 --> 01:05:46,088
Take good care of him.

1049
01:05:46,528 --> 01:05:48,188
-I’m so sorry, Teacher.
- Okay.

1050
01:05:48,488 --> 01:05:49,288
Okay.

1051
01:05:49,988 --> 01:05:50,788
Take good care of him.

1052
01:06:08,458 --> 01:06:09,788
Don’t you have anything to say to me?

1053
01:06:10,888 --> 01:06:11,688
Just say it.

1054
01:06:15,488 --> 01:06:17,488
You probably don’t want to hear it.

1055
01:06:22,388 --> 01:06:23,428
You already promised me

1056
01:06:23,988 --> 01:06:25,288
and your parents, remember?

1057
01:06:25,728 --> 01:06:27,058
That you will not cause any trouble.

1058
01:06:31,028 --> 01:06:33,528
So, should I just stand there and let them bully me?

1059
01:06:38,458 --> 01:06:39,628
I’m not like you…

1060
01:06:40,548 --> 01:06:42,828
I can’t keep saying sorry just to end the problem.

1061
01:06:48,728 --> 01:06:49,528
Yo.

1062
01:06:50,928 --> 01:06:52,488
Yo, stop. Talk to me first.

1063
01:06:54,858 --> 01:06:55,658
Yo.

1064
01:06:57,828 --> 01:06:59,488
Yo! I don’t care

1065
01:07:00,828 --> 01:07:03,188
and I don’t know why you’re mad at me.

1066
01:07:03,658 --> 01:07:05,858
But I said all that out of good intentions.

1067
01:07:10,058 --> 01:07:11,028
Are you done?

1068
01:07:13,058 --> 01:07:14,458
Yo, where are you going?

1069
01:07:16,588 --> 01:07:17,388
Yo.

1070
01:07:18,258 --> 01:07:19,658
Be careful.

1071
01:07:21,928 --> 01:07:22,728
Yo.

1072
01:07:46,088 --> 01:07:47,088
My handkerchief?

1073
01:07:49,628 --> 01:07:50,988
Don’t do this again, Yo.

1074
01:07:51,088 --> 01:07:53,908
What if you fall… or if there’s a snake in there?

1075
01:07:54,658 --> 01:07:56,328
It’s just a handkerchief. You can throw it away.

1076
01:07:57,658 --> 01:07:58,458
No,

1077
01:07:59,388 --> 01:08:00,458
you gave it to me.

1078
01:08:01,788 --> 01:08:03,228
I should take good care of it.

1079
01:08:09,858 --> 01:08:10,658
Thank you.

1080
01:08:19,588 --> 01:08:20,988
I’ve said sorry to you so often

1081
01:08:21,928 --> 01:08:23,188
you’re probably sick of it.

1082
01:08:23,988 --> 01:08:25,128
So, thank you.

1083
01:08:31,788 --> 01:08:34,088
But I really feel thankful.

1084
01:08:36,788 --> 01:08:39,688
When you give something to someone and see that they cherish it,

1085
01:08:41,388 --> 01:08:42,188
it feels nice.

1086
01:08:47,188 --> 01:08:48,928
But next time, don’t give me anything.

1087
01:08:49,888 --> 01:08:51,128
I can’t bother looking after it.

1088
01:09:05,888 --> 01:09:06,688
[Next Episode]
What’s that sound?

1089
01:09:06,858 --> 01:09:07,868
Is it a gunshot?

1090
01:09:07,868 --> 01:09:09,508
[Yod: Move, Jom.]

1091
01:09:09,508 --> 01:09:10,468
[Jom: I can’t.]

1092
01:09:10,628 --> 01:09:13,858
I’m not going to let anyone take away the land of my people unfairly.

1093
01:09:14,328 --> 01:09:15,228
Do you want to try me?

1094
01:09:16,428 --> 01:09:19,348
If you dare, just do it.

1095
01:09:19,348 --> 01:09:20,108
Fine.

1096
01:09:20,628 --> 01:09:21,428
What?

1097
01:09:21,788 --> 01:09:23,728
Did that village chief butt in again?

1098
01:09:23,988 --> 01:09:25,228
Don’t do that again.

1099
01:09:25,388 --> 01:09:26,988
What if he shoots you,

1100
01:09:27,288 --> 01:09:28,088
for real?

1101
01:09:28,728 --> 01:09:29,828
Are you worried about me?

1102
01:09:30,188 --> 01:09:31,058
Of course.

1103
01:09:35,388 --> 01:09:37,188
Speaking of the devil.

1104
01:09:37,428 --> 01:09:38,788
We were just talking about him.

1105
01:09:39,328 --> 01:09:40,428
What the…?!

1106
01:09:41,728 --> 01:09:42,888
Let’s be friends.
