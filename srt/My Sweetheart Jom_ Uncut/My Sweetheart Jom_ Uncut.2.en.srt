1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,130
When will you stop causing trouble, Yo?

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,860
I’m going to send you to stay at ‘Pho Chai’.

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:08,860
Dad, Yo is on his way to Bangkok

4
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:09,730
That rascal.

5
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:10,620
How about this?

6
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,100
You can come with me and get off at the junction.

7
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,380
That’s great. Thanks a lot.

8
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,060
Let’s…

9
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,130
Tell me honestly,

10
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,940
what have you done?

11
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,200
You look like someone,

12
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,140
who’s running away from trouble.

13
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,860
It’s my parents. They want me to stay here with Chief Jom.

14
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:27,530
Dad!

15
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,300
Mum!

16
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,160
Who are you?

17
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,760
I’m sorry for my late introduction.

18
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,200
I’m Jomkwan.

19
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,560
I’m the village chief here.

20
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:35,200
Why didn’t you tell me earlier that you’re Chief Jom?

21
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,500
Don’t unpack all your things.

22
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,580
I don’t think you’d be here long.

23
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,660
Wow, is this the newest model?

24
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:14,900
Now, what?

25
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,140
What do you mean? Just put it back.

26
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:48,660
[🎵If I weren’t that cool or such a badass🎵]

27
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:52,060
[🎵My life would’ve been so plain and simple]🎵]

28
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,300
[🎵But since I’m so cool and such an ass kicker]🎵]

29
00:01:55,300 --> 00:02:00,340
[🎵I have to flee before danger’d come knocking on my door]🎵]

30
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,620
[🎵Running away to find myself even more restless]🎵]

31
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,900
[🎵Because I’ve met someone who keeps making my heart fluttering]🎵]

32
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,180
[🎵What to do now? I can’t stop how I feel anymore]🎵]

33
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,540
[🎵I’m so thrilled whenever I’m near you🎵]

34
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,900
[🎵Lying to the whole world is so easy🎵]

35
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:28,180
[🎵But lying to yourself is such a pity🎵]

36
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:34,820
[🎵So stubborn I never trust anyone but my own heart🎵]

37
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,300
[🎵You’re the right one for me🎵]

38
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,500
[🎵My heart knows better than anyone🎵]

39
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:48,100
[🎵It’s beating so fast when you’re near, and feels uneasy when we’re apart🎵]

40
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:55,020
[🎵I don’t care what they’d say, I just want the world to know🎵]

41
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:59,700
[🎵That you’re my sweetheart🎵]
[My Sweetheart Jom]

42
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,300
Hi, I’m Todd.

43
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,500
I’m Toey.

44
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,360
And I’m Oat.

45
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,400
Are you Yo, bro?

46
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,200
Oat.

47
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,660
He’s older than you,

48
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:19,900
almost 20 now.

49
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,500
Address him with some respect.

50
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,060
I thought it’d make us become friends faster.

51
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,860
I told guys to introduce yourself to him.
Not frighten him.

52
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,740
[Sigh]

53
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,000
Fine. Hello, Yo.

54
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,260
He was sleeping so we didn’t want to wake him up.

55
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,400
We just hung around by the bed.

56
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,000
And suddenly he woke up.

57
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,930
And got startled.

58
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,760
Hey! Are you saying it was my fault?

59
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:55,360
Don’t you have hands?
Why didn’t you just knock first?

60
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,660
Quit it, both of you.

61
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,420
Just apologize to him.

62
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,460
And go help Granny make breakfast. Quickly.

63
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,980
- I’m sorry.
- I’m sorry.

64
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,800
Jeez! You rascals.

65
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,700
Who are those kids?

66
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,460
Your housemates.

67
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,860
Housemates? What do you mean?

68
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:36,660
Their parents have gone to work abroad for a while.

69
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,700
So, they left these kids in Granny’s care.

70
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:39,980
That’s all.

71
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,900
You mean…I have to live with those imps?

72
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,020
Mhm.

73
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,260
Those kids might be a bit mischievous.

74
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:49,960
But they never misbehave.

75
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,760
You’ll probably get closer to them than I do.

76
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,130
You better go freshen up, Then come down for breakfast.

77
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,460
They are all tasty.

78
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,860
Delicious!

79
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,580
Here you go

80
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,140
- Oh, good.
- The pork neck is so good.

81
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,960
Hmm

82
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,820
Here.

83
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:26,300
We don’t have pizza here. Only something like this.

84
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,360
Can you eat it?

85
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,200
Sure, Granny.

86
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,400
Then try this.

87
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,600
It’s our special menu.

88
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,400
Try it.

89
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,730
What is it?

90
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,900
Just try it.

91
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,130
It’s really good.

92
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,860
What’s this dish called?

93
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,360
This one?

94
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,260
It’s Spicy Minced Meat Salad.

95
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,960
Minced meat salad?

96
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:13,900
Yes.

97
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,160
Is it…

98
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:19,260
a secret recipe passed on from your ancestors?

99
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,260
No, not like that, We just use lizards to make it.

100
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,560
A lizard?

101
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,500
Yes.

102
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,420
Hey.

103
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,260
[Laughter]

104
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,980
Jeez! You imp.

105
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,130
Don’t tell me you did that to get closer to him

106
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,700
Don’t ever do that again, okay?

107
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,200
Go check on him, Chief. Where did he go?

108
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:48,960
Yes, Granny.

109
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,760
Go on.

110
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,700
Why are you like this?

111
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,600
Why are you so stubborn?

112
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:54,730
Why are you so stubborn?

113
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,160
Why?

114
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,100
[Spitting]

115
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,500
[Breathing]

116
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,660
Are you okay?

117
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,600
I just want to tell you that the minced meat is not lizard.

118
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,300
It’s catfish.

119
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,620
[Sigh]

120
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,860
I’m sorry for what they did.

121
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:20,560
Where are you going?

122
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,100
I’m going to tell them that I’m not their friend.

123
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,900
If you’re going to do anything to them,

124
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:29,960
just take it out on me.

125
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,330
I’m their guardian.

126
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,200
If those kids have done anything wrong,

127
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,160
it’s probably because I haven’t taught them well enough.

128
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,100
So, it’s all my fault.

129
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,000
It’s because you’re like this.

130
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,530
Those kids are so spoiled.

131
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,760
I know.

132
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,330
They might have gone a bit too far.

133
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,900
I already gave them a warning.

134
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,780
And I promise…

135
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,260
that they’ll never pull those pranks on you again.

136
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,620
[Sigh]

137
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,330
Ouch!

138
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,000
What the heck?

139
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,700
[Sigh]

140
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,900
[Sigh]

141
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,100
It was a misunderstanding. Don’t be so mad at me.

142
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,580
Mix.

143
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,700
Damn it!

144
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,860
Why is she still in my head?

145
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:43,260
[Panting]

146
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,200
The connection sucks.

147
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,860
What a bloody remote area.

148
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,730
Will he be able to live with us, Jom?

149
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,530
Why did you say that? What’s the matter?

150
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,500
I don’t know. He looks a little jumpy.

151
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,060
It doesn’t seem like he’d be able to make it here.

152
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,380
Oat, do you still remember what I told you?

153
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,900
That you shouldn’t judge a book by its cover.

154
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,820
He probably needs some time to adjust.

155
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:51,140
What we should do is helping him to get used to living here.

156
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,860
Got it?

157
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,000
Yes.

158
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,060
Good.

159
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,860
You can go to bed. I’ll take care of it.

160
00:10:59,100 --> 00:10:59,900
Okay.

161
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Did you get hurt?

162
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:41,730
Are you all right?

163
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:43,960
No.

164
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:48,200
So… Why are you still awake?

165
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:50,530
Do you need anything?

166
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,530
I need a WIFI password.

167
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,860
I just turned it off.

168
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,000
Can you wait until tomorrow?

169
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,400
Just turn it back on.

170
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:01,900
So easy.

171
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:03,660
So?

172
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,160
What’s the password?

173
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,930
I’m in the middle of a movie.

174
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,460
It’s late.

175
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:10,960
You should go to bed.

176
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,300
Are you saving the electricity cost?

177
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,930
Shouldn’t that be included in the payment my dad gave to you?

178
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,060
A payment?

179
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,560
Yes.

180
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,100
That envelope is quite big.

181
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,200
Probably lots of ten grand in there.

182
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,820
Oh, or is it not enough?

183
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,930
I can give you more.

184
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,560
Hurry up and turn it on.

185
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,700

What’s the WIFI name?

00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,960
Why can’t I find it?

189
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:44,530
Have you turned it on?

190
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,860
Is this the envelope you were talking about?

I give you my words that when Yo finishes Grade 12 here,

196
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,940
I’ll send him to study in the US.

197

But right now, I’m worried that…
he might have caused you troubles here.

He doesn’t seem that troublesome to me.

That’s because we’re still here.

I’m not that worried about the politician’s son.

It’s our agreement.

Uncle Komet said you must strictly follow it while you’re here.

And don’t ever cause them any trouble.

231
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,500
You caused me trouble by asking me to turn on the router

he never asks anyone to fix it for him.

00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,260
Can you tell me now,

368
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,060
why you’re taking me to the market?

369
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,560
I’m telling you,

370
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,590
I’m here to study.

371
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,520
Not to be a butler

372
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,520
for anyone.

373
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,190
I’m taking you to buy school uniforms.

374
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,820
The school is going to open soon.

375
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,160
We should be prepared.

376
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,960
Can’t we just go some other days?

377
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,620
I’m tired.

378
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,820
And I don’t want to go anywhere with you.

379
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:36,320
Do you know which way to go to Bangkok?

380
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,060
Bangkok?

381
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:38,990
Yes

382
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:41,460
You have to get a bus at the terminal in the city center.

383
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,760
You should be able to make it in time if you go now.

384
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,990
What are you doing?

385
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,460
Making a U-turn.

386
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,120
Didn’t you say you wanted to go on some other day?

387
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,590
Well,

388
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,260
let’s just do it today.

389
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,120
Didn’t you say we should be,

390
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,860
prepared beforehand?

391
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,160
- Let’s go!
- Hmm.

392
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:04,990
Okay.

393
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,620
Are you sure you’re not going to change your mind?

394
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,220
Fine.

395
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,020
Let’s go.

396
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,440
So nice.

397
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,440
Let’s go.

398
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,440
After the uniform fitting,

399
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,480
I’ll take you to have a look at your school.

400
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,520
No need.

401
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,320
I don’t want to.

402
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:16,120
Why not? So that you won’t get nervous on your first day.

403
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,120
I’d rather go to the bus terminal.

404
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,420
I want to go back to Bangkok.

405
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,660
Okay.

406
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:33,590
Let’s get off.

407
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,460
When you said you wanted to go back to Bangkok,

408
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,420
did you really mean it?

409
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,060
Yes.

410
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:48,600
Didn’t you tell me not to unpack?

411
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:50,260
Because I might not stay here long.

412
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:51,590
So,

413
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,320
I’m trying to prove you right…

414
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,060
that I really can’t stay here.

415
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:56,660
You’d better forget it.

416
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,320
How much do you want?

417
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,420
What do you mean?

418
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,920
If you let me go back to Bangkok,

419
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:12,420
I’ll pay you twice the amount my dad gave you.

420
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,320
You’re unbelievable.

421
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:25,760
Triple then! If double is not enough,
I’ll give you triple.

422
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,120
Triple.

423
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:31,390
Do you know how much Uncle Komet paid me for taking care of you?

424
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,520
50,000.

425
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,160
What’s the triple of 50,000?

426
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,660
150,000.

427
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,260
You barely finish high school.

428
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,560
Where would you get that much money from?

429
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,520
I might not have it.

430
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,660
But my friends do.

431
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,920
Also,

432
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,160
you don’t have to know,

433
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,120
where I get the money from.

434
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,460
As long as I can pay you,

435
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,390
isn’t that enough?

436
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,920
What will you do,

437
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,390
once you go back to Bangkok?

438
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,720
I’ll stay with my friends.

439
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,820
You just have to tell my parents

440
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,160
that I’m still here.

441
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:24,620
Just think about it.

442
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,460
Where else could you get this much,

443
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:28,920
amount of money from…

444
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,720
if not from me?

445
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,960
Have you heard anything about Sack?

446
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,720
No.

447
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,320
I’ve looked up so many pages

448
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,520
but couldn’t find any.

449
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,520
Wow.

450
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,120
This means Yo’s dad,

451
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,520
is quite something.

452
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,160
He can make the media keep slient.

453
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:57,560
Isn’t that good?
I’m afraid it’s actually Sack who told the media to keep silent.

454
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,440
What? Really?

455
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,120
Why would he do that?

456
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,920
He probably doesn’t want anyone to know whom he’s having a problem with.

457
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,160
Most people would’ve blamed it on him.

458
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,640
It’s better to keep it silent.

459
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,240
And get revenge secretly.

460
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:14,440
You’re right. That makes sense.

461
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,520
Let’s see if Fah can get anything from Mix.

462
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:18,820
Okay.

463
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,620
Guys!

464
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,790
- What’s wrong?
- What happened?

465
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,660
Nothing. I just want to make it look exciting.

466
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,660
Jeez.

467
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,990
I thought something happened.

468
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,560
I thought you saw Sack.

469
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,560
How's it?

470
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,320
Did you get anything from

471
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,520
spying on the idol at her faculty?

472
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:42,660
Nothing at all.

473
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,680
She just disappears.

474
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,620
I won't find her in her friend's group

475
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,480
Hey, Bank.

476
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,220
Hey!

477
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,020
There you are

478
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:56,560
Someone’s looking for you.

479
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,520
Find me? Who is it?

480
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:00,190
I don’t know too.

481
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,790
But looks like he’s ready to fight you.

482
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,190
Who’s it?

483
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,360
Shoot!!!

484
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,790
What the heck, Toy?

485
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,060
Why do we have to run?

486
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,220
Because you’re Yo’s friend.

487
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,920
How did he know we’re his friends?

488
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,990
Jeez, that’s a piece of cake.

489
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:44,620
All he has to do is check on Yo’s IG and he’d know.

490
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,200
Are they still after us?

491
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,160
Phew, they’re gone.

Wait there. I’ll be right back.

00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,390
I’m asking you where you’re going.

497
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,080
This is your principal’s resort.

498
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,000
We happen to pass by on our way home.

499
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,960
So, I’ll go inform him that you decided not to study here.

500
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,260
Will you take long?

501
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,660

do you really think you’ll be safe in Bangkok?

Although you said that guy, Sack, doesn’t know where your friends live.

But with social media these days, it’s so easy to find out.

507
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,390
Are you afraid you won’t get the money I promise you?

508
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:45,560
Don’t worry. Once I’m in Bangkok,

509
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,480
I’ll ask my friend to wire you the money.

510
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:49,720
I’m not worried about that.

If you bail,

512
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,620
I can just call your parents.

00:40:20,669 --> 00:40:22,009
Are you still in shock?

552
00:40:26,109 --> 00:40:26,889
No.

553
00:40:28,529 --> 00:40:29,889
Just a bit dizzy (from car sickness).

554

[Chan’s coughing]

555
00:40:34,969 --> 00:40:36,769
What took you so long?

556
00:40:38,009 --> 00:40:39,569
Where have you been all day?

557
00:40:39,869 --> 00:40:41,809
Where are the school uniforms?

558
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:45,809
So?

559
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:47,309
We didn’t get them.

560
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:49,089
Why not?

561
00:40:49,509 --> 00:40:51,669
Something urgent came up.

562
00:40:52,839 --> 00:40:53,639
What happened?

563
00:40:56,009 --> 00:40:56,809
Tell me.

564
00:40:59,909 --> 00:41:03,909
How dare they come threatening my people right under my nose.

565
00:41:04,569 --> 00:41:05,369
Yes.

566
00:41:06,209 --> 00:41:07,009
Wow.

567
00:41:14,609 --> 00:41:15,569
Are you sure…

568
00:41:16,569 --> 00:41:18,169
that those two are Sack’s minions?

569
00:41:18,769 --> 00:41:22,039
Of course, I heard them say it with my own ears.

570
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:27,439
Hey, if you want to be alive,

571
00:41:27,869 --> 00:41:29,289
just keep quiet.

572
00:41:29,289 --> 00:41:30,849
Call Sack.

573
00:41:30,909 --> 00:41:31,849
Tell him we got the guy.

574
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:32,969
Okay.

575
00:41:33,609 --> 00:41:34,709
This is too much.

576
00:41:35,169 --> 00:41:37,089
I’m going to…Those scumbags!!

577
00:41:37,089 --> 00:41:37,649
Granny!

578
00:41:38,009 --> 00:41:38,669
Where are you going?

579
00:41:38,969 --> 00:41:41,089
They are right at my doorstep.

580
00:41:41,089 --> 00:41:42,849
How dare they. Right under my nose!

581
00:41:42,849 --> 00:41:44,969
I must go prepare our men. Get the soldiers and guns ready.

582
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:47,329
So that we can retaliate when they’re here.

583
00:41:47,529 --> 00:41:48,439
We have to defend ourselves.

584
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:49,609
Granny, wait.

585
00:41:49,709 --> 00:41:51,249
Jeez, what is it?!

586
00:41:51,669 --> 00:41:52,469
No need to do that.

587
00:41:53,369 --> 00:41:55,709
No one followed us on our way back here.

588
00:41:56,509 --> 00:41:58,209
They probably don’t know where we live.

589
00:41:58,369 --> 00:42:00,039
But we should be cautious, Chief.

590
00:42:00,649 --> 00:42:01,169
Granny.

591
00:42:01,409 --> 00:42:03,969
Oh, jeez. Just get off me.

592
00:42:04,169 --> 00:42:04,969
Fine, how about this?

593
00:42:07,509 --> 00:42:09,329
I’ll go see Headman Kla.

594
00:42:09,809 --> 00:42:12,689
And tell him to watch out for those guys.

595
00:42:13,209 --> 00:42:15,009
We can’t just stay here and do nothing.

596
00:42:15,289 --> 00:42:17,049
It’s such an insult.

597
00:42:22,369 --> 00:42:24,169
I told you not to tell Granny.

598
00:42:24,669 --> 00:42:26,169
I don’t want to make it a big deal.

599
00:42:28,809 --> 00:42:30,169
Even if we don’t tell her,

600
00:42:30,869 --> 00:42:32,209
we all know each other here.

601
00:42:32,569 --> 00:42:34,439
People keep talking, you know?

602
00:42:37,809 --> 00:42:39,109
If Granny found out from someone else,

603
00:42:40,209 --> 00:42:41,709
she’d probably get more furious.

604
00:42:45,409 --> 00:42:47,639
Why didn’t you tell her about me trying to go back to Bangkok then?

605
00:42:48,669 --> 00:42:50,209
I want you to think about it again.

606
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:53,169
Despite being out here,

607
00:42:54,109 --> 00:42:56,109
Sack can still track you down and send his guys to hurt you.

608
00:42:57,609 --> 00:42:59,469
If you go stay with your friend in Bangkok,

609
00:43:00,169 --> 00:43:00,969
do you really think…

610
00:43:01,609 --> 00:43:03,409
you’ll be able to get away from him?

611
00:43:03,969 --> 00:43:05,769
Maybe you won’t be so lucky like this time.

612
00:43:11,569 --> 00:43:12,769
But if you insist on going back,

613
00:43:13,639 --> 00:43:14,439
then so be it.

615

616

What is it?

617
00:43:24,669 --> 00:43:26,209
Not so loud or Granny will hear us.

618
00:43:26,909 --> 00:43:27,709

00:43:28,909 --> 00:43:30,609
Bee’s dad is going to press charges to Oat.

620
00:43:31,669 --> 00:43:32,839
What did he do?

621
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:36,169
He punched Bee until he bled.

622
00:43:36,449 --> 00:43:40,329
And now Bee’s dad is going to take him to the police station

623
00:43:41,729 --> 00:43:43,129
Hurry up and go help him.

624
00:43:43,769 --> 00:43:45,039
You wait here. Let’s go!

625

626
00:43:48,489 --> 00:43:49,849
Apologize to him right now.

627
00:43:49,849 --> 00:43:50,369
No!

628
00:43:50,609 --> 00:43:52,769
Tell your son to apologize to me first!

629
00:43:53,069 --> 00:43:55,249
Are you challenging me?

630
00:43:55,569 --> 00:43:57,449
You think you’re that good, huh?

631
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:58,669
Don’t do it, Bee.

632
00:44:00,669 --> 00:44:01,469
Stop!

633
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:03,039
Stop, Oat!

634
00:44:04,369 --> 00:44:05,369
It’s good you’re here, Chief.

635
00:44:05,869 --> 00:44:07,609
Look what this scumbag,

636
00:44:07,769 --> 00:44:08,809
did to my son.

637
00:44:11,439 --> 00:44:12,709
Why did you punch him, Oat?

638
00:44:12,969 --> 00:44:14,329
Why would you ask him, Chief?

639
00:44:14,329 --> 00:44:17,129
You know so well how troublesome he is.

640
00:44:17,609 --> 00:44:20,169
I didn’t start it. He made fun of me first.

641
00:44:20,169 --> 00:44:22,129
He called me an orphan.

642
00:44:22,809 --> 00:44:23,609
Is it true, Bee?

643
00:44:23,609 --> 00:44:24,489
No.

644
00:44:24,669 --> 00:44:25,569
Tell him then.

645
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:26,649
It’s true.

646
00:44:26,649 --> 00:44:27,729
I was also there.

647
00:44:28,049 --> 00:44:29,889
saw Bee made fun of Oat first.

648
00:44:31,809 --> 00:44:33,689
Hey, say something then.

649
00:44:33,689 --> 00:44:34,929
Are you afraid to admit it?

650
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:37,369
Well, you’re really an orphan.

651
00:44:37,469 --> 00:44:38,889
Oat! Stop!

652
00:44:42,169 --> 00:44:42,889
See that?

653
00:44:44,169 --> 00:44:45,569
They both did something wrong.

654
00:44:46,889 --> 00:44:48,969
Let’s just say it’s a small conflict and have it settled here.

655
00:44:49,369 --> 00:44:51,969
What? How can you say that, Chief?

656
00:44:51,969 --> 00:44:55,129
I admit that my son was wrong to call Oat like that,

657
00:44:55,409 --> 00:44:58,009
but he shouldn’t have punched him until he’s bleeding.

658
00:44:58,009 --> 00:44:59,369
It’s unacceptable.

659
00:45:00,069 --> 00:45:01,769
So, Oat must apologize to my son first.

660
00:45:02,709 --> 00:45:03,669
Otherwise, I won’t let it settle here.

661
00:45:04,069 --> 00:45:06,109
No! It’s him who has to apologize first.

662
00:45:06,269 --> 00:45:07,069
No, you first.

663
00:45:07,209 --> 00:45:08,009
No, you.

664
00:45:08,009 --> 00:45:08,809
You.

665
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:10,609
Enough! Stop it, both of you!

666
00:45:22,969 --> 00:45:24,469
I apologize for what he did then.

667
00:45:26,209 --> 00:45:27,839
He’s under my care.

668
00:45:28,609 --> 00:45:30,639
So, if he does something wrong, I’m wrong too.

669
00:45:31,509 --> 00:45:34,669
Can we please have it settled and not take it any further?

670
00:45:40,709 --> 00:45:41,449
Fine.

671
00:45:41,969 --> 00:45:43,729
It’s because you’re the one asking, Chief.

672

675
00:45:54,909 --> 00:45:56,609
Why did you apologize to them?

676
00:45:56,809 --> 00:45:57,909
Aren’t you the village chief?

677
00:45:58,069 --> 00:45:59,769
Why couldn’t you order them to apologize to us?

678
00:46:00,269 --> 00:46:01,409
It was their fault.

679
00:46:03,239 --> 00:46:04,729
Oat, listen to me first.

680
00:46:04,729 --> 00:46:05,329
Oat!

681
00:46:06,249 --> 00:46:07,249
Go check on your friend.

Oat!

684
00:46:29,269 --> 00:46:31,909
I thought you said their parents are working abroad.

Only Toey’s and Todd’s.

686
00:46:37,639 --> 00:46:40,729
Oat has been left under Granny’s care since when he was very little.

687
00:46:42,909 --> 00:46:46,209
That’s why I said you’re so lucky.

688
00:46:47,289 --> 00:46:51,049
There are many kids who don’t even know what their parents look like.

689

That’s why I want you to talk to your parents nicely.

Uncle and Auntie really love you.

691
00:47:05,109 --> 00:47:06,809
I don’t want you to feel sorry later.

692
00:47:07,709 --> 00:47:09,069
But I can still feel sorry, right?

693
00:47:10,269 --> 00:47:11,769
Do you know how terrible it felt…

694
00:47:12,169 --> 00:47:14,409
when my parents had to bow down and apologize to someone else…

695
00:47:14,769 --> 00:47:16,209
while I didn’t do anything wrong?

696
00:47:20,069 --> 00:47:22,469
Are you saying your parents made you feel humiliated?

697
00:47:23,309 --> 00:47:24,009
Yes!

698
00:47:24,449 --> 00:47:28,889
Since we didn’t do anything wrong, we should at least stand tall for our dignity.

699
00:47:29,569 --> 00:47:31,039
Do you really think they wanted to do that?

700
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:37,289
You said it’s a shame to apologize to someone.

701
00:47:38,569 --> 00:47:41,929
But your parents had to do it on your behalf when they didn’t even do anything wrong.

702
00:47:42,569 --> 00:47:43,729
Why would they do that?

703
00:47:47,069 --> 00:47:50,669
It’s because they love you more than their own dignity.

704
00:47:54,509 --> 00:47:57,469
So, let me know if you want to go back to Bangkok.

705

Why would they do that?

709

It’s because they love you more than their own dignity.

710
00:49:01,009 --> 00:49:02,369
since you came here alone.

Where are you guys going

720

We’re looking for Oat.

No.

What happened?

Oat and Jom have a big quarrel.

725

Do they often quarrel?

726
00:49:51,384 --> 00:49:54,744
Not at all. I’ve never seen Oat getting this mad before.

727

If Granny or Jom come looking for him, please don’t say anything.

00:50:06,054 --> 00:50:07,124
It’s just around here.

733
00:50:07,724 --> 00:50:08,944
Hey, wait.

734
00:50:08,944 --> 00:50:10,944
Let me go too. I can help look for him.

735
00:50:11,424 --> 00:50:13,984
It’s okay. You might get bitten by a snake. The path is quite overgrown.

736

739
00:50:22,384 --> 00:50:23,384

What the heck do you mean by that?

745
00:51:27,624 --> 00:51:29,864
Before you leave, can I ask you something?

746
00:51:30,544 --> 00:51:32,744
Why did you manage to crack only his mouth?

747
00:51:33,584 --> 00:51:34,384
Why are you asking?

748
00:51:34,724 --> 00:51:38,054
If it were me, I would’ve done more than that.

749
00:51:39,784 --> 00:51:42,284
Yeah, he really deserves much worse!

750
00:51:42,684 --> 00:51:43,224
Right?

751
00:51:43,464 --> 00:51:44,064
Yes!

752
00:51:44,654 --> 00:51:45,854
You did good.

753
00:51:46,784 --> 00:51:47,584
Come, my bro.

754
00:51:49,884 --> 00:51:53,704
And the Chief, he even apologized to those two.

755
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:56,504
Why the hell would he do that?

756
00:51:56,704 --> 00:51:57,384
Right?

757

Yeah!

758
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:02,464
Jom is a village chief. How could he give in so easily like that?

759
00:52:02,854 --> 00:52:03,454
Exactly!!

760
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:05,824
Who would follow his order after this?

761
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:07,704
Exactly!!

762
00:52:08,104 --> 00:52:09,024
What order?

763
00:52:10,424 --> 00:52:12,254
It’s not a village chief’s duty to give an order to anyone…

764
00:52:13,254 --> 00:52:16,684
if that order cannot bring peace or happiness to people in the village.

765
00:52:17,684 --> 00:52:20,784
Why would you be a village chief then?

766
00:52:24,324 --> 00:52:25,704
The village chief doesn’t have the right…

767
00:52:26,024 --> 00:52:28,864
to use his power to boss anyone around as he likes.

768
00:52:29,344 --> 00:52:31,104
That’s what a mafia does.

769
00:52:33,124 --> 00:52:34,864
A good village chief must be fair and upright.

As your guardian, it’s my responsibility to apologize to them.

772
00:52:41,904 --> 00:52:45,544
Apologizing after you’ve done something wrong is not a shame at all.

773
00:52:45,824 --> 00:52:49,104
Not apologizing after you did something wrong is rather a disgrace.

01:05:42,624 --> 01:05:45,704
Granny Prik’s mango trees bear a lot of fruits.

917
01:05:45,704 --> 01:05:47,304
So, we want you to help pick them.

918
01:05:47,724 --> 01:05:51,084
Jeez, Todd. You’re not fun at all.

919
01:05:52,184 --> 01:05:53,224
Come on. I’m ready!

920
01:05:53,654 --> 01:05:54,454
Go on.

921
01:05:54,724 --> 01:05:55,524
Go on.

922
01:05:56,524 --> 01:05:57,624
That one there.

923
01:05:58,654 --> 01:05:59,664
This one?

924
01:05:59,664 --> 01:06:00,504
-Yes.
-Yes.

925
01:06:05,124 --> 01:06:06,484
Yes, that’s it.

926
01:06:07,184 --> 01:06:09,384
Yeah, that one.

927
01:06:10,184 --> 01:06:12,224
Jeez, it’s quite tough.
- No, to the right.

928
01:06:12,784 --> 01:06:13,524
Which way?

929
01:06:13,524 --> 01:06:14,524
Right.
- Over there.

930
01:06:14,854 --> 01:06:16,524
- That one?
- Yes.

931
01:06:17,424 --> 01:06:18,984
Pull it.

932
01:06:19,454 --> 01:06:20,254
That’s right.

933
01:06:23,904 --> 01:06:24,784
Cool.

934
01:06:34,724 --> 01:06:35,824
Shit!!!

935
01:06:37,124 --> 01:06:38,524
Let’s go!!!

936
01:06:46,624 --> 01:06:48,064
Shit!!

937
01:06:48,064 --> 01:06:50,184
[Screaming]

938
01:06:50,924 --> 01:06:51,724
They’re here!!

939
01:06:52,304 --> 01:06:56,224
[Screaming]

940
01:06:56,224 --> 01:06:57,544
[Screaming]

941
01:06:58,104 --> 01:06:59,984
[Screaming]

942
01:07:00,544 --> 01:07:03,984
[Screaming]

943
01:07:08,064 --> 01:07:12,744
[Screaming]

944
01:07:14,224 --> 01:07:15,024
What happened?

945
01:07:15,224 --> 01:07:16,344
Everyone, jump!

946
01:07:20,224 --> 01:07:20,864
Hey!

947
01:07:22,144 --> 01:07:22,904
Jump!

948
01:07:24,824 --> 01:07:25,924
Come on, jump.

949
01:07:26,884 --> 01:07:27,684
Quickly.

950
01:07:36,124 --> 01:07:38,084
Don’t move.

951
01:07:39,084 --> 01:07:40,384
Don’t move.

952
01:07:46,724 --> 01:07:48,324
Ouch! That hurts!

953
01:07:49,224 --> 01:07:51,084
Stay still then.

954
01:07:56,124 --> 01:07:56,924
Almost there.

955
01:07:58,784 --> 01:08:02,064
- I said don’t move.
- I can’t.

956
01:08:02,224 --> 01:08:04,504
It stings, doesn’t it?

957
01:08:04,504 --> 01:08:05,664
So?

958
01:08:05,984 --> 01:08:07,104
Have you learnt your lesson now?

959
01:08:07,104 --> 01:08:08,384
Serve you right.

960
01:08:08,724 --> 01:08:11,344
You shouldn’t have taken what’s not yours without permission.

961
01:08:11,344 --> 01:08:14,704
This is what they call ‘karma’.

962
01:08:15,224 --> 01:08:16,284
Jeez, Granny.

963
01:08:16,884 --> 01:08:18,884
It already hurts getting stung by the bees.

964
01:08:19,084 --> 01:08:20,724
Why would you come and add more salt to our wound?

965
01:08:20,924 --> 01:08:21,864
You rascal.

966
01:08:21,864 --> 01:08:24,304
You want some more then? A bump on your head too, maybe?

967
01:08:24,654 --> 01:08:26,784
I kept telling you all those things…

968
01:08:26,984 --> 01:08:28,584
because I want you to be mindful.

969
01:08:28,784 --> 01:08:30,084
And you. You’re older than them.

970
01:08:30,624 --> 01:08:32,824
Why didn’t you try to stop them, Todd?

971
01:08:33,124 --> 01:08:34,254
Why didn’t you do anything?

972
01:08:35,324 --> 01:08:38,584
But Granny Prik said we can go pick any fruits there whenever we want.

973
01:08:38,784 --> 01:08:41,424
So? Will you visit every house and pick their fruit whenever you want?

974
01:08:41,424 --> 01:08:44,544
Prik is kind. She sees you as her own children.

975
01:08:44,544 --> 01:08:47,504
It’s you who should be more considerate and have some manners.

976
01:08:47,504 --> 01:08:50,624
Taking someone else’s stuff is lack of manners. It’s stealing.

977
01:08:51,504 --> 01:08:52,344
Understood?

978
01:08:55,124 --> 01:08:59,424
Asking for permission also helps tell us of your action…
and your whereabout.

979
01:08:59,584 --> 01:09:02,944
What if any of you got drowned, who would have known then?

980
01:09:04,054 --> 01:09:04,854
Yes, sir.

981
01:09:07,454 --> 01:09:10,524
And who told you to jump into the water to avoid the bees?

982
01:09:13,324 --> 01:09:14,124
What should we do then

983
01:09:14,654 --> 01:09:16,384
Running back to Bangkok?

984
01:09:20,284 --> 01:09:23,024
We did good for nothing. And even get scolded too.

985
01:09:27,984 --> 01:09:32,654
Wait, Yo.
Don’t you want me to remove the stingers for you first?

986
01:09:33,654 --> 01:09:35,284
It’s all right. I’ll be fine.

987
01:09:38,054 --> 01:09:40,084
You guys, come over here.

988
01:09:40,824 --> 01:09:41,624
Tell me where else.

989
01:09:42,784 --> 01:09:44,184
Come here.

990
01:09:44,584 --> 01:09:45,864
Come here.

991
01:09:49,424 --> 01:09:50,384
Yotin: What do you mean?

992
01:09:50,624 --> 01:09:51,264
Jomkwan: What?

993
01:09:51,484 --> 01:09:52,254
Yotin: This.

994
01:09:52,254 --> 01:09:54,144
I don’t like it when you’re joking like that.

995
01:09:54,424 --> 01:09:55,884
I just want everyone to love each other.

996
01:09:56,384 --> 01:09:59,064
So? Did you think I confessed to you?

997
01:09:59,454 --> 01:10:00,824
Did you get stung too?

998
01:10:01,124 --> 01:10:01,924
Not by the bees.

999
01:10:02,184 --> 01:10:04,724
It was when those guys trying to hurt you.

1000
01:10:05,054 --> 01:10:06,124
Weren’t you afraid at all?

1001
01:10:06,454 --> 01:10:07,484
Wait, Yo.

1002
01:10:07,684 --> 01:10:09,484
Are you sure they’re Sack’s minions?

1003
01:10:09,924 --> 01:10:11,544
Yotin: Who are they then?

1004
01:10:11,824 --> 01:10:13,664
Stop using my parents as an excuse.

1005
01:10:15,254 --> 01:10:18,464
You know what? Knowing Sack wanting to kill me or beat me up…

1006
01:10:19,104 --> 01:10:21,384
doesn’t really scare me as much as someone seeing me as a fool.

1007
01:10:25,704 --> 01:10:26,704
Jom!
