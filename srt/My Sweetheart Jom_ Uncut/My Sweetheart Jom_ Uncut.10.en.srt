From now on, you can tell me if you need anything.

Should we go to Loy Kratong festival in Pho Chai this year?

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:08,650
Rose said everything is going as planned.

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,250
Yay!!

Yes?

00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,510
There’s a fire at Korn’s farm.

8
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,800
It’s spreading to Joi’s farm next door now.

9
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,890
Miss Kaew is still there collecting soil samples.

10
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:18,530
Kaew!

11
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,450
Jom!

12
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:20,190
I have to go help the others.

13
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,590
Jom, don’t go!

14
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,310
Jom!

15
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,800
You should’ve worried about yourself first.

16
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,030
What if you don’t wake up, what would I do?

17
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,930
See? I’m still warm, aren’t I?

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,130
I have something to tell you.

19
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,090
Let’s go home.

20
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,510
Listen to me first.

21
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:36,430
Don’t be stubborn.

22
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:37,670

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,600

Are you here to deliver vegetables to Granny?

00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,970
No, Miss Kaew. I’m here to fetch some clean clothes for Chief.

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,470
Hurry up!

72
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,170

00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,510
Is Joi here to get Jom his clothes?

77
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:58,650
Mhm, he’s going to sleep there.

78
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,250
So, he asked Joi to fetch him some clothes.

79
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,310
He’s afraid someone might sneak in to burn down his farm.

80
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,350
Like what they did to Korn’s farm.

81
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,430
It’s all gone. I don’t know what he’s so afraid of.

82
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,890
So, he’s going to sleep there.

83
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,950
Anyway,

84
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,530
why are you looking so shabby?

85
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:14,430
Ahh, you fell into the lotus pond, didn't you?

86
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,450
Go shower and get yourself clean.

87
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,350
I’ll make you something delicious.

88
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,970
Okay?

89
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,260
Yes.

90
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,160
Are you and Jom having a quarrel?

91
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,010
No.

92
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,130
That’s good.

93
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:40,090
I’m asking because Jom’s face looked so red when I saw him at the lotus pond.

94
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,950
I thought someone had upset him.

95
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,950
I’m relieved that you and him are not having a quarrel.

96
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,070
Go get your shower.

97
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,810
He was blushing?

98
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,710
Wait, you kissed him?

99
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,330
Yeah. I didn’t mean it though.

100
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,650
I mean, I just did it on impulse.

101
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,200
Can you tell me now who that guy is?

102
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,170
Well…

103
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,610
It’s Chief Jom. The one I came here to stay with.

104
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,770
What? That guy Fah said he looks like a Korean idol?

105
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,070
Yeah, that one.

106
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:35,770
So, how did it feel? Did it feel gross?

107
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,500
Not at all.

108
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,300
It felt so good.

109
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,470
After I kissed him,

110
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,470
he was blushing red.

111
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:58,550
He kept panting while talking. It’s so cute.

112
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,130
You’re down bad, dude.

113
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,170
What? Weren’t you the one who told me to do it?

114
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,570
I didn’t say it was wrong.

115
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,670
That’s good. If you’re sure about how you feel, just go for it.

116
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,450
So…what did he say?

117
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,370
We still haven’t talked about it.

118
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,200
What if he’s not okay with what you did?

119
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,530
Who’s that?

120
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,410
Yo.

121
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,090
What is it?

122
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,530
What are you doing here?

123
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,810
Hasn’t Granny told you?

124
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:33,370
I’m afraid someone might sneak in to burn down the farm.

125
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:34,730
I’m going to stay here to keep watch.

126
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,330
[Sigh]

127
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,310
Isn’t it because you’re avoiding me?

128
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,430
Since you’re here,

129
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,150
let’s talk.

130
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:58,190
I also want to know why you did that at the pond.

131
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,770
I like you.

132
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:15,860
Like me?

133
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,910
In what way?

134
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:20,660
I just kissed you like that.

135
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,170
Do you still have to ask how I like you?

136
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,710
Yo, don’t dodge the question.

137
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,350
Just be clear. In what way?

138
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,090
Okay, okay.

139
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,310
I like you as in…

140
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,370
I want you to be my boyfriend.

141
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,470
Can you be my boyfriend?

142
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,970
I thought you didn’t like me.

143
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,110
Since when have you started to like me? How?

144
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,550
I don’t know too.

145
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,330
I just know that I’ve already fallen for you.

146
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:08,990
I just…want to be near you.

147
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,690
I keep thinking about you.

148
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:15,060
And I don’t like it when someone’s trying hit on you.

149
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,260
I’ve never felt like this with anyone before.

150
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,130
I guess this might be…

151
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,110
No, Yo.

152
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:36,960
Don’t say that word.

153
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,310
[Sigh]

154
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,190

00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:45,530
Jom.

156
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,500
Wait.

157
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,600
What’s wrong?

158
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,870
Nothing. Just go home.

159
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,610
If you’re gone for too long, Granny might be suspicious.

160
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:09,210
No. I thought you said you wanted to talk.

161
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,530
I’ve already told you how I feel. Now, it’s your turn.

162
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,790
I don’t have anything to say.

163
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,500
Jom.

164
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,160
Jom.

165
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,630
[Sigh]

166
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,010
Please wait.

167
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:33,510
Please.

168
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:37,810
[Sigh]

169
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,830
I just want you to be sure about what you just said to me.

170
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,730
This thing that’s happening…

171
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,730
might just be because you’re lonely or confused or…

172
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,460
Or whatever.

173
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,670
But I want you to think hard about it.

174
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,860
Be sure before you say it.

175
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,800
I’m sure.

176
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,160
I’m sure how I feel about you.

177
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:10,770
That I like you.

178
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,560
Fine.

179
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,310
You might be sure.

180
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:22,450
But it’s still inappropriate.

181
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,310
How?

182
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,800
People might think I’m taking you in for that purpose.

183
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,730
I might not be your direct guardian.

184
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,330
But you’re still living in my house.

185
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:46,670
Also, you’ll go to study abroad after this.

186
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,350
You’ll get to meet more people. More new things.

187
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,360
You might change your mind then.

188
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,590
Does this mean…you don’t want me to change my mind?

189
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,230
That’s not what I mean.

190
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,660
What is it then?

191
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,450
If you don’t feel the same way, you can just tell me…

192
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:17,970
that you don’t like me. That’s it.

193
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,970
But you didn’t say it.

194
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,810
So, I’ll just take it…

195
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:30,310
that you also like me too.

196
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,300
You’re unbelievable.

197
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,700
Hey, don’t complain just yet.

198
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,370
I’ve only just started.

199
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,800
Start what?

200
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,470
Pursuing you.

201
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,750
Geez…

202
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,100
You!

203
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,300
Have you been listening to what I just said?

204
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,270
I have, but I don’t care.

205
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,560
Because I like you anyway.

206
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,170
Unlike you, I might be lousy at many things.

207
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,970
But going after someone who’s older than me…

208
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,330
I’m a pro on that.

209
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,560
Be ready to get a lot of love from me.

210
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,150
Wait, Yo.

211
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,610
I’ll leave you alone tonight.

212
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,350
Give you some time to prepare yourself.

213
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,650
But from tomorrow on…

214
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:46,750
You!

215
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:51,690
be prepared to get a bombard of love from me.

216
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,130
[Sigh]

217
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:45,815
[Alleviate suffering and promote well-being for all citizens]

218
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,650
[Sigh]

219
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:31,530
Hey.

220
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,760
Hey!!

221
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,900
Hey, what’s wrong, Chief?

222
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,810
Kaew?

223
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,190
- Yeah.
- Since when did you get here?

224
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,910
What’s wrong? You’ve been sighing all morning.

225
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,450
Is it a problem about the villagers?

226
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:52,960
No, not about them. It’s me.

227
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,760
Is it about what happened at the lotus pond yesterday?

228
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:00,530
Mhm.

229
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,130
Let me guess, it’s also about Yo, isn’t it?

230
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:10,330
Why? Is that kid hitting on you?

231
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,870
How do you know?

232
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:15,950
Did he talk to you about it?

233
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,150
There, I knew it.

234
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:21,230
That’s why you left in a hurry.

235
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:25,410
Why? What did he do to make you so frustrated like this?

236
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,460
Listen.

237
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,850
Can you stop being nosy for a second?

238
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:40,650
Are you going to tell me nicely…

239
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:44,230
…or are you going to let me imagine it?

240
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,190
I could be on cloud nine just by imagining it.

241
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,770
Well, he…

242
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,250
He said he likes me.

243
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,770
What?! Really?

244
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:03,190
Yeah.

245
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,230
Seriously?

246
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,610
Wow, wow, wow!

247
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,610
My BL heart is bursting with joy!

248
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:09,990
Wow, really?

249
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,460
Are you serious?

250
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,150
You’re overreacting.

251
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,490
Go back to your seat.

252
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,060
Sit.

253
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,550
What did he tell you?

254
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:22,230
Nothing. He just said he likes me.

255
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,850
Morning, Kaew.

256
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,510
Did you have a good dream last night?

257
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:32,030
Your face is glowing pink with happiness.

258
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,990
Hasn’t Jom told you?

259
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,430
I already confessed my feelings to him.

260
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,600
Yo.

261
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,250
Kaew, I’m really sorry…

262
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:46,790
for getting jealous of you and Jom.

263
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,750
Now I know you and Jom are just friends.

264
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:57,830
Can you give me a promise instead of an apology?

265
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:00,590
That you’ll never make him disappointed.

266
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,850
I promise you, with all my scout’s honours.

267
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:07,730
Good.

268
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:12,670
Stop it, you two. Get your hand off me. Hands off!

269
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,150
Are you two having fun?

270
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:21,870
If it weren’t because you’re helping the village people,

271
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,770
I would’ve slapped you already.

272
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,810
Helping them about what?

273
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,590
About the fire at the sugarcane farm.

274
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:34,630
Jom sees that the village people are still in fear.

275
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:37,770
He wants to use this opportunity to raise awareness against agricultural burning.

276
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,910
And encourage them to use bio-extracts instead.

277
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:44,770
I see. I’ll go prepare some lunchboxes then.

278
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,950
Wait.

279
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:49,170
Who said you can come with us?

280
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,990
I don’t care. I’m going anyway.

281
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,270
I already told you, remember?

282
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,760
From now on, I’m going to start pursuing you.

283
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,530
Wait.

284
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:24,300
Thank you.

285
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:25,930
Not my hand.

286
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,190
You can go now.

287
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,630
Aww, look at him being all smiley.

288
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:54,160
A younger boyfriend makes your heart pumping fast, doesn’t he?

289
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,600
Mhm.

290
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,570
Not a boyfriend.

291
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,550
He’ll be soon.

292
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,200
He’s falling head over heels for you.

293
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,400
Just go with the flow and let it be.

294
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,130
Be honest with your feelings.

295
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,490
You haven’t had anyone since you broke up with Tee.

296
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:17,190
Why don’t you try giving him a chance?

297
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:23,310
If you’re playing hard to get, you might lose your only chance to taste premium meat.

298
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:25,710
Don’t regret it later, my friend.

299
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:27,730
Kaew!

300
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,270
Embarrassed?

301
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,870
- No.
- A younger boyfriend is awesome.

302
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,810
- Awww.
- No, Never had one before.

303
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,590
I better get going. Bye Bye!

304
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:06,410

Welcome to Pho Chai’s annual fair!

305
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,970
My friend has just arrived.

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,100

Hi, everyone. Thank you for coming today.

312
00:22:34,475 --> 00:22:37,475
Before talking about our Pho Chai annual fair,

313
00:22:38,595 --> 00:22:42,635
I’d like to remind you again about the agricultural burning.

314
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:47,795
All of you might have heard about the fire incident at Korn’s and Joi’s farms recently.

315
00:22:48,315 --> 00:22:52,995
Fortunately, only some pieces of land were damaged this time.

316
00:22:52,995 --> 00:22:56,995
But if the rescue team couldn’t get there in time, we might have lost someone’s lives too.

317
00:22:57,875 --> 00:23:04,355
My friend has done a research on bio-extracts as a better solution for clearing the fields.

318
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:06,875
Please give it up for Miss Kaew.

319
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:09,875
[Applause]

320
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:13,235
Hello, I’m Kaew, a representative from TTK company.

321
00:23:13,235 --> 00:23:16,395
It’s a company that produces bio-extracts Chief Jom has mentioned earlier.

322
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,515
Today, I have good news for everyone.

323
00:23:18,515 --> 00:23:23,075
I have proposed to the company to use Pho Chai as a part of the research.

324
00:23:23,075 --> 00:23:27,555
This means my company will give out bio-extracts to all farmers here…

325
00:23:27,555 --> 00:23:30,035
so that they can use them on their farms.

326
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:31,915
And you won’t have to pay a penny for it!

327
00:23:38,635 --> 00:23:40,875
Ah…Miss Kaew.

328
00:23:41,355 --> 00:23:47,235
By that, do you mean everything is free?

329
00:23:48,035 --> 00:23:50,875
Yes, all free. You won’t even have to pay a penny for it.

330
00:23:51,475 --> 00:23:57,955
Wow, isn’t that amazing? Let’s hear it for Miss Kaew!

331
00:23:57,955 --> 00:23:59,475
Good

332
00:24:01,515 --> 00:24:06,075
Geez, what are you guys clapping for? So annoying.

333
00:24:07,835 --> 00:24:11,915
What about those workers who used to earn some money from agricultural burning?

334
00:24:13,915 --> 00:24:16,755
I don’t have any problem with your idea on bio-extracts.

335
00:24:17,435 --> 00:24:20,835
But gaining benefits on other people’s losses like this…

336
00:24:20,835 --> 00:24:25,435
Can you still call yourself a village chief?

337
00:24:25,435 --> 00:24:26,435
Right?

338
00:24:27,555 --> 00:24:33,195
So tell me, how are you going to compensate for the loss of income for those workers?

339
00:24:33,755 --> 00:24:39,035
Are you talking about the money you paid your workers to burn down Korn’s and Joi’s farms?

340
00:24:39,595 --> 00:24:42,555
Geez, this brat. Watch your mouth.

341
00:24:43,595 --> 00:24:45,955
I can sue you for defamation.

342
00:24:46,715 --> 00:24:48,075
Do you have proof?

343
00:24:49,435 --> 00:24:53,435
Damn you! How could you say that to him?

344
00:24:53,435 --> 00:24:56,155
If he doesn’t have proof, do you think he’d say it?

345
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,435
I can arrest you right here and now.

346
00:24:59,435 --> 00:25:01,235
But Chief Jom told me to wait…

347
00:25:01,235 --> 00:25:04,075
since it’s almost time for our annual fair.

348
00:25:04,435 --> 00:25:06,595
He doesn’t want to make a fuss before the event.

349
00:25:07,315 --> 00:25:09,515
But don’t you worry,

350
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:15,075
after the fair, I’m going to throw you into jail myself.

351
00:25:20,115 --> 00:25:21,035
Calm down, Uncle.

352
00:25:21,475 --> 00:25:22,635
Please leave.

353
00:25:22,635 --> 00:25:23,915
Let's go back

354
00:25:25,155 --> 00:25:26,955
We’re having a meeting about the annual fair.

355
00:25:28,035 --> 00:25:31,035
If you can’t be of any help, please leave.

356
00:25:31,035 --> 00:25:38,435
[Shooing sound]
Get out!

357
00:25:39,715 --> 00:25:43,835
I’m not afraid of you. Don’t bother ganging up on me.

358
00:25:45,275 --> 00:25:46,355
Just you wait.

359
00:25:47,235 --> 00:25:48,035
Get out!

360
00:25:48,155 --> 00:25:48,675
Please leave.

361
00:25:50,275 --> 00:25:51,915
Bye Bye!

362
00:25:51,915 --> 00:25:52,835
[Booing sound]

363
00:25:52,835 --> 00:25:54,595
Get out!

364
00:25:55,235 --> 00:25:56,955
Do you think they really have proof?

365
00:25:57,435 --> 00:26:00,275
Bullshit. They just wanted to scare us.

366
00:26:00,515 --> 00:26:02,355
Don’t be such a wimp.

367
00:26:02,635 --> 00:26:04,675
But are you sure?

368
00:26:05,235 --> 00:26:08,395
You know they are trying to find evidence to get us.

369
00:26:08,395 --> 00:26:12,075
If what they said is true, we’ll be so doomed.

370
00:26:13,355 --> 00:26:15,595
Then we have to act first.

371
00:26:19,355 --> 00:26:23,515
Jomkwan, just you wait.

372
00:26:24,275 --> 00:26:29,995
I’m going to turn a Loy Kratong festival into his funeral this year.

373
00:26:30,995 --> 00:26:32,675
Will there also be a funeral there?

374
00:26:33,755 --> 00:26:34,875
Look at that bird.

375
00:26:35,515 --> 00:26:38,555
It was a metaphor, you idiot!

376
00:26:39,635 --> 00:26:40,555
Let’s go, Uncle.

377
00:26:41,355 --> 00:26:42,635
Geez, got hit every day.

378
00:26:44,755 --> 00:26:47,395
All right then, let’s get back to our business.

379
00:26:47,395 --> 00:26:49,635
Regarding our annual fair this year,

380
00:26:49,635 --> 00:26:52,355
We’ll still arrange a merit making session as usual.

381
00:26:52,355 --> 00:26:55,555
For this year, I’d like everyone…

382
00:26:55,555 --> 00:27:00,755
to please inform me of the menu you’ll cook in order to avoid duplication.

383
00:27:00,755 --> 00:27:03,435
We’ll also get to have a variety of delicious food this way.

384
00:27:03,435 --> 00:27:05,835
[Cheering sound]

385
00:27:07,115 --> 00:27:10,915
In the afternoon, we’ll hold a Krayasart-making competition.

386
00:27:11,235 --> 00:27:14,355
And we’ll announce the result in the evening.

387
00:27:14,355 --> 00:27:18,035
At night, we’ll also hold a Noppamas Queen contest!

388
00:27:18,035 --> 00:27:20,115
[Cheering sound]

389
00:27:20,355 --> 00:27:23,115
But we’ll change some of the rules this year.

390
00:27:23,115 --> 00:27:25,275
Oh, hold it right there.

391
00:27:25,275 --> 00:27:28,635
Are you going to allow contestants to wear swimsuits this year?

392
00:27:29,235 --> 00:27:30,955
Will you wear them, Granny?

393
00:27:31,475 --> 00:27:32,955
Hey, look at my shape.

394
00:27:34,635 --> 00:27:36,515
Please don’t. The whole village might have a bad dream.

395
00:27:36,515 --> 00:27:37,795
Geez, this brat.

396
00:27:37,835 --> 00:27:40,475
Do you want to know what the new rule is?

397
00:27:40,755 --> 00:27:41,555
Yes!

398
00:27:42,635 --> 00:27:49,395
Instead of a Noppamas Queen contest, we’ll have a Pho Chai’s Sweetheart contest this year.

399
00:27:49,395 --> 00:27:51,235
[Cheering sound]

400
00:27:51,755 --> 00:27:54,755
We’ll let everyone vote for the winner.

401
00:27:54,755 --> 00:27:58,955
Each of you will have one vote.

402
00:27:58,955 --> 00:28:01,035
The last three contestants…

403
00:28:01,035 --> 00:28:03,515
will have to be on a stage at the fair.

404
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,915
Then we’ll choose the winner on that day. Is that good?

405
00:28:06,115 --> 00:28:06,915
Yes!

406
00:28:06,915 --> 00:28:08,235
It’s a great idea.

407
00:28:08,235 --> 00:28:12,235
It makes us think of other people before thinking about ourselves.

408
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:14,155
Yes, that’s right.

409
00:28:14,675 --> 00:28:16,515
Do you have any question?

410
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:18,875
I do, Chief.

411
00:28:20,675 --> 00:28:23,435
Can we add more days to the fair?

412
00:28:23,995 --> 00:28:27,555
I think one day is not enough.

413
00:28:27,755 --> 00:28:29,275
Wow.

414
00:28:31,355 --> 00:28:35,915
You might wonder why you can only enjoy it for just one day, right?

415
00:28:36,555 --> 00:28:37,875
But actually,

416
00:28:38,355 --> 00:28:41,075
you can enjoy it every day.

417
00:28:42,515 --> 00:28:45,195
Every day when we meet like this.

418
00:28:45,555 --> 00:28:49,995
Every day when we work on this project together…

419
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:53,595
making snacks or Kratong together,

420
00:28:54,155 --> 00:28:56,835
and having fun together after work.

421
00:28:57,195 --> 00:28:59,155
Or even when we clean up together.

422
00:28:59,875 --> 00:29:02,835
That is in fact the true joy of this event.

423
00:29:02,835 --> 00:29:06,795
It’s all because we are united as one.

424
00:29:07,675 --> 00:29:09,075
We, the people of Pho Chai.

425
00:29:12,675 --> 00:29:15,515
Three days from now on, let’s have fun together.

426
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:19,715
So from this moment on, welcome to Pho Chai’s annual fair!

427
00:29:20,275 --> 00:29:21,115
[Cheering sound]

428
00:29:30,955 --> 00:29:33,195
Well done. That’s right.

429
00:29:33,235 --> 00:29:33,875
Granny.

430
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:34,355
Yes?

431
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:35,315
Please teach me how to do it.

432
00:29:35,395 --> 00:29:37,035
Of course, dear.

433
00:29:37,395 --> 00:29:40,875
First, we have to start by making this.

434
00:29:41,235 --> 00:29:42,515
No, not like this.

435
00:29:42,515 --> 00:29:43,395
Oh, then how should it be?

436
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:45,035
And then you made two like this.

437
00:29:45,275 --> 00:29:46,715
Here, wrap it like this first, see?

438
00:29:46,915 --> 00:29:47,355
Wrap it around,

439
00:29:47,355 --> 00:29:50,035
then press it down and wrap again.

440
00:29:50,035 --> 00:29:51,635
There, see it, dear?

441
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:52,795
Here, here

442
00:29:53,035 --> 00:29:56,275
Take the marigold from over there and stick it in here.

443
00:29:56,275 --> 00:29:58,195
Like this, insert it right here.

444
00:30:00,395 --> 00:30:02,115
Take this part too, Once you cut it, it looks like this.

445
00:30:02,115 --> 00:30:05,955
Have some drinks.

446
00:30:09,235 --> 00:30:10,835
Thanks.

447
00:30:19,435 --> 00:30:20,875
Try this one.

448
00:30:23,875 --> 00:30:25,075
Not this one!

449
00:30:25,395 --> 00:30:26,275
How about this?

450
00:30:27,915 --> 00:30:28,995
So cool!

451
00:30:29,235 --> 00:30:29,995
Awesome.

452
00:30:33,035 --> 00:30:33,835
Perfect.

453
00:30:38,875 --> 00:30:39,595
So cute!

454
00:30:39,675 --> 00:30:40,875
Just like that!

455
00:30:41,115 --> 00:30:42,835
Just like that!

456
00:30:44,715 --> 00:30:45,515
Yes!

457
00:30:46,195 --> 00:30:47,435
Yes! Just like that!

458
00:30:48,195 --> 00:30:48,995
How is it?

459
00:30:48,995 --> 00:30:49,875
Let’s check out the photos.

460
00:31:00,755 --> 00:31:03,235
Hey, are you sure you can do it?

461
00:31:04,075 --> 00:31:07,475
You should keep stirring it,

462
00:31:07,475 --> 00:31:08,635
or else the syrup might harden.

463
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:09,955
See that?

464
00:31:18,155 --> 00:31:19,275
Granny might see it.

465
00:31:20,475 --> 00:31:21,275
Let go!

466
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:26,555
To check if it’s done, scoop it up like this.

467
00:31:27,475 --> 00:31:28,755
Like this?

468
00:31:34,355 --> 00:31:36,435
Tell me when you want me to add it.

469
00:31:37,995 --> 00:31:42,235
Yes, Granny.

470
00:31:43,955 --> 00:31:44,755
Here’s your drink.

471
00:31:45,835 --> 00:31:46,755
Thanks.

472
00:31:49,275 --> 00:31:51,755
Can I invite my friends to the Loy Kratong festival here?

473
00:31:52,075 --> 00:31:54,315
Of course, more people means more fun.

474
00:31:56,115 --> 00:31:58,035
I didn’t want to invite them because I wanted to have fun.

475
00:31:59,795 --> 00:32:01,475
Then what for?

476
00:32:02,275 --> 00:32:04,835
I want them to be the witness for our love.

477
00:32:05,835 --> 00:32:09,075
What are you talking about? We’re not lovers.

478
00:32:12,195 --> 00:32:14,395
Do you want to be one?

479
00:32:15,515 --> 00:32:16,315
Be what?

480
00:32:17,675 --> 00:32:18,795
My boyfriend.

481
00:32:19,435 --> 00:32:20,315
What boyfriend?

482
00:32:21,715 --> 00:32:22,555
Give me a hug.

483
00:32:22,755 --> 00:32:24,675
Geez, don’t!

484
00:32:24,675 --> 00:32:25,955
Someone might see us.

485
00:32:26,155 --> 00:32:27,275
They won’t.

486
00:32:27,275 --> 00:32:28,235
Don’t.

487
00:32:28,555 --> 00:32:29,395
Get off me.

488
00:32:30,555 --> 00:32:31,715
Hey, wait.

489
00:32:31,715 --> 00:32:32,835
Give me a hug first.

490
00:32:35,515 --> 00:32:37,275
We should make a deal.

491
00:32:38,475 --> 00:32:39,595
What deal?

492
00:32:40,235 --> 00:32:42,875
You can just say it. I can do anything for you.

493
00:32:43,315 --> 00:32:44,515
Except for one thing.

494
00:32:44,875 --> 00:32:48,035
If you want me to stop loving you, I can’t do that.

495
00:32:49,835 --> 00:32:50,955
Don’t sweet-talk me.

496
00:32:53,075 --> 00:32:54,955
Let’s make a deal…

497
00:32:55,835 --> 00:32:57,275
especially when we’re in public.

498
00:32:59,615 --> 00:33:00,515
Why?

499
00:33:00,755 --> 00:33:03,115
Don’t you want people to know we like each other?

500
00:33:06,635 --> 00:33:10,075
First, when we’re in public…

501
00:33:10,715 --> 00:33:12,035
never say you like me.

502
00:33:13,635 --> 00:33:15,275
I can do that.

503
00:33:15,555 --> 00:33:20,435
Second, don’t touch me without my permission.

504
00:33:21,915 --> 00:33:25,155
Geez, why?

505
00:33:29,075 --> 00:33:30,715
If you want me to agree,

506
00:33:32,275 --> 00:33:33,795
you have to be my boyfriend first.

507
00:33:34,875 --> 00:33:35,675
No.

508
00:33:37,995 --> 00:33:38,955
Why?

509
00:33:41,515 --> 00:33:43,635
You’ll leave here and go study abroad soon.

510
00:33:44,475 --> 00:33:46,035
If I agree to be your boyfriend now,

511
00:33:46,675 --> 00:33:48,035
we’ll have to break up soon anyway.

512
00:33:48,635 --> 00:33:51,355
Why do I have to break up with you when I go to study abroad?

513
00:33:52,595 --> 00:33:55,315
I promise I’ll facetime you every day.

514
00:33:56,435 --> 00:33:59,515
But if you want it to be more romantic, I can write a letter to you instead.

515
00:34:15,155 --> 00:34:17,155
You can say it however you like now.

516
00:34:17,795 --> 00:34:21,675
But you have no idea that loneliness and long distance…

517
00:34:22,875 --> 00:34:24,515
can hurt us so badly.

518
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:29,515
You said it like you’ve had experience about it before.

519
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:35,755
Nothing. I have a lot of long-distance friends.

520
00:34:36,355 --> 00:34:38,275
Many of them also broke up because of that.

521
00:34:42,435 --> 00:34:44,395
I used to believe that too.

522
00:34:46,995 --> 00:34:49,635
That if I go to study abroad, I should break up with my lover.

523
00:34:51,955 --> 00:34:54,035
That’s why I turned down everyone who came into my life.

524
00:34:57,955 --> 00:34:59,755
Why do you want me to be your boyfriend then?

525
00:35:01,075 --> 00:35:02,235
Because it’s you.

526
00:35:04,155 --> 00:35:08,195
When you love someone, you won’t care about anything else.

527
00:35:09,115 --> 00:35:11,555
You’ll forget whatever rules or conditions you’ve set.

528
00:35:12,835 --> 00:35:15,955
And I’m like that now because of you.

529
00:35:18,235 --> 00:35:19,355
Please be my boyfriend.

530
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:45,635
Please give me some time.

531
00:35:46,315 --> 00:35:48,955
When I’m ready, I’ll let you know.

532
00:35:52,075 --> 00:35:55,515
Okay. Can I have a deposit first?

533
00:36:08,995 --> 00:36:11,755
I better go get some work done.

534
00:36:25,995 --> 00:36:26,955
[Baan Pho Chai’s annual fair]

535
00:36:30,195 --> 00:36:33,035
Hello to everyone – the people of Pho Chai.

536
00:36:33,035 --> 00:36:37,075
Brother, sister, uncle, auntie, grandpa, and grandma.

537
00:36:37,075 --> 00:36:39,635
Welcome to Pho Chai’s annual fair!

538
00:36:39,635 --> 00:36:41,435
[Cheering sound]

539
00:36:42,355 --> 00:36:47,635
As you already know, we were making Krayasart for a contest earlier this afternoon.

540
00:36:48,355 --> 00:36:50,915
Now, it’s time to find out…

541
00:36:50,915 --> 00:36:54,075
how wonderful each of your Krayasart would be.

542
00:36:54,075 --> 00:36:58,475
Let’s see how much each recipe has improved in the past year.

543
00:36:58,755 --> 00:37:03,435
And which recipe will win over the hearts of Pho Chai people this year!

544
00:37:10,475 --> 00:37:12,195
You’re really good at everything.

545
00:37:12,195 --> 00:37:15,955
Planning, organizing, and even hosting the event yourself.

546
00:37:15,955 --> 00:37:18,475
Now, I’m falling even harder for you.

547
00:37:19,395 --> 00:37:21,275
Is your name Yotin or Sweet-talk?

548
00:37:21,595 --> 00:37:22,835
You sweet-talk me every five minutes.

549
00:37:24,715 --> 00:37:25,995
Here’s your drink.

550
00:37:27,275 --> 00:37:28,075
Thank you.

551
00:37:29,475 --> 00:37:31,995
Anyway, where are the others?

552
00:37:34,195 --> 00:37:35,235
I don’t know too.

553
00:37:35,635 --> 00:37:38,395
But I think those three imps are probably getting themselves ready.

554
00:37:38,755 --> 00:37:41,475
Huh? Ready for what?

555
00:37:43,075 --> 00:37:46,795
Well, just…ready to have fun at the festival.

556
00:37:46,875 --> 00:37:50,195
Just look around, you can feel the fun everywhere.

557
00:37:51,235 --> 00:37:54,555
Talking about getting ready, are you ready to go on stage?

558
00:37:55,515 --> 00:37:56,915
You’re one of the contestants, aren’t you?

559
00:37:58,515 --> 00:37:59,395
Not really.

560
00:38:00,635 --> 00:38:03,595
I still can’t believe it when you told me…

561
00:38:03,595 --> 00:38:05,995
that I got voted as one of the top three for this contest.

562
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:08,355
You were joking, right?

563
00:38:09,395 --> 00:38:10,675
Why would I do that?

564
00:38:11,235 --> 00:38:14,275
If you don’t trust me, I can show you the vote result.

565
00:38:15,755 --> 00:38:18,315
You should be happy that everyone here loves you.

566
00:38:19,635 --> 00:38:23,355
You’re right. But I haven’t done anything for them though.

567
00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:25,835
What makes them like me that much?

568
00:38:26,515 --> 00:38:27,475
You already have.

569
00:38:28,395 --> 00:38:31,715
You’ve made them smile. You’ve given them happiness.

570
00:38:32,475 --> 00:38:34,715
That’s much more than enough to make them like you.

571
00:38:35,515 --> 00:38:37,835
What about you? Do you also like me?

572
00:38:39,195 --> 00:38:40,115
Do you?

573
00:38:41,035 --> 00:38:43,555
Hey, stop it.

574
00:38:44,395 --> 00:38:45,475
Where are your friends?

575
00:38:49,475 --> 00:38:51,355
Oh, they’ve just arrived.

576
00:38:51,915 --> 00:38:53,035
I’ll go see them first.

577
00:38:53,155 --> 00:38:53,955
Okay.

578
00:38:53,955 --> 00:38:55,355
I’ll wait around here.

579
00:38:55,675 --> 00:38:56,995
I won’t be long.

580
00:38:57,355 --> 00:39:00,115
Stay here and take care of my heart for me.

581
00:39:00,115 --> 00:39:01,195
Okay?

583
00:39:02,275 --> 00:39:03,675
Stop it.

584
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:04,475
Go now!

585

[Next Break]
Whom are you waiting for, cutie?

586
00:39:21,795 --> 00:39:23,075
Why don’t you come with me first?

587
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:24,555
Hey! What the fuck are you doing?!

588
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:26,275
You wanna play hero, huh?

589
00:39:26,635 --> 00:39:28,315
Go meet me over there then.

[My Sweetheart Jom]

592
00:39:40,381 --> 00:39:45,101
Watch “My Sweetheart Jom” for free on YouTube.

593
00:39:46,221 --> 00:39:49,501
Wow, it seems fun, doesn’t it?

594
00:39:50,181 --> 00:39:52,221
The food also looks delicious.

595
00:39:53,941 --> 00:39:57,221
By the way, since they’ve canceled the Noppamas Queen contest…

596
00:39:57,221 --> 00:40:00,181
how do you plan to get attention from Yo then

597
00:40:00,501 --> 00:40:03,181
Do I have to do that?

598
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,221
Hi, Rose.

599
00:40:06,061 --> 00:40:08,181
Hi, Poe.

600
00:40:08,421 --> 00:40:09,221
Hi.

601
00:40:13,261 --> 00:40:17,261
Fluke? What are you doing here?

602
00:40:18,501 --> 00:40:20,981
I’m just…hanging around.

603
00:40:20,981 --> 00:40:24,941
You also came to the fair?

604
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:27,141
Aha.

605
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:33,061
I think it seems fun…

606
00:40:33,421 --> 00:40:40,501
so I asked Ble and Poe to come with me too.

607
00:40:46,541 --> 00:40:48,061
I’ll go that way then.

608
00:40:49,101 --> 00:40:51,461
- Oops.
- Sorry.

609
00:40:51,461 --> 00:40:52,421
I'm off now, Uncle

610
00:40:57,701 --> 00:41:00,781
Don’t you think Fluke is acting kind of weird today?

611
00:41:03,901 --> 00:41:05,821
Like he’s shy when he sees you.

612
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:10,181
Or…does he like you?

613
00:41:10,181 --> 00:41:10,861
Rose.

614
00:41:13,381 --> 00:41:15,221
If you still want to be my friend,

615
00:41:15,941 --> 00:41:17,261
don’t say that again.

616
00:41:17,861 --> 00:41:18,661
I don’t like it.

617
00:41:20,501 --> 00:41:23,581
And don’t ever think I’d like him.

618
00:41:24,701 --> 00:41:26,581
But he’s been so popular lately.

619
00:41:29,461 --> 00:41:32,101
You haven’t checked out his IG, haven’t you? Check it out then.

620
00:41:32,101 --> 00:41:35,181
His followers have increased so fast.

621
00:41:35,341 --> 00:41:36,141
No.

622
00:41:36,341 --> 00:41:37,301
Come on.

623
00:41:38,301 --> 00:41:39,701
- I don’t believe you.
-He's really popular

624
00:41:39,861 --> 00:41:41,261
I’m not exaggerating.

625
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:46,301
Fine, I won’t mention it again.

626
00:41:52,821 --> 00:41:55,021
I need to go to the loo.

627
00:41:55,581 --> 00:41:56,781
Text me when you’re done.

628
00:41:56,781 --> 00:41:58,741
Okay, see you.

629
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:03,901
Geez.

630
00:42:06,541 --> 00:42:08,421
Fluke is popular?

631
00:42:13,261 --> 00:42:14,061
Huh?

632
00:42:15,941 --> 00:42:18,621
So, which side are you going to bet on?

633
00:42:19,101 --> 00:42:22,101
Pho Chai’s Krayasart, of course.

634
00:42:23,981 --> 00:42:28,861
Don’t you want to pick another choice? You’ll only get double if Pho Chai wins.

635
00:42:29,301 --> 00:42:32,021
Just let him choose what he wants.

636
00:42:33,101 --> 00:42:34,861
- Don’t butt in.
- Sorry.

637
00:42:35,101 --> 00:42:40,101
Only a double is fine. Pho Chai has won every year.

638
00:42:42,581 --> 00:42:48,501
But a little bird told me Pho Chai might not win this year.

639
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:50,941
Other villages might instead.

640
00:42:51,341 --> 00:42:52,781
Trust me.

641
00:42:53,141 --> 00:42:54,141
Wanna try?

642
00:42:54,701 --> 00:42:57,221
So?

643
00:43:06,621 --> 00:43:07,421
Okay!

644
00:43:08,621 --> 00:43:09,421
That’s great.

645
00:43:10,701 --> 00:43:11,661
Which village?

646
00:43:11,821 --> 00:43:12,781
Pho Chai.

647
00:43:13,141 --> 00:43:14,381
Whatever.

648
00:43:15,421 --> 00:43:19,661
Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

649
00:43:21,021 --> 00:43:25,301
Wanna bet on Pho Chai? There you go.

650
00:43:29,781 --> 00:43:31,621
Rich, rich, rich!

651
00:43:35,941 --> 00:43:39,901
What the hell? Why is everyone betting on Pho Chai?

652
00:43:41,101 --> 00:43:42,741
Don’t they have a better choice?

653
00:43:43,701 --> 00:43:46,181
Anyway, fuck it.

654
00:43:47,381 --> 00:43:54,861
If Pho Chai wins, we’ll claim that Jomkwan has used his position…

655
00:43:55,061 --> 00:43:58,461
to make his village win. Right?

656
00:43:59,861 --> 00:44:05,421
This means we… we won’t have to pay even if they win, right Uncle?

657
00:44:05,461 --> 00:44:07,221
Using your brain makes you stutter, huh?

658
00:44:07,421 --> 00:44:08,221
Thank you.

659
00:44:08,741 --> 00:44:14,421
Anyway, that’s an appetizer. We’re doing it just to kill time.

660
00:44:14,501 --> 00:44:16,901
What’s important now is that you…

661
00:44:18,101 --> 00:44:21,101
should get ready to execute on our plan.

662
00:44:21,621 --> 00:44:24,341
Don’t worry, Uncle. I’ll make it as smooth as silk.

663
00:44:24,341 --> 00:44:27,901
Oh yeah? Get your hands off.

664
00:44:27,981 --> 00:44:29,021
That’s your pay.

665
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:30,421
God blesses me

666
00:44:30,821 --> 00:44:32,341
I’ll go get ready then.

667
00:44:32,421 --> 00:44:33,181

668
00:44:40,581 --> 00:44:42,981

670
00:44:58,501 --> 00:44:59,541
I’m waiting for my friend.

671
00:45:00,501 --> 00:45:03,901
Oh, you’re not waiting for us then.

672
00:45:04,341 --> 00:45:07,141
Because we don’t want to be your friends. We want to be your…

Where did you learn your acting from though? You were quite a badass.

That’s a piece of cake. We were born like that, right?

00:49:34,061 --> 00:49:38,981
you have already tried the original sweet and flavourful Krayasart.

725
00:49:38,981 --> 00:49:43,541
Now, I want you to try the fusion version…

726
00:49:43,541 --> 00:49:46,021
made by each village that’s taking part in this contest.

727
00:49:46,021 --> 00:49:49,421
I’ll let the judges try it one by one.

728
00:49:49,421 --> 00:49:52,141
Everyone will get to try it too. I’ll also try it.

729
00:49:52,581 --> 00:49:55,261
First is Krayasart from Baan Pho Chai.

730
00:49:55,261 --> 00:49:58,061
Wow, looks so yummy.

731
00:50:16,756 --> 00:50:17,861
It’s really good.

732
00:50:26,141 --> 00:50:28,261
Now, the judges have finished voting.

733
00:50:28,501 --> 00:50:30,901
Let’s see what the final result would be.

734
00:50:38,181 --> 00:50:41,061
Our judges have already tried all the Krayasart.

735
00:50:41,061 --> 00:50:42,541
And also finished scoring each one.

736
00:50:42,541 --> 00:50:46,901
Can I have the result then?

737
00:50:47,981 --> 00:50:53,581
The final result of the Krayasart-making contest is now in my hand.

738
00:50:54,181 --> 00:51:00,421
The village that has won the contest this year is…

739
00:51:04,101 --> 00:51:05,261
Every village!

740
00:51:08,981 --> 00:51:11,621
Great! Fair enough.

741
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:19,701
We’ve voted every village to be the winner this year…

742
00:51:19,941 --> 00:51:27,061
because each of you has a uniqueness in making your Krayasart.

743
00:51:27,461 --> 00:51:30,781
Each has a wonderful yet unique taste.

744
00:51:31,061 --> 00:51:36,661
And that’s the soft power of your village.

745
00:51:43,861 --> 00:51:45,021
Thank you

746
00:51:48,901 --> 00:51:51,941
Thank you to all three villages.

747
00:51:57,261 --> 00:52:00,941
Now that the Krayasart-making contest is done,

748
00:52:01,021 --> 00:52:03,421
it’s time we’ve all been waiting for…

749
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:07,621
It’s time for a Pho Chai’s Sweetheart contest!

750
00:52:12,061 --> 00:52:13,141
As you can see,

751
00:52:13,141 --> 00:52:18,621
our top 3 contestants are already on this stage with us.

752
00:52:18,621 --> 00:52:20,541
Let’s talk to them one by one.

753
00:52:20,541 --> 00:52:22,701
First, please welcome Aunt Noknoi!

754
00:52:26,261 --> 00:52:28,941
I’m so glad and honoured to be here.

755
00:52:28,941 --> 00:52:32,341
Thank you for every vote you’ve given to me.

756
00:52:32,621 --> 00:52:36,181
Hi, I’m Vivi. I’m so honoured to be here.

757
00:52:36,181 --> 00:52:39,941
Thank you for all of your votes. I’m so proud of you all.

758
00:52:40,381 --> 00:52:43,781
And lastly, please welcome Yotin!

759
00:52:54,061 --> 00:52:55,821
He’s my grandson.

760
00:52:56,341 --> 00:53:00,581
I’d like you to say something to the village people…

761
00:53:00,901 --> 00:53:03,701
who have voted for you.

762
00:53:05,541 --> 00:53:09,301
To be honest, I think I can’t do it.

763
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:20,581
I said that because this Sweetheart prize won’t allow me to do anything much for you.

764
00:53:21,021 --> 00:53:23,901
If it were a Prime Minister contest, then that’s another story.

765
00:53:29,141 --> 00:53:31,301
I was just kidding. Let’s get serious.

766
00:53:32,701 --> 00:53:34,261
Suppose I’m able to do it.

767
00:53:35,541 --> 00:53:37,861
For everyone here to live a happy life,

768
00:53:38,501 --> 00:53:40,861
I think it all starts with ourselves.

769
00:53:42,021 --> 00:53:43,981
I’ll teach everyone to catch fish.

770
00:53:44,741 --> 00:53:48,661
What the hell is he talking about? His answer is as stupid as his look.

771
00:53:48,661 --> 00:53:52,261
Where the fuck were you looking? Over there.

772
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:56,101
My dad used to teach me that a good leader…

773
00:53:56,501 --> 00:53:59,261
should teach his people to catch their own fish.

774
00:54:00,501 --> 00:54:03,061
Because if he keeps bringing them fish…

775
00:54:04,101 --> 00:54:05,861
then one day he stops,

776
00:54:07,101 --> 00:54:10,741
everyone would keep waiting for his fish because they don’t know how to catch it.

777
00:54:12,981 --> 00:54:15,981
At first, I didn’t understand what he was trying to s

778
00:54:16,781 --> 00:54:18,501
Not until I came here.

779
00:54:19,061 --> 00:54:23,581
Then I’ve started to realize that being able to stand on our own legs is more sustainable.

780
00:54:30,461 --> 00:54:31,701
Mr. Yotin.

781
00:54:32,341 --> 00:54:37,661
You’re not from Pho Chai, aren’t you?

782
00:54:38,941 --> 00:54:43,221
How are you going to promote our village and make us well-known?

783
00:54:44,461 --> 00:54:45,901
I will not do anything.

784
00:54:46,421 --> 00:54:47,221
Huh?

785
00:54:48,381 --> 00:54:50,301
Before I came here,

786
00:54:52,181 --> 00:54:53,901
I hated this place so much.

787
00:54:55,141 --> 00:54:57,981
I thought it was somewhere far away from civilization…

788
00:54:59,981 --> 00:55:01,901
somewhere rural and rustic.

789
00:55:03,741 --> 00:55:05,421
Until I finally came to stay here.

790
00:55:06,821 --> 00:55:08,381
At first, I still thought like that.

791
00:55:10,421 --> 00:55:12,021
But after living here for a while,

792
00:55:13,421 --> 00:55:16,461
I started to understand why you can easily fall in love with Pho Chai.

793
00:55:18,661 --> 00:55:20,101
There’s no sky train here.

794
00:55:20,861 --> 00:55:25,781
But sitting on Uncle Pun’s bus, I can smell the scent of flowers and fresh leaves along the roadside.

795
00:55:26,861 --> 00:55:31,221
There’s no fast-food restaurant here. But you have the best rice and curry shop in the world.

796
00:55:31,741 --> 00:55:35,541
Most importantly, this place…

797
00:55:37,341 --> 00:55:38,901
has made me know what love is.

798
00:55:52,621 --> 00:55:54,621
Thank you, Yotin.

799
00:55:55,261 --> 00:55:56,221
Thank you

800
00:55:59,701 --> 00:56:01,621
Come, let’s get our job done.

801
00:56:07,021 --> 00:56:08,741
So stupid. Ouch!

802
00:56:10,101 --> 00:56:11,421
I’m coming.

803
00:56:13,101 --> 00:56:15,821
This year's contestants at Pho chai is,

804
00:56:16,981 --> 00:56:19,261
Yotin!

805
00:56:23,381 --> 00:56:26,901
Yay!! Yotin! Yotin! Yotin!

806
00:57:03,101 --> 00:57:04,221
[Next Break]
Is that a gunshot?

807
00:57:04,341 --> 00:57:05,621
Probably just a transformer blowing up.

808
00:57:05,741 --> 00:57:06,901
Wait here.

809
00:57:11,101 --> 00:57:14,781
[My Sweetheart Jom]

810
00:57:16,273 --> 00:57:20,753
[My Sweetheart Jom]

811
00:57:20,883 --> 00:57:25,693
Watch “My Sweetheart Jom” for free on YouTube.

812
00:57:57,283 --> 00:57:59,743
I never thought people here would still do this kind of dance.

813
00:58:02,083 --> 00:58:05,333
We still preserve lots of good old things.

814
00:58:13,943 --> 00:58:15,083
Jom.

815
00:58:16,883 --> 00:58:17,683
Earn.

816
00:58:18,843 --> 00:58:20,443
I thought you wouldn’t come.

817
00:58:20,883 --> 00:58:23,913
Of course, I would. Mummy just got off work late.

818
00:58:24,043 --> 00:58:27,773
I came running as fast as I could. So lucky I got here in time for the dance.

819
00:58:29,013 --> 00:58:30,353
You haven’t forgotten, right?

820
00:58:30,753 --> 00:58:38,453
You’ve promised to dance with me this year.

821
00:58:40,333 --> 00:58:42,193
Thank you, Mr. Gentleman.

822
00:58:45,533 --> 00:58:46,553
I’m sorry.

823
00:58:51,373 --> 00:58:52,553
Let’s go.

824
00:58:52,553 --> 00:58:54,433
Let’s go.

825
00:58:54,433 --> 00:58:54,973
Let’s go.

826
00:58:57,393 --> 00:58:59,093
Can I have a dance with you?

827
00:59:00,773 --> 00:59:01,393
Okay.

828
00:59:02,113 --> 00:59:04,613
Excuse me? Can we take a picture with you?

829
00:59:04,873 --> 00:59:06,253
Can we take a picture with you?

830
00:59:18,183 --> 00:59:20,843
Is there something wrong?

831
00:59:22,483 --> 00:59:24,683
Oh, nothing.

832
00:59:26,743 --> 00:59:30,293
Don’t you enjoy dancing with me?

833
00:59:30,293 --> 00:59:31,733
You’re not smiling at all.

834
00:59:32,683 --> 00:59:35,643
It’s not like that. I’m just a little tired.

835
00:59:38,213 --> 00:59:39,083
Let’s dance.

836
00:59:40,143 --> 00:59:43,393
I have a way to make you smile.

837
00:59:48,253 --> 00:59:50,013
Good, you’re smiling now.

838
00:59:50,013 --> 00:59:50,613
I’m smiling.

839
00:59:50,613 --> 00:59:53,233
That’s good. Let’s dance.

840
00:59:53,753 --> 00:59:55,713
Over there.

841
00:59:57,613 --> 00:59:59,853
Can you tell me about the plan again?

842
01:00:00,133 --> 01:00:02,193
You moron, can you even remember anything?

843
01:00:02,193 --> 01:00:05,173
Hitting me like that, it’s lucky enough that I can still remember you.

844
01:00:05,583 --> 01:00:10,413
Listen. If the power is out, Jom will definitely come here.

845
01:00:11,013 --> 01:00:12,453
I’ll take care of him.

846
01:00:13,293 --> 01:00:14,333
Okay.

847
01:00:25,143 --> 01:00:26,373
Okay.

848
01:00:26,413 --> 01:00:27,473
- Teacher Toei.
- Can I have…

849
01:00:27,473 --> 01:00:29,173
a dance with you? Come!

850
01:00:29,173 --> 01:00:30,433
- Of course.
- Let’s dance.

851
01:00:31,143 --> 01:00:32,733
Don’t we have to follow the rhythm, Teacher?

852
01:00:32,813 --> 01:00:34,313
No need. We only want to make a scene.

853
01:00:34,413 --> 01:00:35,783
Excuse me?

854
01:00:36,483 --> 01:00:39,033
Oh, someone’s here? I didn’t see you earlier.

855
01:00:39,033 --> 01:00:39,733
Who are you?

856
01:00:39,883 --> 01:00:44,813
Please excuse us, he’s still dancing with me.

857
01:00:44,813 --> 01:00:47,153
Oh, I didn’t know that. Let’s dance then.

858
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:48,043
Let’s dance then.

859
01:00:48,043 --> 01:00:50,533
Excuse me, Miss Moodeng.

860
01:00:51,883 --> 01:00:54,633
I’m afraid I was here first.

861
01:00:56,083 --> 01:00:58,653
Who? Who’s here?

862
01:00:58,653 --> 01:01:00,693
Who do you think you are, Hamster girl?

863
01:01:00,783 --> 01:01:02,393
What? Miss Moodeng!

864
01:01:02,743 --> 01:01:03,653
Hey, Hamster girl.

865
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:05,443
Hasn’t anyone told,

866
01:01:12,143 --> 01:01:14,453
you your outfits don’t match?

867
01:01:14,453 --> 01:01:16,553
Look at yourself first!

868
01:01:16,583 --> 01:01:18,713
My dress is perfect for the event.

869
01:01:18,713 --> 01:01:21,233
Can’t you see it’s a celebration!

870
01:01:21,233 --> 01:01:22,853
Are you nuts? Why wrap a napkin around your neck?

871
01:01:23,183 --> 01:01:25,653
Excuse me, it’s a flower!

872
01:01:25,813 --> 01:01:26,413
Oh, really?

873
01:01:26,413 --> 01:01:27,683
You also have napkins all over your dress.

874
01:01:27,843 --> 01:01:30,493
You think it’s pretty, don’t you?

875
01:01:30,753 --> 01:01:33,153
Let’s dance, Jom. Oh, where’s he?

876
01:01:33,153 --> 01:01:34,653
He left because of you!

877
01:01:35,143 --> 01:01:36,433
Jom!

878
01:01:36,433 --> 01:01:38,113
Get back here and dance!

879
01:01:38,113 --> 01:01:38,793
Jom!

880
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:43,119
Jom

881
01:02:15,583 --> 01:02:18,843
Are you okay? Don’t you enjoy the fair?

882
01:02:19,843 --> 01:02:22,643
I do. I just want to have some time with you alone.

883
01:02:25,143 --> 01:02:27,383
What then?

884
01:02:29,843 --> 01:02:32,883
Just wait here. I’ll be right back.

885
01:02:52,643 --> 01:02:56,033
When I was a kid, I used to go floating Kratong with my parents at the festival.

886
01:02:56,643 --> 01:02:58,843
I saw many couples there floating Kratong together.

887
01:03:00,543 --> 01:03:05,083
And I thought that one day I’d want to do that with the person I love.

888
01:03:28,413 --> 01:03:29,933
Can you do it with me?

889
01:04:11,683 --> 01:04:13,213
What did you wish for?

890
01:04:15,743 --> 01:04:16,993
Have you ever heard…

891
01:04:17,573 --> 01:04:20,833
an old saying that if you let someone else know what you wish for,

892
01:04:21,453 --> 01:04:23,213
it won’t become true?

893
01:04:26,883 --> 01:04:29,143
Remember when you asked me to give you some time?

894
01:04:30,943 --> 01:04:33,933
I wasn’t sure if you said that because you wanted me to stop going after you.

895
01:04:35,643 --> 01:04:39,953
But it actually made me like you even more.

896
01:04:40,583 --> 01:04:41,153
Yo.

897
01:04:41,153 --> 01:04:45,013
I was sincere about what I said on stage.

898
01:04:46,683 --> 01:04:48,283
I don’t like anyone to come near you.

899
01:04:49,943 --> 01:04:52,213
If you don’t want me to go nuts from being so madly in love with you,

900
01:04:53,983 --> 01:04:55,913
please say yes and be my boyfriend.

901
01:04:58,983 --> 01:05:01,833
You’re not giving me any chance to say no, aren’t you?

902
01:05:03,213 --> 01:05:04,933
Are you going to say no?

903
01:05:11,183 --> 01:05:14,843
Do you know what I just wished for?

904
01:05:17,443 --> 01:05:18,383
What did you wish for?

905
01:05:28,143 --> 01:05:29,283
I wished…

906
01:05:31,983 --> 01:05:35,913
you would propose to me again tonight.

907
01:05:36,413 --> 01:05:39,283
Jom! Does this mean you want to be my boyfriend?

908
01:05:40,683 --> 01:05:41,483
Mhm.

909
01:05:42,343 --> 01:05:44,713
Mhm what? What does that mean?

910
01:05:45,283 --> 01:05:46,443
Please be clear.

911
01:05:48,043 --> 01:05:51,233
I’m your boyfriend now.

912
01:05:55,883 --> 01:06:01,183
I don’t know what those feelings are.

913
01:06:02,943 --> 01:06:06,433
But I don’t like it when you smile at someone else.

914
01:06:08,283 --> 01:06:09,643
I don’t want anyone to come near you.

915
01:06:15,083 --> 01:06:16,813
[Jom]: I don’t like it when you smile at someone else.

916
01:06:18,613 --> 01:06:19,943
[Jom]: I don’t want anyone to come near you.

917
01:06:23,283 --> 01:06:24,083
Yo.

918
01:06:27,783 --> 01:06:29,643
Do you know how happy I am now?

919
01:06:34,943 --> 01:06:38,583
Can I kiss you…my boyfriend?

920
01:07:53,533 --> 01:07:55,173
What a mess, uncle

921
01:07:56,183 --> 01:08:01,273
With so many people at the festival,

922
01:08:01,273 --> 01:08:03,253
there would definitely be a crowd crush.

923
01:08:03,253 --> 01:08:09,453
Jom wouldn’t be able to take that much of responsibility.

924
01:08:09,453 --> 01:08:10,533
let's go!

925
01:08:11,483 --> 01:08:12,583
You have a gun.

926
01:08:14,243 --> 01:08:15,243
Are you sure?

927
01:08:17,883 --> 01:08:18,683
What happened?

928
01:08:20,183 --> 01:08:21,213
What happened?

929
01:08:23,213 --> 01:08:24,013
What happened?

930
01:08:24,843 --> 01:08:26,143
It’s just a power outage.

931
01:08:26,583 --> 01:08:28,613
Please calm down, everyone!

932
01:08:29,843 --> 01:08:31,613
Calm down! Don’t run!

933
01:08:36,583 --> 01:08:38,643
Is that a gunshot?

934
01:08:39,613 --> 01:08:42,093
Don’t worry. Probably just a transformer blowing up.

935
01:08:42,473 --> 01:08:43,373
Wait here.

936
01:08:50,283 --> 01:08:51,783
Let’s go stay over there.

937
01:08:54,543 --> 01:08:55,343
Let’s go.

938
01:09:00,813 --> 01:09:02,093
Only me again.

939
01:09:23,483 --> 01:09:25,713
Keep messing with my business, brat.

940
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:28,213
Uncle!

941
01:09:28,743 --> 01:09:29,813
What the fuck?

942
01:09:29,813 --> 01:09:30,943
Are you going to shoot him?

943
01:09:31,043 --> 01:09:33,333
What if someone sees us?

944
01:09:33,333 --> 01:09:35,813
You dumbass. The crowd is in panic right now and it’s so dark.

945
01:09:36,073 --> 01:09:37,353
They wouldn’t know who shoots him.

946
01:09:39,243 --> 01:09:39,973
Jom!

947
01:09:40,813 --> 01:09:41,933
Jom!

948
01:09:41,933 --> 01:09:44,053
Fuck it! Someone’s coming. Let’s go.

949
01:09:51,813 --> 01:09:52,613
Jom!

950
01:09:53,143 --> 01:09:53,943
Jom!

951
01:09:54,583 --> 01:09:55,983
Stay with me, Jom!

952
01:10:00,143 --> 01:10:00,943
Jom!

953
01:10:04,943 --> 01:10:06,883
[Next Episode]
Doctor, how is he?

954
01:10:07,043 --> 01:10:09,933
Please calm down. We still don’t know if there’s congestion or not.

955
01:10:09,933 --> 01:10:12,173
We should give him a thorough checkup first.

956
01:10:13,183 --> 01:10:15,613
You’re safe now, Jom. I’m right here.

957
01:10:16,283 --> 01:10:17,083
Tee.

958
01:10:17,813 --> 01:10:19,243
Whose car is it? Never seen it before.

959
01:10:21,543 --> 01:10:22,453
Tee.

960
01:10:23,673 --> 01:10:26,073
What is Tee to you?

961
01:10:26,083 --> 01:10:28,583
Do you really believe Tee is here just for work?

962
01:10:28,883 --> 01:10:30,583
That’s what he said so.

963
01:10:31,083 --> 01:10:32,133
No need to worry about it.

964
01:10:32,243 --> 01:10:33,483
Where’s Jom?

965
01:10:33,643 --> 01:10:35,983
He went out with Tee to talk to the villagers.

966
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:38,413
Yo! Why’s he in such a hurry?

967
01:10:38,613 --> 01:10:40,683
We want to talk to you about something.

968
01:10:41,043 --> 01:10:42,583
We want you to come home.
