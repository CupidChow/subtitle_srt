Otherwise, I’d have been stung by the bees too.

48

Huh? I thought you said we shouldn’t avoid the bees by jumping into the water.

That’s not what I meant.

What if they’re giant honeybees?

51
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:52,060
They would only keep swarming around there until you come out of the water.

52
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,130
It’d be better to get in the car

53

189
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:28,900
Where is he?!

190
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,100
Are you going to tell me nicely, or do you want me to beat you up first?

Hey, speaking of the devil.

198
00:17:16,723 --> 00:17:19,563
Are you having a good time there?

199
00:17:19,683 --> 00:17:22,983
Good time my arse. I almost went to heaven for real.

200
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:25,183
What happened?

201
00:17:31,113 --> 00:17:32,383
If you still value your life,

202
00:17:32,783 --> 00:17:34,143
just keep quiet!

203
00:17:34,313 --> 00:17:35,713
Hey, call Sack and tell him

204
00:17:35,843 --> 00:17:36,883
we’ve got the guy.

205
00:17:36,883 --> 00:17:37,843
Okay.

206
00:17:38,113 --> 00:17:38,923
What?

207
00:17:39,123 --> 00:17:41,603
Has Sack already found out where you are?

208
00:17:41,683 --> 00:17:42,483
Yeah

209
00:17:42,743 --> 00:17:44,643
Luckily, someone here saved me.

Or else,

211
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:48,383
I wouldn’t have been here talking to you guys like this.

212
00:17:49,713 --> 00:17:51,043
Hang on, Yo.

213
00:17:52,283 --> 00:17:54,243
Are you sure those guys are Sack’s minions?

214
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:57,543
Of course.

215
00:17:57,883 --> 00:17:59,283
But I don’t think so.

216
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:00,713
Why?

217
00:18:01,383 --> 00:18:02,183
Sack and his men,

218
00:18:02,383 --> 00:18:03,943
came to see us yesterday.

219
00:18:04,313 --> 00:18:05,483
He wanted to know where you are.

220
00:18:06,443 --> 00:18:08,203
How could he have sent someone to hurt you there?

221
00:18:08,483 --> 00:18:09,683
That’s what I want to know too.

222
00:18:10,043 --> 00:18:11,983
Have you told anyone that I’m here?

223
00:18:12,783 --> 00:18:13,583
‘Course not.

224
00:18:13,943 --> 00:18:15,643
You said we shouldn’t contact you.

225
00:18:15,743 --> 00:18:17,343
Because you’re afraid Sack might come looking for you.

226
00:18:17,743 --> 00:18:19,883
Otherwise, we would’ve called you since yesterday.

227
00:18:22,043 --> 00:18:24,083
Did Sack and his guys do anything to you?

228
00:18:24,543 --> 00:18:25,843
We almost got beaten up.

229
00:18:29,043 --> 00:18:32,243
Jeez, what kind of colour is this? Why is it not coming off?

230
00:18:34,143 --> 00:18:35,313
I’ll go get more soap.

231
00:18:35,743 --> 00:18:36,883
Wanna tag along, Fah?

232
00:18:37,143 --> 00:18:38,923
Yeah, I have one in my bag.

233
00:18:39,483 --> 00:18:40,443
We’ll be right back, Bank.

234
00:18:44,113 --> 00:18:45,783
Oh! You can actually wash it off.

235
00:18:47,343 --> 00:18:48,583
How about here?

he would remember what he did to me.

What the f*** are you talking about? Make it clear.

279
00:21:22,483 --> 00:21:27,243
Well, Bank found out that Yo tried to hit on Fah.

280
00:21:32,883 --> 00:21:33,683
Right?

281
00:21:33,983 --> 00:21:34,683
Yes.

282
00:21:34,883 --> 00:21:38,723
I found out he did that behind my back despite knowing that Fah and I are dating.

283
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,163
So, we decided to block his call and delete his LINE contact.

284
00:21:53,923 --> 00:21:56,923
He’s not our friend any more. We don’t give a damn where he is right now.

That’s right. What a bastard. Trying to hit on your and my girlfriends.

286
00:22:03,043 --> 00:22:05,483
I think he’s a psycho who likes to flirt with other people’s wives.

287

For not telling them where you are, right?

292
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:33,443
For making me a psycho who loves to hit on someone else’s wives.

293

Where did you get that idea from?

294
00:22:34,883 --> 00:22:36,913
I really didn’t know what to do then.

295
00:22:37,883 --> 00:22:38,543
So,

296
00:22:38,543 --> 00:22:41,443
you decided to make me and Yo look bad?

297
00:22:42,243 --> 00:22:43,483
Or do you want to be a dead body instead?

298

If I hadn’t lied like that,

299
00:22:45,443 --> 00:22:46,943
do you think he would’ve let us go?

Haven’t you had enough?

304
00:23:00,543 --> 00:23:02,483
You know well why you ended up being there.

305

Or do you want him to come after us again?

Fah,

307
00:23:06,483 --> 00:23:08,243
just listen to me first.

308
00:23:09,743 --> 00:23:10,713
I was going to say that

309
00:23:10,983 --> 00:23:13,243
if Mix goes looking for me,

310
00:23:13,543 --> 00:23:14,783
just tell her you don’t know anything.

311
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:16,843
That you can’t contact me.

312
00:23:17,143 --> 00:23:17,943

bother you again.

Aren’t you guys hurt getting stung by those bees this morning?

324
00:24:32,113 --> 00:24:33,383
Of course, we are.

325
00:24:34,283 --> 00:24:37,783
But Oat said that the pain would feel worse if we keep staying still.

326
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:40,883
That’s because Jom used to tell me...

327
00:24:41,203 --> 00:24:44,843
that if we do anything that makes us happy, we’d eventually forget the pain.

328
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:49,283
That’s rubbish. I think you’re using him as an excuse to play football.

329
00:24:51,243 --> 00:24:53,543
Where is Chief? Have you guys seen him?

330
00:24:55,343 --> 00:24:56,683
Hmmm...nope.

331
00:24:57,183 --> 00:25:00,763
Not a clue. There’re only three kids around here.

332
00:25:01,723 --> 00:25:04,383
Oh, or maybe four?

333
00:25:05,483 --> 00:25:06,283
Don’t!

334
00:25:06,763 --> 00:25:08,483
Can’t you just answer nicely?

335
00:25:09,543 --> 00:25:11,343

Don’t worry,

338
00:25:13,713 --> 00:25:14,783
just tell me where to go

339
00:25:15,383 --> 00:25:16,183
Which way is it?

340
00:25:16,243 --> 00:25:17,483

- Okay.
- Yes.

You said you want to star in an action movie,

345
00:26:08,313 --> 00:26:10,143
so I decided to let you put on some stunts.

346
00:26:10,723 --> 00:26:12,343
Oh, I really can’t do it.

347
00:26:12,713 --> 00:26:14,513
Starring as a bad guy is one thing,

348
00:26:15,143 --> 00:26:17,563
but doing those stunts is too much for me.

350
00:26:25,513 --> 00:26:30,383
By the way, did Joi and I do a good job for our roles, Chief?

351
00:26:31,383 --> 00:26:32,243
It was quite good.

352
00:26:37,343 --> 00:26:39,643
Does that kid really have no idea,

353
00:26:39,843 --> 00:26:43,003
you made it look like we’re those guys who are coming after him?

354

Just shut up and walk!

355
00:26:47,003 --> 00:26:49,163
Call Sack and tell him that we’ve got the guy.

356
00:26:51,483 --> 00:26:52,323
You did great.

357
00:26:52,683 --> 00:26:57,043
I was worried you and Joi might get Sack’s name wrong.

358
00:26:58,323 --> 00:26:59,563
But it turned out well.

359
00:26:59,963 --> 00:27:01,923
Did you get hurt though?

360
00:27:01,923 --> 00:27:02,883
Do you want to go see the doctor?

361
00:27:03,443 --> 00:27:07,143
Oh, it’s nothing. That kid can barely give me a scracth.

Is that why you weren’t scared?

You weren’t scared those guys might hurt you...

366
00:27:29,913 --> 00:27:31,713
because you were the one who set this up.

367

Leave me alone.

379
00:27:54,643 --> 00:27:55,713
What’s your excuse this time?

380
00:27:56,843 --> 00:27:57,913
I don’t have any excuse.

381
00:27:59,113 --> 00:28:00,843
I just want to explain to you.

382
00:28:03,713 --> 00:28:04,513
Say it then!

383
00:28:04,843 --> 00:28:06,283
What other lies are you going to tell me?

384
00:28:07,543 --> 00:28:08,343
Fine!

385
00:28:08,983 --> 00:28:09,883
I admit that

386
00:28:10,383 --> 00:28:11,713
what you heard earlier is true.

387
00:28:11,913 --> 00:28:14,543
That I asked Sert to pretend to be Sack’s guy.

388
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:16,743
I already knew that.

389
00:28:18,143 --> 00:28:19,283
What I want to know is,

390
00:28:20,713 --> 00:28:21,583
why you did it?

391
00:28:22,643 --> 00:28:23,783
Was it to get attention?

392
00:28:24,143 --> 00:28:25,443
Or to fulfill your dream as an actor?

393
00:28:26,943 --> 00:28:28,543
I just didn’t want you to go back to Bangkok.

394
00:28:30,943 --> 00:28:32,283

00:28:37,803 --> 00:28:39,723
you could’ve got hurt badly or even killed.

398
00:28:43,683 --> 00:28:44,913
I did all this because...

399
00:28:46,513 --> 00:28:48,783
I don’t want you to make any decision without thinking over it carefully.

400
00:28:50,343 --> 00:28:54,443
If anything bad happens, the one who’d feel sorry the most is your parents.

401
00:28:55,403 --> 00:28:57,203
Stop using my parents as an excuse.

402
00:28:58,483 --> 00:29:02,483
Knowing Sack wanting to kill me or getting me beaten up so badly…

403
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,563
doesn’t make me feel so pissed as when someone is seeing me as a fool!

Why not?

I know that visiting and checking on the village people is your main responsibility as a chief.

00:42:33,316 --> 00:42:36,416
But we also have another thing as our soft power. Do you know what it is?

552
00:42:39,516 --> 00:42:41,016
It’s Prik, my wife, Chief.

553
00:42:41,416 --> 00:42:42,616
- Hey!
- She’s so unique.

554
00:42:43,116 --> 00:42:47,096
The ladies in Pho Chai surely are special and look so fine.

555
00:42:47,446 --> 00:42:49,936
But there’s one more thing special about our Pho Chai village.

556
00:42:49,936 --> 00:42:52,736
We can even claim it against the world.

557
00:42:52,846 --> 00:42:53,376
What is it?

558
00:42:53,376 --> 00:42:55,016
That soft power is…

559
00:42:55,216 --> 00:42:57,056
our smile!

560
00:43:00,016 --> 00:43:01,856
Let’s show off our smiles together.

561
00:43:02,456 --> 00:43:03,216
Okay.

562
00:43:03,216 --> 00:43:05,216
When I say ‘Pho’, everyone can say ‘Chai’.

563
00:43:05,216 --> 00:43:07,056
Ready? One, two…

564
00:43:07,056 --> 00:43:07,616
Pho!

565
00:43:07,616 --> 00:43:08,216
Chai!

566
00:43:08,216 --> 00:43:09,056
Pho!

567
00:43:09,056 --> 00:43:09,536
Chai!

568
00:43:09,536 --> 00:43:10,376
Pho!

569
00:43:10,376 --> 00:43:12,776
Chai!

570
00:43:13,416 --> 00:43:14,096
Good job, everyone.

571
00:43:14,096 --> 00:43:17,696
And that’s our village’s no.1 soft power.

572
00:43:18,256 --> 00:43:19,616
It’s our smile.

573
00:43:20,976 --> 00:43:22,446
You have a beautiful smile, Chief.

574
00:43:22,916 --> 00:43:23,816
Just like you, Granny.

575
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,896
That’s my boy.

576
00:43:26,276 --> 00:43:27,846
Are you guys jealous?

577

[🎵If I weren’t that cool or such a badass🎵]

578
00:43:56,656 --> 00:44:00,056
[🎵My life would’ve been so plain and simple]🎵]

579
00:44:00,056 --> 00:44:03,296
[🎵But since I’m so cool and such an ass kicker]🎵]

580
00:44:03,296 --> 00:44:08,336
[🎵I have to flee before danger’d come knocking on my door]🎵]

581
00:44:13,336 --> 00:44:16,616
[🎵Running away to find myself even more restless]🎵]

582
00:44:16,616 --> 00:44:19,896
[🎵Because I’ve met someone who keeps making my heart fluttering]🎵]

583
00:44:19,896 --> 00:44:23,176
[🎵What to do now? I can’t stop how I feel anymore]🎵]

584
00:44:23,176 --> 00:44:27,536
[🎵I’m so thrilled whenever I’m near you🎵]

585
00:44:27,536 --> 00:44:30,896
[🎵Lying to the whole world is so easy🎵]

586
00:44:30,896 --> 00:44:36,176
[🎵But lying to yourself is such a pity🎵]

587
00:44:36,496 --> 00:44:42,816
[🎵So stubborn I never trust anyone but my own heart🎵]

588
00:44:43,016 --> 00:44:45,296
[🎵You’re the right one for me🎵]

589
00:44:45,296 --> 00:44:49,496
[🎵My heart knows better than anyone🎵]

590
00:44:49,496 --> 00:44:56,096
[🎵It’s beating so fast when you’re near, and feels uneasy when we’re apart🎵]

591
00:44:56,096 --> 00:45:03,016
[🎵I don’t care what they’d say, I just want the world to know🎵]

592
00:45:03,016 --> 00:45:07,696
[🎵That you’re my sweetheart🎵]
[My Sweetheart Jom]

593
00:45:34,246 --> 00:45:37,336
I never thought that just making Krayasat…

594
00:45:37,336 --> 00:45:38,616
would be this exhausting.

595
00:45:38,856 --> 00:45:41,216
My back aches so much.

596
00:45:41,216 --> 00:45:42,456
My dear little sister,

597
00:45:43,276 --> 00:45:47,896
you should’ve been more aware of how old you are.

598
00:45:49,136 --> 00:45:51,516
Are you saying that I’m too old?

599
00:45:52,316 --> 00:45:54,576
I haven’t said anything yet. You said it yourself, little sister.

600
00:45:54,816 --> 00:45:55,916
Fine. I get it!

601
00:45:56,216 --> 00:45:58,976
How about you sit here and rest first?

602
00:45:58,976 --> 00:46:01,936
This big brother of yours will go get some water for you.

603
00:46:01,936 --> 00:46:03,176
So that you’d feel freshened up.

604
00:46:03,276 --> 00:46:04,076
Yes, Brother.

605
00:46:04,476 --> 00:46:06,116
Just a second. I’ll be right back.

606
00:46:06,646 --> 00:46:07,446
I’ll be right back.

607
00:46:09,176 --> 00:46:10,056
Make it quick!

608
00:46:10,056 --> 00:46:10,816
Yes.

609
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:11,976
So annoying.

610
00:46:15,776 --> 00:46:16,456
Careful, Granny.

611
00:46:17,046 --> 00:46:19,896
Yo? Thank you, dear. Thanks a lot.

612
00:46:19,896 --> 00:46:20,576
Please sit down first.

613
00:46:20,576 --> 00:46:22,416
Yeah, it’s aching everywhere.

614
00:46:22,876 --> 00:46:25,896
Jeez, almost like a cripple, aren’t I?

615
00:46:27,116 --> 00:46:28,446
What a day.

616
00:46:29,076 --> 00:46:30,116
So,

617
00:46:30,616 --> 00:46:32,516
did you enjoy it?

618
00:46:35,446 --> 00:46:36,416
Yes, I did.

619
00:46:36,456 --> 00:46:40,856
That’s just an appetizer though. Wait until you see our annual event.

620
00:46:40,876 --> 00:46:41,976
It’s much more fun.

621
00:46:42,916 --> 00:46:45,016
Oh but, by then…

622
00:46:45,016 --> 00:46:46,896
it’ll probably be your school holiday.

623
00:46:47,246 --> 00:46:49,476
That’s right. It’ll be during your school holiday.

624
00:46:50,046 --> 00:46:50,846
Well,

625
00:46:53,246 --> 00:46:54,046
Granny…

626
00:46:54,516 --> 00:46:55,016
What is it, dear?

627
00:46:55,016 --> 00:46:56,336
Yo! Granny!

628
00:46:57,176 --> 00:46:59,316
Are you okay? I heard you moaning quite loud.

629
00:46:59,476 --> 00:47:01,316
I’m okay. Just aching here and there.

630
00:47:01,776 --> 00:47:03,876
By the way, what were you going to ask me, Yo?

631
00:47:08,876 --> 00:47:09,716
What is it, dear?

632
00:47:09,976 --> 00:47:13,536
Nothing. I just wanted to suggest you to try a warm compress.

633
00:47:13,816 --> 00:47:14,896
It might help.

634
00:47:15,016 --> 00:47:17,896
Oh, let’s not make it a big deal.

635
00:47:17,896 --> 00:47:22,296
I’ll get some rest tonight and by tomorrow morning I’ll be fine.

636
00:47:22,646 --> 00:47:24,296
Right? Look, Yo.

637
00:47:24,296 --> 00:47:25,216
See that?

638
00:47:26,446 --> 00:47:27,376
Are you sure, Granny?

639
00:47:27,676 --> 00:47:29,656
Yes! I’m still fit.

640
00:47:30,216 --> 00:47:32,116
- I’m off now.
- Take lots of rest, little sister. Get well soon.

641
00:47:32,446 --> 00:47:34,816
It’s late, you two should go to bed too.

642
00:47:35,116 --> 00:47:36,216
Good night, little sister.

643
00:47:55,016 --> 00:47:55,976

Did you just steal something?

645
00:47:58,216 --> 00:47:59,016
No, I didn’t!

646

- Guards!
- Hey!

647
00:48:00,936 --> 00:48:01,576
Guards!

648
00:48:01,896 --> 00:48:03,016
Run! What are you waiting for?

It’s me.

654
00:49:21,864 --> 00:49:25,094
I saw those scars you got from the bees are still swollen.

655
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:27,794
So, I brought you some painkillers.

656
00:49:36,794 --> 00:49:38,554
How are you going to tell Granny?

657
00:49:39,474 --> 00:49:41,274
About me going back to Bangkok tomorrow.

658
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:47,994
I’ll just be honest.

659
00:49:49,664 --> 00:49:50,934
But I’ll tell her tomorrow.

660
00:49:51,664 --> 00:49:52,694
If I tell her now,

661
00:49:54,594 --> 00:49:56,234
she’d never let you go back.

662
00:50:13,064 --> 00:50:14,534
Take those pills and apply some balm too.

663
00:50:15,534 --> 00:50:16,394
I’m off to bed now.

00:55:50,064 --> 00:55:51,834
Aren’t we done here?

732
00:55:52,264 --> 00:55:53,594
I’m going to settle the payment.

733
00:55:54,194 --> 00:55:55,234
Try them on first.

734
00:55:56,494 --> 00:55:57,634
Do I have to do that?

735
00:55:57,834 --> 00:55:58,514
Mhm.

736
00:55:59,494 --> 00:56:00,234
Here.

737
00:56:00,234 --> 00:56:01,194
Go try it on

738
00:56:01,694 --> 00:56:03,694
How would you know whether it fits or not?

739
00:56:05,034 --> 00:56:06,434
Go on. The fitting room is at the back.

740
00:56:17,064 --> 00:56:17,864
I’m done.

741
00:56:20,934 --> 00:56:21,734
How is it?

742
00:56:26,834 --> 00:56:27,634
Does it fit?

743
00:56:34,834 --> 00:56:35,664
Why are you laughing?

744
00:56:36,664 --> 00:56:37,534
What’s so funny?

745
00:56:38,234 --> 00:56:39,034
Nothing.

746
00:56:39,934 --> 00:56:42,234
Seeing you in this uniform reminds me…

747
00:56:43,634 --> 00:56:45,034
that you’re still a kid.

748
00:56:46,934 --> 00:56:47,734
Who’s a kid?!

749
00:56:48,664 --> 00:56:50,294
I dropped out for two years.

750
00:56:51,434 --> 00:56:52,594
In just two months,

751
00:56:52,864 --> 00:56:54,834
I’ll be of legal age.

752
00:56:56,394 --> 00:56:57,194
I’m an adult.

753
00:56:58,864 --> 00:56:59,934
Whatever you say.

754
00:57:01,834 --> 00:57:04,864
But you look good in this uniform.

755
00:57:07,694 --> 00:57:08,494
What do you mean?

756
00:57:09,834 --> 00:57:12,194
Well, you look your age.

757
00:57:13,994 --> 00:57:15,894
Now, go changed.

758
00:57:16,434 --> 00:57:17,994
I’ll take you to buy something else.

759
00:57:27,394 --> 00:57:28,394
Is there anything else you want?

760
00:57:30,334 --> 00:57:33,394
If I tell you, will you be able to buy it for me?

761
00:57:35,294 --> 00:57:36,434
Try me then.

762
00:57:39,134 --> 00:57:40,234
Is that Jom?

763
00:57:44,094 --> 00:57:45,234
It’s really Jom.

[Knocking on window]

765
00:57:47,994 --> 00:57:49,864
Bro and sis-in-law.

766
00:57:51,694 --> 00:57:52,864
We'd better go see him

767
00:57:57,464 --> 00:57:58,594
Watch out

768
00:58:03,264 --> 00:58:04,134
What are you doing here?

769
00:58:05,294 --> 00:58:06,994
I’m here to buy uniforms for him.

770
00:58:07,734 --> 00:58:09,264
This is Ji,

771
00:58:09,534 --> 00:58:10,334
my older brother.

772
00:58:10,834 --> 00:58:12,864
And that’s Meaw, my sister-in-law.

773
00:58:18,064 --> 00:58:18,864
Hello.

774
00:58:19,664 --> 00:58:20,594
Hello.

775
00:58:21,434 --> 00:58:22,534
This is Yotin.

776
00:58:22,894 --> 00:58:24,194
He’s Headman Kla’s nephew.

777
00:58:25,034 --> 00:58:26,294
His parents want him,

778
00:58:26,494 --> 00:58:27,434
to study here.

779
00:58:27,494 --> 00:58:28,734
So, they’ve left him under Granny’s care.

780
00:58:31,534 --> 00:58:36,294
Headman Kla’s nephew? I don’t quite see the resemblance though

781
00:58:37,634 --> 00:58:40,314
He looks like a mix-raced, doesn’t he?

782
00:58:40,314 --> 00:58:42,114
Most kids these days are like that.

783
00:58:42,664 --> 00:58:44,514
By the way, what are you two doing here?

784
00:58:44,874 --> 00:58:48,994
Is it to buy a birthday gift for the little one?

785
00:58:49,994 --> 00:58:52,554
Oh, not yet. I still have many more months to go.

786
00:58:52,674 --> 00:58:55,074
And actually, you shouldn’t buy it beforehand.

787
00:58:55,194 --> 00:58:56,314
It’s a jinx.

788
00:58:56,314 --> 00:58:59,994
We’re here to get some ingredients to cook for Pa’s birthday.

789
00:59:02,094 --> 00:59:02,894
Yeah

790
00:59:03,134 --> 00:59:04,294
It’s good that we met.

791
00:59:06,994 --> 00:59:08,594
I want to talk to you about our Pa.

792
00:59:19,034 --> 00:59:19,594
Yes.

793
00:59:20,074 --> 00:59:20,834
Yo.

794
00:59:21,074 --> 00:59:23,594
You can go look around first.

795
00:59:23,834 --> 00:59:25,994
I’ll call you when I’m done.

796
00:59:37,594 --> 00:59:38,694
What’s wrong with Pa?

797
00:59:42,394 --> 00:59:45,834
Let’s find some place to talk.

798
00:59:46,914 --> 00:59:47,474
Yes.

799
01:01:50,954 --> 01:01:51,634
Oh!

800
01:01:52,734 --> 01:01:53,534
I’m sorry.

801
01:01:55,034 --> 01:01:55,834
It’s all right.

802
01:01:57,334 --> 01:01:58,264
Hey!

803
01:01:59,194 --> 01:02:00,334
Did you just steal something?

804
01:02:01,434 --> 01:02:02,894
No, I didn’t!

805
01:02:03,594 --> 01:02:04,594
No! Miss!

806
01:02:05,034 --> 01:02:07,034
Please tell him I didn’t do anything.

807
01:02:07,094 --> 01:02:08,734
I just came out of the shop.

808
01:02:08,934 --> 01:02:10,064
I saw you stealing something.

809
01:02:10,514 --> 01:02:11,434
No! I didn’t do it!

810
01:02:11,934 --> 01:02:12,794
-Guards!
-Hey!

811
01:02:13,334 --> 01:02:14,134
Thief!!

812
01:02:14,134 --> 01:02:16,474
I believe you that you didn’t steal anything.

813
01:02:17,494 --> 01:02:19,154
It was her who did that.

814
01:02:19,994 --> 01:02:21,464
It’s that girl in yellow.

815
01:02:21,664 --> 01:02:22,294

That one! She’s a thief!

817
01:02:24,064 --> 01:02:25,794
Calm down.

818
01:02:26,094 --> 01:02:26,894
Which one?

819
01:02:26,994 --> 01:02:28,294
That girl right there!

820
01:02:29,064 --> 01:02:30,064
You mean that one?

821

No! The one in yellow!

822
01:02:31,934 --> 01:02:34,154
Both of them are wearing yellow. Which one?

823
01:02:34,264 --> 01:02:35,334
That yellow!

824
01:02:36,234 --> 01:02:37,034
