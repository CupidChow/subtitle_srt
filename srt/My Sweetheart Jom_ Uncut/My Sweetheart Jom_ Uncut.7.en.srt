Toey, do you know what this is?

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,330
The computer at the shop got a virus because of me.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,060
You have to do this to pay off the debt, right?

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:07,300
I’m returning your stuff.

5
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,500
And also pay for what Toey owes you.

6
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:12,060
I can’t believe he’d skip classes to play games.

7
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,180
You do know that game shop…

8
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,900
is not actually selling games, don’t you?

9
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,020
You think I went there to buy drugs?

10
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,530
If that’s what you really think…

11
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,060
you can call my dad to take me back right now.

12
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:27,900
Yo!

13
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:28,700
Yo!

14
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:29,900
I’m sorry, Yo.

15
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:31,560
Toey told me everything.

16
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,600
I don’t want to make everyone in the house feel awkward.

17
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,940
See? You only apologize because you don’t want them to feel awkward.

18
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:39,530
Yo!

19
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,140
[Sigh]

20
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,930
What are you doing, Sert?

21
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,530
Oh, it’s you. You gave me a fright.

22
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,140
Why are you so surprised?

23
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,140
I thought you were Chief Jom.

24
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,620
He doesn’t like anyone smoking.

25
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,220
Last time when one of us sneakily smoked…

26
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,940
and got caught by Chief Jom,

27
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,460
he fired him.

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,960
So, Chief hates smokers?

29
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:29,460
That’s right. But I also don’t know,

30
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,260
why he hates them so much.

31
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,300
Anyway, can you please not tell Chief that

32
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,060
you saw me smoking here?

33
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,900
Oh, please don’t worry.

34
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,660
Why would I tell him?

35
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,620
Thank you so much.

36
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,000
No problem.

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,780
Please excuse me then. I must get to work.

38
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,060
Sure.

Jomkwan: Have you reported it to the police?

57
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:26,700
Anongnart: Yes.

58
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:30,380
Anongnart: But they only see it as a public quarrel.

59
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,820
Anongnart: But I think otherwise.

60
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,620
Are you saying…

61
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,540
that someone is actually behind all this mess?

62
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,140
I don’t know who exactly.

63
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,060
Maybe it’s some thugs or junkies in the area.

64
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:46,780
Or it might be other gangsters who want to expand their network here.

65
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:51,140
So, I want you and the headman to please help look into it.

66
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,500
Don’t worry. We’ll take care of it.

67
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,060
Bye.

68
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,820
[Sigh]

69
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,460
Chief. Chief.

70
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,400
Yes?

71
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,180
I just talked to the engineers.

72
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,420
They said most of the workers got mild injuries.

73
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,100
But one got stabbed.

74
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,260
He’s already been sent to the provincial hospital.

75
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,500
They also said that…

76
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:19,780
the night before the incident,

77
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,180
the workers’ truck tires were pierced.

78
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,860
And before that,

79
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:29,660
someone had sneaked in to cut the power cord of the generator.

80
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,500
All these incidents in Huay Takay…

81
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,660
are solely your and my responsibilities.

82
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:42,740
We have to find the culprit as soon as possible.

83
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,260
Yes.

84
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:54,340
Miss Anongnart thinks Paisarn might be behind all this.

85
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,980
Hm, what’s with that smirk?

86
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,980
Don’t tell me you’re also thinking the same thing.

87
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,820
In a few days,

88
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,380
the auction result will be revealed.

89
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,940
There are two companies bidding this time.

90
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,340
One is owned by Paisarn. The other is by Miss Anongnart.

91
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:21,980
I see. Are you saying…

92
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,900
that Paisarn is trying to threaten Miss Anongnart?

93
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,580
So that she’d withdraw from the auction. Is that right?

94
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,380
Yes.

95
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,820
All these incidents seem to point out to him.

96
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:40,800
But I don’t think we can do anything now since we still don’t have evidence.

97
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:45,340
The only thing we can do is a quick fix to get everything back on track.

98
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:50,020
Can you please help find worker replacements for Miss Anongnart?

99
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,140
That won’t be a problem.

100
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,220
It’s you whom I’m worried about.

101
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,060
You often go around alone. Please be careful.

102
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,660
They are playing dirty even when the auction result is not out yet.

103
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,020
I can’t imagine what would happen…

104
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:09,100
if it turns out that Miss Anongnart wins the auction.

105
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,580
[Sigh]

106
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,140
That’s what I’m afraid too.

107
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,180
Okay then.

108
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,780
I’ll see you off here. Have to get back to work.

109
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,660
Thank you, Uncle.

110
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,360
See you, Chief. Drive safe.

111
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,700
[Sigh]

112
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,540
[Bell sound]

113
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,260
Here’s your pizza.

114
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:48,960
Thank you.

115
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,160
I even went into town to get this for you.

116
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,260
Please don’t be mad at me for long.

117
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:25,140
[Exciting sound]

118
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,060
Do you also smoke?

119
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,200
I’m bored.

120
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,360
It’s just to kill time.

121
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,400
If you have nothing to do,

122
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,860
why don’t you go play football instead?

123
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,700
Why?

124
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:03,360
Do you hate smokers?

125
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:08,260
Do you want some?

126
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,620
It’s really good.

127
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,130
No, Yo. I don’t like it.

128
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,500
You don’t like it?

129
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,500
Then call my dad to pick me up right now.

130
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,660
Hey!

131
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,740
Stop crying. Shut up.

132
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,700
Why the fuck are you crying?

133
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,300
Huh?!

134
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,130
Why?

135
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,660
I said shut up! Stop crying, brat!

136
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,160
Call my dad to pick me up right now.

137
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,900
I’m your burden anyway.

138
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,180
Hey!

139
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,740
Jom!

140
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,940
Jom! What’s wrong?

141
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,060
Granny! Granny!

142
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,220
Please stay with me.

143
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,140
Help!

144
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,500
Help!

145
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,700
Help, Granny!

146
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,360
Granny!

147
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,700
What’s going on?

148
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:47,740
Help! Jom.

149
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,540
What’s going on?

150
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,460
He just passed out.

151
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:58,100
Give him to me. Move over.

152
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,220
His hands.

153
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,300
Pry his fingers off. On both hands. His body is getting tense.

154
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,860
Take a deep breath, dear. I’m right here.

155
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:14,220
[Exciting sound]

156
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,360
Are you sure we don’t need to take him to the hospital?

157
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,900
It’s all right. He’ll get better soon.

158
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,130
What’s wrong with him?

159
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:51,130
It’s a panic disorder from the fear of his past.

160
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:55,360
The doctor said it’s called P-P-D-D or something like that (PTSD).

161
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,740
He’s had this syndrome since when he was little.

162
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,760
But I thought he’s already cured.

163
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,900
How come it happens again?

164
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,500
My boy.

165
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,060
Granny.

166
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,160
I was the one who triggered it with cigarettes.

167
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,820
I didn’t mean it.

168
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:34,260
I had no idea he’d react like this.

169
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,220
I’m sorry, Granny.

170
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,600
I’m so sorry.

171
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,940
It’s okay, dear. It’s okay.

172
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,620
What’s done is done.

173
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,200
You’ll be all right, Jom.

174
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:00,260
This thing will be gone just like before.

175
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,020
Yo.

176
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,140
Come out and talk to me for a second.

177
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:53,500
What is it, Granny?

178
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,260
I don’t want Jom to keep being reminded about his past.

179
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,380
He was abused by his nanny when he was young.

180
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,580
With cigarette burns.

181
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,300
That’s what she did to him.

182
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:10,700
His parents were so focused on work.

183
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:14,420
So busy making a living they hardly had time for their son.

184
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,580
That’s why they hired a nanny to look after Jom.

185
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:20,260
Didn’t his parents have any clue about this?

186
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,740
How could they?

187
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,620
That bitch was no fool.

188
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:28,540
She made sure all the marks were hidden under his clothes.

189
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,460
She even threatened Jom.

190
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,340
That if he ever told anyone about it,

191
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,100
she’d kill everyone in his family.

192
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:39,140
Luckily, his teachers noticed something wrong.

193
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,580
They noticed he suddenly looked sad and gloomy.

194
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,740
So, they tried to make him speak.

195
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,140
When his parents found out,

196
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:49,380
they reported the police and had her thrown into jail.

197
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,620
That’s why Jom hates cigarettes.

198
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,780
It took quite a long time for him to cure it.

199
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,740
I’m so sorry, Granny.

200
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:09,560
I promise that I’ll never touch cigarettes again.

201
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,620
That’s good, dear. That’d be wonderful.

202
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,980
Don’t ever touch them.

203
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,580
They would only harm you.

204
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,740
Let’s go get some showers.

205
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:25,060
I think I’ll sleep here in case Jom needs anything.

206
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,020
Let’s shower and get some rest.

207
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,660
Can I stay here instead?

208
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,300
I’m the one who made him like that.

209
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,530
I want to take responsibility for what I did.

210
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,600
I’m sorry.

211
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,260
I’m scared.

212
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,300
Hey.

213
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,200
I’m scared.

214
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,100
Don’t be scared.

215
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,260
I’m right here.

216
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,560
I’m scared.

217
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:35,800
You’re safe now.

218
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,160
I’m right here.

What’s Jom’s brother called?

222
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,180
Granny said all Jom’s siblings have their names begin with J.

Yo.

229
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,328
Why are you sleeping here?

230
00:17:53,608 --> 00:17:55,368
It was supposed to be Granny at first.

231
00:17:56,328 --> 00:17:57,968
But I didn’t want to trouble her.

232
00:17:58,448 --> 00:18:00,168
So, I volunteered to do it instead.

233
00:18:01,328 --> 00:18:03,648
How are you feeling? Do you still have a headache?

234
00:18:06,248 --> 00:18:07,688
Just a little.

235
00:18:08,008 --> 00:18:09,528
It should be okay soon.

236
00:18:11,128 --> 00:18:14,368
Staying by my bedside all night like this, does this mean…

237
00:18:15,728 --> 00:18:17,448
Granny already told you everything?

238
00:18:17,968 --> 00:18:19,168
About why I’m like this.

239
00:18:20,928 --> 00:18:21,728
I’m sorry.

240
00:18:26,288 --> 00:18:27,088
It’s okay.

241
00:18:28,248 --> 00:18:31,008
You didn’t know. It wasn’t your fault.

242
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,848
You treated me badly once.

243
00:18:33,688 --> 00:18:36,488
I also talked badly to you once. So…

244
00:18:37,848 --> 00:18:39,208
let’s say we’re even.

245
00:18:40,488 --> 00:18:42,448
Let’s make up.

246
00:18:46,328 --> 00:18:49,008
Geez, you always act like a child.

247
00:18:50,968 --> 00:18:52,648
Fine, let’s say we’re even.

248
00:18:53,808 --> 00:18:56,288
I’m going back to my room then.

249
00:18:58,648 --> 00:19:01,528
Staying by your bedside, I hardly slept last night.

250
00:19:33,128 --> 00:19:33,968
Todd!

251
00:19:33,968 --> 00:19:35,488
Why are you here alone?

252
00:19:35,488 --> 00:19:36,288
Hey, Yo

253
00:19:36,288 --> 00:19:37,088
Where are the others?

254
00:19:37,728 --> 00:19:40,208
Toey and Oat went to help Granny harvest lotus.

255
00:19:40,488 --> 00:19:41,648
I’m home alone.

256
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:44,008
Say, what’s Jom’s brother called?

257
00:19:44,448 --> 00:19:47,048
Is it Tee or Tid?

258
00:19:47,768 --> 00:19:49,008
It’s Ji.

259
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,088
His brother’s called Ji.

260
00:19:51,088 --> 00:19:52,808
But I don’t know his full name though.

261
00:19:52,808 --> 00:19:55,168
I just know Granny used to say…

262
00:19:55,168 --> 00:19:57,408
that all Jom’s siblings have their names begin with J.

263
00:19:57,408 --> 00:19:58,528
Why?

264
00:19:59,248 --> 00:20:00,368
Oh, nothing.

265
00:20:01,128 --> 00:20:02,888
I ran into his brother the other day.

266
00:20:03,528 --> 00:20:04,328
But I couldn’t remember his name.

267
00:20:05,008 --> 00:20:06,208
It was on the tip of my tongue.

268
00:20:06,888 --> 00:20:08,368
It’s good you still remember.

269
00:20:08,768 --> 00:20:09,568
Of course.

270
00:20:10,688 --> 00:20:13,048
Hey, can you help me water…

271
00:20:14,408 --> 00:20:15,888
the plants?

272
00:20:38,248 --> 00:20:39,248
Thank you.

273
00:20:50,768 --> 00:20:51,768
Thank you.

274
00:21:00,088 --> 00:21:01,848
Thank you, Tee.

276
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:23,768
Thank you, Tee.

277
00:21:37,568 --> 00:21:39,608
Who the heck is Tee?

278
00:22:20,888 --> 00:22:22,768
Why are they still not back yet?

279
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:31,848
And why am I so curious about this guy Tee?

280
00:22:35,848 --> 00:22:37,208
[Sigh]

281
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:40,448
Ah, feels so good.

282
00:22:42,168 --> 00:22:44,248
Geez, Granny. Your quad isn’t working…

283
00:22:44,248 --> 00:22:45,648
and you don’t even allow us to sit on it.

284
00:22:45,808 --> 00:22:47,488
Why on earth would you ask us to wear helmets then?

285
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,368
It’s good for you though.

286
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:52,288
It helps protect you when accidents happen.

287
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:54,088
And it can also protect you from cops.

288
00:22:54,088 --> 00:22:55,648
Now, pull over.

289
00:22:55,648 --> 00:22:57,808
This way, both of you will get to exercise too.

290
00:22:58,288 --> 00:23:00,208
Go wash your hands.

291
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:01,408
And come eat lunch.

292
00:23:01,408 --> 00:23:02,848
Off you go.

293
00:23:03,568 --> 00:23:06,128
Yo, where are you going?

294
00:23:07,808 --> 00:23:09,968
I’m going to pick some vegetables from the garden for you.

295
00:23:10,008 --> 00:23:12,728
Oh, no need. I’ve got lots of lotus stems here.

296
00:23:14,608 --> 00:23:16,928
I’ll make you some stir-fried lotus stems.

297
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:17,768
Okay.

298
00:23:17,848 --> 00:23:19,928
We’ve got a lot this time. Fresh from the field.

299
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:22,608
Oh, where’s Jom?

300
00:23:22,608 --> 00:23:24,608
Is he up?

301
00:23:24,648 --> 00:23:25,608
Yes, I am.

302
00:23:27,248 --> 00:23:28,968
I saw the kids carrying lotus stems into the kitchen.

303
00:23:28,968 --> 00:23:31,768
Does this mean I’ll get to eat your stir-fried lotus stems today?

304
00:23:31,808 --> 00:23:34,648
Absolutely. You’ll surely get to eat them today.

305
00:23:34,648 --> 00:23:37,048
But, wait, are you feeling well now?

306
00:23:37,768 --> 00:23:39,088
Just a little headache.

307
00:23:39,408 --> 00:23:40,208
But I feel much better now.

308
00:23:40,248 --> 00:23:41,568
Why is that?

309
00:23:43,568 --> 00:23:45,408
Well, maybe…

310
00:23:45,928 --> 00:23:49,648
because Yotin gave me a sponge bath last night.

311
00:23:49,648 --> 00:23:51,288
So, I can recover fast.

312
00:23:53,848 --> 00:23:55,808
Don’t try to sweet-talk me.

313
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:59,928
The more you put it like that, the more I feel guilty.

314
00:24:03,248 --> 00:24:06,448
Aww, so you two have made up?

315
00:24:07,648 --> 00:24:08,408
Yes.

316
00:24:08,408 --> 00:24:09,968
That’s good.

317
00:24:09,968 --> 00:24:12,128
If you know you’re wrong, just apologize.

318
00:24:12,128 --> 00:24:13,688
Yo already did that.

319
00:24:13,688 --> 00:24:14,928
He confessed to me himself.

320
00:24:14,928 --> 00:24:17,208
And even promised he’d quit smoking.

321
00:24:18,008 --> 00:24:20,168
Where are you going, by the way?

322
00:24:22,408 --> 00:24:24,488
The Inspector just called.

323
00:24:24,728 --> 00:24:26,728
He said he got those men who tried to hurt Yo.

324
00:24:28,408 --> 00:24:29,288
Who are they?

325
00:24:34,888 --> 00:24:38,248
It’s Pol, Uncle Yod’s nephew.

326
00:24:40,848 --> 00:24:43,288
Inspector was checking the CCTV…

327
00:24:43,288 --> 00:24:46,608
and saw Pol and his guy, Lek,

328
00:24:47,088 --> 00:24:48,648
…riding the bike around that area.

329
00:24:49,088 --> 00:24:52,168
So, he knew right away it was them.

330
00:24:52,168 --> 00:24:53,248
No other cars were passing by that night.

331
00:24:54,288 --> 00:24:57,568
Can the police put them behind bars though? They haven’t committed anything yet, have they?

332
00:24:58,688 --> 00:25:00,048
That’s true.

333
00:25:00,728 --> 00:25:03,208
We might not be able to arrest them for trying to hurt Yo.

334
00:25:03,928 --> 00:25:07,568
But we can have them detained and press further charges on them about drugs.

335
00:25:10,848 --> 00:25:12,128
Will you be all right?

336
00:25:12,688 --> 00:25:13,848
Do you want me to go with you?

337
00:25:30,808 --> 00:25:32,928
So? Is it hard?

338
00:25:39,408 --> 00:25:40,728
What’s hard?

339
00:25:40,808 --> 00:25:42,608
I mean my arm muscle. Is it hard?

340
00:25:43,648 --> 00:25:47,088
I’m trying to say not to worry. See? I’m so strong.

341
00:25:48,128 --> 00:25:49,568
You should stay here with Granny.

342
00:25:50,688 --> 00:25:52,088
Where are you going then?

343
00:25:53,288 --> 00:25:54,768
To see the Inspector.

344
00:25:54,768 --> 00:25:56,168
Oh, that’s right.

345
00:25:56,168 --> 00:25:57,248
Go on. Don’t keep him waiting.

346
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:57,968
I’m going then.

347
00:25:58,048 --> 00:25:58,608
Okay.

348
00:25:59,088 --> 00:26:00,128
See you.

349
00:26:00,848 --> 00:26:02,488
Please be careful too.

350
00:26:02,768 --> 00:26:03,568
Yes.

351
00:26:07,048 --> 00:26:11,008
Yo, come help push the quad for me.

352
00:26:11,568 --> 00:26:12,368
Yo.

353
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,408
Yo…

354
00:26:14,168 --> 00:26:15,528
Yo! Geez.

355
00:26:15,688 --> 00:26:16,128
Yes?

356
00:26:16,128 --> 00:26:17,968
Are you going to let me sit here all day?

357
00:26:18,728 --> 00:26:20,008
Push it for me.

358
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:21,368
Push me inside.

359
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,088
Yes, Granny.

360
00:26:22,088 --> 00:26:23,808
Good boy.

361
00:26:24,968 --> 00:26:27,208
Oh, you’re quite strong.

362
00:26:30,848 --> 00:26:32,608

And that guy, Jo. He was also arrested.

402

I guess someone must tip the police off about that place selling drugs.

Teacher Toei said that skipping school doesn’t get you any serious punishment.

If they find out that you turn me down, how on earth could I look at them?

470
00:35:01,728 --> 00:35:05,608
How? Just look at them like you usually do.

It doesn’t matter if you don’t like me.

474

Wanna go have some vermicelli, dude?

543
00:40:32,837 --> 00:40:35,597
Neh. I have a stomachache. I’m going then.

544
00:40:40,717 --> 00:40:42,277
Do you think he’s acting weird?

545
00:40:44,517 --> 00:40:46,557
Didn’t he say he has a stomachache?

546
00:40:49,157 --> 00:40:50,357
Do you really believe him?

547
00:40:52,277 --> 00:40:55,597
I think he’s hiding something from us.

Why are you going home alone today?

551
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:11,037
Fluke said he has a stomachache. So, he already went home.

Nothing. I was just confused.

562
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:00,677
I’ll leave you two here then. I’m going to wait on Uncle Pun’s bus.

572
00:42:41,677 --> 00:42:45,677

Are you curious where I am? It’s at our school.

580
00:43:29,317 --> 00:43:35,677
Someone has asked me to meet him here today. And you know what? He’s so hot.

581
00:43:38,357 --> 00:43:40,477
Did she mean Yo?

582
00:43:42,237 --> 00:43:44,157
I think so.

583
00:43:45,157 --> 00:43:47,797
But…hasn’t he already gone home?

584
00:43:51,237 --> 00:43:53,877
Do you think I look okay now?

585
00:43:54,597 --> 00:43:56,317
But I think I do.

586
00:43:56,837 --> 00:43:59,837
Because if not, he wouldn’t have wanted to see me.

587
00:44:01,197 --> 00:44:05,157
I’m on LIVE today because I want all of you to know…

What about you? What are you doing here?

594
00:44:38,477 --> 00:44:41,477
I’m just…taking a walk. Why?

595

Well, yes. How do you know?

Why wouldn’t I?

598
00:45:00,917 --> 00:45:04,157

I don’t want you to behave so lowly like this morning.

What do you mean?

606
00:45:42,677 --> 00:45:45,157
That you were begging Yo to pretend to be your boyfriend.

608

00:57:28,579 --> 00:57:30,199
You fucking bastard!

723
00:57:41,949 --> 00:57:43,119
Stop!

724
00:57:46,719 --> 00:57:47,749
I’m an officer.

725
00:57:53,949 --> 00:57:56,819
Who the fuck are you? Don’t fucking butt in.

726
00:57:58,949 --> 00:58:02,679
Put down your weapon. I’m the village chief here.

727
00:58:03,519 --> 00:58:06,159
You’re breaking the laws in my town.

728
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:11,159
Drop down your weapon and move away from that boy.

729
00:58:19,979 --> 00:58:23,359
Just a fucking village chief. How dare telling me what to do.

730
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:25,679
I also wonder…

731
00:58:26,039 --> 00:58:30,079
between your gun and my gun, whose is bigger?

732
00:58:37,349 --> 00:58:40,559
Now you know who’s the boss here, huh?

733
00:58:41,549 --> 00:58:45,999
Just fuck off. It’s this brat I want to clear up with.

734
00:58:47,349 --> 00:58:52,159
But if you still want to play a hero, I’ll fucking get you too.

735
00:58:53,479 --> 00:58:55,079
Put down your gun, Sack.

736
00:58:56,679 --> 00:59:00,119
I’m the headman here. Let’s talk nicely.

737
00:59:02,479 --> 00:59:04,599
You know who I am?

738
00:59:05,879 --> 00:59:08,349
Then you should know who my father is.

739
00:59:09,549 --> 00:59:12,439
Of course, you’re Mr. Sira’s son.

740
00:59:12,619 --> 00:59:15,319
But you’re making trouble in my town.

741
00:59:15,749 --> 00:59:18,119
So, even your father can’t help you.

742
00:59:18,619 --> 00:59:20,879
And you should also know…

743
00:59:21,079 --> 00:59:22,879
who that boy’s father is.

744
00:59:29,319 --> 00:59:34,679
[Incoming call]

745
00:59:35,379 --> 00:59:39,239
If you don’t want to regret it, you better take that call.

746
00:59:50,879 --> 00:59:51,879
Yes, Dad?

747
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:53,733
Are you crazy, Sack?

748
00:59:54,262 --> 00:59:56,290
I told you not to mess with that kid again.

749
00:59:56,490 --> 00:59:57,790
You don't remember, right?

750
01:00:00,279 --> 01:00:00,959
Dad!

751
01:00:01,279 --> 01:00:02,919
You want me to let him go?

752
01:00:02,919 --> 01:00:05,239
Did you already forget what he did to me?

753
01:00:05,919 --> 01:00:09,476
Who the fuck is his father? Why are you so scared of him?

754
01:00:09,676 --> 01:00:11,048
So listen to me.

755
01:00:11,176 --> 01:00:12,690
His father is a friend of Mr. Piti.

756
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:14,376
The leader of my party.

757
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:15,805
Don't ask too many questions.

758
01:00:15,825 --> 01:00:16,819
Hurry back.

759
01:00:16,948 --> 01:00:19,776
If I miss out on the party's MP quota this round...

760
01:00:19,976 --> 01:00:21,333
I'll kill you!

761
01:00:27,719 --> 01:00:30,039
Fuck! Let’s go!

762
01:00:41,519 --> 01:00:46,079
Yo! Yo!

763
01:00:47,919 --> 01:00:50,399
Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?

764
01:00:55,519 --> 01:00:56,319
I’m okay.

765
01:00:57,819 --> 01:00:58,619
Are you sure?

766
01:01:00,179 --> 01:01:03,399
I told you I’d come to save you.

767
01:01:04,179 --> 01:01:06,719
Come. Let’s go home.

768
01:01:33,179 --> 01:01:38,679
Granny! Granny! Please don’t go, Granny!

769
01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:42,019
Let Jom handle it.

770
01:01:42,719 --> 01:01:44,719
Why are you two so annoying?

771
01:01:44,819 --> 01:01:46,319
Stop bothering me.

772
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:49,479
Stop it. I’m going anyway.

773
01:01:49,579 --> 01:01:51,639
I’m coming! I’m coming!

774
01:01:51,959 --> 01:01:53,519
Where have you been, Sert?

775
01:01:53,679 --> 01:01:55,639
Where are the others? Why is it only three of you?

776
01:01:55,679 --> 01:01:57,419
They all went to harvest lotus. They’re not back yet.

777
01:01:57,579 --> 01:01:58,679
Geez, those idiots.

778
01:01:58,679 --> 01:02:00,879
Is this time to worry about harvesting?

779
01:02:00,979 --> 01:02:03,599
Fine! We’ll make do with this. Get in the car!

780
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:04,519
I’ll drive.

781
01:02:04,519 --> 01:02:05,319
Yes, Granny.

782
01:02:05,319 --> 01:02:07,959
Oh, Jom is here!

783
01:02:12,279 --> 01:02:13,479
Go check on them.

784
01:02:14,719 --> 01:02:15,879
Go! Hurry up.

785
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:18,959
Yo! Are you all right?

786
01:02:18,959 --> 01:02:19,919
Are you okay?

787
01:02:21,879 --> 01:02:23,239
Easy there.

788
01:02:23,799 --> 01:02:25,519
Easy.

789
01:02:27,619 --> 01:02:28,419
Be careful.

790
01:02:29,149 --> 01:02:30,549
He was quite fine at first.

791
01:02:30,949 --> 01:02:32,719
But he’d get worse because of you two.

792
01:02:36,949 --> 01:02:37,979
Are you hurt anywhere?

793
01:02:39,679 --> 01:02:40,919
I’m fine, Granny.

794
01:02:40,919 --> 01:02:41,919
That’s good.

795
01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:47,579
I’m sorry for causing everyone trouble.

796
01:02:48,819 --> 01:02:50,719
Aw, it’s not that bad, dear.

797
01:02:50,719 --> 01:02:52,279
No need to apologize.

798
01:02:52,279 --> 01:02:55,239
It’s good that you’re safe.

799
01:02:55,239 --> 01:02:57,439
We’re just worried about your safety. Don’t worry, dear.

800
01:02:58,149 --> 01:03:00,199
Kla, what about those thugs?

801
01:03:00,819 --> 01:03:04,039
Our village volunteers have already kicked them out of town.

802
01:03:04,279 --> 01:03:06,479
That’s good!

803
01:03:06,479 --> 01:03:10,359
If they refuse to leave, I’d give them a bullet or two as a warning.

804
01:03:10,999 --> 01:03:12,519
Don’t, Granny!

805
01:03:12,579 --> 01:03:13,719
Not you lot!

806
01:03:13,719 --> 01:03:15,359
I meant those thugs.

807
01:03:15,639 --> 01:03:17,799
Come! Let’s go talk inside.

808
01:03:18,949 --> 01:03:19,749
Yes, Granny.

809
01:03:19,749 --> 01:03:22,279
Let’s go, Yo.

810
01:03:22,279 --> 01:03:22,919
Hold on.

811
01:03:22,919 --> 01:03:24,399
Not with you two.

812
01:03:24,679 --> 01:03:27,799
You two go prepare drinks for the adults.

813
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:29,399
As for Yo,

814
01:03:29,399 --> 01:03:31,079
Jom will take care of him.

815
01:03:31,079 --> 01:03:33,839
Off you go now. Go!

816
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:34,919
Let’s go, boys.

817
01:03:35,199 --> 01:03:36,479
Geez.

818
01:03:38,639 --> 01:03:39,879
Are you hurt anywhere?

819
01:03:42,219 --> 01:03:43,349
Let’s go inside.

820
01:03:43,979 --> 01:03:44,779
Come.

821
01:03:46,379 --> 01:03:49,119
It’s okay, I can walk.

822
01:03:49,919 --> 01:03:52,959
Don’t be stubborn. Let me take care of you.

823
01:03:54,719 --> 01:03:55,619
Be careful.

824
01:04:25,979 --> 01:04:29,079
Are you sure you don’t want to go to the hospital?

825
01:04:30,179 --> 01:04:33,039
Yes, Granny. I just got kicked and punched.

826
01:04:33,319 --> 01:04:34,919
They haven’t used any weapon yet.

827
01:04:35,179 --> 01:04:36,279
Only kicks and punches?

828
01:04:36,279 --> 01:04:36,959
Yes.

829
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:41,199
why did those thugs easily leave this town?

830
01:04:42,749 --> 01:04:49,599
About that, you have to give Chief Jom some credits.

831
01:04:49,959 --> 01:04:50,919
My grandson?

832
01:04:53,879 --> 01:04:55,319
It wasn’t all my doing, Granny.

833
01:04:55,979 --> 01:04:57,279
To be honest,

834
01:04:57,959 --> 01:05:00,079
it was rather because of Uncle Komet.

835
01:05:00,639 --> 01:05:01,719
Komet!

836
01:05:01,719 --> 01:05:01,779
Dad?

837
01:05:03,239 --> 01:05:04,679
My dad?

838
01:05:04,819 --> 01:05:05,619
Yes.

839
01:05:06,279 --> 01:05:07,549
What did he do?

840
01:05:08,549 --> 01:05:09,799
Well, actually…

841
01:05:09,799 --> 01:05:11,239
even though your father

842
01:05:11,559 --> 01:05:14,319
trusts me and Uncle Kla to look after you.

843
01:05:15,479 --> 01:05:17,019
But he’s still very concerned about your safety.

844
01:05:18,019 --> 01:05:19,319
He gave me Mr. Pithi’s phone number.

845
01:05:19,519 --> 01:05:22,079
He’s the head of a political party Mr. Sira is under.

846
01:05:22,879 --> 01:05:25,399
Your father told me that if Sack ever finds you here,

847
01:05:25,399 --> 01:05:27,399
and that I’m not able to contact him,

848
01:05:27,399 --> 01:05:29,559
I should call Mr. Pithi for help.

849
01:05:31,319 --> 01:05:32,639
Now, do you understand…

850
01:05:33,239 --> 01:05:36,719
how much your parents love you?

851
01:06:03,749 --> 01:06:05,399
He has grown up a lot, Granny.

852
01:06:21,679 --> 01:06:22,479
Look at him.

853
01:06:23,219 --> 01:06:24,239
Yes,

854
01:06:25,379 --> 01:06:26,519
I’m sure he knows.

855
01:06:38,519 --> 01:06:39,919
Is it enough, Dad?

856
01:06:40,619 --> 01:06:42,639
Now, turn to the right.

857
01:06:43,319 --> 01:06:45,359
Okay, stop.

858
01:06:45,549 --> 01:06:47,919
Now, turn to the left.

859
01:06:49,779 --> 01:06:52,359
Come a bit closer.

860
01:06:52,359 --> 01:06:53,759
Move your face closer.

861
01:06:57,619 --> 01:06:58,749
Stick out your tongue.

862
01:07:02,749 --> 01:07:05,759
Now, raise your front legs.

863
01:07:07,019 --> 01:07:09,319
Bah! Dad!

864
01:07:10,619 --> 01:07:12,719
Are you really worried about me?

865
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:15,219
Of course, I am.

866
01:07:16,519 --> 01:07:19,679
Getting hit on the head like that, I just want to make sure…

867
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:22,159
your brain is still working properly.

868
01:07:23,019 --> 01:07:27,079
Mum, help me.

869
01:07:27,179 --> 01:07:29,039
Just play with your dad a bit, dear.

870
01:07:29,319 --> 01:07:30,799
Since you went to Pho Chai,

871
01:07:30,799 --> 01:07:32,559
your dad has had no one to play with.

872
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:33,439
He’s lonely.

873
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:36,119
Are you sure you’re all right?

874
01:07:37,779 --> 01:07:40,879
Yes, it was just a punch or two.

875
01:07:42,879 --> 01:07:44,419
It was nothing, Mum.

876
01:07:45,679 --> 01:07:46,959
That’s good.

877
01:07:47,319 --> 01:07:49,239
You better get ready then.

878
01:07:49,239 --> 01:07:50,799
Start packing your things.

879
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:52,759
I’ll go pick you up this Saturday.

880
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:54,719
Why would you pick me up?

881
01:07:55,379 --> 01:07:57,719
I sent you to live there…

882
01:07:57,719 --> 01:08:00,039
because I didn’t want Sack to find you.

883
01:08:00,219 --> 01:08:02,839
But now things seem to settle down. All cleared.

884
01:08:02,839 --> 01:08:04,399
There’s nothing to be afraid of anymore.

885
01:08:05,079 --> 01:08:07,679
We want you to come back and live with us like before.

886
01:08:07,679 --> 01:08:10,639
What if something like today happens again?

887
01:08:10,639 --> 01:08:11,399
Right?

888
01:08:13,199 --> 01:08:14,799
[Sigh]

889
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:31,579
I still want to stay here.

890
01:08:32,379 --> 01:08:33,179
Huh?

891
01:08:34,119 --> 01:08:34,919
Yo.

892
01:08:35,219 --> 01:08:37,079
You want to stay there, dear?

893
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:44,319
I think I’ll call Chief Jom and tell him to take you to see the doctor.

894
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:45,799
To have your brain checked.

895
01:08:46,079 --> 01:08:47,879
There must be something wrong with it.

896
01:08:48,199 --> 01:08:50,119
Weren’t you the one who kept telling me…

897
01:08:50,119 --> 01:08:53,439
that you didn’t want to study there in Pho Chai?

898
01:09:00,349 --> 01:09:01,479
Well, yes.

899
01:09:04,119 --> 01:09:05,879
But if I go back now,

900
01:09:06,779 --> 01:09:09,079
I’d end up being a loser who can’t succeed in anything.

901
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:10,779
Also,

902
01:09:11,349 --> 01:09:13,349
I want to finish school here.

903
01:09:15,619 --> 01:09:18,349
I was right to send you there.

904
01:09:19,949 --> 01:09:22,349
You’ve really grown up, Yo.

905
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:28,639
Then, your mum and I will start preparing about your study in the US.

906
01:09:28,639 --> 01:09:31,359
After you finish school there,

907
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:34,479
you can fly to the US right away.

908
01:09:36,219 --> 01:09:37,919
Go get some rest.

909
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:39,359
If you have a headache or not feeling well,

910
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:40,919
just tell Chief Jom, okay?

911
01:09:43,119 --> 01:09:44,119
Dad and Mum.

912
01:09:51,879 --> 01:09:53,279
I love you.

913
01:09:53,599 --> 01:09:54,559
Huh?

914
01:09:59,979 --> 01:10:08,999
Dad? Mum? What’s wrong with the internet?

915
01:10:11,019 --> 01:10:12,079
No connection?

916
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:18,279
There’s nothing wrong with it, dear.

917
01:10:18,279 --> 01:10:20,079
We were just stunned.

918
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:27,119
We love you too.

919
01:10:27,779 --> 01:10:30,019
Now, go to bed, son.

920
01:10:34,879 --> 01:10:35,679
Goodnight.

921
01:10:46,279 --> 01:10:49,879
Do you also feel he has changed a lot?

922
01:10:50,199 --> 01:10:53,519
He seems to be more matured, and has become more responsible.

923
01:10:53,519 --> 01:10:54,399
That’s right.

924
01:10:54,399 --> 01:10:56,839
I still couldn’t believe my own ears…

925
01:10:56,839 --> 01:11:00,319
when he said he wanted to finish school there.

926
01:11:02,819 --> 01:11:04,559
It was the right decision indeed.

927
01:11:04,559 --> 01:11:08,039
To send him to Pho Chai.

What did your parents say about this?

941
01:12:24,144 --> 01:12:25,244
Nothing much.

942
01:12:26,104 --> 01:12:27,644
They’re just worried.

943
01:12:31,574 --> 01:12:32,784
What are you doing out here?

944
01:12:33,144 --> 01:12:34,784
Where are you going?

945

Come, let me see.

Do you have a headache? Are you hurt anywhere?

949
01:12:55,744 --> 01:12:56,604
No, I’m okay.

01:12:58,704 --> 01:13:01,904
If you start to feel dizzy or not feeling well,

951
01:13:02,144 --> 01:13:03,544
just tell me, okay?

01:13:03,544 --> 01:13:05,544
I’ll take you to the hospital.

953

I’m okay.

954
01:13:07,744 --> 01:13:10,184
It’s just a fight. I’m used to it.

955
01:13:10,304 --> 01:13:16,744
Hey, don’t be so stubborn.

956
01:13:16,744 --> 01:13:18,344
And stop talking back to me.

957
01:13:18,344 --> 01:13:21,344
Try listening to what I tell you sometimes.

958
01:13:21,704 --> 01:13:22,744

01:13:28,244 --> 01:13:29,044

Let’s see.

962
01:13:39,344 --> 01:13:40,974
the temperature should be okay now.

963
01:14:03,774 --> 01:14:04,984
Is it too hot?

964
01:14:27,784 --> 01:14:29,544
Do you want to say anything?

965
01:14:31,104 --> 01:14:31,904
No.

966
01:14:34,544 --> 01:14:35,864
I don’t believe you.

967
01:14:35,864 --> 01:14:38,384
You’re avoiding my eyes.

968
01:14:38,444 --> 01:14:40,744
You said I shouldn’t talk back to you.

969
01:14:49,904 --> 01:14:51,544
Don’t ever do that again.

970
01:14:54,604 --> 01:14:55,404
Do what?

971
01:14:56,944 --> 01:14:58,174
What you did this afternoon.

972
01:14:59,144 --> 01:15:02,024
You were there alone with just a gun.

973
01:15:02,174 --> 01:15:03,744
Sack got a lot of his men with him.

974
01:15:04,104 --> 01:15:05,804
What if Uncle Kla couldn’t make it in time.

975
01:15:06,044 --> 01:15:06,844
What would you do then?

976
01:15:09,184 --> 01:15:13,624
Why? Are you worried about me again?

977
01:15:16,374 --> 01:15:17,704
Quit joking around.

978
01:15:18,704 --> 01:15:19,774
I’m serious.

979
01:15:20,904 --> 01:15:22,264
Last time it was Uncle Yod.

980
01:15:22,264 --> 01:15:23,824
He had his gun pointed at your head.

981
01:15:24,444 --> 01:15:25,744
This time it was Sack.

982
01:15:26,544 --> 01:15:28,204
What if he really pulls the trigger?

983
01:15:29,544 --> 01:15:30,774
What do you want me to do then?

984
01:15:32,004 --> 01:15:33,804
Leave you there and run away?

985
01:15:35,244 --> 01:15:36,544
I can’t do that.

986
01:15:59,744 --> 01:16:03,624
I’ll call Teacher Toei and tell her…

987
01:16:03,904 --> 01:16:05,344
that you’ll take leave tomorrow.

988
01:16:06,944 --> 01:16:08,784
What will you tell her?

989
01:16:09,784 --> 01:16:13,584
Look at me. If you tell her I’d caught a cold,

990
01:16:13,584 --> 01:16:15,224
no one would believe it.

991
01:16:19,644 --> 01:16:22,944
Hey, should we tell her I fell off the bike?

992
01:16:23,344 --> 01:16:26,344
Good idea. Sounds about right.

993
01:16:27,444 --> 01:16:29,664
You’re quite good at this kind of thing.

994
01:16:29,664 --> 01:16:33,384
Hey, I’m still recovering.

995
01:16:36,104 --> 01:16:39,064
You better go to bed.

996
01:16:39,544 --> 01:16:40,774
I’ll take you somewhere tomorrow.

997
01:16:42,044 --> 01:16:42,844
Somewhere?

998
01:16:44,174 --> 01:16:45,604
Where are you going to take me?

999
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:49,404
I’m not telling you.

1000
01:16:50,944 --> 01:16:52,344
You’ll find out tomorrow.

1001
01:16:52,844 --> 01:16:53,804
Don’t sleep so late.

1002
01:16:54,404 --> 01:16:55,604
And don’t forget to put a warm compress on your wound.

1003
01:16:55,844 --> 01:16:56,704
Get well soon.

1004
01:16:57,544 --> 01:16:58,464
Night.

1005
01:17:00,024 --> 01:17:00,944
Hey!

1006
01:17:39,404 --> 01:17:40,204
Wow.

1007
01:17:40,904 --> 01:17:42,574
That’s the lotus field.

1008
01:17:43,444 --> 01:17:44,344
It’s awesome.

1009
01:18:07,604 --> 01:18:11,064
Relax. No need to be so tense.

1010
01:18:11,944 --> 01:18:15,104
The more you’re afraid, the more it will make the boat wobble.

1011
01:18:18,344 --> 01:18:19,144
Okay.

1012
01:18:23,944 --> 01:18:26,904
How deep is it?

1013
01:18:29,704 --> 01:18:30,664
Not much.

1014
01:18:30,664 --> 01:18:31,944
Here, I’ll show you.

1015
01:18:32,824 --> 01:18:35,824
See?

1016
01:18:37,844 --> 01:18:39,144
It’s not deep at all.

1017
01:18:39,444 --> 01:18:42,204
The water probably comes up to your waste.

1018
01:18:45,044 --> 01:18:46,744
I often come here.

1019
01:18:46,744 --> 01:18:49,224
Whenever I’m stressed or want to chill out.

1020
01:18:50,424 --> 01:18:53,344
I’ll lie down and close my eyes…

1021
01:18:53,344 --> 01:18:58,224
listening to sounds of the wind, water, and birds chirping.

1022
01:19:00,504 --> 01:19:01,384
Try it.

1023
01:19:12,944 --> 01:19:15,244
So? Feeling better?

1024
01:19:24,544 --> 01:19:25,984
Do you own this lotus pond?

1025
01:19:25,984 --> 01:19:29,544
Yeah, Granny has owned it for many decades now.

1026
01:19:29,644 --> 01:19:31,944
They’re not harvesting lotus today so I can take you out here.

1027
01:19:32,574 --> 01:19:33,374
Do you like it?

1028
01:19:33,974 --> 01:19:34,774
Yes.

1029
01:19:42,544 --> 01:19:45,344
Do these lotus sell well?

1030
01:19:45,424 --> 01:19:47,504
Why do many people here like to grow them?

1031
01:19:47,844 --> 01:19:50,024
Lotus plants are good for many things.

1032
01:19:50,544 --> 01:19:52,864
Let’s say their flowers.

1033
01:19:53,264 --> 01:19:54,984
You can use them to pay respect to the monk.

1034
01:19:54,984 --> 01:19:56,784
Their seeds can be dried and made into snacks.

1035
01:19:58,044 --> 01:20:00,824
Their leaves can be used to wrap food.

1036
01:20:01,104 --> 01:20:03,224
The petal can also be used for a one-bite wrap (Miang Kham).

1037
01:20:03,944 --> 01:20:06,024
See? They’re very useful.

1038
01:20:09,644 --> 01:20:12,204
How do you pick their flowers then?

1039
01:20:12,574 --> 01:20:15,824
Just use the knife or scissors to cut them off.

1040
01:20:16,044 --> 01:20:17,944
You have scissors, don’t you?

1041
01:20:18,304 --> 01:20:19,264
This one?

1042
01:20:19,264 --> 01:20:20,104
Go on.

1043
01:20:32,504 --> 01:20:33,304
Okay.

1044
01:21:29,944 --> 01:21:31,024
Finally, I’m here.

1045
01:21:31,584 --> 01:21:34,184
Should I grab something to eat before going to Pho Chai?

1046
01:21:46,404 --> 01:21:48,224
Mummy.

1047
01:21:48,224 --> 01:21:50,224
The subject is so hard to understand today.

1048
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:52,744
I’m having a headache.

1049
01:21:53,104 --> 01:21:55,584
I need a Thai tea to boost up my energy.

1050
01:21:55,774 --> 01:21:58,944
Or else I won’t be able to make it until this evening.

1051
01:22:03,744 --> 01:22:05,904
Can I have one Thai tea with 25% sweetness?

1052
01:22:05,904 --> 01:22:09,304
And…

1053
01:22:10,224 --> 01:22:10,944
a chicken pie too.

1054
01:22:11,044 --> 01:22:12,464
Just a moment please.

1055
01:22:16,774 --> 01:22:17,604
Yes, Mummy.

1056
01:22:18,004 --> 01:22:18,944
Yes. Goodbye.

1057
01:22:22,204 --> 01:22:25,744
Can I have one Thai tea with 25% sweetness?

1058
01:22:26,664 --> 01:22:29,424
And a chicken pie too.

1059
01:22:29,424 --> 01:22:30,304
Yes.

1060
01:22:30,374 --> 01:22:31,174
Just a moment.

1061
01:22:55,504 --> 01:22:57,904
A chicken pie and Thai tea with 25% sweetness are ready.

1062
01:22:58,424 --> 01:22:59,544
That’s quick.

1063
01:23:00,104 --> 01:23:06,184
Hmm, a chicken pie and Thai tea.

1064
01:23:07,244 --> 01:23:09,424
You won’t know how good they are…

1065
01:23:10,024 --> 01:23:13,344
until you’ve tried them.

1066
01:23:26,744 --> 01:23:27,544
What’s wrong with you?

1067
01:23:27,904 --> 01:23:29,544
If you’re hungry, just tell me honestly.

1068
01:23:29,544 --> 01:23:31,384
Don’t steal someone else’s food like this.

1069
01:23:32,444 --> 01:23:34,444
Hey, watch your mouth, Sis.

1070
01:23:34,744 --> 01:23:35,944
It’s you who’s stealing.

1071
01:23:36,044 --> 01:23:37,504
How dare you.

1072
01:23:38,504 --> 01:23:40,004
They’re obviously mine.

1073
01:23:40,974 --> 01:23:44,184
Mine! This chicken pie too!

1074
01:23:45,144 --> 01:23:46,744
Then give me back my tea first.

1075
01:23:47,004 --> 01:23:47,624
It’s mine!

1076
01:23:47,624 --> 01:23:48,744
Wait.

1077
01:23:49,204 --> 01:23:50,944
It’s okay. I can handle it.

1078
01:23:52,304 --> 01:23:53,144
Give me the tea.

1079
01:23:53,144 --> 01:23:53,704
It’s mine!

1080
01:23:53,704 --> 01:23:54,504
Wait.

1081
01:23:54,704 --> 01:23:56,374
It’s okay. I’ll clear it up soon.

1082
01:23:57,744 --> 01:23:58,544
Whatever you say then.

1083
01:24:01,344 --> 01:24:04,184
You want a chicken pie, huh?

1084
01:24:04,744 --> 01:24:05,544
Fine!

1085
01:24:08,624 --> 01:24:10,824
Eww, that’s disgusting!

Fine. You also want Thai tea, don’t you?

1094

What a waste of food.

How can she be so shameless?

1097
01:25:16,644 --> 01:25:21,544
Ah, they’re so good. I’ve never had a chicken pie and a Thai tea this good before.

1098
01:25:21,774 --> 01:25:25,374
Hey. How can you still eat them?

1099
01:25:25,844 --> 01:25:28,544
But they’re so good. Do you want some?

1100
01:25:28,904 --> 01:25:31,184
Eww, who’d want to eat your leftovers?

You have to pay for those balloons.

Pay it.

1109
01:26:20,144 --> 01:26:21,784
But I wasn’t the one who did it.

1110
01:26:21,784 --> 01:26:23,184
The real culprit just ran off over there.

1111
01:26:25,304 --> 01:26:27,144
It was that girl. She did it.

1112

Can you stop by to get some mackerels on the way back?

1113

You want him for yourself then?

1208
01:32:29,121 --> 01:32:30,361
No, he likes girls.

1209
01:32:31,001 --> 01:32:35,761
He has to be here because of that problem.

1210
01:32:38,421 --> 01:32:39,861

No!

1226
01:33:22,321 --> 01:33:23,921
If you don’t want to stay in my room,

1227
01:33:23,921 --> 01:33:27,441
then go sleep in a tent in the middle of the field.

1228
01:33:27,861 --> 01:33:28,661
Want that?

1229
01:33:31,191 --> 01:33:35,201
It was just a joke. Why do you have to kick me out?

1230
01:33:41,961 --> 01:33:44,961
That’s right. Have you heard Tee already broke up with his wife?

1231
01:33:46,421 --> 01:33:49,391
Yeah. Joom, Best, and Fang told me.

1232
01:33:49,561 --> 01:33:52,721
Geez, those three are so nosy.

1233
01:33:53,281 --> 01:33:55,321
Now I know why they messaged me.

1234
01:33:55,321 --> 01:33:57,401
They just wanted to pry on you.

1235
01:33:58,921 --> 01:34:00,841
Has Tee contacted you?

1236
01:34:14,721 --> 01:34:20,001
No, we have a deal that we won’t contact each other.

1237
01:34:20,321 --> 01:34:23,761
I don’t think so. It’s only you who told him that.

1238
01:34:23,761 --> 01:34:25,521
He didn’t even say anything.

1239
01:34:26,241 --> 01:34:27,041
Really?

1240
01:34:27,421 --> 01:34:30,081
But come to think about it, it’s good he doesn’t contact you.

1241
01:34:30,081 --> 01:34:33,001
I’m so afraid that woman will come harass you again.

1242
01:34:33,001 --> 01:34:35,481
It really pisses me off just thinking about it.

1243
01:34:35,481 --> 01:34:37,081
She was the one who stole him from you.

1244
01:34:37,081 --> 01:34:39,121
How dared she berate you like that.

1245
01:34:39,121 --> 01:34:41,641
She was lucky I didn’t slap her in the face.

1246
01:34:41,991 --> 01:34:43,521
You’re such a drama queen.

1247
01:34:44,441 --> 01:34:47,921
It’s been a long time. I don’t hold any grudge on her.

1248
01:34:48,391 --> 01:34:51,081
That’s good for you.

1249
01:34:51,261 --> 01:34:53,221
Tee also has his baggage.

1250
01:34:53,721 --> 01:34:55,621
Even after a divorce, he still has to look after his child.

1251
01:34:56,161 --> 01:34:59,441
I really want to know how much he has to pay her to divorce him.

1252
01:35:00,321 --> 01:35:02,481
Just chuck it. It’s nothing we should care about.

No, you can’t do that. They can’t sleep together even if they’re dating.
