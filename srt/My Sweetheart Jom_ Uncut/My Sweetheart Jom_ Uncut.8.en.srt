00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:04,560
I didn’t mean it.

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,500
I didn’t know he’d be like this.

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,800
Hiding out in the fucking sticks like this, are you so scared of me?

5
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,100
Stop!

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,160
Fuck!

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,160
I told you I’d come.

8
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,940
Jom!

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,500
Are you two dating?

10
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,460
Kaew is Jom’s college friend.

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,000
Where are you going?

12
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,700
I’ll go prepare the room for you.

13
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:34,700
Night then.

14
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:47,060

00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,380

What’s wrong?

19
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,660
What’s the matter?

20
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,700
What? Nothing.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,560
But I just heard you screaming.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,180
What? Who screamed?

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,800
What are you talking about?

24
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,330
So, there’s nothing wrong?

25
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,730
Did you just imagine it?

26
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:24,130
Are you sure?

27
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,940
Hey, snake!

28
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,580
No, it’s not a snake.

29
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:30,760
Snake! It already went under the blanket!

30
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,700

31
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:32,530
Don’t move!

32
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,460
That’s not a snake.

33
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,780
It’s not a snake.

34
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,800

37
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,460
Calm down. It’s not a snake.

38
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,130
It’s really a snake.

39
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:41,580
No!

40
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,020

Oh.

82
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,260
Let me help.

83
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,220
Thanks a lot.

84
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,000
Put it over there.

85
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,960
Okay.

86
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,330
What is your job?

87
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,260
I’m a research officer for agricultural products.

88
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,980
Do you usually work alone?

89
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,700
Where’s your team?

90
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:41,700
Usually, we’d go onsite to test the products as a team.

91
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,180
But since it’s just an initial period,

92
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,860
I have to collect as many samples as I could first.

93
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,260
Are you here to work or to flirt, Miss Kaew?

94
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,700
Hey, watch your mouth, Chief.

95
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,260
I haven’t done anything like that yet.

96
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,140
Or should I start flirting now?

97
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,140
Hmm, hands off, missy.

98
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,300
So, do you want to go talk to the village people today?

99
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,980
If not, I’ll just go talk to Luangpor.

100
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:14,700
I think I’ll work on collecting soil samples today – mostly from your farm.

101
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,900
If there’s still some time left, I might collect it from other areas too.

102
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:18,940
Okay.

103
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,860
That’s right, I totally forgot.

104
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,460
Last night, I printed out some info about how to make bio-extract.

105
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,660
I want you to hand them out to the village people.

106
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,820
Just a sec, I’ll be right back.

107
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:29,700

108
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,330
So? Pretty?

109
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,060

00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,700
Do you like her?

111
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,700
What? You think I like her?

112
00:06:55,330 --> 00:07:00,820
Well, it was quite obvious – judging from your willy this morning.

113
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,960
There.

114
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,380
Willy?

115
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,060
Mhm.

116
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:07,900

- Why?
-  What’s wrong with you?

119
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,660
Were you dreaming of Kaew last night?

120
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,100
I wasn’t dreaming of her. I was dreaming of…

121
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,000
I wasn’t dreaming of anything.

122
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,330
It’s normal, isn’t it?

123
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:34,900
Or isn’t your willy not like that in the morning?

124
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,180
I better go to school.

125
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,580
Someone might give me an earful if I’m late.

126
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,360
Are you busy this evening

127
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,260
This evening?

128
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,380
Hmm, I’m not sure.

129
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:16,260
I think I’ll go talk to Luangpor about our annual fair.

130
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,700
Why?

131
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,220
Nothing. I just think you hardly have time to rest lately.

132
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,260
If you’re not busy this evening, hurry home and get some rest.

133
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:29,940
Careful there.

134
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,700
That’s all.

135
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,160
Study hard.

136
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,200
Why the heck did I say that?

137
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,260
He obviously wouldn’t know it’s my birthday today.

138
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,530
Geez.

139
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,360
Wow! My mother is looking so gorgeous today.

140
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:59,820
Huh? Does this mean you don’t find me beautiful on other days?

141
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:04,780
Of course not. You’re just especially beautiful today.

142
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:11,340
I’m not going to let anyone or any teacher get near you today

143
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:13,940
Especially our PE teacher, Teacher Ake.

144
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,300
Absolutely not for him.

145
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:18,700
Wow! Why? What’s so important today?

146
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,360
A parent-teacher meeting.

147
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,330
Did you forget?

148
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,220
Of course not, dear.

149
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,560
But I’m afraid I won’t be able to make it today.

150
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,800
I have an urgent matter in the city center to take care of.

151
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,940
But you already promised me you’d be there.

152
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,260
I know, sweetie.

153
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:52,260
But the job I have to take care of today is a very important one.

154
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,500
You’re always like this.

155
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,060
Every job is important for you.

156
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,660
Only one thing is not important.

157
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,100
That’s me!

158
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,340
Sweetie, please don’t be upset.

159
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:18,660
If I don’t do this, how on earth would I be able to give you such a comfortable life?

160
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,340
Please understand me, dear.

161
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,400
Are you saying that

162
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:29,500
you’re exhausted from going out to work every day…

163
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,960
all because you have to take care of me?

164
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,560
Am I a burden to you?

165
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,260
Earn.

166
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,140
[Sigh]

167
00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:47,930
Yo.

168
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,000
What’s up?

169
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,900
What’s wrong with your face?

170
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,300
Ah, here?

171
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,200
I fell off the bike.

172
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,000
Why?

173
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,660
Nothing. I thought it was because of Fluke and Prae.

174
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,780
Fluke and Prae?

175
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:19,930
Yeah, remember that day when Rose asked you if you had to go meet Prae?

176
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:24,400
It was actually Fluke who sent her the note.

177
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,160
Fluke?

178
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:36,940
[Fluke: Hey, I’m Fluke.]

00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,700
Geez.

180
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,900
She already knows my name.

181
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,380
[Fluke: Are you Prae?]

182
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,820
Are you Prae?

00:23:23,653 --> 00:23:26,273
So, she’s at your house?

365
00:23:26,273 --> 00:23:28,393
Yes, I came home to get my car…

366
00:23:28,953 --> 00:23:30,223
and ran into her here.

367
00:23:30,453 --> 00:23:32,153
Is she all right?

368
00:23:32,993 --> 00:23:33,793
Yes.

369
00:23:35,053 --> 00:23:39,253
She said she hired a taxi to drop her off here.

370
00:23:39,823 --> 00:23:42,193
That’s a relief.

371
00:23:42,193 --> 00:23:45,353
All right then, I’ll hurry there to pick her up.

372
00:23:46,053 --> 00:23:47,093
Maybe not now.

373
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:50,313
I’ve tried telling her many times that I’d take her home.

374
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:55,393
But she kept saying she doesn’t want to see you right now.

375
00:23:57,823 --> 00:23:59,623
She’s probably still mad at you.

376
00:24:00,393 --> 00:24:04,393
Let her stay here for a night. I’ll try to calm her down for you

377
00:24:04,393 --> 00:24:05,073
But…

378
00:24:05,073 --> 00:24:09,553
Don’t worry, there are also Granny and my friend who’s a girl here.

379
00:24:09,873 --> 00:24:12,793
I can assure you she’ll be okay.

380
00:24:12,953 --> 00:24:16,873
Well then, please look after her for me, Chief.

381
00:24:17,393 --> 00:24:18,553
Thank you so much.

382
00:24:19,223 --> 00:24:19,673

Happy 20th Birthday, pal!

387
00:24:34,293 --> 00:24:36,453
Tell me how it feels to be twenty?

388
00:24:38,453 --> 00:24:39,653
Just so so.

389
00:24:40,493 --> 00:24:43,593
What? When you were nineteen, you kept bickering when you’d turn twenty.

390
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:45,993
Now that you’ve turned twenty, you just said it’s nothing?

391
00:24:46,953 --> 00:24:49,473
Yeah, it’s really like that. Nothing special.

392
00:24:49,793 --> 00:24:51,633
Nothing to be so glad of.

393
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:53,873
I knew it.

394

You’re afraid you’d no longer be called a juvenile, aren’t you?

395
00:24:57,853 --> 00:25:02,753
Try looking on the bright side. If there’s someone older than you trying to hit on you,

396
00:25:03,023 --> 00:25:05,913
they no longer have to be afraid they’d break the juvenile laws. Right?

00:32:38,913 --> 00:32:43,513
with us in person on this Wednesday, July 9…

544
00:32:43,513 --> 00:32:45,313
at Krung Thep Aphiwat Central Terminal Station.

545
00:32:45,313 --> 00:32:47,073
See you there!

546
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:53,530
[My Sweetheart Jom]

547
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:58,570
Watch “My Sweetheart Jom” for free on YouTube.

548
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:06,930
Are you happy now?

549
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:09,570
You’ve succeeded in making those two girls fighting over you

550
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:12,730
Answer me.

551
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:17,570
Don’t stay quiet. Answer me!

552
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:27,570
Does it sound too aggressive? Geez.

553
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:33,590
Let’s do this then.

554
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:37,950
So, who do you like?

555
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:39,990
Earn or Kaew?

556
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,720
But what if he says…

557
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,770
“Whom I like is none of your business.”

558
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:49,890
“So what?”

559
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,950
How should I respond then?

560
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:57,250
Geez, so frustrating.

561
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,490
What’s wrong?

562
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:11,090
Nothing.

563
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:18,320
Earn made you upset, didn’t she?

564
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,590
That’s why you’re exercising like this.

565
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:23,250
Why should I be upset?

566
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,090
You have to study for exams during these days.

567
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,090
Also, you don’t like it when there are lots of people.

568
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:31,720
It’s not like that.

569
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:35,650
I just think those two girls are so annoying.

570
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:38,170
They behave like jealous characters in the drama.

571
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:40,090
Fighting over the leading male actor.

572
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,850
Are you saying I’m a leading male actor?

573
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,530
Hey! I’m being serious here.

574
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:49,290
But you can’t blame them though.

575
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:52,450
You’re the one who should be blamed the most.

576
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:03,490
Tell me, what did I do?

577
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:04,850
Just be clear.

578
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:07,790
you’re wrong for playing with other people’s feelings.

579
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:12,570
If you like someone, just tell them honestly.

580
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,530
Don’t keep flirting around like this.

581
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:18,520
Then, do you know whom I like?

582
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,050
I don’t care.

583
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:24,530
I don’t want to know whom you like.

584
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:28,250
None of them.

585
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:32,250
Really?

586
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:33,250
Mhm.

587
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,550
Earn is like my sister.

588
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:37,990
And Kaew is my best friend.

589
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,520
Got it?

590
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,350
So?

591
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,850
I already told you I don’t care.

592
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,590
Let’s go. Or else we’ll be home late.

593
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:50,120
Oh, you’re coming too?

594
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:51,850
Of course.

595
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,120
Do you think I’d stay here listening to those two fighting over you?

596
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:56,250
No way.

597
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:57,930
Come. Let’s go.

598
00:35:58,650 --> 00:35:59,250
Okay.

599
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,130
There you are, Chief.

600
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:12,370
Come, come.

601
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:14,050
Greetings, Luangpor.

602
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:15,090
Bless you.

603
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,410
My apology, Luangpor.

604
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:17,610
For being here so late.

605
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:20,130
There were some problems I had to sort out during the day.

606
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:25,320
A good person should be responsible for their job.

607
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:28,650
If they can’t,

608
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:30,990
they should let someone else do it instead.

609
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:34,350
Am I right, Luangpor?

610
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:39,170
Mr. Yod came here to ask me…

611
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:43,610
if he could be the organizer for Pho Chai’s annual fair this year.

612
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:51,090
It’s just that you seem to be quite busy lately.

613
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:53,770
So, I think I’d volunteer to do it instead.

614
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:56,850
Also, it’s almost time for the annual fair.

615
00:36:57,370 --> 00:36:59,370
But you don’t seem to have made any preparation yet.

616
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:01,050
What do you think, Chief?

617
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:04,930
If you’re busy, do you want him to help?

618
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:09,530
I’d rather not.

619
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:12,850
This is a village chief’s responsibility.

620
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:15,570
I’d prefer to do it since I’m the village chief.

621
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:17,090
However,

622
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:19,450
if you sincerely want to help,

623
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:20,930
you’re more than welcome.

624
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,450
But if you only want to do it for getting more votes…

625
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,410
or for the benefit of some investors,

626
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:28,690
I’d rather you not do it.

627
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:30,690
You’re crossing the line.

628
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:32,890
All right, all right.

629
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:34,330
That’s enough.

630
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:36,610
Whether Chief Jom…

631
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:37,890
or Mr. Yod,

632
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:40,650
you’re both not strangers here.

633
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:44,720
Let’s help each other and work for our village.

634
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:52,690
What about you, son?

635
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:54,330
How come you’re with him?

636
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,650
This is Yotin, Luangpor.

637
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:59,130
I’ve asked him to tag along here…

638
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:03,330
in case we might be able to promote more about our Pho Chai’s culture…

639
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:04,530
since he’s a new gen.

640
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:05,970
That’s good.

641
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:07,730
Our Pho Chai village…

642
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:09,850
is full of wonderful things.

643
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:12,130
We have beautiful nature,

644
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:13,090
kind people,

645
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:15,010
and Krayasart.

646
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:18,250
We only have one bad thing in our village, Luangpor.

647
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:20,210
Goodbye.

648
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:25,170
Did you mean yourself?

649
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,090
What did you just say?

650
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,410
Say it again. I couldn’t catch it, brat.

651
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:33,410
I was just kidding.

652
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:35,490
Chief Jom often mentions…

653
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:37,410
how people in Pho Chai are always full of smiles.

654
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:39,410
So, I just wanted to make you…

655
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:40,530
smile more often.

656
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,130
Do you find it funny, Uncle?

657
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:43,930
not really

658
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:46,320
All right then,

659
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:49,450
if Chief Jom said so…

660
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:52,790
let’s just stick to how it used to be.

661
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:53,950
Yes, Luangpor.

662
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:57,610
Goodbye, Abby.

663
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:58,550
Abbot!

664
00:38:59,090 --> 00:38:59,730
Bless you.

665
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:02,550
Go! Came here just to get insulted.

666
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,750
I like you.

667
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,850
I mean I like how you talked back to Uncle Yod like that.

668
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:49,120
I wanted to do that too.

669
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:52,490
But I’m a village chief.

670
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:54,490
So, I can’t just do something like that.

671
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,120
Thank you.

672
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:58,720
It’s good you didn’t though.

673
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,920
If you had done it,

674
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:03,920
he might have accused you of abusing authority.

675
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,850
You know about this kind of thing too?

676
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:13,090
Hey, a face like this…

677
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:15,690
is quite knowledgeable somehow.

678
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:22,130
From now on, you don’t have to worry…

679
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:24,170
if anyone dares to mess with you.

680
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:28,730
I’ll protect you.

681
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:36,130
Huh?

682
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:44,750
What’s going on?

683
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,750
Trying to start the engine]

684
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,390
I’ll go check it out.

685
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,720
It’s not that serious, right?

686
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:15,290
Let me see.

687
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:22,290
Geez.

688
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:23,950
Just a rope getting stuck in there.

689
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,150
Does this mean we can go home now?

690
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:30,010
This is not a rope. It’s a serpentine belt.

691
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:32,320
If this belt is torn or damaged,

692
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:35,170
the car won’t move. Understood?

693
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:38,050
Does this mean we have to walk home?

694
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:39,490
You can do that too.

695
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:41,930
Or we can just walk back to the temple. It’s the same distance.

696
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:45,290
Can you try not to get on my nerve for a second?

697
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:52,090
That’s right! Can we call Sert…

698
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:53,490
and ask him to drive here to tow us back?

699
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:55,090
I guess that’s how it should be.

700
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,770
You can’t see any stars here.

701
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,120
Yeah.

702
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:42,770
It’s actually a waxing moon night.

703
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,390
But there are no stars at all.

704
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:48,950
Do you know what day it is today?

705
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:54,990
Of course, It’s Tuesday.

706
00:42:59,290 --> 00:43:03,490
No, apart from that.

707
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,520
What else could it be?

708
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:09,350
What day is it?

709
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:12,450
It’s definitely not a lotto result day.

710
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,410
What day is it? Tell me.

711
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:19,720
Never mind.

712
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:22,850
It’s nothing important.

713
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:37,970
♪Happy birthday to you~

714
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:45,770

Go on. Make a wish.

719
00:44:28,490 --> 00:44:29,290
Do it.

720
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:39,350
Happy Birthday.

721
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:54,690
You remember it?

722
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:55,950
Of course.

723
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:57,690
Did you forget…

724
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,720
Did you forget…

725
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:01,790
And it’s not just me.

726
00:45:02,590 --> 00:45:05,690
Granny and everyone also remember it too.

727
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,050
They are now waiting at home with your cake.

728
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:10,550
Everyone?

729
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:12,390
Mhm.

730
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:15,520
Don’t you think it’s suspicious…

731
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:18,550
that those kids all went to play football?

732
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:20,890
Granny had asked them to get your cake.

733
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:25,730
But I’m sorry though.

734
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:29,250
I know today is important to you.

735
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:33,010
It’s your 20th birthday.

736
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:36,010
But you have to be stuck here with me….

737
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:37,930
and a broke-down car instead.

738
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:42,650
Judging from the time,

739
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:45,750
we’d probably be home quite late.

740
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,590
I’m sorry.

741
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:52,050
I think you’d probably feel bad…

742
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:53,890
that I use Krayasart as your cake.

743
00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:57,750
And use tree sticks as candles.

744
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:00,350
That doesn’t matter at all.

745
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:06,610
I thought no one could remember my birthday.

746
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:07,970
Of course not.

747
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:10,090
You mean a lot to our family.

748
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:17,890
Try it.

749
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:21,120
This one is a soft Krayasart made by Aunt Daeng.

750
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:22,350
So good!

751
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:36,350
How is it? Good, right?

752
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:03,210
A thunder.

753
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:06,850
It’s also drizzling.

754
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:11,610
I guess it’ll be pouring down soon.

755
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:14,010
We better go find some shelter.

756
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:14,890
Let’s go!

757
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:41,650
See? I told you.

758
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:45,130
That it’d be pouring down soon.

759
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:49,370
Whose hut is this?

760
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:51,930
Wouldn’t the owner think we’re trespassing?

761
00:47:52,690 --> 00:47:53,570
Nope.

762
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:57,570
This hut is built for those who have to stay a night to watch over the farm.

763
00:47:58,130 --> 00:48:00,130
There aren’t any valuable things here.

764
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:04,250
How long do we have to stay here?

765
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:07,570
Hmm, probably not long…

766
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:08,890
if it’s quite a downpour like this.

767
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,090
Okay, fine!

768
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:13,350
Okay, fine!

769
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:21,690
There’s a good thing about getting stuck here though.

770
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:25,090
Growing up in Bangkok,

771
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:27,450

You ate that much chilli. It might upset your stomach.

790

Take this medicine, it could help.

Don’t worry. I’m giving you this medicine…

911
01:00:50,519 --> 01:00:51,399
Let’s not wake her up.

912
01:00:51,399 --> 01:00:52,719
Or else she might ruin mood here.

913
01:00:54,579 --> 01:00:57,479
Why don’t you give him a blessing, Granny?

914
01:00:57,709 --> 01:00:59,839
What blessing does he need?

915
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:01,439
How old are you now?

916
01:01:01,579 --> 01:01:02,379
I’m 20.

917
01:01:02,539 --> 01:01:04,279
20 already? Good!

918
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:05,979
I wish you to turn 21 next year then.

920

922
01:01:11,339 --> 01:01:12,399
Geez, Granny.

923
01:01:12,639 --> 01:01:13,779
Stop joking around.

924
01:01:13,909 --> 01:01:15,309
Jom’ll show you how to do it properly.

925
01:01:15,799 --> 01:01:17,679
All right everyone, put your hands together.

926
01:01:17,779 --> 01:01:18,909
Okay, Chief.

927
01:01:19,239 --> 01:01:20,039
Put your hands together.

928
01:01:20,039 --> 01:01:20,559
Me too?

929
01:01:20,639 --> 01:01:21,479
Not you, Granny.

930
01:01:22,279 --> 01:01:23,579
Put your hands together.

931
01:01:24,539 --> 01:01:28,839
May you have a long life and good health. (Chanting)

932
01:01:29,309 --> 01:01:30,959
Thank you!

933
01:01:30,959 --> 01:01:31,919
Duh!

934
01:01:32,539 --> 01:01:33,339
What the heck?

935
01:01:33,509 --> 01:01:35,039
I almost said ‘bless you’ at the end.

936
01:01:36,379 --> 01:01:39,559
Enough with the joke. Let’s take a mixture together.

937

Yay!

945
01:02:07,239 --> 01:02:08,039
Hello?

946
01:02:09,079 --> 01:02:10,539
Can we talk, Toy?

947
01:02:12,309 --> 01:02:15,599
What’s up? Let me guess.

948
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:16,839
It’s either…

949
01:02:17,399 --> 01:02:19,719
you’re fighting with your dad, or with your mum.

950
01:02:26,339 --> 01:02:29,399
So, what is it? Say something.

951
01:02:30,119 --> 01:02:31,519
If not, I’ll hang up.

952
01:02:31,839 --> 01:02:33,939
Alright, I’ll say it.

953
01:02:36,709 --> 01:02:40,199
When did you know…

954
01:02:40,999 --> 01:02:42,479
that you actually…

955
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:46,879
that you like men not women?

956
01:02:50,439 --> 01:02:51,479
What happened?

957
01:02:51,479 --> 01:02:53,479
Why are you asking me that all of a sudden?

958
01:02:55,539 --> 01:02:58,199
Geez, just answer me first.

959
01:02:58,759 --> 01:03:00,119
I’ll tell you later.

960
01:03:02,939 --> 01:03:05,239
Remember when we were still in Grade 8?

961
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:07,239
We had a new teaching intern called ‘Jay’.

962
01:03:07,509 --> 01:03:11,959
Yeah, I remember you liked hanging out with him.

963
01:03:14,879 --> 01:03:15,559
Wait, were you guys…

964
01:03:15,559 --> 01:03:18,319
Stop that. It’s not what you think.

965
01:03:19,479 --> 01:03:21,439
I was really bad at Maths back then.

966
01:03:22,339 --> 01:03:24,709
So, Jay helped tutoring me.

967
01:03:25,579 --> 01:03:27,319
We started to become close.

968
01:03:27,319 --> 01:03:29,039
And I started to have feelings for him.

969
01:03:29,559 --> 01:03:33,599
But back then I thought it was just something between brothers.

970
01:03:36,639 --> 01:03:38,439
Until he was gone.

971
01:03:40,479 --> 01:03:44,779
Yeah, I remember it now. He kind of disappeared.

972
01:03:46,339 --> 01:03:49,109
Then, we found out later he went back home to get married.

973
01:03:49,939 --> 01:03:51,079
Do you also remember…

974
01:03:51,079 --> 01:03:52,879
when I had been crying for weeks?

975
01:03:53,399 --> 01:03:55,359
You asked me…

976
01:03:55,359 --> 01:03:56,399
what was wrong.

977
01:03:57,039 --> 01:03:58,759
And I told you my cat died.

978
01:03:59,479 --> 01:04:00,439
Actually,

979
01:04:00,679 --> 01:04:03,319
I was sad that he got married.

980
01:04:04,939 --> 01:04:08,119
That was when I knew I loved him

981
01:04:15,879 --> 01:04:22,159
Toy, that’s how I feel now.

982
01:04:26,839 --> 01:04:31,319
I have this strange feeling for this one guy.

983
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:35,509
I want to be near him.

984
01:04:38,179 --> 01:04:39,279
Keep thinking about him.

985
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:42,719
And worry about him.

986
01:04:50,439 --> 01:04:53,509
Is it like when you were with Mix?

987
01:04:55,279 --> 01:04:58,539
Or like when you had a crush on someone?

988
01:04:59,339 --> 01:05:00,559
It’s just that I’m not sure.

989
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:03,439
I’m not sure if this might just be something between friends or brothers.

990
01:05:14,939 --> 01:05:15,909
Honestly,

991
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:19,479
I’ve never been in love before.

992
01:05:23,109 --> 01:05:27,939
And I’ve never felt how I feel now before too.

993
01:05:30,179 --> 01:05:32,239
I can’t just give you the right answer about this.

994
01:05:32,839 --> 01:05:34,559

If you really like someone,

you wont’ be able to hide it for long.

Or even if you can,

998
01:05:43,339 --> 01:05:45,679
you might have realized it when it’s too late—just like me.

999
01:05:59,309 --> 01:06:00,739
Or do I like him?

Are you guys planning to go to Pho Chai’s annual fair?

That’s good.

01:06:35,309 --> 01:06:38,039
I’m looking for some friends to hang out with at the fair.

1003

Will you go too, Fluke?

1004
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:42,879
Since when has Yo become friends with Fluke and his gang?

1005

That’s right.

1006
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:46,959
Are you really going to keep picking on me like this?

1007
01:06:47,179 --> 01:06:48,739
If you can’t do it, just go home.
