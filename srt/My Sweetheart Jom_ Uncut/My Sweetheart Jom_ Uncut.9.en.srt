Your work is always important.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:05,080
The only thing that’s not important is me.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,160
Earn didn’t show up today?

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,120
What are you doing here?

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,720
This is Kaew, my friend.

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,760
Jom: You’ll pretend to have a crush on me?

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,480
Since we can’t kick her out, we have to make her leave on her own.

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,560
How?

9
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,000
If you can prove that you really like Jom,

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,520
I’ll get out of your way.

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,000
Happy Birthday, Yo.

12
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,320
You remember?

13
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,240
Of course, you mean a lot to our family.

14
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,200
Yotin: It feels so good!

15
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:38,080
Yotin: How did you know that you actually like guys…

16
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,640
more than girls?

17
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,800
I’m ready.

18
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,280
Where did you get those outfits from?

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,520
I borrowed them from Granny.

20
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,160
I know you’ll definitely work my tail off…

21
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,720
so I have to be prepared with these outfits.

22
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,320
That’s good. But it’s rather you who might not be able to make it.

23
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,240
We’ll see. Anyway,

24
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,800
if I do as you say…

25
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,320
you have to leave Jom alone and get out of here.

26
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,520
This one?

27
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,800
A bucket. You want me to fetch some water, don’t you?

28
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,920
Almost right. A bucket should be used to carry water.

29
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,840
But if you want to give up and feel too embarrassed,

30
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,200
you can use it to cover your head instead.

31
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,160
I wouldn’t mind.

32
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,000
I’d better use it to cover your mouth!

33
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,760
So? Are you going to do it or not?

34
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,520
Or you can change your mind and go back to your palace.

35
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,840
Pff! Just bring it on!

36
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,520
Filling water in a bucket…

37
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,480
is just a piece of cake!

38
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,640
You’d better get this piece of cake done first.

39
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,160
I’m giving you a last chance.

40
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,960
Give me your mother’s number. I’ll tell her to pick you up.

41
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,040
No way!

42
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,000
Move! I have work to do.

43
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,480
Load them all. Be careful too.

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Piece of cake. That’s it?

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,080
Yeah. Make it quick.

46
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,720
Don’t tell me I have to drain this pond.

47
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,440
Didn’t you say you’re ready for it?

48
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,880
I’m not giving up.

49
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,600
I’m going to tell Jom.

50
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,320
Whatever.

51
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,920
But that’s a foul, meaning you lose.

52
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,240
Fine.

53
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,080
Good. Let’s hurry up. I have lots of work for you today.

54
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,840
Hold on.

55
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,520
Are you really going to do this to me?

56
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,680
Do what? I’m not forcing you to do it.

57
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,560
You don’t have to do it if you don’t want to. It’s your choice.

58
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,440
Up to you.

59
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,920

Are you calling to check on the work progress, Chief?

83
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,400
Don’t make it sound like I’m the one who made her do it.

It’s quite hot today,

86
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,280

I’m trying to remove water from this pond.

93
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,480
But how are you going to get it done using only that bucket?

94
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,960
Why don’t you use a water pump instead?

95
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,560
You have a water pump here?!

101
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,800

109
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,000
Thank you, Chief. You can drop me off here.

110
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:41,600
Okay.

00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,800
Thank you so much for helping us with the water problem.

You’re welcome. See you. Please take care.

00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,160
Well, I was just thinking…

116
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,720
Is there anything? You can tell me.

117
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,920
I...

118
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,040
What is it?

119
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,600
I was just thinking to…

120
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,560
Geez!

121
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,720

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,000
I wasn’t being quiet though.

You were probably busy having your head in the clouds and didn’t notice me.

124
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,520

125
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,000

00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,760

00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,600
What did you say? What’s wrong with Kaew?

129
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,800
Kaew. Kaew.

130
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,040
Is Earn okay, Granny?

131
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,320
She’s okay. Worry about yourself first.

132
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,560
She only got tiny scratches here and there.

133
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,640
There, Chief is here to take you to the hospital.

134
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,320
Let’s go.

135
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,680
It’s okay, Granny. I’m fine.

136
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,360
It’s just a little bump on the head.

137
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,360
Just a little bump?

138
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,720
By the way, who told Earn to drain the pond like that?

139
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,000
I’m asking you both, answer me.

140
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,080
Well…

141
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,240
Well…

142
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,400
Jom and I just wanted to trick her, Granny.

143
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,640
So that she wouldn’t want to stay here and go back home to see her mum.

144
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,320
Really?

145
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,760
That way, she won't have to stay here, Grandma.

146
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,960
- Earn
- Is that true?

147
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,320
Do you really hate me and don’t want me to be here that much?

148
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,720
Earn, listen to me first.

149
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,120
You should stay here. I’ll go talk to her.

150
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,560
I want to explain everything to her.

151
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,920
Do you think she’ll listen to you now?

152
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,000
You should stay here with Kaew.

153
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,960
Ha! That’s how you should do it.

154
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,560
A tiny one like that won’t make you feel better.

155
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,880
Why are you following me?

156
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:40,440
Why does nobody love me? Whether my mum or Jom…

157
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,960
Do you really think that?

158
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,560
Mum doesn’t care about me, and Jom doesn’t want me to stay here.

159
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,360
What else could that mean?

160
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,120
You have no idea. Just be quiet.

161
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,320
You know what?

162
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,200
I used to think that my parents hated me too.

163
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,840
I have to be here in Pho Chai,

164
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,080
because I got myself into trouble with a politician’s son.

165
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,320
So, my parents decided to send me here.

166
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,880
Huh?

167
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,160
What? Surprised, aren’t you?

168
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,760
Although my parents told me it was for my safety and my own good,

169
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,840
deep down I couldn’t help thinking that…

170
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,880
they were trying to get rid of me – a trouble and nuisance in their life.

171
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,440
But I’ve just come to realize the truth lately.

172
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,200
How?

173
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,840
That politician’s son finally found me here,

174
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,920
and tried to beat me up.

175
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,480
What’s next? Did they do anything to you?

176
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,120
Of course. They even pointed a gun at my head like this.

177
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,440
Luckily, Jom was there to save me just in time.

178
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:11,600
I first thought they ran off because they were afraid of Jom and the people here.

179
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,840
But the truth was…

180
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,960
Jom said my dad had known all along they’d find me one day.

181
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,640
So, he had everything prepared.

182
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,680
That was when I finally realized that my parents loved me the most.

183
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,320
Sometimes, what our parents have done for us…

184
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:46,480
might be the way they say how they love us more than just saying it out loud.

185
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,040
Mummy!

186
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,360
Those two have been gone for quite a while now.

187
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,480
Why don’t you go look for them, Chief?

188
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,680
It’s been too long.

189
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,600
You’re right. I better go check on them.

190
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,280
Go on then.

191
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,720
Where’s everyone?

192
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,920
Oh, there you are.

193
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,920
Hello.

194
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,320
Hello, Madame.

195
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,280
Hello.

196
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,400
It’s been a while. You’re looking as beautiful as usual.

197
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:34,720
It’s about Earn. She comes here to impose on you so often. I feel sorry about that.

198
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,280
So, I’m here to pick her up.

199
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,800
I’m really sorry, Chief, that you have to babysit her for me.

200
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,600
Don’t worry.

201
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,880
So, where’s Earn?

202
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,120
Well, she’s…

203
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,600
I’m really sorry, Aunt Nart.

204
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,280
I’ll go get her for you.

205
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,640
It’s my fault.

206
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,600
It’s my fault too. I made him do that.

207
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,520
No, no. It’s my fault, dear.

208
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,360
That’s why she ran here in the first place.

209
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:17,640
All right, it doesn’t matter whose fault it is.

210
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,240
And no need to go look for them.

211
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,920
Look, there they are.

212
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,640
- Earn
- Mummy!

213
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,280
Oh, sweetie! I miss you!

214
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,920
My dear.

215
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,440
Mummy.

216
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,720
I miss you so much. How are you?

217
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,320
Are you okay? Where have you been?

218
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,800
Mummy, I’m so sorry.

219
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,920
It’s me who should say sorry. From now on, I’ll…

220
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,880
No, it’s me who should apologize to you, Mummy.

221
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,840
I’m so selfish. I never thought about how you feel.

222
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,720
You’ve worked so hard to raise me up,

223
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,440
but I still said those things to hurt you.

224
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,240
I’m so sorry.

225
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,280
I love you too, Sweetie. Let’s go home, dear.

226
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,680
Earn, I’m sorry.

227
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,120
I’m sorry too.

228
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,720
If you want me to forgive you,

229
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,880
try changing from apologizing to…

230
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,080
saying I love you instead.

231
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,120
Geez!

232
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,880
Just kidding. I’m not mad at you.

233
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,480
As for you,

234
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,120
I’ll let you off this time…

235
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,280
since you’re actually not my rival in love.

236
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,640
Now, I can go home and sleep soundly.

237
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,880
I knew it. Someone like Jom wouldn’t have fallen for an old hag like her.

238
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,240
Hey!

239
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,600
I’ll let it slide this time. We’re even now.

240
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,000
Mummy, let’s go. I want to go home now.

241
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,760
Of course, dear.

242
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,560
But first, can you change into something else?

243
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,680
You look like a farm worker.

244
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,680
Isn’t it pretty?

245
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,720
Thanks.

246
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,880
Let’s go, dear. Enough with the bickering.

247
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,480
Let’s go home.

00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:08,969
We have to give you a big credit this time.

255
00:18:10,869 --> 00:18:15,609
But what did you tell her to make her finally come to her sense?

256
00:18:17,569 --> 00:18:20,169
I just told her my dad had saved me from Sack.

257
00:18:21,169 --> 00:18:23,249
I also told her that…

258
00:18:23,649 --> 00:18:25,769
no parents will ever not love their children.

259
00:18:29,269 --> 00:18:34,529
But I’m sure that kid will soon try to pick a fight with her mum and come stay here again.

260
00:18:35,969 --> 00:18:38,689
She’s cute though.

261
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:41,009
Don’t you like her a bit?

262
00:18:41,869 --> 00:18:42,709
No, he doesn’t.

263
00:18:44,469 --> 00:18:48,529
He once told me that she’s like a little sister to him.

264
00:18:51,209 --> 00:18:52,039
Right?

265
00:18:56,569 --> 00:19:00,409
All right then, I’ll go get some rest first.

266
00:19:00,869 --> 00:19:02,239
Mhm, go on.

267
00:19:08,239 --> 00:19:09,509
What’s wrong with that pup?

268
00:19:09,909 --> 00:19:11,239
He’s probably possessive of the owner.

269
00:19:13,609 --> 00:19:17,209
You said so yourself that he’s like a puppy.

270
00:19:17,439 --> 00:19:19,489
He’s possessive of his dad.

271
00:19:19,869 --> 00:19:21,489
- Hey.
- I’m off too!

272
00:19:21,489 --> 00:19:22,369
Geez!

273
00:19:33,809 --> 00:19:38,289
Kib is good. Fai is also nice.

274
00:19:39,609 --> 00:19:42,689
Fluke, whom should I pick?

275
00:19:42,689 --> 00:19:43,849
What the heck?

276
00:19:44,439 --> 00:19:46,329
You’ve been acting like a pervert since morning.

277
00:19:46,409 --> 00:19:47,809
Hey, I’m not a pervert.

278
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:50,439
I’ve been thinking.

279
00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:52,609
Before we graduate,

280
00:19:52,969 --> 00:19:54,409
we should get ourselves a girlfriend.

281
00:19:54,869 --> 00:19:59,329
It’d leave a great imprint on our memory about this school.

282
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,169
What do you guys think?

283
00:20:03,009 --> 00:20:05,809
I don’t know. Just ask Poe.

284
00:20:06,369 --> 00:20:07,409
So?

285
00:20:08,869 --> 00:20:09,929
Yeah, I…

286
00:20:09,929 --> 00:20:11,649
Why the heck would you ask him?

287
00:20:12,209 --> 00:20:14,249
No one would want him as a boyfriend.

288
00:20:14,569 --> 00:20:17,169
Unlike you and me.

289
00:20:17,769 --> 00:20:21,409
I’m telling you, there are less than five pretty girls in our school.

290
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:25,409
But only two of them you should never mess with.

291
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:27,329
Do you know who?

292
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:31,689
Prae and Rose.

293
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:38,469
Why?

294
00:20:39,969 --> 00:20:46,489
Those two always act high and mighty. Do you think they’d pick us?

295
00:20:51,409 --> 00:20:52,209
Right?

296
00:20:52,369 --> 00:20:53,169
Poe.

297
00:20:54,609 --> 00:20:55,409
Rose.

298
00:20:55,409 --> 00:20:58,209
I’ve made some sandwiches today. Please try them.

299
00:21:01,639 --> 00:21:03,009
Thanks, Rose.

300
00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:07,209
Let me know what you think about them.

301
00:21:26,309 --> 00:21:30,129
Poe, why does she have to give it to you?

302
00:21:32,009 --> 00:21:33,769
It’s nothing.

303
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:38,729
Nothing what? Why did she give this to you?

304
00:21:41,439 --> 00:21:44,169
Hey, are you going to tell us or not?

305
00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:46,729
I’ll eat it then!

306
00:21:46,729 --> 00:21:48,849
Don’t!

307
00:21:50,569 --> 00:21:51,729
Fine, I’ll say it.

308
00:21:54,169 --> 00:22:00,849
I…I’ve had a crush on her for a while.

309
00:22:01,049 --> 00:22:04,609
But I never got enough guts to confess to her.

310
00:22:05,129 --> 00:22:08,409
But then Yo found out.

311
00:22:09,469 --> 00:22:12,709
He told me to be a man and confess to her.

312
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:18,329
He even told me that…

313
00:22:18,769 --> 00:22:23,809
A broken heart is better than never to have loved at all.

314
00:22:26,239 --> 00:22:29,639
So, I decided to muster up and tell Rose how I felt.

315
00:22:34,439 --> 00:22:37,239
And…what did she say?

316
00:22:38,569 --> 00:22:40,649
Can’t you tell, dude?

317
00:22:43,769 --> 00:22:45,129
I’ll have it then!

318
00:22:45,509 --> 00:22:47,489
You jerk! Give it back!

319
00:22:47,809 --> 00:22:48,609
Bye, dude!

320
00:23:02,689 --> 00:23:03,409
Hey!

321
00:23:21,769 --> 00:23:24,449
Remember when you asked me if I like Prae?

322
00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:31,839
Yes, I like her.

323
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:35,689
Huh? What did you say?

324
00:23:37,209 --> 00:23:38,439
Why are you telling me then?

325
00:23:41,109 --> 00:23:45,809
Poe did it because of you. He already told me.

326
00:23:46,069 --> 00:23:48,009
About him confessing to Rose.

327
00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:53,329
Who would’ve thought he’d have the courage to do it.

328
00:23:57,109 --> 00:23:58,469
I’m telling you this…

329
00:24:00,909 --> 00:24:03,289
because I want to have that kind of courage too.

330
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:11,209
Before, I had never wanted to be your friend.

331
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:17,649
But now, I’ve changed my mind.

332
00:24:35,709 --> 00:24:38,569
From now on, you can tell me if you need anything.

333
00:24:40,069 --> 00:24:43,609
Sure. There’s one thing I want to tell you.

334
00:24:45,239 --> 00:24:46,769
Don’t be mad at me though.

335
00:24:48,769 --> 00:24:49,569
What is it?

336
00:24:51,469 --> 00:24:53,009
I haven’t washed my hand yet.

337
00:25:07,209 --> 00:25:08,809
Shit!

338
00:25:16,969 --> 00:25:19,649
Ouch!

339
00:25:21,409 --> 00:25:22,449
Shit!

340
00:25:31,009 --> 00:25:33,009
Do you really think it’d work?

341
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:38,769
Who knows? But it’s worth trying, isn’t it?

342
00:25:41,069 --> 00:25:43,109
Will Prae and Rose really come?

343
00:25:45,409 --> 00:25:48,689
They will. I see them coming here every day.

344
00:25:48,689 --> 00:25:51,329
In a minute, Prae will come sit around here with her lunch.

345
00:25:54,089 --> 00:25:56,689
- Awww.
-  It’s not like I was stalking on her.

346
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,409
I just happen to see her there.

347
00:25:58,929 --> 00:26:01,689
You’re stuttering.

348
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:03,049
I’m not.

349
00:26:12,209 --> 00:26:13,849
- Dude, she’s here.
-  Where?

350
00:26:32,609 --> 00:26:33,439
Let’s sit over there.

351
00:26:40,669 --> 00:26:41,849
Hey, guys!

352
00:26:42,069 --> 00:26:44,489
Are you planning to go to the annual fair in Pho Chai?

353
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:48,689
That’s great. I’m looking for some friends to hang out there with me.

354
00:26:50,239 --> 00:26:51,649
Are you going too, Fluke?

355
00:26:53,209 --> 00:26:55,529
Since when have Yo and Fluke become friends?

356
00:26:56,639 --> 00:26:59,009
Yeah. Do you want me to ask?

357
00:27:00,109 --> 00:27:02,489
No need. I’m just curious.

358
00:27:03,009 --> 00:27:04,849
Let’s go. Don’t mind them.

359
00:27:23,239 --> 00:27:24,439
I think they’re talking about it.

360
00:27:28,239 --> 00:27:31,809
Should we…go to Loy Kratong festival in Pho Chai this year?

361
00:27:34,769 --> 00:27:41,489
If you win the Noppamas Queen contest this year,
Yo will definitely regret turning you down.

362
00:27:42,209 --> 00:27:46,009
Yes. You’re damn right.

363
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:57,569
By the way, do you have to be a local
if you want to participate in the Noppamas Queen contest?

364
00:27:58,509 --> 00:28:03,169
ก็ไม่นะ ฉันเห็นคนต่างตำบลก็ประกวดได้เหมือนกันอ่ะ

365
00:28:07,809 --> 00:28:09,209
Why are you asking though?

366
00:28:10,509 --> 00:28:12,849
Don’t tell me…

367
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:16,569
Yes, I’ve decided.

368
00:28:16,889 --> 00:28:20,849
I’m going to participate in the Noppamas Queen contest in Pho Chai.

Oh, it’s Rose.

371
00:28:41,609 --> 00:28:45,639
She said everything is going as planned.

372
00:28:55,129 --> 00:28:56,769
Just like what we thought.

373
00:29:00,909 --> 00:29:04,769
But…Prae doesn’t like me though.

374
00:29:05,439 --> 00:29:08,169
Will she like me if we do this?

375
00:29:08,269 --> 00:29:09,069
That’s easy.

376
00:29:09,809 --> 00:29:11,639
You have to find out what she likes first.

377
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:13,909
Then try to please her with what she likes.

378
00:29:14,509 --> 00:29:15,409
That’s it.

379
00:29:16,209 --> 00:29:16,889

Right?

381
00:29:24,849 --> 00:29:28,249
The other day when I was checking out her IG,

382
00:29:28,569 --> 00:29:31,369
I saw her story post where she was playing with her Siberian dog.

383
00:29:33,529 --> 00:29:36,249
So, you want Fluke to act like a dog, right?

384
00:29:39,639 --> 00:29:40,849
Enough, you guys.

00:29:41,129 --> 00:29:42,409

Just take him. Go.

Hey, I’ll have this then.

393
00:30:15,709 --> 00:30:16,509
Yo,

394
00:30:18,669 --> 00:30:20,509
can I ask you something?

395
00:30:20,849 --> 00:30:21,689
Mhm.

396
00:30:22,069 --> 00:30:24,609
Why don’t you like Prae?

397
00:30:25,639 --> 00:30:27,309
Because I already have someone that I like.

398
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:30,169
Who?

399
00:30:31,769 --> 00:30:33,109
Can I tell you later?

400
00:30:34,309 --> 00:30:37,839
I’m still not sure if that person likes me too.

401
00:30:40,709 --> 00:30:42,209
Have you told her then?

402
00:30:47,909 --> 00:30:49,489
Hey, you’re just the same then.

403
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:52,609
Why telling me to muster up and confess?

404
00:30:53,439 --> 00:30:54,239
I know.

405
00:30:56,869 --> 00:30:59,889
See? Do you get how I feel now?

406
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:04,689
When the person you like is near, you can’t help feeling fluttering.

407
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:12,729
Is that what it’s like when you love someone?

408
00:31:15,209 --> 00:31:16,239
Of course.

409
00:31:27,609 --> 00:31:30,529
Yes, I know that.

410
00:31:32,269 --> 00:31:33,069
Yes.

You two, go play somewhere else.

412
00:31:49,009 --> 00:31:54,449
Listen, Boss. Workers like us need money.

413
00:31:54,449 --> 00:31:59,049
You don’t leave us any money at all. How can we get the work done?

414
00:31:59,869 --> 00:32:03,369
If you can’t do it, then don’t.

415
00:32:04,569 --> 00:32:07,969
I’ll find someone better to do it instead.

416
00:32:08,409 --> 00:32:11,049
Fine. Never mind then.

417
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:14,169
I still have some money left.

418
00:32:14,169 --> 00:32:16,009
Let me take care of it.

Fuck! How dare he hang up on me again.

421
00:32:25,369 --> 00:32:28,769
Just wait until I become a village chief again.

422
00:32:28,769 --> 00:32:34,289
I’m going to make you craw and beg for me to help. Damn you!

423
00:32:34,969 --> 00:32:36,239
Are you sure you can do that?

424
00:32:37,809 --> 00:32:41,009
Geez, this brat. Just shut up if you don’t have anything good to say.

425
00:32:41,009 --> 00:32:45,729
But it was true though. Even the zinc sheet knows it.

426
00:32:46,009 --> 00:32:49,289
Let’s think about it.

427
00:32:49,849 --> 00:32:53,569
We asked Luangpor if we could be the organizer of the annual fair this year. Did he agree?

428
00:32:53,929 --> 00:32:54,889
No.

429
00:32:55,129 --> 00:32:58,409
And there’s also Chief Jom’s friend. That woman friend.

430
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:00,009
She’s here to help promote for him.

431
00:33:01,069 --> 00:33:02,969
Which bitch are you talking about?

432
00:33:03,069 --> 00:33:05,249
I think her name is Kaew.

433
00:33:05,929 --> 00:33:09,009
She’s giving out bio-extract to the village people for free.

434
00:33:09,009 --> 00:33:13,329
She said you can use it to digest sugarcane plants so that you won’t have to burn them.

435
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,609
The village people are so happy about it.

436
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:18,639
See? They have all the advantages.

437
00:33:19,269 --> 00:33:20,369

438
00:33:22,639 --> 00:33:23,969

No but.

You wait here.

00:46:41,129 --> 00:46:42,099
What is it?

667
00:46:42,759 --> 00:46:45,059
Looking from the outside, he might seem fine.

668
00:46:45,419 --> 00:46:48,299
But inhaling a lot of smoke from the fire…

669
00:46:48,299 --> 00:46:51,419
can cause a severe damage to the patient’s internal organs.

670
00:46:52,339 --> 00:46:56,779
I’d suggest him to be admitted here for a night to get more oxygen into his body.

Where’s Yo? Where’s he?

726
00:49:59,345 --> 00:50:00,185
Jom.

727
00:50:01,385 --> 00:50:06,505
Wow, has he been listening? What a perfect timing.

728
00:50:07,425 --> 00:50:08,585
You’re awake.

729
00:50:11,225 --> 00:50:12,385
Do you have a stomachache?

730
00:50:13,785 --> 00:50:17,025
No. I’m hungry.

731
00:50:25,145 --> 00:50:27,425
It’s good you’re here. I’ll leave him to you then.

732
00:50:27,705 --> 00:50:28,505
Okay.

733
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:30,585
I’ll tell the doctor you finally came to.

734
00:50:35,945 --> 00:50:37,385
Did you say you’re hungry?

735
00:50:38,065 --> 00:50:39,705
Is there anything you want to eat?

736
00:50:40,305 --> 00:50:41,545
Anything at all.

737
00:50:47,425 --> 00:50:48,865
Thank you, Yo.

738
00:50:51,785 --> 00:50:52,865
For what?

739
00:50:54,545 --> 00:50:57,505
For saving me from the fire.

740
00:50:58,385 --> 00:50:59,785
Kaew told me everything.

741
00:51:02,025 --> 00:51:03,865
Now you’re the one to talk.

742
00:51:04,105 --> 00:51:06,265
Kaew also told me everything.

743
00:51:06,465 --> 00:51:08,705
That you ran into the farm while the fire was still spreading.

744
00:51:10,425 --> 00:51:12,065
Weren’t you worried about yourself at all?

745
00:51:12,705 --> 00:51:14,945
What if you hadn’t regained consciousness?

746
00:51:15,905 --> 00:51:18,265
You’re a village chief not a superhero.

747
00:51:30,985 --> 00:51:35,025
Do you know how scared I was when I saw you stop breathing?

748
00:51:42,025 --> 00:51:42,865
What?

749
00:51:50,585 --> 00:51:51,385
Feel that?

750
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:57,985
I’m still warm, aren’t I? I won’t die so easily.

751
00:52:19,865 --> 00:52:21,745
I’d better go get the doctor.

752
00:52:22,385 --> 00:52:26,105
Kaew is taking too long. She probably couldn’t find the doctor.

753
00:52:28,065 --> 00:52:30,385
Hey! What are you doing?

754
00:52:32,425 --> 00:52:35,905
You should stay still. You’re still hurt.

755
00:52:36,065 --> 00:52:36,945
I’m thirsty.

756
00:52:40,145 --> 00:52:41,385
Just tell me then.

757
00:52:42,905 --> 00:52:43,705
I’m thirsty.

758
00:52:44,705 --> 00:52:45,505
I know.

759
00:52:55,145 --> 00:52:56,545
How are you feeling, Chief?

760
00:52:59,025 --> 00:53:00,225
Much better now.

761
00:53:01,705 --> 00:53:02,505
Nurse.

762
00:53:08,225 --> 00:53:12,505
According to the result, there’re only minor physical injuries.

763
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:18,025
Does that mean I can go home today?

764
00:53:18,825 --> 00:53:20,705
Easy, Chief. I’m not done yet.

765
00:53:21,345 --> 00:53:25,865
There might not be any obvious symptoms at the moment.

766
00:53:25,865 --> 00:53:29,905
But you have inhaled quite a lot of smoke.

767
00:53:29,905 --> 00:53:32,625
I’d like you to go through a detailed checkup one more time.

768
00:53:33,065 --> 00:53:37,225
But doctor, I’m feeling fine now.

769
00:53:37,385 --> 00:53:41,025
What if you’re not. You’re a village chief, not a doctor.

770
00:53:41,505 --> 00:53:44,225
Just listen to what the doctor said.

771
00:53:44,345 --> 00:53:47,905
I still have work to do. I really can’t stay here.

772
00:53:48,385 --> 00:53:52,425
The village people wouldn’t mind if you’ll take a few days off.

773
00:53:57,345 --> 00:54:02,025
What I want to say is, I’m not asking you to stay at the hospital.

774
00:54:02,345 --> 00:54:04,305
You can observe the symptoms at home.

775
00:54:04,305 --> 00:54:07,305
If there’s anything unusual, you can always come back to see me.

776
00:54:07,625 --> 00:54:09,825
Okay. Thank you, Doctor.

777
00:54:12,225 --> 00:54:13,025
Thank you.

778
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:28,705
May you stay healthy and be shielded from all the illnesses.

779
00:55:29,865 --> 00:55:36,145
May all the good things come into your life.

780
00:55:36,865 --> 00:55:39,065
Bless you!

781
00:55:39,425 --> 00:55:40,505
Bless you!

782
00:55:40,545 --> 00:55:41,825
Come here, Yo.

783
00:55:42,825 --> 00:55:45,065
You too, son.

784
00:55:45,505 --> 00:55:49,585
You have done many good things for the chief.

785
00:55:49,905 --> 00:55:51,865
May all those good things return to you.

786
00:55:51,945 --> 00:55:54,145
Whatever you wish for, may it all come true.

787
00:55:54,625 --> 00:55:57,745
May all your wishes come true, dear.

788
00:56:00,145 --> 00:56:01,705
Bless you!

789
00:56:01,905 --> 00:56:05,065
Have a happy life, both of you.

790
00:56:14,185 --> 00:56:16,705
- “Give me a lemon."
- “And I’ll give you some lime.”

791
00:56:16,745 --> 00:56:17,545
“Give me your daughter.”

792
00:56:17,625 --> 00:56:18,545
“And I’ll give you my son.”

793
00:56:18,705 --> 00:56:19,705
“Come over, everyone.”

794
00:56:19,945 --> 00:56:22,185
“Let’s get them married.”

795
00:56:25,425 --> 00:56:27,265
What the heck are you brats doing?

796
00:56:27,505 --> 00:56:29,025
It’s not a wedding, you rascals!

797
00:56:29,025 --> 00:56:31,665
Go play somewhere else. It’s not that kind of ceremony.

798
00:56:31,665 --> 00:56:35,465
Geez, those brats!

799
00:56:38,345 --> 00:56:41,505
Oh, Headman Kla.

800
00:56:52,425 --> 00:56:58,585
He told them so many times not to use fire, but those workers just wanted to do it the easy way.

801
00:57:01,465 --> 00:57:03,225
Can we believe Korn though?

802
00:57:03,745 --> 00:57:05,705
I think we can, Chief.

803
00:57:05,985 --> 00:57:09,465
This year, the factory is offering quite a good price for fresh sugarcane.

804
00:57:09,465 --> 00:57:15,505
Korn’s farm still has plenty of time before the delivery date.

805
00:57:15,505 --> 00:57:17,745
Why would he burn down the farm and ruin his chance to get a good price?

806
00:57:18,745 --> 00:57:20,865
Do you think Uncle Yod is involved?

807
00:57:25,265 --> 00:57:28,265
You think he did this?

808
00:57:28,665 --> 00:57:29,345
Yes.

809
00:57:30,705 --> 00:57:36,105
When Kaew was at the farm, she saw a car going in.

810
00:57:36,385 --> 00:57:39,665
She also saw Uncle Yod and Pol in that car.

811
00:57:39,665 --> 00:57:42,185
After that, the car came out from Korn’s farm.

812
00:57:45,585 --> 00:57:50,785
I also think he’s behind this.

813
00:57:51,425 --> 00:57:58,465
But I didn’t tell you earlier because I still don’t have enough evidence.

814
00:57:59,945 --> 00:58:01,345
What do you mean?

815
00:58:03,265 --> 00:58:05,585
When I was interrogating the workers,

816
00:58:05,585 --> 00:58:10,825
they said Yod promised them a job at Huay Takay after they finished harvesting Korn’s farm.

817
00:58:11,785 --> 00:58:16,065
Those workers were afraid they wouldn’t make it in time, so they decided to burn it down.

818
00:58:17,945 --> 00:58:19,745
That bastard is quite smart.

819
00:58:20,305 --> 00:58:23,505
He made it look like the workers’ doing.

820
00:58:23,745 --> 00:58:25,185
No one can blame it on him.

821
00:58:27,825 --> 00:58:32,545
I just don’t understand why he must do it when Kaew was still collecting samples there.

822
00:58:35,945 --> 00:58:39,345
Because he knew you would go there to help your friend.

823
00:58:40,745 --> 00:58:42,825
He set up this incident to lure you in…

824
00:58:43,145 --> 00:58:45,705
hoping you might get killed in the fire.

825
00:58:46,545 --> 00:58:50,905
That son of a bitch is going way over the line this time.

826
00:58:51,225 --> 00:58:55,265
Just you wait, I’m going to drag those two here…

827
00:58:55,265 --> 00:58:57,785
and see if I could force the truth out of them.

828
00:59:24,945 --> 00:59:30,025
Yo, aren’t you studying upstairs?

829
00:59:31,225 --> 00:59:35,265
Uncle Kla looked so serious like that. How could I focus on studying?

830
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:36,385
What’s going on?

831
00:59:37,585 --> 00:59:41,745
He just came to report more details about the fire. Nothing much.

832
00:59:43,745 --> 00:59:48,145
But if you’re stressed out, you can always tell me.

833
00:59:50,665 --> 00:59:52,225
I was just pondering about something.

834
00:59:54,065 --> 00:59:56,625
Can you take me to that lotus pond we went to the other day?

835
00:59:57,585 --> 00:59:59,905
I just want to clear off my head.

836
01:00:03,625 --> 01:00:06,945
Sure. I’ll tell those three kids to join us too.

837
01:00:10,025 --> 01:00:11,945
I want to go there with you alone.

838
01:00:13,545 --> 01:00:14,985
Only two of us?

839
01:00:15,305 --> 01:00:16,105
Please?

840
01:01:07,185 --> 01:01:10,625
They’re all over the pond. Why didn’t you tell your workers to cut them

841
01:01:14,505 --> 01:01:17,105
Well, I…

842
01:01:19,185 --> 01:01:20,905
I want to keep them for you.

843
01:01:22,185 --> 01:01:22,985
Really?

844
01:01:23,785 --> 01:01:24,585
No.

845
01:01:25,425 --> 01:01:27,665
It’s not time to cut them yet.

846
01:01:50,185 --> 01:01:51,585
Why are you looking at me?

847
01:01:52,465 --> 01:01:53,825
Aren’t you here to look at the lotus?

848
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:55,545
Here, look at them.

849
01:01:56,625 --> 01:02:00,025
Why are you looking at my face? Is there anything on it?

850
01:02:00,785 --> 01:02:04,585
I’m just looking at your face. Does that make you nervous?

851
01:02:07,625 --> 01:02:08,745
No, it doesn’t.

852
01:02:10,545 --> 01:02:12,065
You’re acting weird today.

853
01:02:13,225 --> 01:02:15,545
Or is it because you’re stressed out?

854
01:02:16,705 --> 01:02:21,305
But you just told me it wasn’t because of studying.

855
01:02:23,945 --> 01:02:25,425
So, it could only be that one thing.

856
01:02:26,785 --> 01:02:27,585
I know it.

857
01:02:31,745 --> 01:02:32,785
You do?

858
01:02:35,145 --> 01:02:36,705
It’s definitely about girls.

859
01:02:40,625 --> 01:02:42,745
But you seem to be quite popular.

860
01:02:43,265 --> 01:02:44,345
That’s understandable.

861
01:02:45,385 --> 01:02:47,425
Can you stop making other people confused?

862
01:02:48,145 --> 01:02:50,505
Confused? What do you mean? Who?

863
01:02:51,945 --> 01:02:52,985
Me.

864
01:02:53,945 --> 01:02:56,425
Sometimes you’re nice to me, but sometimes you enjoy teasing me.

865
01:02:56,425 --> 01:02:59,425
And stop saying something like I’m having a crush on someone else.

866
01:02:59,425 --> 01:03:04,705
I’m telling you, I can only fall for one person at a time.

867
01:03:05,785 --> 01:03:06,665
That’s good for you.

868
01:03:09,865 --> 01:03:13,985
Let’s go home then, shall we?

869
01:03:14,465 --> 01:03:15,705
I have something to tell you.

870
01:03:17,705 --> 01:03:19,345
What is it? Can’t you wait until we get home?

871
01:03:19,785 --> 01:03:21,705
Granny, Kaew, and the kids are waiting to have lunch with us.

872
01:03:21,985 --> 01:03:22,545
No.

873
01:03:34,905 --> 01:03:36,025
I’m going to tell you now.

874
01:03:38,945 --> 01:03:42,025
Let’s go home. I think it’s too sunny.

875
01:03:44,505 --> 01:03:45,465
I said no.

876
01:03:47,385 --> 01:03:48,305
Let it go.

877
01:03:50,145 --> 01:03:51,465
I have to tell you now.

878
01:03:52,785 --> 01:03:54,265
I want to go home. It’s too sunny.

879
01:03:54,665 --> 01:03:55,625
I said no.

880
01:03:55,865 --> 01:03:56,665
Let’s go home.

881
01:03:57,065 --> 01:03:57,865
No.

882
01:03:58,945 --> 01:03:59,445
Yes.

883
01:03:59,905 --> 01:04:00,705
No.

884
01:04:00,985 --> 01:04:01,905
let’s go home, Yo.

885
01:04:02,025 --> 01:04:02,825
I said no.

886
01:04:02,905 --> 01:04:03,585
Yes.

887
01:04:03,785 --> 01:04:05,065
Listen to me first.

888
01:04:05,065 --> 01:04:06,745
You should just come home and talk to me

889
01:04:06,745 --> 01:04:07,265
Let it go.

890
01:04:08,065 --> 01:04:08,505
No.

891
01:04:08,505 --> 01:04:09,185
Let’s go home!

892
01:04:09,185 --> 01:04:10,425
Don’t be stubborn,Yo

893
01:04:21,785 --> 01:04:22,305
Yo!

894
01:04:24,025 --> 01:04:24,585
Yo!

895
01:04:26,545 --> 01:04:27,065
Yo!

896
01:04:32,025 --> 01:04:32,705
Jom.

897
01:05:08,785 --> 01:05:09,585
[Next Episode]
What’s wrong with you?

898
01:05:10,705 --> 01:05:11,905
I’m your boyfriend.

899
01:05:13,025 --> 01:05:14,305
Wait, give me a hug first.

900
01:05:14,905 --> 01:05:18,305
What has he done to you? Why are you looking so nervous, Chief?

901
01:05:18,305 --> 01:05:20,265
Can you stop being nosy for a second?

902
01:05:24,425 --> 01:05:27,305
Welcome to Pho Chai’s annual fair!

903
01:05:27,665 --> 01:05:31,425
Whom are you waiting for, cutie? Wanna come with me, babe?

904
01:05:31,425 --> 01:05:33,105
Hey, what are you doing?

905
01:05:33,105 --> 01:05:34,665
What? Wanna play hero?

906
01:05:34,665 --> 01:05:36,505
Go and meet me over there then.

907
01:05:40,025 --> 01:05:41,305
Is that a gunshot?

908
01:05:41,305 --> 01:05:42,425
Maybe it’s just the transformer blowing up.

909
01:05:42,425 --> 01:05:43,225
Wait here.
