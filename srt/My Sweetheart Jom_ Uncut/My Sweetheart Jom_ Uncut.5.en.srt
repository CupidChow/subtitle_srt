00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,760
[Previously]
I have nothing to do

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,460
with that fire at the co-op.

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:06,400
If you really didn’t order that man to do it,

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,100
then hand him over to us.

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,360
Go get him yourself.

6
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,330
I don’t want problems.

7
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,100
But I do.

8
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,060
I don’t know how cool you are in Bangkok.

9
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,020
But here, I rule.

10
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,500
You’ve promised me and your parents that you will not cause any trouble.

11
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:26,160
So what? Should I just stand there and let them bully me?

12
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,380
I don’t know why you’re mad at me.

13
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,740
But I said all that out of good intentions.

14
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,560
Are you done?

15
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,760
It’s just a handkerchief. Just chuck it.

16
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,140
You gave it to me, so I should take good care of it.

17
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,860
But next time, don’t give me anything.

18
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:38,860
I can’t bother looking after it.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,300
Why are we here?

20
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,360
To relief your stress.

21
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,960
Our house has this one rule…

22
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,530
where we will not take home any bad feelings or negative thoughts…

23
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,460
since it might cause a fight within our family.

24
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,360
What if it makes me feel even more upset?

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,800
Just try it first.

43
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,960
Where are you taking me?

44
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,100
Are you scared?

45
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,930
Don’t worry, I’m not going to sell you to a trafficker.

46
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,700
I’m not scared.

47
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,560
I just want to know where we’re going.

48
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,360
If you don’t tell me,

49
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,700
I’m going to jump.

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,530
I’m serious.

51
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,530
I really mean it.

52
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,260
Go on. Do it if you want.

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,960
Okay, I’ll tell you.

54
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,530
Since you’re quite moody,

55
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,560
I want to take you to eat something delicious.

56
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:12,730
Huh?

57
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,500
In the middle of the field?

58
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,460
Over there.

59
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,540
It’s called “Rice & Curry In The Field”.

60
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,500
Have you ever heard about it?

61
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,580
Nah, never.

62
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,420
It’s an unseen place in our community.

63
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,860
If you want to eat here, you have to call the owner and book it first.

64
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,100
Then take this special car to the restaurant. Or else, you won’t get to eat.

65
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,780
Hey!

66
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,660
That’s not a gear.

67
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,700
Sorry.

68
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,860
What the heck?

69
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,140
Ready?

70
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,380
If you’re ready, close your eyes.

71
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:04,960
Why do I have to do that?

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,860
I want you to close your eyes…

73
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:11,140
and open them when the food is here.

74
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,560
Just do it.

75
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:16,130
Fine.

76
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,930
Wait.

77
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,600
Don’t give me anything weird or bizarre.

78
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,730
If it’s like that spicy lizard last time,

79
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,700
don’t give it to me.

80
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,130
I won’t give you something like that.

81
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,560
I just want you to try our Pho Chai’s special menu.

82
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:40,260
You can only find it here in Pho Chai.

83
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,100
Fine.

84
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,800
But if anything happens to me,

85
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,260
it’s your fault.

86
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,060
Ready?

87
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,300
Close your eyes.

88
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,800
Bring it on.

89
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:53,730
Okay.

90
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,200
Ready?

91
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,740
Open your mouth.

92
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,760
Can you smell it?

93
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:12,930
Open your mouth.

94
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,340
Is it good?

95
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,000
What meat is it?

96
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,560
Just a simple grilled pork neck.

97
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:32,330
I don’t believe you.

98
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,000
You said it’s Pho Chai’s special menu.

99
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,200
So, it must be something unique.

100
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,330
I just said that to get your attention.

101
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:43,760
ฉันก็แค่อยากใI wanted you to focus all your senses on tasting it.

102
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,530
That’s all.

103
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:49,300
But,

104
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,700
it does have a secret recipe though.

105
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:52,760
That is…

106
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:55,560
Do you know what it is?

107
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,700
An MSG, right?

108
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:06,200
Yeah, I told them to put in two packs of MSG.

109
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,400
Two packs?

110
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,460
Mhm.

111
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,060
You’re quite funny.

112
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,500
There, more food is coming.

113
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,740
This one is really good.

114
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,730
This fried chicken is also special. You can’t find it elsewhere.

115
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:30,980
Try it.

116
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:38,580
They’re special because of the efforts we have made.

117
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:42,140
Do you know how tough it is to travel here?

118
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,000
It’s like that problem we’ve encountered today.

119
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,960
It’s only a tiny obstacle that’s blocking our way to success.

120
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,400
But it can’t stop us. It’d only make our success much sweeter.

121
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,860
Just like you.

122
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,940
You came to Pho Chai…

123
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,260
and might find some obstacles here.

124
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,260
But once you can get through it, you’ll be so proud of yourself.

125
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,580
Trust me.

126
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,660
Hey, have you been listening to what I said?

127
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,220
What did you say?

128
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,780
[Sigh]

129
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,300
Never mind.

130
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,330
I’m glad you enjoy the food.

131
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Come eat with me.

132
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,900
Okay, I’ll join you.

133
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,500
The spicy minced meat here is really good.

134
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:37,660
Good, huh?

135
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,820
You can’t find something like this in Bangkok, right?

136
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,260
Do you like it?

137
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,300
Like what?

138
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:49,800
The restaurant I took you earlier.

139
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,400
Do you like it?

140
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,860
If you do, I’ll take you there more often.

141
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,330
Is this how you try to make up with someone?

142
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,660
Do you like it?

143
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,660
It’s good. But I’m not like the others though.

144
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,360
When Earn is mad at you,

145
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,660
do you also take her here?

146
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:14,330
Who told you that?

147
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,360
I’ve never brought anyone here.

148
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:20,730
You’re the first one.

149
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,140
[Gunshot]

150
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,360
What’s that?

151
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,560
Is it a gunshot?

152
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,200
I think so.

153
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,760
It’s around here.

154
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,600
Get in the car.

155
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,420
Let’s go check it out.

156
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,380
Let’s go!

157
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:50,930
Please, Chief,

158
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,560
I’m begging you.

159
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:55,020
Please give me one more week.

160
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:56,500
You can take my car.

161
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,060
But please don’t take my land.

162
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,260
That’s not my problem.

163
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:00,930
You can’t keep your promise

164
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,460
so I’m taking your land.

165
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:05,530
What’s going on?

166
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,130
Please get up, Som.

167
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,700
What’s going on?

168
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,980
He has mortgaged his land with me.

169
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:18,800
But he didn’t pay me the interest.

170
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,560
So, I’m taking his land.

171
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,860
It’s as we’ve agreed in the contract. That’s all.

172
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,860
That’s not true. I’ve always paid him the interest.

173
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:31,220
I went to his house to give it to him, but he wasn’t home.

174
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,260
So, I left it with Pol.

175
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,780
How come you said I didn’t pay you the interest?

176
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,940
What should I do?

177
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,060
You rascal.

178
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:41,260
Are you saying I’m lying?

179
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,760
If he fails to pay you the interest,

180
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,930
why don’t you just charge him an extra fee?

181
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,100
Isn’t it because you want his land in the first place?

00:17:33,044 --> 00:17:35,964
whether this has something to do with the road construction at the end of our village.

will Yod have that much amount of money to do it?

00:17:54,234 --> 00:17:55,804
Or is there someone behind him?

366

I always got drunk after that so I have no clue.

367
00:20:36,264 --> 00:20:37,834
But I think…

368
00:20:38,764 --> 00:20:42,264
if he’s with Jom, maybe he’s related to Grandma Chan.

369
00:20:43,164 --> 00:20:45,564
Although judging from his look, I don’t think he’s from around here.

370
00:20:48,034 --> 00:20:49,364
Then go find out more.

371
00:20:50,234 --> 00:20:51,864

372

448

00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:04,210
he’ll throw it away anyway.

552
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:08,190
You’re so sure about yourself, huh?

553
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,510
Do you really think he’d accept your gifts?

554
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:11,870
Whether we’re sure or not…

555
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,710
is none of your business.

556
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:14,910
Yeah, back off.

557
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:17,350
Why? Or is it because…

558
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,110
you like him too?

559
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:23,010
What if I say ‘yes’.

560
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:29,670
Now, you heard it.

561
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:32,910
If you are so sure that you’re pretty enough,

562
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,030
Then go on.

563
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:36,830
Hmph!

564
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:43,470
Don’t you think…

565
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,410
that was too harsh?

566
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:48,470
What?

567
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:51,230
Those girls should’ve thanked me actually.

568
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:53,470
If they give him those gifts,

569
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:54,510
he’ll throw them away for sure.

570
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:56,750
Also,

571
00:33:56,990 --> 00:34:00,950
Didn’t I say they can do it if they think they’re pretty enough.

572
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:04,110
Right, miss beauty queen.

573
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:06,550
No one in this school is as pretty as you.

574
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:08,510
But you might be heartbroken though.

575
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:11,550
Why? Are you taking their side?

576
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,310
No,

577
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,970
but you haven’t even talked to Yo yet.

578
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:20,910
Ouch, that hurts.

579
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:22,110
I’m trying my best here

580
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:23,370
Make sure it looks real.

581
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,170
Yeah. Just stay still.

582
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:26,770
Just stay still.

583
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:29,070
Fluke!

584
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:30,940
I got something to tell you.

585
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:34,310
What?

586
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:37,140
Why are you wearing makeup?

587
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,470
I’m not.

588
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,870
I asked him to cover the bruise for me.

589
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:43,870
Really?

590
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:46,510
I don’t want anyone to know that

591
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:48,140
I got punched by the newbie.

592
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:54,740
What kind of makeup is this?

593
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:55,810
I'm wearing on your makeup right now.

594
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,310
What the fuck, Poe?

595
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:00,190
Are you making fun of me?

596
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:01,570
No, I’m not.

597
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:03,770
This is how you should do it.

598
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:05,570
A foundation alone can’t cover it.

599
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:08,210
Did you think I’d go for a Tiffany show or what?

600
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:09,030
Don’t!

601
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:10,510
Oh my...

602
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:13,370
Listen,

603
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,070
I have an idea.

604
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:18,370
If anyone asks you why your cheek is so pink,

605
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,830
just tell them that you’re…

606
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:23,070
in love.

607
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:24,410
In love?

608
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,610
In love?

609
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:27,270
In love?!

610
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:30,430
Damn you.

611
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:34,070
So, what is it?

612
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:35,910
What’s with the ruckus?

613
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:38,510
Oh, that’s right.

614
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:39,910
Do you know…

615
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:42,950
that Ploy likes the newbie?

616
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:44,010
How did you know?

617
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:50,140
Just earlier, the junior girls were waiting for that newbie in front of our room.

618
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:53,170
Then, Praeploy just said it right then and there.

619
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,510
That she likes Yotin.

620
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:57,510
She said it in front of all those girls.

621
00:35:58,370 --> 00:35:59,940
Why are you telling me this?

622
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:01,830
I’m not interested in her anyway.

623
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:02,590
So?

624
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:05,750
I’m not saying you’re interested.

625
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:08,270
I’m just telling you about it.

626
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:14,070
You’re acting weird, Fluke.

627
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:15,740
What’s wrong?

628
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:18,010
I’m just mad at Poe.

629
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:19,990
For doing this to my face.

630
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:22,170
Yes, you idiot.

631
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,810
Speaking of the devil.

632
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,370
We were just talking about him.

633
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:49,540
Hey, he’s coming this way.

634
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:51,210
What the fuck?

635
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:06,910
Let’s get him. He’s asking for it.

636
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:09,630
Teach him a lesson.

637
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:12,390
Don’t, Fluke.

638
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:13,590
Do you want to go to the Discipline Room again?

639
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:15,230
Leave him, Poe.

640
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:20,610
What the fuck do you want?

641
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:27,670
I let you off yesterday.

642
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:29,750
Want me to finish it off?

643
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,790
-Yeah, bring it on.
-Go on.

644
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,390
Shit.

645
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,940
Let’s be friends.

646
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:56,190
I’m here to study not to have more trouble.

647
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:59,670
Let’s just forget about yesterday.

648
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:02,270
Okay, let’s be friends.

649
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:12,770
Remember what I told you, that Praeploy likes him?

650
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,370
Are you really going to be his friend?

651
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:18,140
Think about it.

652
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:23,170
Friend?

653
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:14,310
[Baan Pho Chai Village Chief Office, Moo 2]

654
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:17,770
Jom!

655
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:19,810
Granny.

656
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:22,770
Are you really not coming?

657
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:25,550
Jeez, how many times do I have to tell you I’m not going?

658
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:27,750
Why keep asking? I’m not going.

659
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:29,630
You’re so annoying.

660
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:30,570
Jeez!

661
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:33,110
Thank you, Granny.

662
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,790
What?

663
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:36,710
You’re…

664
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:39,070
Why are you thanking me?

665
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:43,270
I know you’re upset because you’re worried.

666
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,750
But please don’t be upset.

667
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:48,710
Pa has his own reason.

668
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:49,870
What reason?

669
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,970
Seriously, do you really think that,

670
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:53,140
stubborn old man has any reason?

671
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:56,310
Why does he have to force you to do something you don’t like?

672
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:57,540
I really don’t understand.

673
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,770
That’s why I don’t like him.

674
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:02,270
Here you go.

675
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:05,710
Your vegetables, Granny.

676
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:07,210
Give it to Chief.

677
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:10,340
It’s for your mother.

678
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:12,470
Don’t tell her it’s from me.

679
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:16,340
Tell her to eat more organic vegetables.

680
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,340
And stop eating rubbish food.

681
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,910
Don’t tell her it’s from me.

682
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,570
Or else they won’t eat it.

683
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:25,770
You don’t like them but you send them gifts?

684
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:31,030
Honestly, it’s only that old man Heng that I can’t tolerate.

685
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:32,550
Your damn father.

686
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:34,790
But your mother is different.

687
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,070
Then, isn’t it better if you give it to her yourself?

688
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:43,190
Stop beating around the bush.

689
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:46,830
You want me to go with you and use me as a shield, don’t you?

690
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:50,470
Well, just help shielding me from Pa, that’s all.

691
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:54,110
I’m a bit nervous too.

692
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:56,270
I don’t know if Pa is still mad at me or not.

693
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:01,350
Listen, Chief.

694
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:05,950
If you ever feel bad or find yourself in an awkward situation,

695
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:08,990
Just come home. That’s it.

696
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:10,140
It’s easy for you to say.

697
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:11,910
How can I just leave, Granny?

698
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:13,170
Jeez,

699
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,710
you and your endless excuses.

700
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:17,340
Just go. Get lost.

701
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:18,810
I’m going then.

702
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:19,630
Bye.

703
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:22,750
Don’t forget to give it to your mother.

704
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:23,830
Sure.

705
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:25,910
Vegetables there are so full of chemicals.

706
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:27,110
She likes watermelon.

707
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:29,570
Our vegetables are fresh and organic.

708
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:40,540
He's coming

709
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:43,910
Hey, wait.

710
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:46,940
I think we should stop doing this.

711
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:49,170
Doing what?

712
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:53,030
I know you refused to give Rose your LINE ID…

713
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:55,150
because you wanted to play hard to get.

714
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:58,670
You want to look all high and mighty, and hope that I’d approach you first, don’t you?

715
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:01,070
That way, it’d make you feel proud…

716
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:04,950
that a school belle like me approaches you first.

717
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:07,870
Fine, I give in.

718
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:11,010
This is my LINE ID.

719
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:16,940
What?

720
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:19,370
Nothing.

721
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:23,770
You…what’s your name?

722
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:29,870
I remember you’re also in my class.

723
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:32,310
But I really don’t remember your name.

724
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:38,270
I’m Praeploy.

725
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:41,670
Stop acting like you’re not interested.

726
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:46,510
I know you remember my name, but you just pretend you don’t.

727
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:49,870
Because you want to look cool.

728
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:51,670
I know that.

729
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:56,910
So, do you want it?

730
00:42:58,070 --> 00:42:59,870
I already told your friend I don’t have LINE.

731
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:02,470
What?

732
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:06,110
I’m sorry.

733
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:08,510
I have to go.

734
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:18,110
Are you okay?

735
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:22,710
What are you looking at?

736
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:26,390
[Student: Can I have your LINE ID?]

737
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:52,740
Why are you here?

738
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:54,170
To see Teacher Toei?

739
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:55,770
No,

740
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:57,170
to see you.

741
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:01,570
I want you to go to my dad’s birthday party with me.

742
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:04,710
Your dad’s birthday party?

743
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:05,590
Mhm.

744
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:10,410
Or you can go hang out with that friend if you want.

745
00:44:11,170 --> 00:44:11,970
I wouldn’t mind.

746
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:13,470
Why would I do that?

747
00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:16,870
I was being careful and just excused myself like what you’ve told me to do.

748
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:19,610
But if you want me to go with her,

749
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:21,140
then I’ll do that.

750
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:26,210
Does this mean…you’re coming with me?

751
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:31,950
I wouldn’t mind. But I’m just curious.

752
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:35,270
It’s your dad’s birthday party. Why would you want me go to too?

753
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:40,140
I want to use you as an excuse.

754
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:48,740
It’s… My dad and I don’t get along well.

755
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:52,670
In case it’s getting too awkward,

756
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:57,140
I can tell them that you have to go home to take care of something urgent

757
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:01,770
But it’s all right if you don’t want to go.

758
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:03,410
I wouldn’t mind.

759
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:06,870
You can just go home with Uncle Pun.

760
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:22,170
So?

761
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:26,140
Are you coming or not?

762
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:29,610
Of course.

763
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:33,740
Let’s go.

764
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:47,470
I’m so glad you’ve decided to hold your birthday party at my restaurant.

765
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:50,550
I’ve arranged a table for you. Please have a seat.

766
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:55,740
What’s wrong?

767
00:45:57,970 --> 00:45:59,390
It’s nothing serious.

768
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:04,990
I just remember that when Jom was little, he loved the shrimp cakes here so much.

769
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:10,410
Stop talking about that ungrateful child.

770
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:13,510
Don’t ruin the mood on my birthday.

771
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:26,910
Do you miss Jom, Mum?

772
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:30,670
What kind of mother wouldn’t miss her own son?

773
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:34,670
What if he’s coming this year?

774
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:39,540
Really? Is he really going to be here?

775
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:41,270
Yes, Mum.

776
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:45,150
Meaw and I want Jom and Pa to reconcile.

777
00:46:45,590 --> 00:46:48,670
So, we lied to him that…

778
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:50,870
Pa wanted him to come to the party.

779
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:54,630
But what if Jom really shows up,

780
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:57,750
wouldn’t that make your Pa so upset?

781
00:46:58,210 --> 00:46:59,510
That’s why, Mum.

782
00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:01,910
That’s why I want you to talk to Pa.

783
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:04,670
So that when Jom is here, Pa wouldn’t be so shocked.

784
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:06,590
Ji!

785
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:08,470
Please, Mum. I’m so sorry.

786
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:12,590
Think of it as a favour for your soon-to-be-born grandchild.

787
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:13,110
Please.

788
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:18,110
Who knows? Pa and Jom might be able to reconcile this time.

789
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:21,030
And we’ll finally have him back in our family. Isn’t that nice?

790
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:27,430
Please.

791
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:39,270
That’s all.

792
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:41,830
Wait.

793
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:45,210
Can I have shrimp cakes too?

794
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:46,210
Okay

795
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:49,910
Why? I thought you didn’t like them.

796
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:53,740
It’s for Jom.

797
00:47:56,970 --> 00:47:59,550
Ji told me that Jom called him.

798
00:47:59,790 --> 00:48:02,390
And said that he’ll come to your party this year.

799
00:48:05,270 --> 00:48:06,310
Where is he now?

800
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:11,390
Aren’t you upset…

801
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:13,870
that he’ll be here?

802
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:19,610
That’s good. I want to see him anyway.

803
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:37,630
Hello, sir. Are you free today?

804
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:43,070
I’d like to invite you to my birthday party.

805
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:49,390
[Next Break]
Happy Birthday to Mr. Heng!

806
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:51,350
Please make yourself comfortable.

807
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:53,270
Order anything you like.

808
00:48:54,830 --> 00:48:58,950
[My Sweetheart Jom]

809
00:49:00,253 --> 00:49:04,893
[My Sweetheart Jom]

810
00:49:05,173 --> 00:49:09,313
Watch “My Sweetheart Jom” for free on YouTube.

811
00:49:19,073 --> 00:49:20,073
What is it?

812
00:49:22,173 --> 00:49:24,013
Well…

813
00:49:24,013 --> 00:49:27,373
Usually, my dad would have a birthday party at home.

814
00:49:27,893 --> 00:49:31,693
But this year, it’s at the restaurant. So, I’m a bit curious.

815
00:49:33,813 --> 00:49:35,573
Eating out on your birthday is quite normal.

816
00:49:36,243 --> 00:49:37,773
Why are you curious?

817
00:49:38,913 --> 00:49:39,713
Let’s go.

818
00:49:40,113 --> 00:49:40,893
Let’s go.

819
00:49:40,893 --> 00:49:45,133
Well, I…I don’t have any gift for him.

820
00:49:47,913 --> 00:49:49,493
Of course, you do.

821
00:49:50,493 --> 00:49:51,373
That’s the gift.

822
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:54,413
Isn’t it a little improper?

823
00:49:54,613 --> 00:49:57,893
Improper or not, it depends on the giver not the gift.

824
00:49:58,373 --> 00:50:01,933
You showing up at his party this year should make him happy already.

825
00:50:07,773 --> 00:50:11,053
Don’t worry, if you ever feel uncomfortable…

826
00:50:11,053 --> 00:50:12,213
just look at me, okay?

827
00:50:15,533 --> 00:50:15,573
Let’s go.

828
00:50:22,713 --> 00:50:23,843
They all look delicious.

829
00:50:24,073 --> 00:50:24,873
There’s taro,

830
00:50:26,213 --> 00:50:28,373
your favourite dish too.

831
00:50:30,173 --> 00:50:30,973
It comes with salad.

832
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:39,813
[Ji: I think Pa is up to something.]

833
00:50:43,893 --> 00:50:46,173
[Ji: That’s why he doesn’t say anything when we told him about Jom.]

834
00:50:51,653 --> 00:50:53,613
[Meaw: Maybe Pa wants to talk about his will.]

835
00:50:53,613 --> 00:50:54,213
Shit.

836
00:50:54,213 --> 00:50:55,053
What?

837
00:50:57,113 --> 00:51:02,453
It’s nothing, Pa. Just a client asking about his will.

838
00:51:02,613 --> 00:51:03,413
Huh?

839
00:51:04,713 --> 00:51:05,693
No, I mean…

840
00:51:06,693 --> 00:51:08,053
About gold bars.

841
00:51:09,273 --> 00:51:13,693
Does the client want a big lot? Why were you so surprised?

842
00:51:15,973 --> 00:51:19,813
If it’s not that big, why don’t you just eat first?

843
00:51:20,213 --> 00:51:21,973
You’re right. I’ll talk to him later.

844
00:51:28,673 --> 00:51:29,773
What’s wrong?

845
00:51:30,573 --> 00:51:33,013
Aren’t you happy that Jom can come to the party?

846
00:51:36,443 --> 00:51:37,413
Well…

847
00:51:38,893 --> 00:51:42,293
If him being here really makes you happy,

848
00:51:43,813 --> 00:51:45,333
then I’m happy too.

849
00:51:48,013 --> 00:51:50,013
Do you really want him to come?

850
00:52:02,373 --> 00:52:03,533
Oh, Miss Nart.

851
00:52:03,533 --> 00:52:04,853
Hello.

852
00:52:04,853 --> 00:52:05,613
Hello.

853
00:52:07,113 --> 00:52:09,473
I thought you won’t be able to make it this year.

854
00:52:10,013 --> 00:52:13,253
How could I not? We’re good friends, aren’t we?

855
00:52:13,533 --> 00:52:18,693
Happy Birthday, Mr. Heng. I wish you good heath and prosperity.

856
00:52:19,273 --> 00:52:20,173
Thank you.

857
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:23,493
Sweetie, give him the gift, dear.

858
00:52:23,493 --> 00:52:24,013
Oh.

859
00:52:28,573 --> 00:52:29,693
Thank you.

860
00:52:32,613 --> 00:52:34,273
Oh, there he is.

861
00:52:35,573 --> 00:52:36,413
Jom!

862
00:52:36,413 --> 00:52:38,453
No, sweetie.

863
00:52:41,713 --> 00:52:43,843
Don’t you have to work today? How come you’re here.

864
00:52:45,173 --> 00:52:47,473
How could work be more important than his father’s birthday?

865
00:52:47,713 --> 00:52:48,673
Right, Jom?

866
00:52:53,843 --> 00:52:55,313
Happy Birthday, Pa.

867
00:53:01,573 --> 00:53:03,413
Granny also sends her best regards.

868
00:53:14,643 --> 00:53:15,443
Sit down.

869
00:53:15,813 --> 00:53:17,853
[Mum: Miss Nart and Earn, please have a seat.]

870
00:53:17,853 --> 00:53:19,693
[Mum: Jom, Let’s eat together.]

871
00:53:31,673 --> 00:53:33,843
I didn’t expect you’d come too.

872
00:53:34,413 --> 00:53:36,573
Why didn’t you tell me you’d be here?

873
00:53:37,613 --> 00:53:38,413
Yes

874
00:53:38,873 --> 00:53:41,573
He didn’t tell you because he doesn’t care.

875
00:53:51,713 --> 00:53:53,043
Are you Yotin?

876
00:53:54,973 --> 00:53:55,493
Yes.

877
00:53:55,773 --> 00:53:59,373
My parents have to go work abroad. So, they’ve left me under Granny Chan’s care.

878
00:54:02,643 --> 00:54:05,013
Do you have to pick him up every day?

879
00:54:06,843 --> 00:54:07,913
Not every day.

880
00:54:08,243 --> 00:54:09,873
He usually takes a bus.

881
00:54:10,243 --> 00:54:11,213
But the bus broke down today,

882
00:54:11,513 --> 00:54:12,613
so I had to pick him up.

883
00:54:17,173 --> 00:54:17,733
Hey.

884
00:54:18,533 --> 00:54:21,453
I had a Thai language class today.

885
00:54:21,893 --> 00:54:24,493
What do you think this is called?

886
00:54:25,773 --> 00:54:27,043
A cup.

887
00:54:27,613 --> 00:54:29,813
No, it’s a bowl.

888
00:54:31,273 --> 00:54:34,893
What about…

889
00:54:34,893 --> 00:54:39,413
having to trouble someone to do something for you, what is it called?

890
00:54:43,513 --> 00:54:44,413
Burden!

891
00:54:49,073 --> 00:54:51,573
Jom, have some shrimp cakes.

892
00:54:51,573 --> 00:54:53,413
Your favourite. I ordered it for you.

893
00:54:54,473 --> 00:54:56,513
You also like shrimp cakes?

894
00:54:57,613 --> 00:54:58,843
Me too.

895
00:55:00,773 --> 00:55:04,533
Can’t believe we like the same thing.

896
00:55:04,533 --> 00:55:05,933
It’s my favourite too.

897
00:55:06,513 --> 00:55:09,473
Oh, really? You like shrimp cakes too?

898
00:55:10,513 --> 00:55:12,813
But I think this menu probably suits you more.

899
00:55:14,913 --> 00:55:15,973
Fried fish?

900
00:55:17,173 --> 00:55:18,213
With horns too.

901
00:55:20,513 --> 00:55:22,673
Fried Horny Fish.

902
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:27,773
Enjoy your food.

903
00:55:29,443 --> 00:55:30,243
Then,

904
00:55:33,573 --> 00:55:36,213
you should try this.

905
00:55:37,853 --> 00:55:39,653
It’s perfect for you.

906
00:55:40,293 --> 00:55:41,853
Fried taro.

907
00:55:43,253 --> 00:55:47,573
You seem to like ‘prying’ on someone else’s business.

908
00:55:54,513 --> 00:55:57,693
Miss Waewdao and Mr. Heng, thank you so much…

909
00:55:57,693 --> 00:55:59,573
for inviting me to your party today.

910
00:56:00,013 --> 00:56:00,773
My pleasure.

911
00:56:00,773 --> 00:56:01,573
Yes

912
00:56:01,643 --> 00:56:06,573
Is it a surprise, Mum? Why did you sound like it’s something special?

913
00:56:07,413 --> 00:56:09,473
Oh, it’s nothing like that.

914
00:56:09,873 --> 00:56:12,213
It’s just there’s an auction going on at the moment.

915
00:56:12,413 --> 00:56:15,013
For road construction around Pho Chai dam.

916
00:56:15,613 --> 00:56:21,613
I was afraid that if other people see me getting too acquainted with Chief Jom…

917
00:56:21,613 --> 00:56:24,453
Or if I happen to win this auction,

918
00:56:24,453 --> 00:56:28,733
people might think that it’s not a clean victory.

919
00:56:30,073 --> 00:56:32,733
That’s right. Even when choosing your gift,

920
00:56:32,733 --> 00:56:36,413
the health check-up programme from Pho Chai Wade hospital,

921
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:39,093
she decided to go for the cheapest one.

922
00:56:39,093 --> 00:56:39,973
Here it is.

923
00:56:41,253 --> 00:56:42,173
Thank you.

924
00:56:43,913 --> 00:56:45,093
Sweetie.

925
00:56:45,093 --> 00:56:47,493
You don’t have to tell him that, dear.

926
00:56:47,493 --> 00:56:50,773
People might think I’m stingy.

927
00:56:52,243 --> 00:56:57,773
I tried to choose the one with the best reasonable price.

928
00:56:57,773 --> 00:57:01,173
During this period, government officers and their relatives…

929
00:57:01,173 --> 00:57:05,093
are not allowed to accept a gift worth more than 3,000 baht.

930
00:57:05,093 --> 00:57:07,133
Otherwise, people would say it’s a bribe.

931
00:57:08,813 --> 00:57:10,713
You’re very cautious, Miss Nart.

932
00:57:12,043 --> 00:57:15,013
You can rest assured now, Jom.

933
00:57:17,173 --> 00:57:19,913
Thank you so much for being so considerate.

934
00:57:20,613 --> 00:57:21,413
You’re welcome.

935
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:24,213
I’m so thankful indeed.

936
00:57:24,213 --> 00:57:29,293
I also apologize for having a relative working as a government officer.

937
00:57:29,733 --> 00:57:31,853
So, I can’t just ask you for any favour.

938
00:57:40,333 --> 00:57:45,573
Happy Birthday to Mr. Heng!

939
00:57:47,933 --> 00:57:48,653
Please come in.

940
00:57:51,513 --> 00:57:52,613
Happy Birthday.

941
00:57:52,873 --> 00:57:54,643
Thank you, Boss.

942
00:57:54,843 --> 00:58:00,443
I wish you and your family a lot of joy and happiness.

943
00:58:00,873 --> 00:58:01,973
Thank you.

944
00:58:04,873 --> 00:58:07,413
Oh, you’re here too, Miss nart?

945
00:58:08,243 --> 00:58:13,453
What a surprise. Didn’t expect to see you here.

946
00:58:14,913 --> 00:58:17,513
And I didn’t expect you’d be here either.

947
00:58:18,373 --> 00:58:22,173
Well, I wasn’t planning to come at first.

948
00:58:22,653 --> 00:58:23,893
I was afraid.

949
00:58:24,673 --> 00:58:28,653
Afraid that if anyone sees me attending Mr. Heng’s birthday party…

950
00:58:28,653 --> 00:58:30,933
who is also Chief Jom’s father,

951
00:58:31,773 --> 00:58:35,693
they might think I’m trying to bribe Chief Jom.

952
00:58:35,893 --> 00:58:38,813
So that I would win an auction at Pho Chai.

953
00:58:41,913 --> 00:58:42,613
You don’t have to,

954
00:58:42,613 --> 00:58:43,643
worry about that.

955
00:58:44,443 --> 00:58:47,253
Miss Nart is only here to congratulate my father.

956
00:58:47,873 --> 00:58:49,373
She hasn’t mentioned anything about the auction.

957
00:58:49,873 --> 00:58:51,013
If you come here,

958
00:58:51,443 --> 00:58:53,043
just to congratulate my father on his birthday,

959
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:54,513
please feel free.

960
00:58:55,113 --> 00:58:55,913
Great.

961
00:58:56,573 --> 00:59:00,213
Does that mean I can stay?

962
00:59:00,443 --> 00:59:02,693
Of course. Why not?

963
00:59:02,693 --> 00:59:05,853
Since you’re my main sponsor today.

964
00:59:06,513 --> 00:59:10,413
Everyone, let’s say thank you to him.

965
00:59:11,813 --> 00:59:13,773
Thank you.

966
00:59:13,773 --> 00:59:16,013
You’re welcome. Please make yourself comfortable.

967
00:59:16,453 --> 00:59:18,133
Just order anything you like.

968
00:59:20,073 --> 00:59:23,653
If I had known that it’s your treat today,

969
00:59:24,453 --> 00:59:26,253
I wouldn’t have come.

970
00:59:27,673 --> 00:59:30,253
But thank you anyway…

971
00:59:31,293 --> 00:59:33,013
for treating my father to a meal on his birthday.

972
00:59:33,213 --> 00:59:35,733
But next time, please don’t bother.

973
00:59:36,093 --> 00:59:40,053
He’s my father. I can treat him to a meal.

974
00:59:41,453 --> 00:59:43,093
I apologize to everyone for my abrupt behavior.

975
00:59:43,653 --> 00:59:44,893
Please excuse me.

976
00:59:47,273 --> 00:59:48,013
Pa.

977
00:59:49,573 --> 00:59:50,933
Happy Birthday.

978
01:00:26,113 --> 01:00:29,373
Manager, can you give the bill first?

979
01:00:29,573 --> 01:00:31,333
Are you leaving already?

980
01:00:32,373 --> 01:00:33,453
What happened?

981
01:00:34,913 --> 01:00:35,813
It’s nothing.

982
01:00:35,813 --> 01:00:38,653
Just send me the bill after this, can you?

983
01:00:39,573 --> 01:00:40,373
Yes.

984
01:00:42,873 --> 01:00:43,673
You can’t!

985
01:00:57,413 --> 01:01:00,453
[Next Episode]
[Poe: You’re still on detention from that fight with Fluke.]

986
01:01:00,473 --> 01:01:02,293
If you get caught for skipping school,

987
01:01:02,413 --> 01:01:03,373
it won’t look good for you.

988
01:01:03,713 --> 01:01:05,273
You guys go home first.

989
01:01:05,643 --> 01:01:07,243
I’ll go buy something for Granny.

990
01:01:07,473 --> 01:01:08,613
[Chan: Is Yo really a drug addict?]

991
01:01:09,073 --> 01:01:09,733
Yes.

992
01:01:10,293 --> 01:01:14,173
The inspector said that game center is where the drug dealer called Joe works.

993
01:01:14,213 --> 01:01:16,213
Do you really think I bought drugs from those thugs?

994
01:01:16,473 --> 01:01:18,773
Those money you paid them, where did you get it from?

995
01:01:19,613 --> 01:01:21,373
Talk to me first, Yo!

996
01:01:21,773 --> 01:01:22,693
Yo!

997
01:01:22,693 --> 01:01:23,443
Hey!

998
01:01:24,643 --> 01:01:25,613
What the fuck?

999
01:01:25,713 --> 01:01:26,573
Get him!

1000
01:01:27,373 --> 01:01:28,413
What are you waiting for?

1001
01:01:30,713 --> 01:01:31,513
Yo!

1002
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:32,613
Yo!

1003
01:01:33,243 --> 01:01:34,043
Yo!
