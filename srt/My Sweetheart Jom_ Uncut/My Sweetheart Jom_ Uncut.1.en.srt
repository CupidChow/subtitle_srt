00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,180
Oh, that’s right.

184
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,740
I have to go see Sert.

185
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,420
He’s probably at the vegetable plot. I’ll be right back.

186
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,060
You two go on with the chitchat.

187
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,740
I’ll be right back.

188
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,340
Granny.

189
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,460
Take care of yourself.

190
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,020
[Sigh]

191
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,500
How about this, Todd?

192
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,660
Granny is here!

193
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,300
Oh, I’m sweating.

194
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,220
Huh? I think I saw someone here.

195
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,700
It’s definitely human.

196
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,020
Where did they go?

197
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,900
That’s weird.

198
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,260
[Sigh]

199
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:47,820
Is the weather in Bangkok as good as our Pho Chai village?

200
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,900
You said ‘our’.

201
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,260
Well, yes.

202
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,540
But sometimes, it’s rather hot.

203
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,700
Are you hot?

204
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,260
Koi.

205
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,340
Let me be straightforward here.

206
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,060
So that we can be clear.

207
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,220
Okay!

208
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,460
Well, I…

209
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,020
Oat, Todd, Toei: Dad! Dad!

210
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,900
Oat: Dad, I’m back.

211
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,700
Who is this woman? Why is she in our house?

212
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,860
Jom…

213
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,820
Who are these kids?

214
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,940
Why did they call you ‘Dad’?

215
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,260
Oat: You’re funny.

216
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:39,860
If the sons don’t call their father ‘Dad’, then what should we call him?

217
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:45,500
What? You already have children?

218
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,500
I’m Oat, his youngest son.

219
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:55,860
This is Toei. He’s my brother.

220
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,740
But we all have different mothers.

221
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,020
Toei: Don’t start.

222
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,420
Todd: It’s sad.

223
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,460
Are you going to be our new mother?

224
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,180
Jeez! You should’ve told me you’re already married.

225
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,660
Sert, go tell our men not to load all the vegetables onto the truck.

226
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,500
I’ll give out the rest to those who live near the end of our farm.

227
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,100
The bridge is broken and can’t be used right now.

228
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,980
People there are having difficulties travelling back and forth.

229
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,500
But it seems the market wants more of our vegetables.

230
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:45,380
The owner said our vegetables are big and fresh.

231
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,740
People here prefer them.

232
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,500
Sert, tell me honestly…

233
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:53,500
Do you want to see me choosing money over our neighbours who are in trouble?

234
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,460
I’m doing this because I want to help them.

235
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,780
Go tell the market owner…

236
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:01,500
that those are all vegetables we have for him. That’s it.

237
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,020
That’s my boss.

238
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,020
What’s wrong with you?

239
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,420
I’m happy for the people in our village.

240
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,980
That they have you as their guardian.

241
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,660
But one day when you’re not around anymore,

242
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,620
what should we do then?

243
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,020
When I’m not around anymore?

244
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,300
I’ll tell you what?

245
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:25,140
I’ll just…

246
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,220
Weren’t you just complimenting me back there? Now, you’re wishing me dead?

247
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,180
Go. Just go. Don’t let me get more upset. Go!

248
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,620
- Yes, boss.
- Go do as I said!

249
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,500
I’m on it.

250
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,820
Jeez!

251
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,380
I thought he’d keep saying good things about me.

252
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,100
What an insult. That rascal.

253
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,500
Always giving me a headache.

254
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,100
Oh, Koi. Where are you going?

255
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,260
Are you done?

256
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,020
Oops.

257
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:49,820
I mean…

258
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,380
Are you done talking with the chief?

259
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:52,780
Yes!

260
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,180
Why is she mad?

261
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:05,060
Chief, what made her stomp out like that?

262
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,860
What did you do? Why is she so upset?

263
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:11,100
Toei: She’s probably afraid you’d trick her into becoming Oat’s mother.

264
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:12,980
What?

265
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:19,140
She’s probably afraid you’d trick her into becoming Oat’s mother.

266
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,540
Really? You rascal!

267
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,660
You too, Oat.

268
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,980
Don’t make that innocent face.

269
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,020
You’re the worst.

270
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,580
Whenever a girl comes to our house,

271
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,420
you’d keep chasing her away. Remember last time?

272
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,580
When Jah was here. You let out the buffalo to chase her until she fell into the swamp.

273
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,540
Why would you do that?

274
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,100
And this time too. Am I right?

275
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,620
It was your idea, wasn’t it?

276
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,020
Why are you like this?

277
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,460
Honestly, I’m so fed up with you, kids.

278
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,700
Don’t you want your Chief to have a girlfriend?

279
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,300
Don’t you want him to be happy?

280
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:53,260
Granny, I actually don’t want a girlfriend.

281
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,460
Jeez, Chief.

282
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,780
Don’t blame them. I have to thank them actually.

283
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:57,900
That’s all right.

284
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,060
It was nothing.

285
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,860
It’s our duty as the village chief’s assistants.

286
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,660
That’s right.

287
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,620
Oh, really? A duty?

288
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,420
As village chief’s assistants?

289
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,900
Would you like to taste my knuckle sandwich, assistants?

290
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:10,660
No!

291
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,460
- Jowkwan: Don’t, Granny!
- Let me go.

292
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,580
- Let me go. / - Please, don’t.

293
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,300
- Come here! / - Granny!

294
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,580
Don’t hit them.

295
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,900
Seriously! You guys are unbelievable.

296
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:24,500
Will there be any day that they won’t give me a headache?

297
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,100
Well, there actually is.

298
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,380
If you don’t want to have a headache anymore,

299
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,300
then stop playing a matchmaker.

300
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,300
Hey, Chief.

301
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,580
Why are you blaming me now?

302
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,900
I want you to have a girlfriend because you’re working so hard.

303
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,780
You take really good care of us and the village people.

304
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:50,460
So, I want you to have someone to take care of you too.

305
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,100
- Mhm.
- Right?

306
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,300
Don’t you want a girlfriend?

307
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,380
No?

308
00:19:59,180 --> 00:19:59,980
Well,

309
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,700
yes, kind of.

310
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,020
That’s good.

311
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,060
But I’m not that eager to look for one.

312
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,740
I do believe in love though.

313
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,860
I believe in destiny.

314
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,420
I believe that if I’m destined to be with someone,

315
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,300
no matter how far he or she is,

316
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,660
we’ll definitely meet one day.

317
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,380
What if that doesn’t happen?

318
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,620
If that doesn’t happen…

319
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,820
then I’ll just be with you forever.

320
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,180
Until you’re fed up of me. Isn’t that good?

321
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:31,180
I’ll keep hugging you like this.

322
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,620
Heaven will punish us! You’re my grandson!

323
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,460
We can’t do that!

324
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,580
I’d rather go prepare dinner.

325
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,500
No, no. We can’t do that!

326
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,140
We can’t do that!

327
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,620
Kids? Where are you?

328
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,180
Guys, hug her! Don’t let her get away!

329
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,300
No!

330
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,500
Come and help me prepare dinner.

331
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,500
Make it tasty.

332
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,300
NEXT BREAK
Aren’t they afraid people wouldn’t know they’re dating?

333
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,340
Of course.

334
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,620
Yo

335
00:21:29,726 --> 00:21:31,726
Is that all you’ve got?!

336
00:21:32,006 --> 00:21:34,206
Why is it so soft? Do it again!

337
00:21:35,326 --> 00:21:38,206
[Freshmen’s boom]

338
00:21:38,206 --> 00:21:40,566
[Freshmen’s boom]

339
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:41,526
Louder!

340
00:21:41,526 --> 00:21:43,726
[Freshmen’s boom]

341
00:21:44,326 --> 00:21:45,126
That’s right!

342
00:21:47,726 --> 00:21:49,126
That’s it.

343
00:21:52,206 --> 00:21:53,886
Ha! So satisfied.

344
00:21:55,726 --> 00:21:58,206
It’s just a hazing. Why did you take it so seriously?

345
00:21:58,606 --> 00:22:00,006
Did you say ‘just’?

346
00:22:00,006 --> 00:22:02,766
You have no idea what it feels like to get a hazing from the seniors.

347
00:22:03,086 --> 00:22:04,406
It’s torturing.

348
00:22:04,806 --> 00:22:06,926
Someone who can’t even finish Grade 12 like you would never know.

349
00:22:08,206 --> 00:22:09,286
Hey, Bank.

350
00:22:10,206 --> 00:22:11,886
Jeez, you and your foul mouth.

351
00:22:12,486 --> 00:22:14,846
You know so well why he didn’t finish school.

352
00:22:14,846 --> 00:22:16,286
Stop talking trash.

353
00:22:23,886 --> 00:22:24,686
Teacher: Tell me.

354
00:22:25,406 --> 00:22:28,006
Teacher: Why did you beat up Teacher Yak like that?

355
00:22:29,286 --> 00:22:30,766
Bank: It wasn’t our fault.

356
00:22:31,206 --> 00:22:33,126
Bank: Yak was going to hurt Toy.

357
00:22:33,486 --> 00:22:34,806
Bank: I was trying to help my friend.

358
00:22:36,326 --> 00:22:37,326
Bastard!!

359
00:22:38,006 --> 00:22:40,886
Hey, I’m your teacher.

360
00:22:43,686 --> 00:22:45,606
What kind of teacher would try to harass me?

361
00:22:46,326 --> 00:22:47,446
Watch your mouth.

362
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:49,206
I didn’t do it.

363
00:22:49,606 --> 00:22:50,886
Do you have any proof?

364
00:22:52,126 --> 00:22:52,886
Why?

365
00:22:54,446 --> 00:22:55,926
Did anyone see it…

366
00:22:56,206 --> 00:22:57,806
when we were together?

367
00:22:58,086 --> 00:22:59,206
Just the two of us.

368
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:01,166
Tell me, my dear student.

369
00:23:01,286 --> 00:23:02,086
Son of a bitch!

370
00:23:07,566 --> 00:23:08,766
You want to have it with me?

371
00:23:10,006 --> 00:23:11,206
Do you?

372
00:23:13,206 --> 00:23:14,006
Fine.

373
00:23:14,646 --> 00:23:15,406
I’ll…

374
00:23:16,966 --> 00:23:18,126
What the f*** did you do to my friend?

375
00:23:19,406 --> 00:23:21,406
Yo! Are you guys ganging up on me?

376
00:23:21,766 --> 00:23:22,806
I’m your teacher.

377
00:23:23,006 --> 00:23:23,926
What teacher?

378
00:23:23,926 --> 00:23:25,686
Can you still call yourself a teacher?

379
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,046
A teacher? Teacher my arse!

380
00:23:40,366 --> 00:23:41,166
Bastard!

381
00:23:41,606 --> 00:23:42,406
Bastard!

382
00:23:42,406 --> 00:23:43,006
F*** off!

383
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:43,486
F*** off!

384
00:23:43,486 --> 00:23:44,086
Teacher Yak: Help!

385
00:23:44,086 --> 00:23:44,846
How can you call yourself a teacher?!

386
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:45,646
Teacher Yak: Help!

387
00:23:47,206 --> 00:23:50,206
Teacher: Do you know how badly he’s injured?

388
00:23:51,606 --> 00:23:53,446
He’s still in a coma.

389
00:23:53,486 --> 00:23:54,806
You can say whatever you like.

390
00:23:56,606 --> 00:23:57,686
One more thing,

391
00:23:58,926 --> 00:24:01,566
what you told me is a different case.

392
00:24:03,766 --> 00:24:05,926
If he really did that to your friend,

393
00:24:06,326 --> 00:24:07,566
then get some proof to press charges against him.

394
00:24:09,206 --> 00:24:11,086
But what you did is committing another crime.

395
00:24:11,806 --> 00:24:13,086
You beat up your teacher.

396
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:34,166
I did it.

397
00:24:36,606 --> 00:24:37,406
What about the others?

398
00:24:37,606 --> 00:24:38,606
They didn’t do it.

399
00:24:39,326 --> 00:24:40,566
I did it alone.

400
00:24:41,126 --> 00:24:42,046
Yo!

401
00:24:42,686 --> 00:24:44,086
I was the one who punched him.

402
00:24:44,806 --> 00:24:45,806
You didn’t do anything at all.

403
00:24:51,286 --> 00:24:52,406
Mr. Yotin.

404
00:24:53,286 --> 00:24:55,446
Are you sure you’re going to take this guilt alone?

405
00:24:57,686 --> 00:24:58,486
Are you aware…

406
00:24:59,766 --> 00:25:01,806
…that you’d get the highest level of punishment?

407
00:25:02,726 --> 00:25:04,446
That is to leave this school.

408
00:25:12,086 --> 00:25:13,326
Bank: I’m sorry, Yo.

409
00:25:14,526 --> 00:25:17,006
It’s nothing. Why would you keep saying sorry?

410
00:25:17,326 --> 00:25:18,926
He’s not mad at you, Bank.

411
00:25:18,926 --> 00:25:22,286
He knows you didn’t use your mouth but your ear to say it.

412
00:25:22,526 --> 00:25:24,206
By the way, are you okay?

413
00:25:25,406 --> 00:25:29,126
You don’t usually come here when we ask you to.

414
00:25:29,126 --> 00:25:30,646
How come you can show up today?

415
00:25:32,006 --> 00:25:33,726
I was bored at home.

416
00:25:33,726 --> 00:25:36,726
I want to go out and find something to do.

417
00:25:38,206 --> 00:25:39,006
Really?

418
00:25:39,806 --> 00:25:41,766
What about that thing you posted on IG?

419
00:25:41,766 --> 00:25:44,406
“No need to walk arm in arm, just call me your boyfriend.”

420
00:25:44,406 --> 00:25:45,566
I’m leaving then.

421
00:25:45,566 --> 00:25:48,846
Hey, why so hurry?

422
00:25:49,566 --> 00:25:51,166
Tell us first.

423
00:25:51,486 --> 00:25:52,966
Spit it out, Yo.

424
00:25:53,206 --> 00:25:54,166
If you don’t,

425
00:25:54,806 --> 00:25:58,846
I’ll have Toy and Bank pin you down and make you talk.

426
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:05,006
What’d you say, Toy? Get him.

427
00:26:07,206 --> 00:26:08,286
Okay, fine. I’ll talk.

428
00:26:09,566 --> 00:26:11,726
But you must promise me first.

429
00:26:12,366 --> 00:26:13,766
That if I show you…

430
00:26:14,326 --> 00:26:16,206
the picture of this girl I’m talking to,

431
00:26:16,966 --> 00:26:17,926
you won’t be surprised.

432
00:26:18,206 --> 00:26:19,006
Yeah.

433
00:26:19,006 --> 00:26:20,206
And don’t ever tell anyone about it.

434
00:26:20,206 --> 00:26:20,686
Sure!

435
00:26:20,686 --> 00:26:21,566
Promise?

436
00:26:21,566 --> 00:26:24,566
- Okay.
- Okay?

437
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:48,726
Sack: Did you forget something?

438
00:27:05,926 --> 00:27:08,286
Jeez, what a show-off.

439
00:27:08,686 --> 00:27:10,406
Aren’t they afraid people wouldn’t know they’re dating?

440
00:27:11,126 --> 00:27:14,126
I really wonder if the guy weren’t a politician’s son,

441
00:27:14,206 --> 00:27:15,606
would Mix still want to date him?

442
00:27:16,286 --> 00:27:17,806
Are those two lovers?

443
00:27:18,006 --> 00:27:19,086
Of course.

444
00:27:23,086 --> 00:27:23,926
What are you doing?

445
00:27:24,246 --> 00:27:25,406
Can you stop doing this?

446
00:27:25,806 --> 00:27:27,806
I told you so many times that I don’t like it.

447
00:27:29,006 --> 00:27:31,406
You don’t like it, but I do.

448
00:27:39,166 --> 00:27:43,366
I also…like it when you get jealous like this, Babe.

449
00:27:48,526 --> 00:27:49,326
I have to go.

450
00:27:49,566 --> 00:27:51,086
I also have a practice this evening.

451
00:27:51,726 --> 00:27:53,686
So, just stay home, okay?

452
00:28:13,446 --> 00:28:14,886
Yo!

453
00:28:17,566 --> 00:28:18,606
Hey, Yo.

Mix, you scared me.

469
00:30:21,606 --> 00:30:23,606
I thought you were going to commit a suicide.

470
00:30:26,606 --> 00:30:28,966
If I hadn’t done that, would you come see me then?

471
00:30:35,406 --> 00:30:38,166
Yo…about Sack…

472
00:30:39,006 --> 00:30:40,966
I really wanted to tell you.

473
00:30:42,566 --> 00:30:44,806
But I was scared you might not be able to take it.

474
00:30:48,406 --> 00:30:49,726
Don’t worry, Mix.

475
00:30:52,366 --> 00:30:53,886
Because I really can’t take it.

476
00:30:57,206 --> 00:30:58,006
Yo…

477
00:30:59,886 --> 00:31:01,606
But you still love me, right?

478
00:31:02,006 --> 00:31:04,486
Otherwise, you wouldn’t have rushed here.

479
00:31:07,486 --> 00:31:08,966
You still care about me, don’t you?

480
00:31:11,406 --> 00:31:13,086
I’m here because…

481
00:31:14,686 --> 00:31:16,206
I want to tell you…

482
00:31:18,886 --> 00:31:20,326
that we should stop.

483
00:31:22,206 --> 00:31:23,486
Yo…

484
00:31:26,726 --> 00:31:28,406
I didn’t know you already have a boyfriend.

485
00:31:34,286 --> 00:31:36,126
And come to think of it,

486
00:31:40,286 --> 00:31:42,126
I’m actually not that into you.

487
00:31:54,366 --> 00:31:54,966

00:31:54,966 --> 00:31:56,326
Yo! Please stay here first.

489
00:31:56,726 --> 00:31:57,526
Don’t go anywhere.

490
00:32:05,206 --> 00:32:06,806
He’s still in the house.

491
00:32:07,886 --> 00:32:08,766
Come with me.

492
00:32:08,766 --> 00:32:09,606

Yo. Let me talk to him.

494
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:20,166
No.

495
00:32:20,566 --> 00:32:21,806
I’ll talk to him.

496
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:23,886
I’ll tell him that we’re just friends.

497
00:32:24,006 --> 00:32:26,926
No, Yo. You’ll get yourself killed. He would never listen to you.

498
00:32:27,206 --> 00:32:28,006
No, Mix.

499
00:32:36,166 --> 00:32:37,726

00:35:52,379 --> 00:35:54,129
Turn around, Yo.

551
00:35:55,089 --> 00:35:56,179
Turn around.

552
00:36:06,509 --> 00:36:09,759
Oh dear, what happened?

553
00:36:11,549 --> 00:36:12,549
Nothing serious, Mum.

554
00:36:13,089 --> 00:36:16,929
Just a little accident when I was helping Bank with the hazing.

555
00:36:17,929 --> 00:36:21,589
Are you going to tell me the truth now,
or are you going to wait until I find out?

556
00:36:23,219 --> 00:36:24,009
Tell me,

557
00:36:24,799 --> 00:36:26,589
whom did you pick a fight with this time?

558
00:36:37,589 --> 00:36:38,379
Okay.

559
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:40,379
Yes. Thank you.

560
00:36:41,429 --> 00:36:45,129
How’s Mr. Sira’s son? Is the injury serious?

561
00:36:46,509 --> 00:36:48,929
I think he’ll be fine.

562
00:36:48,929 --> 00:36:51,259
We have to wait for the x-ray result tomorrow first.

563
00:36:55,629 --> 00:36:58,299
When will you stop causing trouble, Yo?

564
00:36:59,379 --> 00:37:01,799
Two years ago, you beat your teacher up until he was hospitalized.

565
00:37:02,969 --> 00:37:06,049
This time, you almost got someone killed.

566
00:37:07,799 --> 00:37:10,509
That boy you smashed his head with the vase…

567
00:37:11,219 --> 00:37:12,339
Do you know who he is?

568
00:37:13,049 --> 00:37:16,759
He’s the son of Mr. Sira, a politician from Victory Thai party.

569
00:37:18,089 --> 00:37:19,299
What do you want me to do then?

570
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:22,509
Should I just stand there and let him shoot me?

571
00:37:23,509 --> 00:37:24,929
I had to protect myself.

572
00:37:25,799 --> 00:37:27,049
If I hadn’t done that…

573
00:37:27,509 --> 00:37:29,509
You might have had to go confirm my dead body at the hospital instead.

574
00:37:29,589 --> 00:37:31,549
You and your endless excuses.

575
00:37:31,929 --> 00:37:34,179
If you hadn't flirted with his girlfriend.

576
00:37:34,589 --> 00:37:36,049
why would he want to shoot you?

577
00:37:36,179 --> 00:37:37,429
I already told you.

578
00:37:38,009 --> 00:37:39,549
It was her who tried to play me.

579
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:41,719
Actually, I went there

580
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:43,429
because I wanted to break up with her.

581
00:37:43,759 --> 00:37:45,009
I didn’t mean to do anything like you think.

582
00:37:45,339 --> 00:37:46,629
- You..!
- That’s enough.

583
00:37:47,509 --> 00:37:48,589
Both of you.

584
00:37:49,429 --> 00:37:50,379
What’s done is done.

585
00:37:51,429 --> 00:37:55,179
We’d better try to come up with a way to deal with it.

586
00:37:56,799 --> 00:37:57,589
So,

587
00:37:58,429 --> 00:38:01,429
do you know anyone who can probably talk to Mr. Sira for us?

588
00:38:03,629 --> 00:38:05,549
Don’t worry about that.

589
00:38:06,929 --> 00:38:11,259
Even though I don’t know him personally,

590
00:38:11,259 --> 00:38:14,379
I’m sure he still respects me a little.

591
00:38:14,589 --> 00:38:17,299
We’re the main sponsor for his party.

592
00:38:17,549 --> 00:38:19,429
I’m sure we can settle this somehow.

593
00:38:20,549 --> 00:38:22,259
What I’m more worried about…

594
00:38:22,879 --> 00:38:25,009
is Mr. Sira’s son.

595
00:38:26,969 --> 00:38:27,759
Why?

596
00:38:28,549 --> 00:38:29,759
You shouldn't have asked.

597
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,969
Isn’t a man’s pride the most important thing to him?

598
00:38:34,509 --> 00:38:36,469
You flirted with his girl…

599
00:38:36,469 --> 00:38:38,929
And even beat him up until he must be taken to the hospital.

600
00:38:39,339 --> 00:38:42,049
Do you really think this Sack guy will let you get away with it?

601
00:38:44,179 --> 00:38:48,509
Can we wait until he gets better then Yo can go apologize to him?

602
00:38:48,509 --> 00:38:50,929
We can explain to him that it was a misunderstanding.

603
00:38:52,129 --> 00:38:54,219
I don’t think he would listen to us.

604
00:38:55,969 --> 00:38:57,589
What should we do then?

605
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:05,219
You have to go live somewhere else for a while.

606
00:39:08,049 --> 00:39:08,839
Somewhere

607
00:39:11,259 --> 00:39:12,299
Where is it, Dad?

608
00:39:17,629 --> 00:39:19,469
Is it abroad?

609
00:39:37,759 --> 00:39:39,589
Mum: Yo, wake up, dear.

610
00:39:44,839 --> 00:39:45,629
Jeez!

611
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:48,759
What the…

612
00:39:50,219 --> 00:39:52,219
Where are you taking me?

613
00:39:53,589 --> 00:39:54,929
Pho Chai Village.

614
00:39:55,429 --> 00:39:57,589
It’s a small village. Your dad used to live here.

615
00:39:59,509 --> 00:40:00,629
Did you get it wrong?

616
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:07,259
Do you mean Pochi, a small village abroad?

617
00:40:08,179 --> 00:40:10,799
No, you heard it right.

618
00:40:10,929 --> 00:40:13,799
I’m going to send you to stay at ‘Pho Chai’.

619
00:40:14,339 --> 00:40:15,339
Pochi!

620
00:40:15,339 --> 00:40:16,339
Pho Chai!

621
00:40:16,679 --> 00:40:18,719
Ah Pochi, pochi. Ah..

622
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:20,339
Pochi..Pho Chai!

623
00:40:20,589 --> 00:40:22,049
If you say it again,

624
00:40:22,379 --> 00:40:24,429
I’ll send you there forever.

625
00:40:26,759 --> 00:40:29,509
It’ll be good for you. You can finish school there.

626
00:40:29,929 --> 00:40:32,969
You’ve dropped out for two years already.
How long will you keep staying like this?

627
00:40:34,259 --> 00:40:36,259
You want me to go study in the countryside?

628
00:40:36,429 --> 00:40:37,339
Yes.

629
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:39,879
Since you can’t finish school here,

630
00:40:39,879 --> 00:40:42,589
maybe you’ll be able to finish it there.

631
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:47,469
He does this for your own safety.

632
00:40:48,299 --> 00:40:50,219
He has a lot of friends there.

633
00:40:50,219 --> 00:40:53,049
In case anything happens, they’d be able to help.

634
00:40:54,969 --> 00:40:55,759
Mum.

635
00:40:58,299 --> 00:41:00,719
Please send me to the US instead.

636
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:03,379
If you send me to the countryside,

637
00:41:03,759 --> 00:41:06,049
aren’t you afraid I’d get killed by the buffalo there?

638
00:41:07,219 --> 00:41:08,589
You'd be so devastated.

639
00:41:08,879 --> 00:41:13,469
Oh, shut up. Enough with your daydreaming to study in the US.

640
00:41:13,879 --> 00:41:15,759
You can’t even finish school here.

641
00:41:15,759 --> 00:41:18,089
I doubt if you’d be able to study anything there.

642
00:41:18,759 --> 00:41:21,549
If you still value your life,

643
00:41:21,969 --> 00:41:25,129
you must go to study at ‘Pho Chai’.

644
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:26,049

00:41:30,429 --> 00:41:32,299
Whom would you send him to stay with?

647
00:41:38,179 --> 00:41:42,929
Yo, do you still remember what I told you?

648
00:41:43,929 --> 00:41:46,429
That you must behave while living with Grandma Jan.

649
00:41:46,969 --> 00:41:48,839
Don’t you go causing her any trouble.

650
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:55,339
And if you’re thinking that you’d do it on purpose, so that they would send you back…

651
00:41:55,339 --> 00:41:56,679
you can forget that.

652
00:41:57,129 --> 00:41:59,759
Not only you’d get reprimanded by Grandma Jan,

653
00:42:00,179 --> 00:42:02,469
Chief Jom will also make you pay for your mischief.

654
00:42:04,429 --> 00:42:06,379
Have you ever met this Chief Jom before?

655
00:42:07,759 --> 00:42:11,129
No, but Headman Kla said he’s his nephew.

656
00:42:12,089 --> 00:42:14,679
The reason we have to send you to Pho Chai…

657
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:17,089
is because Chief Jom lives here.

658
00:42:18,339 --> 00:42:19,129
Why?

659
00:42:20,589 --> 00:42:25,259
Kla said Chief Jom rules here.

660
00:42:26,379 --> 00:42:29,929
Should Sira’s son and his gang come all the way from Bangkok to get back at our son…

661
00:42:30,469 --> 00:42:32,929
With just one word from Chief Jom,

662
00:42:32,929 --> 00:42:35,759
they could never leave Pho Chai.

663
00:42:38,379 --> 00:42:41,509
It seems this Chief Jom is quite ruthless.

I don’t want to study here.

667
00:43:03,759 --> 00:43:05,549
Why do you have to do this to me?

668
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:15,759
If you don’t want to stay here,

669
00:43:22,799 --> 00:43:23,969
then die.

00:44:01,929 --> 00:44:03,179

Granny Nid told me that you’re running out of them.

731
00:50:46,299 --> 00:50:46,879
That’s right.

732
00:50:46,879 --> 00:50:47,929
Here are your stocks.

733
00:50:47,969 --> 00:50:48,719
Have a good day.

734
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:49,429
Thanks.

735
00:50:49,429 --> 00:50:50,259
See you.

736
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,179
Oh, wait.

737
00:50:56,719 --> 00:50:59,179
Do you know how I can go back to Bangkok? Which way is it?

738
00:51:00,179 --> 00:51:01,339
Bangkok?

739
00:51:01,929 --> 00:51:04,429
You have to get a bus at the terminal in the city center.

740
00:51:04,799 --> 00:51:06,589
You should be able to get a seat if you go now.

741
00:51:07,629 --> 00:51:08,969
Do you happen to pass by there?

742
00:51:09,549 --> 00:51:11,299
Can you give me a ride?

743
00:51:12,379 --> 00:51:14,429
Well, I’m afraid I’m not going that way.

744
00:51:14,879 --> 00:51:15,469
How about this?

745
00:51:15,469 --> 00:51:18,179
You can come with me and get off at the junction.

746
00:51:18,179 --> 00:51:19,929
You should be able to find someone who’s going to the city center there.

747
00:51:19,929 --> 00:51:21,179
That’s great. Thanks a lot.

748
00:51:21,179 --> 00:51:21,799
Let’s…

749
00:51:23,009 --> 00:51:24,089
…get in the car.

750
00:51:35,179 --> 00:51:37,839
Shop owner: Hey! You forgot your change.

751
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:42,509
NEXT BREAK
Dad! Mum! Who are you?

752
00:51:42,669 --> 00:51:44,549
I’m sorry for my late introduction.

753
00:51:44,549 --> 00:51:47,089
I’m Jomkwan. I’m the village chief here.

754
00:51:55,179 --> 00:52:00,219
[My Sweetheart Jom]

755
00:52:33,979 --> 00:52:35,419
You’re not from around here, aren’t you?

756
00:52:37,219 --> 00:52:39,019
Is it that obvious?

757
00:52:42,779 --> 00:52:43,499
It’s not that.

758
00:52:43,739 --> 00:52:47,339
Our Pho Chai village is such a tiny community.

759
00:52:47,819 --> 00:52:48,899
Everyone knows each other here.

760
00:52:49,859 --> 00:52:51,419
I’ve never seen you around before.

761
00:52:52,539 --> 00:52:54,819
So, I thought you might not be from around here.

762
00:53:05,979 --> 00:53:06,939
What’s wrong?

763
00:53:13,019 --> 00:53:13,819
Nothing.

764
00:53:14,859 --> 00:53:16,779
Do you have a problem with that car?

765
00:53:19,059 --> 00:53:19,859
No, not at all.

766
00:53:40,019 --> 00:53:41,379
Why do you stop?

767
00:53:45,419 --> 00:53:48,459
Tell me honestly, what have you done?

768
00:53:48,819 --> 00:53:51,979
You look like someone who’s running away from trouble.

769
00:53:52,339 --> 00:53:55,299
If you don’t tell me, I’ll call the police.

770
00:54:06,819 --> 00:54:09,739
Okay, fine. I’ll tell you.

771
00:54:10,419 --> 00:54:12,059
I’m here with my friends.

772
00:54:15,019 --> 00:54:16,539
Don’t lie to me.

773
00:54:18,939 --> 00:54:23,219
If you do, I’ll make you tell everything to the police.

774
00:54:32,819 --> 00:54:36,219
It’s my parents. They want me to stay here with Chief Jom.

775
00:54:42,659 --> 00:54:44,819
Komet’s son is moving here to stay with us.

776
00:54:46,659 --> 00:54:49,019
Did Uncle Kla tell you why?

777
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:53,419
He said that boy got himself into a fight with the politician’s son.

778
00:54:53,939 --> 00:54:56,579
Komet is worried about his son’s safety.

779
00:54:57,539 --> 00:54:59,219
So, he wants his son to stay with us for a while.

780
00:55:00,339 --> 00:55:01,579
But don’t worry, Chief.

781
00:55:01,819 --> 00:55:03,419
I’ve already checked.

782
00:55:04,019 --> 00:55:05,539
That boy didn’t kill anyone.

783
00:55:05,659 --> 00:55:07,739
Nor is he involved with drugs.

784
00:55:08,739 --> 00:55:09,579
Also,

785
00:55:10,419 --> 00:55:12,179
Komet is such a nice guy.

786
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:16,819
If it’s not that serious, I’m sure he’d never have sent his only son away like this.

787
00:55:17,259 --> 00:55:20,459
Do you have any problem with it?

788
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:24,619
If you’re okay, then I’m okay too.

789
00:55:25,819 --> 00:55:28,819
Did Uncle Komet tell you when his son would move in?

790
00:55:33,739 --> 00:55:34,739
So, this means…

791
00:55:34,739 --> 00:55:35,899
You’re from around here.

792
00:55:36,139 --> 00:55:37,699
So, you probably know Chief Jom.

793
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:41,019
Well, I…

794
00:55:41,019 --> 00:55:45,299
Do you know how cruel and ruthless he is?

795
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:49,979
Chief Jom is cruel?

796
00:55:50,579 --> 00:55:51,619
Yes.

797
00:55:52,459 --> 00:55:56,099
He might act kind and nice in front of you.

798
00:55:56,099 --> 00:55:58,699
But behind your back, he’s not like that at all.

799
00:56:01,219 --> 00:56:03,019
You said he’s also ruthless. How?

800
00:56:03,219 --> 00:56:04,979
How?

801
00:56:05,259 --> 00:56:07,659
He’s cruel,

802
00:56:08,219 --> 00:56:09,459
merciless,

803
00:56:09,979 --> 00:56:11,219
and cold-blooded.

804
00:56:12,019 --> 00:56:13,659
So much I have to run away from him.

805
00:56:15,459 --> 00:56:18,059
If he’s that bad,

806
00:56:19,619 --> 00:56:20,979
should I take you to see the police instead?

807
00:56:21,019 --> 00:56:23,579
No! Don’t do that.

808
00:56:24,419 --> 00:56:26,619
Don’t you know how powerful Chief Jom is around here?

809
00:56:27,579 --> 00:56:30,779
Those police might also work for him.

810
00:56:33,339 --> 00:56:38,099
If you really want to help, just drop me off at the bus terminal.

811
00:56:38,419 --> 00:56:39,219
Please?

812
00:56:41,459 --> 00:56:44,979
Okay, I’ll give you a lift there.

813
00:56:46,739 --> 00:56:47,539
Thank you.

814
00:56:48,619 --> 00:56:49,619
No need to do that.

815
00:56:51,579 --> 00:56:53,539
Yes!

816
00:56:56,539 --> 00:56:59,219
Why are they taking so long?

817
00:56:59,219 --> 00:57:03,139
Aren’t they supposed to be here by now?

818
00:57:04,139 --> 00:57:08,339
Maybe Komet is getting lost, Granny.

819
00:57:09,219 --> 00:57:11,539
Should we call them?

820
00:57:13,379 --> 00:57:15,619
No need. There they are.

821
00:57:15,619 --> 00:57:18,379
- Let’s go.
- Speak of the devil.

822
00:57:21,219 --> 00:57:25,539
- Kla: Here they come.
- Finally.

823
00:57:25,659 --> 00:57:28,219
- Hello, Granny.
- Hello, dear.

824
00:57:28,659 --> 00:57:31,619
This is Bus, my wife. Do you remember her?

825
00:57:32,219 --> 00:57:36,739
Of course. I’m not that old and forgetful.

826
00:57:36,739 --> 00:57:38,339
I remember everything.

827
00:57:38,779 --> 00:57:41,419
You’re still the same though.

828
00:57:43,139 --> 00:57:48,419
It’s probably because of those vitamins and supplements she often gives to me.

829
00:57:49,019 --> 00:57:52,659
That’s why I still look young despite my age.

830
00:57:53,379 --> 00:57:54,659
That’s not what I meant.

831
00:57:55,419 --> 00:57:59,419
I mean you and your lack of punctuality. You’re always late.

832
00:57:59,419 --> 00:58:01,379
Ah, yes.

833
00:58:01,419 --> 00:58:04,659
Granny, don’t be so harsh.

834
00:58:04,659 --> 00:58:06,179
He might have gone the wrong way earlier.

835
00:58:06,179 --> 00:58:10,059
It’s been a long time since he last came here.

836
00:58:10,059 --> 00:58:11,699
Right?

837
00:58:11,699 --> 00:58:13,979
Yes, thank you, Headman.

838
00:58:14,339 --> 00:58:16,739
How are you doing?

839
00:58:16,779 --> 00:58:17,859
I’m good.

840
00:58:18,419 --> 00:58:23,619
But tomorrow, I might have a bad headache.

841
00:58:27,179 --> 00:58:32,419
Because I guess I’ll stay up all night drinking with you.

842
00:58:35,579 --> 00:58:39,219
Not just a headache but also a crack on your head t

843
00:58:39,339 --> 00:58:40,139
Jeez, you two.

844
00:58:40,379 --> 00:58:42,419
Is drinking the only thing you can do well?

845
00:58:42,819 --> 00:58:44,259
How would our people in the village survive then?

846
00:58:46,379 --> 00:58:48,339
Come on, we were just kidding.

847
00:58:48,619 --> 00:58:49,419
So?

848
00:58:49,619 --> 00:58:54,579
We’re not that young anymore. We’ll probably be in bed by 8 or 9pm.

849
00:58:56,619 --> 00:58:58,419
So annoying.

850
00:58:59,739 --> 00:59:02,019
Isn’t that rascal also here?

851
00:59:02,859 --> 00:59:04,659
I don’t see anyone here. Where’s he?

852
00:59:05,739 --> 00:59:07,499
Hey, are you there?

853
00:59:38,419 --> 00:59:41,619
This doesn’t seem like a way to the city center.

854
00:59:42,779 --> 00:59:44,419
Are you taking a longer way there?

855
00:59:51,339 --> 00:59:52,179
Oh.

856
00:59:58,419 --> 00:59:59,659
We’ve arrived.

857
01:00:02,819 --> 01:00:04,339
Dad. Mum.

858
01:00:04,339 --> 01:00:04,939
Let’s go.

859
01:00:06,459 --> 01:00:07,619
Who are you?

860
01:00:22,059 --> 01:00:22,939
Yo.

861
01:00:24,419 --> 01:00:25,339
Yo!

862
01:00:25,819 --> 01:00:26,619
Come here right now!

863
01:00:31,659 --> 01:00:32,619
Come here.

864
01:00:38,459 --> 01:00:40,819
When will you stop causing trouble?

865
01:00:40,979 --> 01:00:44,099
Please talk to him nicely.

866
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:45,259
Calm down.

867
01:00:46,939 --> 01:00:49,139
Thank you so much for giving him a ride.

868
01:00:49,459 --> 01:00:49,939
Yes.

869
01:00:50,979 --> 01:00:52,219
Is this your son?

870
01:00:52,219 --> 01:00:58,099
Yo, say hello to Grandma Chan and my friend, Headman Kla.

871
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:03,459
Hello.

872
01:01:03,579 --> 01:01:04,259
Hello.

873
01:01:04,259 --> 01:01:05,059
Hello.

874
01:01:07,259 --> 01:01:08,579
He is quite something.

875
01:01:09,339 --> 01:01:10,619
Where did you meet him?

876
01:01:12,139 --> 01:01:13,939
At Uncle Daeng’s shop.

877
01:01:14,019 --> 01:01:15,979
I bumped into him and decided to give him a lift.

878
01:01:20,139 --> 01:01:21,539
Hello, Uncle and Auntie.

879
01:01:21,539 --> 01:01:22,499
Hello.

880
01:01:22,539 --> 01:01:24,099
I’m sorry for my late introduction.

881
01:01:24,379 --> 01:01:26,979
I’m Jomkwan. I’m the village chief here.

882
01:01:27,179 --> 01:01:29,179
Ah, Chief Jom.

883
01:01:29,179 --> 01:01:31,739
You look much younger than we thought.

884
01:01:56,059 --> 01:01:58,539
[Certificate Awarding Ceremony for Best Headman and Village Chief]

885
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:07,419
What is it, Komet?

886
01:02:08,419 --> 01:02:09,699
Nothing, Granny.

887
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:14,339
I just didn’t expect Chief Jom to be this young.

888
01:02:16,419 --> 01:02:17,939
What’s wrong with being young?

889
01:02:17,939 --> 01:02:21,259
Do you really think an older man would do better than him?

890
01:02:21,259 --> 01:02:23,379
Am I right?

891
01:02:24,859 --> 01:02:28,779
Jeez, can’t you turn somewhere else when you talk about being ‘old’?

892
01:02:28,779 --> 01:02:31,019
Don’t turn your face my way.

893
01:02:33,259 --> 01:02:37,579
It’s not like that. Komet thinks Pho Chai is not an ordinary village.

894
01:02:37,579 --> 01:02:41,339
The one who can be a village chief here would probably look more ruthless.

895
01:02:41,979 --> 01:02:44,979
Like one with a bushy beard and booming voice?

896
01:02:45,379 --> 01:02:45,819
Yes.

897
01:02:45,819 --> 01:02:51,219
Maybe that’s not a good idea. Someone around here already thinks I’m cruel and cold-blooded.

898
01:02:55,019 --> 01:02:58,019
But I’m telling you,

899
01:02:58,619 --> 01:03:03,259
don’t let that pretty face fool you.

900
01:03:03,579 --> 01:03:07,139
He’s bold, daring, and never back down in a fight.

901
01:03:07,179 --> 01:03:07,979
Really?

902
01:03:08,219 --> 01:03:12,379
That politician’s son and his minions won’t be able to lay a finger on him here.

903
01:03:14,819 --> 01:03:17,419
Don’t say that. It’s rather because I’m the village chief.

904
01:03:18,019 --> 01:03:22,179
Everyone who lives here is also under my care and responsibility.

905
01:03:23,019 --> 01:03:25,179
If anyone wants to hurt my people, they must get over my dead body first.

906
01:03:25,259 --> 01:03:26,659
That’s my boy!

907
01:03:26,979 --> 01:03:28,859
My grandson!

908
01:03:38,059 --> 01:03:41,459
Try to behave, don’t be stubborn or cause any trouble.

909
01:03:41,979 --> 01:03:44,219
You’ve said that for the umpteenth time now, Dad.

910
01:03:45,019 --> 01:03:46,059
I heard it

911
01:03:47,419 --> 01:03:51,019
Hearing it and doing it is a different thing.

912
01:03:52,219 --> 01:03:52,739
I know.

913
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:57,539
You too, Dad. Don’t forget our promise.

914
01:03:58,059 --> 01:03:59,779
Don’t worry, I won’t.

915
01:04:00,859 --> 01:04:03,259
If you can finish Grade 12 here,

916
01:04:03,659 --> 01:04:05,259
be it the US…

917
01:04:06,939 --> 01:04:12,419
or anywhere in this world or even on Mars, I’ll send you there.

918
01:04:13,619 --> 01:04:14,419
I promise.

919
01:04:19,539 --> 01:04:21,739
Are you really going to leave me here?

920
01:04:24,219 --> 01:04:28,619
What about my money? Can you unfreeze my bank account?

921
01:04:32,459 --> 01:04:35,059
My son, let’s go.

922
01:04:36,219 --> 01:04:39,699
Go upstairs and see if Granny wants you to help with anything.

923
01:04:40,019 --> 01:04:41,739
I’m going to talk to the chief.

924
01:04:42,459 --> 01:04:43,379
Off you go.

925
01:05:25,419 --> 01:05:28,419
Just see us off here. No need to walk us to our car.

926
01:05:28,979 --> 01:05:29,619
Yes.

927
01:05:31,299 --> 01:05:32,219
Give me a hug.

928
01:05:32,459 --> 01:05:34,259
Be a good boy, okay?

929
01:05:36,659 --> 01:05:37,739
Goodbye, Dad and Mum.

930
01:05:38,259 --> 01:05:39,059
Bye.

931
01:05:40,219 --> 01:05:41,019
Take care.

932
01:05:41,459 --> 01:05:42,259
Let’s go.

933
01:05:57,059 --> 01:05:59,019
I know you’re worried about him.

934
01:06:00,019 --> 01:06:03,419
But you must stay strong.

935
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:12,379
Tell that to yourself too. It’s you who are worried about him the most.

936
01:06:12,459 --> 01:06:16,539
It was you who immediately called your friend who knows Sira…

937
01:06:16,539 --> 01:06:18,979
to help settle the problem our son has caused.

938
01:06:19,219 --> 01:06:23,139
It was also you who arranged everything for You to take refuge here.

939
01:06:23,579 --> 01:06:27,099
I think the one who cares for him the most is you.

940
01:06:35,979 --> 01:06:39,419
I just hope he can one day become more reliable.

941
01:06:45,219 --> 01:06:46,019
Believe in him.

942
01:06:47,699 --> 01:06:48,379
Let’s go.

943
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:16,059
You can use this room.

944
01:07:20,379 --> 01:07:21,379
Did you have fun?

945
01:07:21,859 --> 01:07:23,819
Why didn’t you tell me earlier that you’re Chief Jom?

946
01:07:26,019 --> 01:07:27,739
You didn’t give me any chance.

947
01:07:30,619 --> 01:07:32,459
When they told me you had a fight with a politician’s son,

948
01:07:36,299 --> 01:07:37,699
I thought you’d be stronger.

949
01:07:38,619 --> 01:07:39,419
But…

950
01:07:40,179 --> 01:07:40,979
But what?

951
01:07:42,619 --> 01:07:43,419
Nothing.

952
01:07:43,979 --> 01:07:45,459
Let’s take a look at your room.

953
01:07:46,019 --> 01:07:48,459
The toilet is outside.

954
01:07:48,579 --> 01:07:50,059
That’s the wardrobe.

955
01:07:51,179 --> 01:07:51,979
I know.

956
01:07:52,659 --> 01:07:53,339
Good.

957
01:07:56,539 --> 01:07:58,739
I can take care of my things.

958
01:08:08,139 --> 01:08:08,939
Sure?

959
01:08:10,339 --> 01:08:11,179
I’m not a kid.

960
01:08:12,219 --> 01:08:13,659
You don’t have to babysit me.

961
01:08:20,259 --> 01:08:22,339
Oh, one more thing.

962
01:08:22,859 --> 01:08:24,499
Don’t unpack all your things.

963
01:08:28,659 --> 01:08:30,819
I don’t think you’d be here long.

964
01:08:43,379 --> 01:08:44,819
Not long, huh?

965
01:08:52,779 --> 01:08:54,739
Why did you say that to him, Chief?

966
01:08:55,419 --> 01:09:00,619
Because I know he’s stubborn and doesn’t want to lose.

967
01:09:01,379 --> 01:09:04,539
If we think he can’t do it, he’ll do everything to prove us wrong

968
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:07,779
This way, he’ll do anything to stay here.

969
01:09:08,059 --> 01:09:11,179
I hope you’re right.

970
01:09:11,619 --> 01:09:12,539
Me too.

971
01:09:13,019 --> 01:09:14,739
Come, I’ll walk with you.

972
01:10:00,339 --> 01:10:01,779
Yothin: Who are those kids?

973
01:10:01,779 --> 01:10:03,339
Jomkwan: Your housemates.

974
01:10:03,339 --> 01:10:05,459
Yothin: I have to live with those imps?

975
01:10:05,459 --> 01:10:06,539
Yothin: What’s this dish called?

976
01:10:06,539 --> 01:10:08,019
It’s our family’s Spicy Minced Meat Salad.

977
01:10:08,019 --> 01:10:11,059
Oh, is it a secret recipe passed on from your ancestors?

978
01:10:11,059 --> 01:10:13,979
No, not really. We just use lizard.

979
01:10:14,259 --> 01:10:15,459
A lizard?

980
01:10:15,819 --> 01:10:17,379
Is there any news about Sack?

981
01:10:18,139 --> 01:10:22,579
Toy: No.

982
01:10:22,579 --> 01:10:24,579
Toy: I’m afraid it’s Sack who told the media to keep silent.

983
01:10:34,899 --> 01:10:37,779
Jomkwan: I think you’re safe now.
