1
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:08,560
Zeng Qian.

2
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,650
What's going on?

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,020
The buns are poisoned.

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,970
I don't know what happened.

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,920
I'll report this to Master Baili right away.

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,800
Go quickly!

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,440
Zeng Qian.

8
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,600
She's gone.

9
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,720
No need to overdo the makeup.

10
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,380
Just make your lips look pale.

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,720
Just my lips?

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,680
Fake death.

13
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,600
Will this trick work?

14
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,080
Even if Zeng Qian holds her breath.

15
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,280
What about the pulse?

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,840
Put something hard under the armpit.

17
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,100
The pulse at the wrist can be controlled.

18
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,280
Zeng Qian.

19
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,760
There's really no pulse now.

20
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,840
If she holds her breath, he won't see her heartbeat.

21
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,500
And since Zeng Qian is a woman,

22
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,960
Baili Yuan probably won't touch her chest to feel her heartbeat.

23
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,640
But the pulse in the neck is a problem.

24
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,640
We can guide him

25
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,520
to check her wrist first.

26
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,160
What if after checking her wrist...

27
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,039
What if he checks my neck again?

28
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:25,920
Once he confirms there's no pulse in my wrist,

29
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,440
he won't be able to hide his reaction.

30
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:27,920
Unless

31
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,160
he's not the one who saved me back then.

32
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,680
If the person who sent someone to rescue Zeng Qian

33
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,940
was really Bai Liyuan,

34
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,160
it means he cares deeply about her

35
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,000
and is just deliberately hiding it now.

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,200
What if Zeng Qian

37
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,120
is in danger again?

38
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,259
Those who care lose their composure.

39
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,760
Were my reactions

40
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,520
satisfactory to you?

41
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,360
This person is barely breathing

42
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,560
and you're still talking like that?

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Stop pretending.

44
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,760
He's already figured it out.

45
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,440
My household is very cautious about food

46
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,240
so poisoning incidents rarely happen.

47
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,680
Furthermore,

48
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,620
your supposed death looks too peculiar.

49
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,600
Arms tightly pressed together,

50
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,940
definitely hiding something hard under your armpits.

51
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,610
I've seen this trick many times during military campaigns.

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,520
Xiguang has told me a lot about you all.

53
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,960
I've heard about your cleverness and intelligence.

54
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,940
But seeing the tricks you used today,

55
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,400
I'm deeply disappointed.

56
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,540
[Fake death by poisoning]

57
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,500
This plan is rather childish.

58
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,120
We're dealing with Baili Yuan.

59
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,920
Don't worry.

60
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,320
He'll definitely see through it.

61
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,080
Even if he does, it doesn't matter.

62
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,640
We must do this anyway.

63
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,300
This is our statement.

64
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,400
I understand.

65
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,600
Let him know that we already know.

66
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:21,360
This might force him to tell the truth.

67
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,640
You all.

68
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,700
You actually anticipated I would see through this,

69
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,360
didn't you?

70
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,100
You're clever indeed.

71
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,800
You may leave.

72
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,560
Yes.

73
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,170
You were impersonating me.

74
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,880
Getting information from my confidant

75
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,440
I knew about this last night.

76
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,040
There are some things

77
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,080
if you don't figure out,

78
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,280
even if you're driven out of Baili Manor,

79
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,200
you still won't give up.

80
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,880
Young lady,

81
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,920
let's talk in private.

82
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,810
This sword of yours,

83
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,360
where did you get it from?

84
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,840
When I was nine,

85
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,090
I found it in the mountains.

86
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,760
These two precious swords

87
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,600
were made by Tuo tribe craftsmen using meteorite stone,

88
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,000
identical to each other.

89
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:42,880
Back then,

90
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,000
I helped the Tuo tribe repel the Northern Mang cavalry,

91
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,980
and the tribal chief, to show gratitude,

92
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,520
gifted me these two swords.

93
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:56,040
Later, I went to Suzhou to quell a rebellion,

94
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,040
and for an entire year,

95
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,280
we were at a stalemate with the rebels.

96
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,840
During that time,

97
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,720
I saved a local woman

98
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,640
who fell in love with me

99
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,460
and gave herself to me,

100
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,280
and even

101
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,200
bore me a daughter.

102
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,960
Soon after,

103
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,560
the military situation suddenly changed.

104
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,900
The rebels received reinforcements

105
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,570
and began a counterattack.

106
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,159
I took the mother and daughter along with my few hundred remaining loyal soldiers

107
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,890
and became trapped in a valley.

108
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,730
I had prepared myself to die in battle.

109
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,320
But just then,

110
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,000
I accidentally discovered an underground river.

111
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Though narrow,

112
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,280
it ran across the entire valley.

113
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,560
To save my daughter's life,

114
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,480
I placed her, still in swaddling clothes, into a wooden basin

115
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,200
and included one of the precious daggers as proof of identity

116
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,160
so we could recognize each other in the future.

117
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,560
The basin floated safely away along the underground river,

118
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,120
and my reinforcements finally arrived.

119
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,720
With forces inside and outside,

120
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,600
we defeated the rebels.

121
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,240
But I never found my daughter again.

122
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,240
Her mother

123
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,400
also fell ill from longing

124
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,120
and died of grief.

125
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,520
And I

126
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,840
can only remember her through this knife.

127
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,960
For years,

128
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,600
I've carefully preserved it,

129
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,480
not allowing it to be damaged in any way.

130
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,040
Because only with it

131
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,440
can I remember

132
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,400
my poor daughter who cannot be by my side.

133
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,080
So...

134
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,760
Think carefully.

135
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,880
Is this knife

136
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,520
really something you found?

137
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,080
Years later,

138
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,180
I finally found you at Jiuyuan Mountain.

139
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,660
But by then, you had been adopted by a family of hunters.

140
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,120
They treated you as their own child.

141
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,320
Although I held a high position

142
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,780
with vast territories under my control,

143
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,080
there were dangerous undercurrents at court

144
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,160
and political factions targeting their enemies.

145
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,480
Many people had their eyes on me.

146
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,940
Not acknowledging you

147
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,960
was for your own safety.

148
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,920
Being the daughter of Bai Liyuan

149
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,160
would mean being surrounded by wolves.

150
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,760
Better to be a complete stranger,

151
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:07,960
free

152
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,680
and at peace.

153
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,760
Later,

154
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,600
I occasionally sent people to the mountain to check on you.

155
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,520
That time when I sent Feng Buhai to rescue you,

156
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,520
it was indeed me.

157
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,400
But after that attack,

158
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,880
you went into hiding.

159
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,160
I never heard from you again.

160
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,480
This time you came to the Bai residence...

161
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,810
I'm incredibly excited

162
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,810
with so many emotions stirring inside me,

163
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,000
but I have to force myself to hold them back.

164
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,560
Now

165
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,520
you've become aware of our relationship,

166
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,800
and it's no longer a secret that I sent people to save you.

167
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,440
Your true identity will be revealed sooner or later,

168
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,680
and then you'll be surrounded by danger.

169
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,180
Rather than waiting for that,

170
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,120
we should acknowledge our connection.

171
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,520
Our enemies will be wary,

172
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,330
and I'll have peace of mind.

173
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,840
But child,

174
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,220
if circumstances hadn't forced my hand,

175
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,320
I would rather you lived an ordinary life

176
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,800
than have you

177
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,040
dragged into these treacherous power struggles because of me.

178
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,760
Look.

179
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,800
I was right.

180
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,480
He really is your father.

181
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,040
That's great.

182
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:14,600
This way,

183
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,130
you don't have to worry about him refusing to help save Zeng Xin.

184
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,880
But didn't you say before

185
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,640
that you found that knife?

186
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,400
This rain is quite chilly.

187
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,200
I'll go inside to warm up.

188
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,960
Wait.

189
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,000
I feel cold too.

190
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,440
I'll come with you.

191
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,440
Xie Jingtang.

192
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,040
Aren't you cold?

193
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,770
Not at all. The rain feels nice.

194
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,440
You are cold.

195
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,680
I'm freezing.

196
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,770
Why is it so cold?

197
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,720
If I say...

198
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,720
I've always believed you were that girl from back then.

199
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,720
Do you believe me?

200
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,360
I do.

201
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,200
But why?

202
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,720
Because you're so similar to that girl.

203
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,840
After all these years,

204
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,520
how could I still look the same?

205
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,980
It's the feeling you give.

206
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,880
Some feelings are etched into a person's memory forever.

207
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,200
These feelings might occur at a special time,

208
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,080
in a special place,

209
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,820
or when you're with a special person.

210
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,820
What's interesting is

211
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,680
that girl happened to be someone I met

212
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,320
at a special time,

213
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,760
in a special place.

214
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,240
And now you

215
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,410
are that person too.

216
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,760
But I understand

217
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,160
why you didn't reveal yourself to me then.

218
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,890
You must have had your reasons.

219
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,880
That year, my family

220
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,980
was attacked by mysterious men in black.

221
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,780
My father, with his dying breath,

222
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,020
not only revealed my true identity to me,

223
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,300
but also instructed me

224
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,840
not to dwell on it,

225
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,920
to let it go,

226
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,520
and to live in anonymity.

227
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,040
At that moment, I realized

228
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,640
my identity had to remain secret

229
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,960
and couldn't be shared with others.

230
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,480
Otherwise,

231
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,520
it would endanger those close to me.

232
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,420
Your reason is remarkably similar to why Bai Liyuan

233
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,960
didn't acknowledge you.

234
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,960
You and your father are truly alike.

235
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,640
Actually, back then,

236
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,480
when you mentioned that past incident,

237
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,960
I had a momentary impulse to tell you

238
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,680
that I was that girl.

239
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,600
But I held back.

240
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,560
I thought it was just childhood memories

241
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,290
that should be left in the past.

242
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,410
But the more I thought that way,

243
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,890
the more it bothered me.

244
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,970
The more it bothered me,

245
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,380
the more guilty I felt.

246
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,320
I'm sorry

247
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,240
for deceiving you.

248
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,380
I'm the one who should apologize.

249
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,740
I was the one who broke our promise first.

250
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,410
That's true.

251
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,370
Consider it my revenge.

252
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,300
Let's get reacquainted then,

253
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,560
Aqin.

254
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,400
Sure,

255
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,359
Brother Chong.

256
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,920
Should we celebrate?

257
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,369
Have a drink?

258
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,599
Even though many things remain unresolved,

259
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,920
that shouldn't stop us from drinking.

260
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,760
We can drink when we're happy,

261
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,119
and we can drink when we're not.

262
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:21,920
Right, Aqin?

263
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,700
And you too, Chong?

264
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:25,720
Please.

265
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,280
Now that Baili Yuan and Zeng Qian have recognized each other

266
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,360
it means you've passed the hardest part.

267
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,440
Poisoning Baili Yuan should be the hardest part, right?

268
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,080
The difficulty isn't in the action

269
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,080
but in your heart.

270
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,760
You need to overcome your own barriers.

271
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,840
Not for me

272
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,640
but for yourself.

273
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,040
Baili Yuan and Zeng Qian have recognized each other.

274
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,640
They are indeed father and daughter.

275
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,370
Everything is going smoothly.

276
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,640
Will Cao Sheng make his move?

277
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,850
The Crown Prince just needs to act.

278
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,400
Cao Sheng is right.

279
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,000
Trying to poison Baili Yuan

280
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,000
is indeed not easy.

281
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,840
However,

282
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,640
Zeng Qian has no defenses at all.

283
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,120
If Zeng Qian is poisoned,

284
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,360
Baili Yuan will still produce that map.

285
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,100
Different paths, same destination.

286
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,480
Then why did we let them go?

287
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,520
Why didn't we just threaten Baili Yuan with Zeng Qian

288
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,640
from the beginning?

289
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,520
Before, Zeng Qian was just an abandoned baby.

290
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,560
Even if she is Baili Yuan's daughter,

291
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,220
Baili Yuan had never seen her.

292
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,400
How much would he sacrifice for her?

293
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,680
Only after meeting her

294
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,810
and recognizing her

295
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,640
would Baili Yuan invest emotions in her.

296
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,680
With emotional attachment.

297
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,570
It would be a breakthrough.

298
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,780
General Baili's daughter

299
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,280
is now the young lady of the house.

300
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,410
Why don't you change into clothes that suit your status?

301
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,800
I think these clothes are fine.

302
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,600
Comfortable.

303
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,040
The Crown Prince is in such good spirits

304
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,610
to specially invite me for drinks.

305
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,100
Now not only the Baili household,

306
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,280
but probably all of Chen Province knows that Lord Baili

307
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,360
has found his long-lost daughter,

308
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,200
like a pearl returned to its bay.

309
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,460
I should take this chance to curry favor too.

310
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,200
I don't deserve that.

311
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,650
You are the Crown Prince after all.

312
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,720
I was just joking.

313
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,800
That's too harsh.

314
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,560
There's no such thing as Crown Prince anymore.

315
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,720
You know what,

316
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,760
the food at Baili Mansion really is excellent.

317
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,560
Better than Qingfeng Tower.

318
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,680
Not by much.

319
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,640
I prefer Qingfeng Tower's flavor.

320
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,160
Why?

321
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,200
It tastes bad.

322
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,940
I just went outside

323
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
and saw many people bringing gifts.

324
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,720
Seems like Baili Yuan's family reunion

325
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,320
is going to be a grand affair.

326
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,780
Where's Zeng Qian?

327
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,940
The Crown Prince invited her out.

328
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,420
When did they become so close?

329
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,800
It's not surprising though.

330
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,080
Baili Yuan has impressive military achievements.

331
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,480
He'll be granted a royal title sooner or later.

332
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,560
Then Zeng Qian will become a princess.

333
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,720
A princess and the Crown Prince...

334
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,970
Cao Sheng has competition now.

335
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,680
Hurry up.

336
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,440
I can't eat anymore.

337
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,320
What are you doing with that fish?

338
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:56,800
No,

339
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,280
I asked Xie Jingtang to save it quickly.

340
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,800
It's almost dead.

341
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,360
I'm a doctor.

342
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,240
I treat people,

343
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,520
not animals.

344
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,640
Besides, even veterinarians don't treat fish.

345
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,640
Look,

346
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,600
it's so beautiful.

347
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,460
It would be such a shame if it died.

348
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:12,880
Let me see.

349
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,680
Wait,

350
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,000
its gills are purplish-red.

351
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,520
It's been poisoned.

352
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,180
Where did this fish come from?

353
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,320
From the pond in the south garden.

354
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,560
Several have already died.

355
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,360
I think this is the only one that can still be saved.

356
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,360
The south garden?

357
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,960
Lord Baili has been silently protecting you for so many years.

358
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,400
Truly a father's love as vast as a mountain.

359
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,720
It's really enviable.

360
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,160
In the families of emperors and ministers,

361
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,440
they have everything,

362
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,040
but what they often lack most

363
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,720
is family affection.

364
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,700
The King of Jingnan and I were born from the same mother,

365
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,480
yet now we've become enemies,

366
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,560
fallen to this state.

367
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,240
I suppose it was inevitable.

368
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,320
I'm sorry.

369
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,640
I originally wanted to congratulate you,

370
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,840
but ended up saying such unlucky words.

371
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,640
Let's not talk about this.

372
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,240
Come,

373
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,840
let's drink while we can.

374
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,120
To prepare this kind of poison

375
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,040
you need an herb called Xianju.

376
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,960
You crush it with your hands

377
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,120
and mix it in,

378
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,050
which delays the poison's effect.

379
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,760
This herb itself isn't poisonous,

380
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,000
but it is corrosive.

381
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,220
Zeng Qian, don't drink it!

382
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,440
You drink first.

383
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,760
Your poison doesn't take effect immediately.

384
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,220
You have the antidote.

385
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,880
I might as well keep you company a while longer,

386
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,650
even until tomorrow if needed.

387
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,160
Is it because of this?

388
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,360
I did prepare poison

389
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,560
and put it in the wine,

390
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,560
but not in this jar.

391
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,320
Why did you change your mind?

392
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,240
I didn't expect it either.

393
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,040
Perhaps

394
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,360
I've been forced to do too many things against my will before.

395
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,440
This time,

396
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,760
I wanted to make my own decision.

397
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,960
Thank you for saving me that day at Yangjia Ridge,

398
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,690
allowing me to leave Dengzhou.

399
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,880
Unexpected.

400
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,880
You came just in time.

401
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,860
Good thing you're clever enough.

402
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,210
Fortunately the prince changed his mind.

403
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,090
Besides telling them what just happened,

404
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,580
there's one more thing

405
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,010
I need to tell you about.

406
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,440
What?

407
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,800
You promised the King of Jingnan to poison Bai Liyuan?

408
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,920
It was just a delaying tactic.

409
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,680
Besides,

410
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,520
you knew all along that Bai Liyuan is my father.

411
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,840
It was just the King of Jingnan's word,

412
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,300
I wasn't completely sure.

413
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,920
If it was a delaying tactic,

414
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,200
it means you had no intention of poisoning him.

415
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,930
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

416
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,080
The King of Jingnan is very clever.

417
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,400
He wouldn't place all his bets

418
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,960
on me alone.

419
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,360
He might have known from the beginning

420
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,880
that I wouldn't poison anyone.

421
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,960
So why would he still make this deal with me on the surface?

422
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,840
This means

423
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,880
I'm his obvious move,

424
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,360
while he has another hidden move in play.

425
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,520
Even if I fail

426
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,760
or change my mind,

427
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,370
his hidden piece might still succeed.

428
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,320
I came here to find this hidden move.

429
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,810
As for why I didn't tell you,

430
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,480
I was worried information might leak

431
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,540
and affect my plan.

432
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,400
Why are you so fixated on this hidden move?

433
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,730
I want to help Bai Liyuan

434
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,690
eliminate this potential threat around him.

435
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,880
Assuming you weren't Bai Liyuan's daughter,

436
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,160
why would he help us?

437
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,320
We're not related to him at all.

438
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,120
Unless

439
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,560
we help him first.

440
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,560
How did we not realize

441
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,240
that the prince is the King of Jingnan's hidden piece?

442
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,170
It's difficult.

443
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,320
After all, the falling out between the King of Jingnan and the prince was real.

444
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,600
Everything that happened at Yangjia Ridge

445
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,530
wasn't just an act for our benefit.

446
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:48,120
It's hard to understand why the prince would still help the King of Jingnan later.

447
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,280
This shows that for the King of Jingnan,

448
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,560
our obvious move

449
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,640
only needed to reach the point where Bai Liyuan and Zeng Qian recognize each other.

450
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,520
The rest

451
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,080
would be left to the prince to complete.

452
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,480
Then what's his purpose?

453
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,770
It must also be for that map.

454
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,730
Poisoning Zeng Qian

455
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,610
or poisoning Bai Liyuan

456
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,010
is actually the same thing.

457
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,640
Young master did this

458
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,320
also to get Bai Liyuan to save Zeng Xin.

459
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,210
Of course, that's not the only reason.

460
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,360
I have my own purpose too.

461
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,560
Didn't you ask before?

462
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,080
Many things clearly have nothing to do with me,

463
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,640
yet why am I so willing to help everyone?

464
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,600
See? See? See?

465
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,400
What did I tell you before?

466
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,320
You do have other motives.

467
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,960
When I was little, my father told me

468
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,360
there was a city that could cure my illness.

469
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,600
It was a city floating in the sky.

470
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,240
But as I grew older,

471
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,320
I increasingly felt it was just my father's way of comforting me,

472
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,200
a fabricated, elusive hope.

473
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,280
Until later in Dengzhou,

474
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,120
I saw the mirage.

475
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,240
I never dared to imagine the future before,

476
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,360
because I could leave this world at any moment.

477
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,120
The mirage showed me hope.

478
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,280
I realized my life still had a long way to go.

479
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,440
What exactly is in this mirage?

480
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,800
Are there really immortals living there?

481
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,920
Besides swapping souls for people,

482
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,450
it can also cure illnesses?

483
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,800
Young Master.

484
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,800
Why aren't you saying anything, Young Master?

485
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,280
Even I don't know about this.

486
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,880
This is just like my illness.

487
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,970
It's none of your business.

488
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,920
Telling you would only add to your worries.

489
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,320
You might think I deceived you

490
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,120
and used you.

491
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,760
But I sincerely wanted to help everyone.

492
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,680
I have never done anything

493
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,120
to harm any of you.

494
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,000
Everyone has secrets.

495
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,180
As long as our goals align,

496
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,840
secrets don't matter.

497
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:15,000
Haven't you said that before?

498
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,480
Yes,

499
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,260
is it wrong to say it twice?

500
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,800
The King of Jingnan's iron-armored creature

501
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,920
can control mirages.

502
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,640
If we can enter the mirage,

503
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,320
then

504
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,960
we can rescue Zeng Xin

505
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,200
and save Tongtong,

506
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,880
and also cure the young master's strange illness.

507
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,240
Our goals are indeed aligned.

508
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,410
Except for mine.

509
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,520
You promised to help me deal with the King of Jingnan.

510
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,850
We have to rebel anyway.

511
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,840
Zeng Qian.

512
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:45,960
I'm sorry.

513
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,200
I deceived you.

514
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,480
That sounds familiar.

515
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,040
Forget it.

516
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,960
We're even now.

517
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,820
Although we dismantled the King of Jingnan's hidden plot,

518
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,890
we were still used, weren't we?

519
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,840
It was mutual.

520
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,160
Besides seeking help from Lord Baili,

521
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,760
we have no other options now.

522
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,860
We had to come to Chenzhou anyway.

523
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,040
Zeng Qian,

524
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,960
about the Crown Prince poisoning you,

525
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,160
should we tell your father?

526
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,820
He didn't actually poison me.

527
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,840
He couldn't explain his actions to the King of Jingnan.

528
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,440
Besides,

529
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,320
if we drive him out of the Baili residence,

530
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,980
he'll have nowhere else to go.

531
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,210
Has Lao Ba's pigeon message

532
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,440
arrived yet?

533
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,400
No.

534
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,760
It seems Lao Ba can't make this move anymore.

535
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,440
But fortunately,

536
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,040
the game isn't over yet.

537
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,400
The fish aren't eating.

538
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,880
Who says they aren't?

539
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,170
You're just feeding them handful after handful.

540
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,340
Then I'll use this.

541
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,330
I'll pour it.

542
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:07,840
Fine.

543
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,060
Could you feed where the fish actually are, sis?

544
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:17,840
There are fish over there.

545
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,700
Are you trying to make the fish eat until they burst?

546
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,040
Now that's how a young lady should look.

547
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,679
Should we bow to you now?

548
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,250
You look beautiful.

549
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,929
Your father is here.

550
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,020
Greetings, Mr. Baili.

551
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,560
They're all Qian'er's friends.

552
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,960
No need for formalities.

553
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,320
Buhai,

554
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,889
you may rise as well.

555
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,290
I've heard a lot about your adventures from Qian'er.

556
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,440
Such brave heroes

557
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,920
with noble hearts.

558
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,120
Thanks to your help,

559
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,860
my daughter and I can reunite.

560
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,679
Thank you all.

561
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,960
Mr. Baili, you're too kind.

562
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,219
Zeng Qian has helped us with many things.

563
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,699
Listening to them talk now

564
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,840
is much more pleasant than when we first met.

565
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,360
It's only temporary.

566
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,680
Give it time,

567
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,680
and they'll show their true colors.

568
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,890
You are honored guests.

569
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,180
If you need anything in the house,

570
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,690
just tell the servants.

571
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,330
Everything is fine now.

572
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,220
Just don't make us eat those bitter cakes again.

573
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,620
It's all right.

574
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,400
You're straightforward.

575
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,000
I appreciate that about you.

576
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,840
Make yourselves at home.

577
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,970
I have official business to attend to.

578
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,580
I'll take my leave now.

579
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,360
You two may leave now.

580
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,600
Yes.

581
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,560
Let me tell you, Zeng Qian.

582
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,160
You're still being too polite.

583
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:49,960
You should just tell them,

584
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,600
'Leave'

585
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,720
and that's it.

586
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,400
Come.

587
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,280
Please.

588
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,080
Please.

589
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,480
Are you still not used to it?

590
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,360
Not really.

591
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,920
Especially wearing these clothes.

592
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,120
Does it look strange?

593
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,160
Yes, strange.

594
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,300
Strangely beautiful.

595
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,770
Although Master Xie is telling the truth,

596
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,240
why does it sound so uncomfortable?

597
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:15,720
Yes.

598
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,680
My way of speaking

599
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,200
is indeed not as good as Master Cao's.

600
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,320
What comfortable fabric!

601
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,330
I still prefer wearing my own clothes.

602
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,560
What happened to your neck?

603
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,020
Got bitten by mosquitoes.

604
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,920
I've always attracted mosquitoes since I was little.

605
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,680
They burn mugwort every day.

606
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,200
Don't they burn it in your room?

607
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,640
I'm not used to that smell.

608
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,170
So I didn't let them burn it.

609
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,400
After all these years,

610
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,960
you haven't been sucked dry by mosquitoes.

611
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,760
I'd say they've shown you mercy.

612
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,480
I remember once,

613
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,600
Axin, to keep me from getting bitten,

614
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,650
was tricked by someone.

615
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,400
He bought a worthless stone.

616
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,440
They told him

617
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:59,560
that the smoother he polished the stone, the better it would repel mosquitoes.

618
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,960
He actually believed it.

619
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,360
Then he secretly rubbed it all night,

620
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,720
until his hands were red and raw.

621
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,840
This Zeng Xin,

622
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,540
he's truly a good brother.

623
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,200
About Tongtong,

624
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,600
I'll talk to him about it.

625
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,640
Thank you.

626
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,120
Have you told him about Zeng Xin?

627
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,160
Not yet.

628
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,460
I haven't found the right moment.

629
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,880
What right moment?

630
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,760
Your father would give you the moon and stars right now.

631
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,160
Just tell him directly.

632
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,720
Are you afraid he won't help you find your brother?

633
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,480
Qian'er.

634
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,640
You're here.

635
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,400
Father,

636
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,370
why aren't you resting so late?

637
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,690
I'm used to staying up late.

638
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,780
What about you?

639
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,360
I know what you want to talk about.

640
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,020
Have a seat.

641
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,480
Your foster father raised you.

642
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:31,320
Zeng Xin is his only blood relative in this world.

643
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,200
You grew up together.

644
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,040
Though not related by blood,

645
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,920
you're as close as real siblings.

646
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,080
But I wasn't lying to you before.

647
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,040
He Xiguang's Halberd Fang cannot control the mirage.

648
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,360
Is there really no solution at all?

649
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,400
The Prince of Jingnan is in Dengzhou

650
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,800
with only a few hundred guards.

651
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,520
I understand what you mean.

652
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,960
But...

653
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,920
The Prince of Jingnan brought so few people

654
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,180
yet dares to stay in Dengzhou for so long.

655
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,920
Don't you find that strange?

656
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,920
I heard from Cao Sheng

657
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,940
that the Prince of Jingnan

658
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,820
has his so-called trump card.

659
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,480
In Dengzhou,

660
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,240
there are nearly 200 people from beyond.

661
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,660
They cannot leave that place yet.

662
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,960
If the Prince of Jingnan detects any unusual move from me,

663
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:27,000
he will certainly use those people's lives to threaten me.

664
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:28,840
Of course.

665
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:33,040
Sacrificing merely 200 people to eliminate the Prince of Jingnan

666
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,820
would theoretically be worthwhile.

667
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,880
The reason I don't do this

668
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,060
is not because I care about these people,

669
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,220
but because I worry

670
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,760
it would offend those from beyond who have not yet arrived.

671
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,840
They can use the mirage

672
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,370
to connect with the eyes of all outsiders here

673
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,680
and see what happens in our world.

674
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,520
As long as the Prince of Jingnan controls the mirage to Dengzhou

675
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,480
and presents those 200 hostages,

676
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,920
I would hesitate to take action.

677
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,680
Those who can come here from beyond

678
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,120
are all influential figures

679
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,360
in their world.

680
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,920
If I simply eliminate the Prince of Jingnan

681
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,400
with disregard for their lives,

682
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:22,760
it would certainly dishearten other outsiders.

683
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,240
The cooperation between us

684
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,570
would immediately end.

685
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,400
Then everything I've done before would be in vain.

686
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,500
Your ambition is grand

687
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,680
and admirable.

688
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,760
But what you've done

689
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,170
I cannot agree with.

690
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,320
Feng Buhai said something similar.

691
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,720
I understand the difficult situation you're in now.

692
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,840
You are my daughter.

693
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,040
Feng Buhai is my trusted officer and beloved general.

694
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,720
I really want to help you,

695
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,090
but there's truly no perfect solution right now.

696
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:05,640
Qian'er.

697
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,880
Give me a little more time.

698
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,400
But the Prince of Jingnan will leave Dengzhou in less than 7 days.

699
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,760
I may not have time left.

700
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,490
But thank you for being honest with me.

701
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,920
I know with your temperament, it's hard to believe what I say.

702
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,360
You might leave the Baili residence right now

703
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,080
and confront the Prince of Jingnan at all costs.

704
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:27,920
But doing so

705
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,490
would be like an ant trying to shake a tree.

706
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,080
I'm tired, Father.

707
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,080
I'll go rest now.

708
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,520
Judging by her expression just now,

709
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,680
your conversation

710
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:13,520
didn't go well.

711
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,440
I think

712
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,490
I can't keep my daughter here anymore.

713
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,420
You should tell her the truth.

714
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,760
Some things

715
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,610
can only be let go when all hope is lost.

716
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,480
What I say,

717
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,090
she may not believe.

718
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,240
It would be the same if I told her.

719
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,920
But Tongtong can.

720
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,340
The things you wanted are inside.

721
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,600
The rabbit is here.

722
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,770
When will you release the hawk?

723
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,850
From the looks of it,

724
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,090
that wolf you're trying to trap

725
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,760
won't be easy to deal with.

726
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,200
It's not as serious as you think.

727
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,240
Baili Yuan

728
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,770
wants Zeng Qian to know some things

729
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,920
and has asked you to tell her.

730
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,720
How much should I tell?

731
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,450
Everything.

732
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,720
Tell the truth.
