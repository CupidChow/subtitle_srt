1
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,380
Thanks.

2
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,240
Sir.

3
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,409
This happened so suddenly.

4
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,440
This secluded residence

5
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,720
is a bit modest,

6
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,120
I apologize for the inconvenience.

7
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,080
I'll arrange for someone

8
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,120
to renovate it properly for you,

9
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,240
making it grand and impressive.

10
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,720
So you can have

11
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,820
dignity in the afterlife.

12
00:00:59,120 --> 00:00:59,920
Young master.

13
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,080
Young master.

14
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,480
Your cry for help came at quite the perfect time.

15
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,320
I saw Your Majesty in danger

16
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,920
and blurted out in panic,

17
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,800
revealing your identity.

18
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,560
Please punish me.

19
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,120
Rise.

20
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,360
I know your filial devotion.

21
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,320
How could I punish you?

22
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,860
Thank you, Father.

23
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,200
You let them

24
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,520
go free?

25
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,560
Father is kind-hearted

26
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,600
and values all life.

27
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,200
Therefore,

28
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,000
I took the liberty to act.

29
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,880
You certainly know how to think on my behalf.

30
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,720
I dare to presume Your Majesty's intention

31
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,579
and I am guilty.

32
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,640
Enough.

33
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,920
You're always so fearful.

34
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,720
My rejuvenation

35
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,440
will soon be announced to the world.

36
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,079
Everyone will know then,

37
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,560
and it won't be a secret anymore.

38
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,120
Letting them know a few days earlier

39
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,720
doesn't matter.

40
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,320
Father, you are wise.

41
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,360
You may leave now.

42
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,920
I heard before that the Emperor was very old.

43
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,840
Gravely ill

44
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,500
and bedridden for a long time.

45
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,840
Now it seems

46
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,760
some kind of sorcery was used

47
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,440
to transfer his soul into Zeng Xin's body.

48
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,320
Immortality,

49
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,320
rejuvenation,

50
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,000
these are what every emperor dreams of.

51
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,800
Remember that ritual drawing in the files?

52
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,940
Many people forming a circle.

53
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,560
Someone is sitting cross-legged in the middle.

54
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,090
We were wondering why Zeng Xin was so special.

55
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,260
Now it's clear.

56
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,240
Everything makes sense.

57
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,760
The one sitting in the middle is Zeng Xin.

58
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,400
And those surrounding him are the missing people.

59
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,040
So,

60
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,240
that flying city

61
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,160
must be where they perform their ritual ceremonies.

62
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,320
Many supernatural books have mentioned this.

63
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,760
Some demons, to enhance their powers,

64
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,240
feed on human essence.

65
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,159
If the Emperor wants to possess Zeng Xin's body,

66
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,520
then one person's essence wouldn't be enough.

67
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,640
That's why he captured so many people.

68
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,200
And those people, like sacrifices,

69
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,730
had their essence drained,

70
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,680
which is why they developed soul-loss syndrome.

71
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,880
Don't you recognize me?

72
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,920
I'm your father!

73
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,740
What's wrong with you?

74
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,090
Don't you recognize me?

75
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,640
The Zeng Xin in the Taoist temple

76
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,970
has been the Emperor all along.

77
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,080
That day we suddenly broke in and took him away.

78
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,320
For self-preservation,

79
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,380
he had to imitate those with amnesia,

80
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,880
pretending to be the clueless Zeng Xin.

81
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,760
But didn't you say

82
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,120
that the young leader held Zeng Xin at swordpoint?

83
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,440
Isn't that like the crown prince holding the emperor hostage?

84
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,370
That must have been an act performed in desperation.

85
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,400
Let me go.

86
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,600
So you're saying

87
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,520
all the strange events in Dengzhou lately...

88
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,960
It's all because the Emperor wanted to reverse his aging.

89
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,720
What about the previous two times?

90
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,000
The one at Gaomeng Lake 23 years ago and the Huo River 4 years ago.

91
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,360
Something like this happened 23 years ago.

92
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,040
The southwestern tribes invaded.

93
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,480
The Emperor led the army himself.

94
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,960
He was unexpectedly captured.

95
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,680
Although he was later rescued,

96
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,200
he was severely wounded.

97
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,659
His fever wouldn't break.

98
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,159
The Crown Prince was still young then.

99
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,680
A young ruler brings uncertainty to the nation.

100
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,280
The atmosphere throughout the capital was extremely tense.

101
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,560
But not long after,

102
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,680
in June of that year,

103
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,640
the Emperor suddenly announced to the world

104
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,900
that he had recovered by heaven's grace,

105
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,120
which finally put people's minds at ease.

106
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,040
The mirage at Gaomeng Lake appeared in May that year.

107
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,080
One month later,

108
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,360
the Emperor went from danger to safety.

109
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,800
You mean

110
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,440
there's a connection between these two events?

111
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,640
What else could it be?

112
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,120
What about that time at Hu River?

113
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,650
That year, apart from the Battle of Wusiling,

114
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,690
there weren't any other major events, right?

115
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,960
The reason the Battle of Wusiling happened

116
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,720
was because the Emperor's health was deteriorating.

117
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,240
He wanted to recapture the capital before his death,

118
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,200
so he fought the rebels at any cost.

119
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,340
There's a possibility

120
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,920
that the purpose of the mirage back then and this time in Dengzhou

121
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,920
are the same.

122
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,560
So you're saying

123
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,140
he already attempted rejuvenation four years ago?

124
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,140
He must not have succeeded that time.

125
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,240
The Gaomeng Lake incident 23 years ago and this time in Dengzhou

126
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,370
both had nearly 200 people disappear.

127
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,280
If we assume these people were sacrifices to provide essence.

128
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,040
Then the place where the mirage appeared four years ago

129
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,500
happened to be where the rebels were hiding,

130
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,640
Sunset Valley.

131
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,160
If nothing unexpected had happened,

132
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,160
many of them would have been taken as sacrifices too.

133
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,820
But something unexpected did happen that time.

134
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,120
My master took me to Sunset Valley.

135
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,680
I saw that city floating in the air.

136
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,300
As well as thousands of rebels below,

137
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,800
they all died unnatural deaths.

138
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,800
My master told me

139
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,440
he poisoned the spring water they drank.

140
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,080
My father killed thousands of rebels that time

141
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,800
to prevent the Emperor from regaining his youth.

142
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,840
This time he diverted water to flood Dengzhou City,

143
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,570
probably for the same purpose.

144
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,720
However,

145
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,240
he didn't succeed.

146
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,680
The Emperor did.

147
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,440
The entire plan was devised by the master.

148
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,440
The gunpowder has been placed at the tunnel entrance connecting to the canal.

149
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,040
Once we blow up this connection point,

150
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,680
the water will come gushing out

151
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,160
and flood the entire Dengzhou City.

152
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,800
By then, the citizens in the city

153
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,120
should all be sound asleep.

154
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,050
This will ensure

155
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,120
that no one is left behind

156
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,370
and no one survives.

157
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,160
Cao Zhong

158
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,490
has failed his master's trust.

159
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,920
You'll be the one who ruins the entire plan.

160
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,770
So now the truth has finally come to light.

161
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,780
There are several things I still don't understand.

162
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,800
If that iron-armored man is supposedly a divine sorcerer

163
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,330
with supernatural powers,

164
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,840
why would he repeatedly help the Emperor?

165
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,920
With his abilities, he could get anything he wants.

166
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,920
There's no need to help the Emperor.

167
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:52,840
Moreover,

168
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,600
if he can control that city,

169
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,000
and he's now in Dengzhou,

170
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,040
then where is that city?

171
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:00,880
Secondly,

172
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,720
if all the missing people became sacrifices

173
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,960
and suffered soul-loss syndrome from having their essence extracted,

174
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,690
why would the iron-armored man want to kill them?

175
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,400
If the iron-armored man wanted to kill them,

176
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,000
why would he let them return?

177
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,760
Logically, these people pose no threat

178
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,400
to either him or the Emperor.

179
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,200
Furthermore,

180
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,200
why is Zeng Xin so special?

181
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,360
With nearly 20,000 people in Dengzhou,

182
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,620
why did the Emperor specifically choose him as his vessel?

183
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,020
If Zeng Xin's body contains the Emperor's soul,

184
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,370
Where did Zeng Xin's original soul go?

185
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,290
My father told me before he died

186
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,440
that because I prevented him from flooding Dengzhou City

187
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,900
I caused a great disaster.

188
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,080
Sometimes killing people is to save others.

189
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,240
Sometimes saving people actually harms them.

190
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,520
Cao Sheng, oh Cao Sheng.

191
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,880
You've caused a terrible disaster.

192
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,410
What exactly is this disaster?

193
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,640
If it's merely because

194
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,770
I failed to stop the Emperor from rejuvenating himself.

195
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,380
What could possibly go wrong?

196
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:27,800
Sister.

197
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,100
Sister.

198
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,280
Sister,

199
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:32,840
dinner is ready.

200
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,680
Come home and eat.

201
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,200
Okay.

202
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,060
Sister,

203
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,010
what happened to your face?

204
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,920
A bee stung me.

205
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,440
What about your neck?

206
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,360
Mosquito bites.

207
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,690
Where did they bite you?

208
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,640
I'll avenge you.

209
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,920
Axin.

210
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,040
Sister.

211
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,280
Sis,

212
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,760
I couldn't catch the mosquito,

213
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,890
but I caught the bee.

214
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,060
Is this the one?

215
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,600
Let me take a look.

216
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,280
It's fine.

217
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,010
Just apply some medicine when we get back.

218
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:15,940
Sister,

219
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,720
did you shake your head because

220
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,160
that's not the bee that stung you?

221
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,160
But I caught it right over there.

222
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,080
Axin,

223
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,480
a bee

224
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,760
can only sting once,

225
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,420
because it dies after stinging someone.

226
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,440
Right.

227
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,490
I was told that by my father.

228
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,360
Now I'm just like you.

229
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,120
When we go back, people won't just make fun of you anymore.

230
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,920
Let's go home for dinner.

231
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,120
Many people now

232
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,880
criticize me behind my back,

233
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,440
saying like father, like son.

234
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,120
Tang has become what he is today

235
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,880
because he's just following my example.

236
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,560
If you show your divine power

237
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,440
and bring my Tang back safely,

238
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,920
I, your unworthy descendant Xie Kui, will govern diligently,

239
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,200
fulfill my duties,

240
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,840
do more for the common people,

241
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,960
and discipline Tang strictly.

242
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:45,680
God.

243
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,240
You've finished your medicine.

244
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,960
You should recover faster now.

245
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,840
You just said

246
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,640
you analyzed those files and manuscripts

247
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,600
and figured out what happened.

248
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,960
But for me,

249
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,890
that doesn't seem helpful.

250
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,880
I just want to know

251
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,560
where Axin's soul has gone

252
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,890
and if we can get it back.

253
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,480
We'll find a way.

254
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,120
Axin has grown up

255
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,600
never leaving my side.

256
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,480
He was born with a fever

257
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,440
and after recovering,

258
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,060
he was left with chronic illness.

259
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,840
Even now,

260
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,570
his mind is like that of a seven or eight-year-old child.

261
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,920
But he's very sensible

262
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,760
and physically strong.

263
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,490
He's never caused any trouble for our family.

264
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,860
After father passed away,

265
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,560
it was just the two of us

266
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,080
depending on each other to survive.

267
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,760
You know,

268
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,640
it's not easy for a girl to make her way in the world.

269
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,600
Whenever I faced harsh words,

270
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,600
Axin would immediately stand up for me.

271
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,880
At those moments,

272
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,800
I always felt

273
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,680
he was like a real man.

274
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,290
And when he's by my side,

275
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,560
he's gentle

276
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,960
and thoughtful.

277
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,120
Father told me before he died

278
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,600
that he worried Axin would become my burden.

279
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,840
But now I see

280
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,890
I'm the one who can't leave him.

281
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,650
We need to go back to the temple.

282
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,200
The one who tied the knot must untie it.

283
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,880
The Emperor has taken over Axin's body.

284
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,000
To get Axin back,

285
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,960
we need to deal with the Emperor.

286
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,450
But that's the Emperor.

287
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,610
With hundreds of imperial guards.

288
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,120
Last time we managed to get in and rescue someone

289
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,240
was mostly luck.

290
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,330
It's impossible to get in there

291
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,640
this time.

292
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,320
But the Emperor could leave Dengzhou at any moment.

293
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,040
Once he returns to the capital,

294
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,920
we'll have even less chance.

295
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:53,250
Forcing your way into the Taoist temple would be like throwing eggs at a stone.

296
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,120
If something happens to you,

297
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,520
Zeng Xin will never return.

298
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,800
Young Master.

299
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,280
You may have convinced Zeng Qian for now,

300
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,760
but what if

301
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,880
one day she becomes desperate

302
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,120
and goes to the temple alone?

303
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,130
That would be terrible.

304
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,480
Do you want me to keep an eye on her?

305
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,540
Is that necessary?

306
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,920
If she really wants to go,

307
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,320
who can stop her?

308
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,240
Since we've already confirmed

309
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,680
that she's not the girl from back then,

310
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,840
do we really need to help her like this?

311
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,880
I know it sounds selfish,

312
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,360
but young master,

313
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,090
I'm worried about your safety.

314
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,800
Or is it that

315
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,320
you still believe

316
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,620
Zeng Qian is that girl from back then?

317
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,690
Why did my father strongly oppose the Emperor's rejuvenation?

318
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,660
Don't you think my father kept many secrets?

319
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,640
To uncover the truth,

320
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,060
we need to start with the Emperor.

321
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,480
Helping Zeng Qian

322
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,370
is also helping ourselves.

323
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,080
By the way, young master,

324
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,410
there's one more thing.

325
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,120
When Feng Buhai came to the inn that day,

326
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,360
you said he had something to tell Zeng Qian,

327
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,920
but he never got to say it.

328
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,440
What was it about?

329
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,400
Was he going to tell her about being Ye Xie?

330
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,400
What grudge is there between them?

331
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,280
It's not a grudge,

332
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,760
just past events.

333
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,240
How do you know?

334
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,260
Feng Buhai told me.

335
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,320
So it's still here.

336
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,920
That day when the Crown Prince's men came to take those files,

337
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,780
they turned the room upside down.

338
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,360
When I was cleaning up later,

339
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,560
I couldn't find the master's manuscript.

340
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,690
I never expected...

341
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,240
Corrupt official!

342
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,120
Deserved to die!

343
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,000
It's karma!

344
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,520
You finally got what you deserve!

345
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,720
Dig him up and whip his corpse!

346
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,780
Corrupt official!

347
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,440
Smash!

348
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,880
What are you doing?

349
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,080
What's going on here?

350
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,160
Stop it!

351
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,800
Stop!

352
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,200
Murderer!

353
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,800
Murderer!

354
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,560
Quack!

355
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:29,960
Beat him!

356
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,890
He has no regard for human life!

357
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,520
Who are you?

358
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,040
Looking for trouble?

359
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:43,210
Go quickly! Go quickly!

360
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,800
You must be hungry.

361
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:21,720
Here.

362
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,320
Thank you.

363
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,000
Tongtong.

364
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,280
You saved me

365
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,360
for this, didn't you?

366
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,820
Everything has a purpose.

367
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,500
Who cares about me now?

368
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,860
Now that my father is gone,

369
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,440
I'm really nothing.

370
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,880
But just now,

371
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,680
I was touched for a moment.

372
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,160
Tongtong.

373
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,560
What's wrong?

374
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,200
Hurry up.

375
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,000
Wait.

376
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,040
Take this.

377
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:22,570
Okay.

378
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,320
What's all that noise, Guanying?

379
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,040
Nothing.

380
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,650
Just two cats fighting.

381
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,800
Who are you?

382
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,360
So you're Xie Jingtang?

383
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,860
You know about me too, auntie?

384
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,640
I'm really...

385
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,680
Notorious.

386
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,120
I've heard quite a bit about you.

387
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,960
Surely nothing good.

388
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,120
I've done too many bad things.

389
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,180
I don't blame them.

390
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,040
Karma.

391
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,450
This is all my retribution.

392
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,240
Auntie.

393
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,530
This garlic of yours...

394
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,720
It's gone bad.

395
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:27,920
It's fine.

396
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,330
You can still eat it after removing the bad parts.

397
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,240
When people know they've done wrong,

398
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,000
They're not completely rotten.

399
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
There's still hope for redemption.

400
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,850
What are you doing here?

401
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,200
Young lady.

402
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,720
It's you again.

403
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,760
You want vegetable buns?

404
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,020
I'll make some for you.

405
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,800
No need, Aunt Ji.

406
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,960
I came today to...

407
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,880
I came to...

408
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,880
Ask how you made those wedding pastries last time.

409
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,600
Didn't I tell you?

410
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,840
I brought those back from a banquet.

411
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,320
If you want to learn,

412
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,680
I can teach you.

413
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,330
That would be great.

414
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,760
Here, auntie.

415
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,320
Careful.

416
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,800
You're here for Feng Buhai, aren't you?

417
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,600
He's not home.

418
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,840
The family heirloom just lit up.

419
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,300
He ran away with Tongtong.

420
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,480
Are you all right?

421
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,680
Not a scratch on me.

422
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,810
Obviously I'm fine.

423
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,240
Looks like my family heirloom really works.

424
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:56,840
Tongtong.

425
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,020
Come inside first.

426
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,520
What just happened?

427
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,000
Why did we have to run?

428
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,920
I'll tell you next time.

429
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,000
Let's go back first.

430
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,520
You always say that.

431
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,280
When exactly is 'next time'?

432
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,960
I just saw the Iron Man.

433
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,000
Wasn't he invisible?

434
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,720
Or can't he turn invisible whenever he wants?

435
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,050
Are there limitations?

436
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,080
How did you get away from him?

437
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,530
I was riding a horse.

438
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,810
As I was running,

439
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,800
the light on the family heirloom disappeared.

440
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,900
Here, take it back.

441
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,640
What did you want to see me about?

442
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,280
You can dodge it now,

443
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,520
but you can't escape it forever.

444
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,760
I want to deal with the Iron Man

445
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,690
once and for all.

446
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,080
Aren't you being a bit unrealistic?

447
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,560
Your goal is to rescue Zeng Xin, right?

448
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,360
Yes.

449
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,960
Logically, I should go to the Emperor.

450
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,600
But it's impossible for us to enter the Taoist temple again now.

451
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,200
So starting with the Iron Man is also an option.

452
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,440
First, it can solve many mysteries.

453
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,560
Maybe there's a way to find Zeng Xin.

454
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,100
After all, the Iron Man knows quite a lot.

455
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,360
Second, we can eliminate

456
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,490
his threat to Tongtong and the others.

457
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:11,880
No.

458
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,800
What's wrong?

459
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,320
You're wrong.

460
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,240
I asked you before.

461
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,220
Why do you keep helping Zeng Qian?

462
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,860
Now you're even risking your life against the Iron Man for her.

463
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,720
Is it really just for her?

464
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,420
Think about what's happened these days.

465
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,800
I'm here to find Little One-Eye.

466
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,040
He's here to save his daughter.

467
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,120
Zeng Qian is here to save her brother.

468
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,800
But what about you?

469
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,200
It feels like you've been helping us

470
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,060
and putting yourself on the line.

471
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,560
I'm saying, aren't you being a bit

472
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,800
too nice?

473
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,930
Do you have some other purpose?

474
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,380
Don't you think so?

475
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,920
Everyone has secrets.

476
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,640
But as long as we share the same goal,

477
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,960
sometimes secrets don't matter that much.

478
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:56,840
Smart guy.

479
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,840
Fine.

480
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,920
If none of you care,

481
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,650
then I certainly don't either.

482
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,000
Anyway,

483
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,760
I have nothing left to lose now.

484
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,240
Alright, let's talk about what just happened.

485
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,240
You said you want to deal with the Iron Man,

486
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,560
but he's so powerful.

487
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,200
How can you possibly defeat him?

488
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,640
Besides, where would you even find him?

489
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,100
He'll come looking for us.

490
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,680
However,

491
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,040
you want to use Tongtong as bait.

492
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,040
No way.

493
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,080
I can guarantee her safety.

494
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:27,880
How can you guarantee that?

495
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,280
Didn't you just manage to escape?

496
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,120
That was just luck.

497
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,720
Please trust me.

498
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,240
Why should I trust you?

499
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:40,760
Wait.

500
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,560
So according to you,

501
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,400
anyone who returns from disappearing can be used as bait?

502
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,800
Why must we use Tongtong?

503
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,660
Can't we use someone else?

504
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,600
But isn't this plan a bit cruel?

505
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,700
Aunt Ji just said there was still hope for me.

506
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:58,960
You're right.

507
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,810
What right do we have to make others take risks for us?

508
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,260
Let's still use Tongtong.

509
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,320
Judging from what happened to those people at Gaomengdian,

510
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,720
no matter where they run,

511
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,410
the Iron Man will find them.

512
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,820
Even if Tongtong isn't the bait here,

513
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,080
she would be somewhere else.

514
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,200
Don't let that fire get too strong,

515
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,120
or it'll burn.

516
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,640
Alright, ma'am.

517
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,680
Ma'am.

518
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,880
This child of yours.

519
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,200
You two.

520
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,240
Mrs. Ji, is this okay?

521
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,000
This scene feels familiar.

522
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,440
I'm learning to make pancakes from Mrs. Ji.

523
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,760
I didn't touch any of your things.

524
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,720
Guanying.

525
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:43,560
Mom.

526
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,320
We have many guests at home today.

527
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,720
Please help entertain them.

528
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,520
Got it.

529
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,860
By the way, Mom,

530
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,600
our roof is damaged,

531
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,130
we might need to stay elsewhere for a few days.

532
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,480
Mother, watch your step.

533
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,520
Mother, take it slow.

534
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,680
Here, careful now.

535
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,240
Mom,

536
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,810
you and Tongtong can stay here for now.

537
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,400
Guanying,

538
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,520
don't forget to thank Young Master Xie

539
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,760
for the trouble we've caused him.

540
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,400
Sure.

541
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,400
Don't worry, Mom,

542
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,810
I'll go fix the roof now.

543
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,280
Boss.

544
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,650
How does it look?

545
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,120
I didn't spend much,

546
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,360
but got everything restored exactly as it was before.

547
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,580
It's good, looks nice.

548
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,730
Who did the work?

549
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,010
Someone called Bao,

550
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,400
do you want to check the accounts?

551
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:42,920
No need,

552
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,600
whatever it costs is fine.

553
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,320
Alright.

554
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,520
Weren't you all

555
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,560
supposed to be preparing things to deal with the Iron Monster?

556
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,520
Why are you still here?

557
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,180
We're waiting for Feng Buhai.

558
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,090
How is Zeng Qian?

559
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,680
Is she still feeling down?

560
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,940
Let her recover first.

561
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,360
I've examined her wound.

562
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,000
The stab isn't deep.

563
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,560
It didn't hit any vital organs.

564
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,160
She should be fine after taking this medicine.

565
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,560
In critical moments,

566
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,440
we still need Dr. Xie.

567
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,160
If only everyone thought like you.

568
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,960
Should we take Tongtong with us?

569
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,880
Leaving her at the inn,

570
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,400
I'm not very comfortable with that.

571
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,600
What are you worried about?

572
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,680
I'm here.

573
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,400
As soon as there's a small light on the family heirloom,

574
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,560
I'll take her and run immediately.

575
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,760
Let me tell you, I'm really fast on horseback.

576
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:32,040
I just haven't used this skill for good purposes before.

577
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,520
Didn't Aunt Ji already say so?

578
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,780
You can still be saved.

579
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,020
Be careful, everyone.

580
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,400
Daozi,

581
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,940
take a table upstairs.

582
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:44,800
Got it.

583
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,520
From now on,

584
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,330
don't do anything else.

585
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,080
Keep your eyes fixed on it.

586
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,600
As soon as you see any small light appear,

587
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,060
shout for me immediately.

588
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:56,800
Got that?

589
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,360
Watch it, not me!

590
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,440
What if I need to use the toilet?

591
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,240
Hold it.

592
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,520
If you can't hold it,

593
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,680
have someone take your place.

594
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,140
Keep watching carefully.

595
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:17,840
Come in.

596
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,130
Take your medicine.

597
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,600
This medicine might be a bit bitter.

598
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:33,920
This...

599
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,240
What's wrong?

600
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,040
This bowl is Lin Han's.

601
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,160
But it's fine if you drink it.

602
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,620
It's good for your health.

603
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,080
Where are Cao Sheng and the others?

604
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,480
They're working on a solution.

605
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,210
Don't worry.

606
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,639
Why is my door open?

607
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,889
Didn't you say you couldn't find my sword?

608
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,239
Why is it in your room?

609
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:28,840
If I tell you that

610
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,540
I know nothing about this,

611
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:31,840
would you believe me?

612
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,730
Actually, I found it for you back then.

613
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,719
But you weren't fully recovered yet,

614
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:39,560
and I was afraid you'd take the sword to fight that armored monster again.

615
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:40,719
So I decided to

616
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,570
hide it from you.

617
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,690
Why do you always like to scare people?

618
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,520
Tongtong, what would you like to eat tonight?

619
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,800
I don't know.

620
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,800
It's so boring here.

621
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,800
We'll go home once your father fixes the roof.

622
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,040
Ma'am,

623
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,000
let me help you.

624
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,220
Thank you, young lady.

625
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,440
You're so kind.

626
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,800
Didn't I tell you already?

627
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,930
Use less gunpowder.

628
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,880
Go find me some flints,

629
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,840
the more the better.

630
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,480
Flints?

631
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,610
What do you need flints for?

632
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,480
What happens when flints strike together?

633
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,480
They make sparks.

634
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,730
And what about sparks plus gunpowder?

635
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,580
Did you bring the silver needles?

636
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:09,840
Young master,

637
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,360
let me do it when the time comes.

638
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,290
You shouldn't handle the needles.

639
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,720
I made the mechanism.

640
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,780
You don't know how to control it well.

641
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,280
We can't have a repeat of last time

642
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,680
when you fell asleep at the crucial moment.

643
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,320
You need this many again?

644
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:46,840
Miss,

645
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,280
our boss is asking

646
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,210
if you'd consider buying our shop.

647
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,080
Think about it.

648
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,320
What are these leaves for?

649
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,720
If he becomes invisible,

650
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,980
this way we can see him.

651
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,850
Did you learn this at Tabai too?

652
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,560
No,

653
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,410
it's common knowledge.

654
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,640
How do we know

655
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,370
when the Iron Man will come?

656
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,060
What if he doesn't show up?

657
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,040
We wait.

658
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,120
At least we have food and drink here.

659
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:58,600
As long as his goal is to kill those who returned after disappearing,

660
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,130
he'll come sooner or later.

661
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,000
That's true.

662
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,600
I asked the county office today.

663
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,880
Eight people have already died in Dengzhou.

664
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,880
At this rate,

665
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,360
he'll be coming for us in just a few days.

666
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,080
At this pace,

667
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,200
others will soon discover something fishy about this.

668
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,520
When that happens, to save their lives,

669
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,320
they'll definitely try to flee.

670
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,490
Though running won't do them any good.

671
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,160
Why didn't your young master

672
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,040
ask Zeng Qian to come help?

673
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
He didn't ask Lin Han to help either.

674
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:35,960
That's true.

675
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,770
Two injured people.

676
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,010
Lin Han is no ordinary injured person.

677
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,320
They say

678
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,080
when she was a Tabai agent,

679
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,840
she buried herself in sand for two days and nights,

680
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,720
waiting for the rebels to pass by.

681
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,200
Then suddenly, she sprang out.

682
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,760
She leaped out from the sand

683
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,330
and killed the rebel leader in one strike.

684
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,080
She's so fierce.

685
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,050
But now she's focused on avenging her master.

686
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,880
If she decides to fight the Iron Warrior to the death,

687
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,410
we won't be able to stop her.

688
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,560
Enough about Lin Han.

689
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,400
For her brother's sake,

690
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,920
Zeng Qian would do anything too.

691
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,850
I'm telling you,

692
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,160
it's right not to ask those two for help.

693
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,720
So why are you here?

694
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,330
I need to keep an eye on my family heirloom.

695
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,200
Yunniang, stop!

696
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,000
Retreat now!

697
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:04,720
You go first.

698
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,920
Don't worry about me.

699
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:31,640
