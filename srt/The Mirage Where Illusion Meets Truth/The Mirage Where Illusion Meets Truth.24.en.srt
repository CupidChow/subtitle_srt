1
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,960
The King of Jingnan has disappeared

2
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,850
and we can't continue negotiations with him.

3
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,680
I hope the captured outsider

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,520
is safe and sound.

5
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:24,560
Sir.

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,840
As the King of Jingnan said,

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,720
the people from our place

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,280
can only see what we see here.

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,700
But they can't hear any sound.

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,520
And when you speak, sir,

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,840
if I don't look at you,

12
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,080
your lip movements

13
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,610
won't appear in their view.

14
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,280
They have no idea

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,140
what's actually happening here.

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,970
What they should know, I'll let them know.

17
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,620
What they shouldn't know,

18
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,320
I certainly

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,240
won't reveal even the slightest bit.

20
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,160
So, sir,

21
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,820
there's no need to be so cautious.

22
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,240
Please speak freely.

23
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,640
Your people

24
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,920
must be focusing on what's happening in the cave now.

25
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,520
They probably won't recognize Feixing and Xianyun, right?

26
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,580
Shenjing has never been to Chenzhou.

27
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,360
They

28
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,920
won't know Feixing and Xianyun are your people.

29
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,650
Anyone who wants to start a fire

30
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,280
in their eyes

31
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,880
is the King of Jingnan's man.

32
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,039
I

33
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,130
shall take my leave now.

34
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,220
Don't you want to see the outcome?

35
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,760
They are still my countrymen after all.

36
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,440
I understand.

37
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,170
But for all these years,

38
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,440
your people have always been hesitant

39
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,370
and indecisive.

40
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:33,560
Only by making them watch these 200 people die

41
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,440
will they strengthen their resolve

42
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,000
and hasten their arrival.

43
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,480
Although the monsters still exist now,

44
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,880
we have the transformation vessel,

45
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,280
and finding the ore is just a matter of time.

46
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,680
In the future,

47
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,720
this will be a promising situation.

48
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,540
I'm not doing this for myself,

49
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,880
but for all of you

50
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,640
and for the world.

51
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,080
I hope

52
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,850
that when your new world comes,

53
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,800
we will truly be part of it.

54
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,440
Here.

55
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:47,960
Take this.

56
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,400
Those wires are disconnected.

57
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,130
The medical bed isn't working.

58
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,560
I can't stop what I'm doing.

59
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,920
Reconnect the wires quickly.

60
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,440
How?

61
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,100
I'll show you the diagram.

62
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,360
Follow the diagram.

63
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,720
You absolutely cannot make a mistake.

64
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,040
If even one wire is wrong,

65
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,720
the medical bed will be damaged,

66
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,920
and Xie Jingtang will be beyond saving.

67
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,159
Orange white orange.

68
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:33,340
So this is the best swordsman of the Divine Machine Battalion.

69
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,690
Boring. Boring.

70
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,360
So boring.

71
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,260
How's it going?

72
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,800
I can't see clearly anymore.

73
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,610
The diagram is gone.

74
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,500
Your screen can't display the diagram anymore.

75
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,060
What should we do then?

76
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,120
Did you memorize it earlier?

77
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,560
Connect according to the diagram.

78
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,080
You absolutely cannot make a mistake.

79
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,360
If you connect even one wire wrong,

80
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,840
the medical bed will be damaged.

81
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,570
Xie Jingtang is beyond saving.

82
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,800
Too slow. Too slow. Too slow.

83
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:42,920
Too slow.

84
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,580
You can't even hold the knife steady.

85
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,000
It's a complete mess.

86
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,320
I want you to remember

87
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,720
that your life

88
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,810
is more important than anything else.

89
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,040
Young master,

90
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,120
I can't obey you this time.

91
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,080
You want to do something within your power

92
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,410
to help Feng Buhai find the real Tongtong.

93
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,480
I guess it's a kind of atonement.

94
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,720
All these years,

95
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,320
I've never done anything that I truly wanted to do.

96
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,800
It's rare to have something now.

97
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,880
I think

98
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,840
it's good.

99
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,420
Many people after taking off their armor

100
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,880
will recall scenes from the battlefield.

101
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,680
I suppose you're the same, aren't you?

102
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,400
Sometimes

103
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,720
I feel afraid.

104
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:17,800
Perhaps

105
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,400
you're just feeling nostalgic.

106
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,359
Maybe

107
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:24,010
it's nostalgia.

108
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,760
It's longing.

109
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,240
Missing the past.

110
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,280
Too slow.

111
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,760
A complete mess.

112
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,520
The terrain is too complex.

113
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,440
Anyone inside would definitely get lost.

114
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,960
No matter how complex something is,

115
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,720
in your eyes, it's just a picture.

116
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,120
When you look at it once,

117
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,680
that picture is already in your mind.

118
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,960
What you need to do is

119
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,020
figure out how to retrieve this picture from your mind.

120
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,610
Focus your will undivided,

121
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,440
concentrate your spirit,

122
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,760
and it will naturally appear.

123
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,840
Focus your mind,

124
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,120
concentrate your spirit,

125
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,600
and it will naturally appear.

126
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,850
Yellow black black.

127
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,410
Yellow black black.

128
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,140
Green green brown.

129
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,000
I can die.

130
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,680
But I cannot lose.

131
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,330
You need to leave here quickly.

132
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,560
This place is about to be destroyed.

133
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,640
The person you want to see

134
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,370
will go back to meet you.

135
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:13,900
What about you?

136
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,800
I have to go

137
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,290
to see the person I want to meet.

138
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,120
Sister.

139
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,240
What a pity.

140
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,400
I am not Axin.

141
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,880
What is this place?

142
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,520
Could it be

143
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,700
that you two are also dead?

144
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Let's go quickly.

145
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,890
But your illness hasn't been treated yet.

146
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:52,840
Forget it.

147
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:54,650
Let's go.

148
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,520
Let's go.

149
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:58,920
Lin Han,

150
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,410
I'm fine now.

151
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,320
Let's go.

152
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:08,840
Lin Han

153
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,040
Lin Han

154
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,360
Lin Han

155
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,040
Lin Han

156
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,480
It seems like I've known you for so long

157
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,140
but I've never seen you smile.

158
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,680
Is there anything worth smiling about?

159
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:58,680
I also

160
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,800
found it.

161
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,300
Report!

162
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,720
Something terrible has happened.

163
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,120
The mirage is destroyed.

164
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,960
Sir, someone is on the city wall.

165
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:03,960
Your Highness.

166
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,000
By the Emperor's command:

167
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,360
if the mirage in the sky changes,

168
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,960
this box must be given to you.

169
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:35,640
Brother.

170
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,480
This mess is all yours now.

171
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,260
When the snipe and the clam fight,

172
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,620
the fisherman reaps the benefit.

173
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,370
Let's return to the palace.

174
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,159
I told you.

175
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,120
I can take on 200 or 300 men

176
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,600
no problem.

177
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,500
But you didn't believe me.

178
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,440
Yunniang.

179
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,120
Are you two all right?

180
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,570
Where's Lin Han?

181
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,160
The captured people have returned.

182
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,700
They're at the South Gate.

183
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,380
Everyone's at the South Gate.

184
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,920
They're all at the South Gate.

185
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,200
Hurry and get them!

186
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,200
The captured people have returned.

187
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,480
They're at the South Gate.

188
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,720
Go get someone.

189
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:29,680
Sister,

190
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,820
why are you crying?

191
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,280
Sis, I saw Cao Sheng.

192
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,810
I'll go catch him right now.

193
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,890
Did you get into another fight?

194
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,130
Look at these injuries.

195
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,680
So useless.

196
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,440
Next time,

197
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,490
remember to call me.

198
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,000

Hey, Zeng Qian.

242
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,160
It's been over two months since we last met.

243
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,360
We made such an effort to come visit you.

244
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,680
My legs are about to break from all this climbing.

245
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,520
I was hoping to taste some exotic wild delicacies,

246
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,610
but you're just serving us a few roasted rabbits?

247
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,050
Our rabbits here are wild game too.

248
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,480
What can't you get at your Qingfeng Tower?

249
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,720
I just wanted

250
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,040
to come and see

251
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,160
what kind of environment you were in

252
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,360
when you came up with the plan to save us.

253
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,620
But after seeing the Manzhu Dai flowers,

254
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,720
I didn't expect them to be so unremarkable.

255
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:07,920
That's what I was saying.

256
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,050
Don't they look like morning glories?

257
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:11,960
When I think about

258
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,140
everything that happened recently,

259
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,440
it all feels like a dream.

260
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:21,840
You once said

261
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:25,840
there's a feeling that becomes deeply etched in your memory.

262
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,360
It's when you meet

263
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,840
special people

264
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,920
at special times and places.

265
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,040
I think

266
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,600
that all of us

267
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,850
might be just like that.

268
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,280
I'm fine.

269
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:07,360
There are certain things and people

270
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,690
that we'll always miss.

271
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,600
Can't I reminisce a little?

272
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,370
I used to hear people say

273
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,180
that those who have no stories to tell

274
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,440
are the happiest.

275
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:20,760
But I don't think so anymore.

276
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,460
I think if you have no stories to tell,

277
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,440
isn't that a bit too boring?

278
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,730
The not-so-boring person is back.

279
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,440
Brother, sister,

280
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,240
I picked some fruits for you.

281
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,850
You should call them uncle and auntie.

282
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,090
Are you sure this

283
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,600
is the real Tongtong?

284
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,920
She and the other Tongtong

285
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,520
are most similar in this way.

286
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,120
You two are really something,

287
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,760
picking fruits so late at night.

288
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,290
Have one.

289
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,770
We kids have good eyesight.

290
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,360
Kid?

291
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,080
Don't you forget

292
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,200
you used to be an old lady.

293
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,200
Shouldn't you be calling me auntie?

294
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,320
Besides,

295
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,090
what's wrong with me being an old lady?

296
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,920
We even have an emperor here.

297
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,520
Shouldn't you all

298
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,520
be kneeling down?

299
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,720
What does that mean?

300
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,220
Who's the emperor?

301
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,050
I didn't tell him anything.

302
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,570
What's the big deal?

303
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:21,440
Zeng Qian,

304
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,780
we need to talk about it to move on.

305
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,100
Come, Zeng Xin,

306
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,440
sit properly.

307
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,040
I'll tell you a story.

308
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,560
This story is about

309
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,040
how a hunter became an emperor.

310
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,480
What are you talking about?

311
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,480
Did I give you permission to tell it?

312
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,130
Her silence means consent,

313
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,160
right, Zeng Qian?

314
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,280
So these fruits aren't for eating,

315
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,340
they're for throwing at people, huh?

316
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,320
I'll go get water for everyone.
