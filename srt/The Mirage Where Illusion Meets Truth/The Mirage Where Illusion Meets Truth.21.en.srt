1
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,920
Even if Zeng Qian is exposed,

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,720
her life shouldn't be in danger.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,080
Didn't they say she has something Baili Yuan wants?

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:15,960
Think positively.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,240
What if she hasn't been discovered?

6
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,480
We can go tell Zeng Qian

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,600
that Zeng Xin can still be saved

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,440
and ask her to put aside her revenge for now.

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,120
We'll make up an excuse

10
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,080
and slip away.

11
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,440
But he won't let her leave.

12
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,000
No matter what the situation is now,

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,760
taking Zeng Qian away from the Baili mansion...

14
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,220
It's all quite difficult.

15
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,680
There's a post station down the mountain.

16
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:31,400
You go ahead first.

17
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,400
I'll go ahead to prepare the horses.

18
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,560
That person who looked like you earlier,

19
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,890
was wearing a disguise.

20
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,680
The resemblance was striking.

21
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,680
Just a puppet.

22
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,200
But finding someone who looks so much like me

23
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,360
isn't easy at all.

24
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,000
Fortunately, that knife strike of yours

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,730
didn't actually take his life.

26
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,680
It seems.

27
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,690
Although I'm not your biological father,

28
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:26,079
after spending this time together,

29
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,000
you still care about our father-daughter relationship.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,400
You're overthinking it.

31
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,120
I just want you to die more slowly.

32
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,440
Actually,

33
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,840
After all this time,

34
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,680
sometimes

35
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,800
I feel like

36
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,840
I really am your father.

37
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,360
My father is dead.

38
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,120
Manzhu Dai

39
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,120
is not actually the name of a flower,

40
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,980
but rather a classification of flowers.

41
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,020
This flower is called Manzhu.

42
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,400
Wherever it grows,

43
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,800
the minerals I need will certainly be there.

44
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,160
That's why this mineral

45
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,860
is also called Zhu ore.

46
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,880
Manzhu flowers come in five colors:

47
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,880
white, yellow, red, purple, and black.

48
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,840
The darker the color,

49
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,079
the higher the grade,

50
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,930
and the more minerals you'll find nearby.

51
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,000
Dai is blackish-green,

52
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,560
the highest grade of Manzhu.

53
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,640
Cao Jiande's father was the former Minister of War,

54
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,440
yet Cao Jiande only became a minor official in the Geographical Bureau.

55
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,040
The purpose was to take advantage of his position

56
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,160
to travel through mountains and rivers

57
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,690
and search for pearl mines.

58
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,400
Back then,

59
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,320
Cao Jiande found Manzhu jade in Jiuyuan Mountain.

60
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,680
When I learned of this,

61
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,360
I sent He Xiguang with men to investigate.

62
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,040
But Cao Jiande had already left Jiuyuan Mountain.

63
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,360
The mountains were vast,

64
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,960
with ranges extending endlessly.

65
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,890
He Xiguang searched for a long time

66
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,160
but found nothing.

67
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,840
Years later,

68
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,690
I accidentally discovered

69
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,160
that the Manzhu jade in Jiuyuan Mountain

70
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,420
It's related to a hunter in the mountains

71
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,660
who is your foster father.

72
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,560
As for his relationship with Cao Jiande,

73
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,240
I have no idea.

74
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,920
So I sent people up the mountain again.

75
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,080
The plan was to follow your foster father

76
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,240
until we found Manzhudai.

77
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,560
But unexpectedly, your foster father

78
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,080
was extremely vigilant.

79
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,640
He discovered my men.

80
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,080
My men had no choice but to reveal themselves,

81
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,920
which led to your ambush.

82
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,480
Actually, my men only wanted to subdue you

83
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,880
to find out where the flower was.

84
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,360
But unexpectedly,

85
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,820
they seriously wounded your foster father.

86
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,400
At the critical moment...

87
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,800
The men in black arrived,

88
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,760
who was actually Feng Buhai.

89
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,000
He saved you all.

90
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,840
Later I learned

91
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,840
that Feng Buhai was sent by Zouwu Academy,

92
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,120
and the head of Zouwu Academy at that time

93
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,850
was none other than Cao Jiande.

94
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,600
He must have known

95
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,760
that I sent people to Jiuyuan Mountain to find you,

96
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,090
which is why he sent someone to rescue you.

97
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,720
The two subordinates who escaped back to me

98
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,560
reported this matter to me.

99
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,880
I sent people into the mountains to find you again,

100
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,520
but your family

101
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,880
had already fled.

102
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,680
Later,

103
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,280
after extensive inquiries,

104
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,640
I learned that your adoptive father

105
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,360
had found you in a wolf den and taken you home.

106
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,320
One of my men had used your sword.

107
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,440
He was very knowledgeable about weapons,

108
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,320
with an almost photographic memory.

109
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,800
Based on his description,

110
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,480
I had a sword made identical to yours.

111
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,280
I had hoped

112
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,200
to find you quickly

113
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,560
and acknowledge you as my daughter.

114
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,840
But to my surprise,

115
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,920
you were too good at hiding,

116
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,320
changing names

117
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,000
and fleeing to distant places.

118
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
My search

119
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,080
lasted a full eight years.

120
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,440
Until you appeared in Dengzhou.

121
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,160
To make you come to Baili Manor,

122
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,640
I went to great lengths.

123
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Unfortunately,

124
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,720
there was still a flaw in my perfect plan,

125
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,980
and you saw through it.

126
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,880
I think this painting you drew

127
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,930
must be fake, right?

128
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,560
My fake painting

129
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,040
is nothing compared to your deception.

130
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,360
From the Zouwu Institute files

131
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,600
to that knife

132
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,040
to my supposedly ill birth mother

133
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,600
it was all fake.

134
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,320
That file is real.

135
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,000
Except for that ritual drawing inside.

136
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,840
What is this drawing?

137
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,600
A ritual.

138
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,360
I was afraid you would discover

139
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,800
that those missing people

140
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,040
had their bodies possessed by beings from beyond

141
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,320
and harm them.

142
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,680
So I put that drawing in the file

143
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,000
to make you believe

144
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,320
that the only one whose soul was replaced

145
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,920
was the Emperor alone.

146
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,040
The one sitting in the middle is Zeng Xin,

147
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,880
surrounded by those who went missing.

148
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,120
So the Emperor wants to possess Zeng Xin's body.

149
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,200
His spiritual essence alone wouldn't be enough,

150
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,320
that's why he captured so many people.

151
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,760
And those people were like sacrifices,

152
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,520
their spiritual essence was consumed,

153
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,580
causing their soul-loss condition.

154
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,650
There's nothing wrong with the files.

155
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,120
The question is,

156
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,580
who let the Crown Prince get the first copy of the files?

157
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,600
Baili Yuan.

158
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,730
The Emperor's secret trip to Dengzhou

159
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,880
was no secret to me.

160
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,760
Therefore,

161
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,960
I already had eyes and ears in Dengzhou.

162
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,640
After that,

163
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,560
the mirage appeared.

164
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,400
People began to disappear one after another.

165
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,040
And you, in search of your brother,

166
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,000
left no stone unturned.

167
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,920
You alarmed the prefecture office

168
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,450
and the Wuji Temple as well.

169
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,240
That's how I found you again.

170
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,880
Logically,

171
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,360
I should have sent someone to bring you here immediately.

172
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,520
To force you to reveal Manzhudai's whereabouts.

173
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,400
But making someone like you talk

174
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,360
would certainly not be an easy task.

175
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,159
Moreover,

176
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,120
the Prince of Jingnan was in Dengzhou.

177
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,320
If I alarmed him,

178
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,159
letting the Prince know

179
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,340
that you possessed such a big secret,

180
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,380
he might have gotten to you first.

181
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,260
Until I discovered you were with Feng Buhai.

182
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,060
Years ago, the person I sent returned and told me

183
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,120
that a man with a broken eyebrow saved you and your father.

184
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,240
Feng Buhai and I have some history.

185
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,800
So...

186
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,480
I quickly searched and confirmed

187
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,520
that he was the one who saved you.

188
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,000
You and Feng Buhai met in Dengzhou.

189
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,760
So I decided to use him.

190
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,880
And coincidentally,

191
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,360
the Crown Prince was investigating

192
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,840
the mirage at Gaomeng Lake from over 20 years ago.

193
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,400
This matter involved the Zouwu Institute.

194
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,280
Out of curiosity,

195
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,640
I began to investigate everything related to Gaomeng Lake from that year.

196
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,640
We found out there's a mysterious organization

197
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,520
that was established after that mirage incident,

198
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,840
called the Zouwu Institute.

199
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,720
And I did serve as the head of the Zouwu Institute.

200
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,320
But I later stepped down due to war affairs.

201
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,160
So then,

202
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,480
I came up with my subsequent plan.

203
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,140
The Crown Prince was part of Baili Yuan's plan from the beginning.

204
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,200
But why did the Crown Prince only get

205
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,660
this portion of the files?

206
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,080
Baili Yuan would only let him get these.

207
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,960
Because his files

208
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,160
weren't prepared for the Crown Prince,

209
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,960
but for Feng Buhai.

210
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,920
But if Feng Buhai

211
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,780
obtained those files too easily,

212
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,740
it would inevitably raise your suspicions.

213
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,280
So a simple matter had to be

214
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,640
made more complicated.

215
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,600
As it happens,

216
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,040
You suspected there was something wrong with Wuji Temple

217
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,200
and were investigating it.

218
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,400
Stop making trouble.

219
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,960
I just want to go in and light some incense.

220
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,290
I need to offer incense.

221
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,690
You all saw that, right?

222
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,280
This Taoist temple definitely has something suspicious going on.

223
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,210
Your investigation of Wuji Temple

224
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,520
would inevitably intersect

225
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,080
with the Crown Prince and others.

226
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,880
So I guided the Crown Prince's men

227
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,840
to help them

228
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,170
find that document in the secret archive.

229
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,840
Later, when the mirage appeared in Dengzhou,

230
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,920
my people finally found

231
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,520
the scrolls about Zouwu Institute in the palace archives.

232
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,680
What a coincidence.

233
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,680
That section in the Zouwu Department of the Archives

234
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,080
only has records from Baili Yuan's tenure.

235
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,250
Baili Yuan tampered with things beforehand.

236
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,680
He arranged for people to enter the Archives

237
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,200
to filter out only the records from his time in office

238
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,400
and leave them there.

239
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,520
Since removing documents from the Archives

240
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,920
requires registration,

241
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,480
and his people couldn't

242
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,940
remove other files without leaving traces,

243
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,120
and destroying them inside would be easily discovered,

244
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,640
so he hid all the records from Cao Jiande's tenure

245
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,680
in the place you eventually found.

246
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,440
After the Crown Prince's men went in,

247
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,300
they only found

248
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,080
the records Baili Yuan wanted them to find.

249
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,960
But how could he ensure

250
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,400
that these records

251
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,800
would definitely end up in Feng Buhai's hands?

252
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,720
I originally had a perfect plan

253
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,120
to let Feng Buhai get those records

254
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,600
from the Crown Prince.

255
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,160
But to my surprise,

256
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,160
just after the Crown Prince got them,

257
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,880
you and Cao Sheng broke into Wuji Temple

258
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,940
and took them away.

259
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,720
That's fine too.

260
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,360
It saved me a lot of trouble.

261
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,680
What happened afterward

262
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,600
was pretty much as I imagined.

263
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,880
Feng Buhai recognized my personal seal

264
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,560
and told you

265
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,680
that I was the one who saved you back then.

266
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,810
After repeated setbacks in Dengzhou,

267
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,360
you had no choice but to come to Chenzhou for my help.

268
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,720
But if I had easily acknowledged you as my daughter,

269
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,120
many things would be difficult to explain.

270
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,840
And you're all so clever

271
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,840
you would inevitably become suspicious.

272
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,640
I had no choice

273
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,800
but to play hard to get

274
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,330
and shift the blame.

275
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,760
In the 34th year of Jingyun,

276
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,240
did you order someone

277
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,500
to rescue my family at Jiuyuan Mountain?

278
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,970
I've never met you before, young lady,

279
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,720
and don't recall doing such a thing.

280
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,840
Meanwhile,

281
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,480
I needed to leave some flaws for you to find.

282
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,890
To turn you from passive

283
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,440
into active players.

284
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,040
Where did you get this sword?

285
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,360
The guard's reaction suggests

286
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,610
he's very likely seen my sword before.

287
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,890
People are often like this:

288
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,160
what they receive passively or by chance,

289
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,090
they tend to undervalue and doubt.

290
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,300
But what they actively fight for,

291
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,410
they cherish and truly believe in.

292
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,600
At this point,

293
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,970
my plan is only missing the final step:

294
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,160
arranging for you to see your sick mother.

295
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,600
This matter can't be rushed.

296
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,160
I need some time

297
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,280
to gain more of your trust.

298
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,040
But you're desperate to save Zeng Xin,

299
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,360
eager to leave.

300
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,680
But the Prince of Jingnan will leave Dengzhou in less than 7 days.

301
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,040
I might be running out of time.

302
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,400
I know with your temperament, it's hard to believe what I say.

303
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,360
You might leave the Baili residence right now

304
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,320
to confront the Prince of Jingnan at all costs.

305
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,180
But doing so...

306
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,370
It's like an ant trying to shake a tree.

307
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,960
I can't force you to stay.

308
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,360
That would destroy your trust in me.

309
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,960
But if you leave now,

310
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,920
my plan

311
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,360
will fall apart.

312
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,160
I think

313
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,320
I'm losing my grip on this daughter.

314
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,880
You need to tell her the truth.

315
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,800
Some things

316
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,840
can only be let go when all hope is lost.

317
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,760
What I say.

318
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,520
She might not believe it.

319
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,200
Baili Yuan

320
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,320
wants Zeng Qian to know some things

321
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,480
and has asked you to tell her.

322
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,600
How much should I tell?

323
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,330
Everything.

324
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,040
Tell the truth.

325
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,400
That day in the garden,

326
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,450
I saw you were extremely upset.

327
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,320
I thought you had finally given up on leaving the Baili residence.

328
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,280
I was still rejoicing

329
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,280
that everything was under control.

330
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,160
But on that very day...

331
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,920
You saw through me.

332
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,200
I didn't expect that.

333
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,560
I never thought

334
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,020
you would be so clever.

335
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,720
My cleverness is no match for your cunning.

336
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,360
So the Crown Prince was essentially Baili Yuan's messenger,

337
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,220
though he himself didn't know it.

338
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,160
Now it seems

339
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,740
Baili Yuan wasn't the one who saved Zeng Qian back then.

340
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,620
Then the claim that Zeng Qian is his daughter

341
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,560
probably doesn't make sense anymore.

342
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,880
Earlier when the Crown Prince visited Baili's residence,

343
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,760
he accidentally discovered that Baili Yuan had

344
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,720
a dagger identical to Zeng Qian's,

345
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,720
which led him to deduce

346
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,760
that Zeng Qian was Baili Yuan's daughter.

347
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,840
Now it appears

348
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,240
that dagger must have been a replica,

349
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,280
specifically prepared for Zeng Qian,

350
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,280
but it indirectly misled us as well.

351
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,840
Years ago, when Baili Yuan was trapped in the valley,

352
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,280
those who rushed to rescue him

353
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,010
were the Northern Border Army.

354
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,760
Though I was only a child then,

355
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:17,050
I still joined the military campaign.

356
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,960
During that battle,

357
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,340
Baili Yuan did indeed become separated from his infant daughter.

358
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,640
For many years,

359
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,200
he has been secretly searching for her.

360
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,760
That's why we were misled.

361
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,380
Looking at it this way,

362
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,120
the daughter he's been looking for

363
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,780
was never Zeng Qian after all.

364
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,320
It doesn't matter anymore.

365
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,320
Baili Yuan

366
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,160
went to such great lengths to trap them.

367
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,450
His target definitely wasn't any of them.

368
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,760
Although I can't figure out Baili Yuan,

369
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,800
I do understand my sister.

370
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,680
No matter what Baili Yuan

371
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,040
wants to get from her,

372
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,900
it's going to be quite difficult.

373
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,160
I've told you

374
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,890
everything you wanted to know.

375
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,120
Now,

376
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,360
tell me

377
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,280
everything you know.

378
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,760
I hear horses.

379
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,120
Feng Buhai must have prepared the horses.

380
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,200
They're just ahead.

381
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,000
What worries me most now

382
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,160
is that Zeng Qian might have been exposed.

383
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,280
It doesn't matter if she's exposed.

384
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,440
She's useful to Baili Yuan.

385
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,720
He'll keep her alive.

386
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,970
What if Zeng Qian doesn't want to live?

387
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,240
I won't draw it for you.

388
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,440
If you want to know,

389
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,440
follow me.

390
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,560
For Zeng Qian,

391
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,240
Zeng Xin is already dead.

392
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,520
If she can't avenge her grudge,

393
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,180
she'll have no reason to live.

394
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,359
Death would be a release for her.

395
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,440
Now the only ones who can give Zeng Qian hope

396
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,900
and a reason to keep living

397
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,960
are us.

398
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,360
So we need to hurry back and tell her

399
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,160
that Zeng Xin can still be saved.

400
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,160
You may go.

401
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,920
Yes.

402
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,000
You know, biting your tongue

403
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,600
doesn't usually kill you.

404
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,490
You'll just pass out from the pain.

405
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,760
So

406
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,740
there's no need for pointless attempts.

407
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,600
That device where I come from

408
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,730
is specifically used against rebels.

409
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,520
It enters your body,

410
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,720
quickly merges with your flesh

411
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,650
and bone marrow.

412
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,320
Once activated,

413
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,880
it travels throughout your entire body.

414
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,240
People around here

415
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,770
think childbirth is the worst pain possible.

416
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,440
Compared to this,

417
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,320
childbirth is nothing.

418
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,720
So,

419
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,100
is there anything you want to tell me?

420
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,640
If possible,

421
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,760
I'd prefer not to use it.

422
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,640
Not because I care about you,

423
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,960
but because whenever I use it,

424
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,880
I feel the pain myself.

425
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,800
The pain it causes has three levels.

426
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,120
If you want to talk later,

427
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,880
I can stop at any time.

428
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,980
Because where I come from,

429
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,970
no one has ever endured to the third level.

430
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,520
I once told Cao Jiande

431
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,120
that inferior groups like you

432
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,880
don't deserve such a beautiful world.

433
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,840
But he told me

434
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,400
that you possess many admirable qualities

435
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,560
that we don't have.

436
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,000
Is it your kind?

437
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,440
Don't you find it ridiculous

438
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,240
and pathetic?

439
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,280
I'm out of ideas.

440
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,860
Let Baili Yuan figure it out himself.

441
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,960
Assassin!

442
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,920
When did Minister He leave the mansion?

443
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,280
This is no time for such questions.

444
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,640
Don't you know the mansion is under attack?

445
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,440
Move aside!

446
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,080
Minister Baili ordered

447
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,560
that everyone entering or leaving today

448
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,000
must be thoroughly checked,

449
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,200
to prevent anyone in disguise

450
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,000
from sneaking into the mansion.

451
00:24:59,160 --> 00:24:59,600
Sir!

452
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,480
Sir, are you alright?

453
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,920
Are you hurt, sir?

454
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:03,400
Sir!

455
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,240
Sir!

456
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,040
Minister He!

457
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,440
Go attend to your duties.

458
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,560
Zeng Qian,

459
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,200
over here!

460
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,520
Hurry!

461
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,240
Zeng Qian!

462
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,480
You must stay alive.

463
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,240
Tongtong said

464
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,500
we can rescue Zeng Xin.

465
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,240
Go quickly!

466
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,000
Go!

467
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,160
Kneel!

468
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:30,880
Zeng Qian!

469
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,160
Don't move!

470
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,780
Drop your weapons!

471
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,040
You could have escaped,

472
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,300
yet you risked your lives to save others.

473
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,000
Should I commend your courage

474
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,040
or pity your desperate struggle?

475
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,440
Why can't you accept reality?

476
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,080
Mere insects

477
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,340
bringing destruction upon yourselves.

478
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,720
You cannot change this world,

479
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,240
nor stop the coming era.

480
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,760
I truly never expected

481
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,120
that He Xiguang's methods

482
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,480
would have absolutely no effect on you.

483
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,500
However, after years as an official,

484
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,680
when it comes to interrogation,

485
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,520
I have my own approach.

486
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,960
Questions are inferior to enticement,

487
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,080
enticement inferior to intimidation,

488
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,920
intimidation inferior to torture,

489
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,720
and torture

490
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,140
inferior to death.

491
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,600
Let them go

492
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,660
and I'll give you the drawing.

493
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,880
I know you're not afraid of death,

494
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:40,320
so it's hard for me to trust your sincerity.

495
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,800
But I also know

496
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,450
you're afraid of others dying.

497
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,240
Three more people can die.

498
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,520
Now,

499
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,240
can I trust your sincerity?

500
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,400
You're insane!

501
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,560
Go now!

502
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,600
Open the door!

503
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:46,720
Boss,

504
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,360
we have to disobey orders this time.

505
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,130
Shen Hui, open the door!

506
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,120
Shen Hui!

507
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,440
Shen Hui, open the door!

508
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,120
Shen Hui!

509
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,300
If you don't leave now,

510
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,920
their deaths will be in vain.

511
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,820
How are you all?

512
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,460
We're fine.

513
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,320
There might be more pursuers behind us.

514
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,720
We need to leave quickly.

515
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,440
Where are our horses?

516
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,400
Stop!

517
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,320
You go ahead.

518
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:54,810
I'll be fine.

519
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:56,920
Go.

520
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,420
Chi Mo pays respect to Your Highness.

521
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,640
With all this display,

522
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,440
formalities seem unnecessary.

523
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,480
I received a secret order from His Majesty.

524
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,440
I thought Your Highness would remain at Baili Manor.

525
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,840
Now you appear so suddenly.

526
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,700
It's hard to tell friend from foe.

527
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,320
I didn't accomplish what he wanted,

528
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,180
but that doesn't make me an enemy.

529
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,560
You came all the way to Chenzhou,

530
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,960
and returning empty-handed

531
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,690
would be difficult to explain.

532
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,720
Let me give you a gift.

533
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,880
Your Highness would be a great gift.

534
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,610
If I return, I'm as good as dead.

535
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,800
I have no value.

536
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,200
Then what does Your Highness mean?

537
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,900
Zeng Qian and the others have already left Baili Manor.

538
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:07,960
Go over there.

539
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,600
Come.

540
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,450
I'll go find some herbs.

541
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,640
So this is

542
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,880
what heartache feels like.

543
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,930
Let's go to a nearby village

544
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,480
to find a doctor.

545
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,760
It's too late.

546
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,880
You've all forgotten

547
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,760
that I am

548
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,600
a doctor.

549
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,240
Go

550
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,000
check on Tongtong.

551
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,400
Go now.

552
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,040
I...

553
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,720
I'll wait for you to come back

554
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,360
before I

555
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,880
die.

556
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,160
I'll go find a doctor.

557
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,170
I'll go with you, young master.

558
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,480
Are you sure your wound is okay?

559
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,740
It's nothing serious.

560
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,440
Don't worry, I'm fine.

561
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:14,000
I should recover soon.

562
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,640
Let's go.

563
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,760
First, find a doctor.

564
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,800
Then buy some horses

565
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,200
to take him into the city.

566
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,130
Alright.

567
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:26,040
You should remove the needles now, young master.

568
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,640
We'll talk about that later.

569
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,160
Are you okay?

570
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,120
I'm fine.

571
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:47,890
Let's go.

572
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,410
Quickly, take her away.

573
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,240
It's just ahead.

574
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,080
Hurry!

575
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,120
Go!

576
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,280
Stop chasing.

577
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,760
Take us to see Zeng Qian.

578
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:32,640
We got separated.

579
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,480
Baili Yuan's pursuers can't be just these two people.

580
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,000
If you want to leave Chenzhou,

581
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,200
it won't be that easy.

582
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,920
You people

583
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,000
won't make much difference.

584
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,130
Our reinforcements will arrive soon.

585
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,060
Commander Lin,

586
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,960
we're here to help you.

587
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,540
I'm afraid we can't accept your help.

588
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,880
Then give Zeng Qian a message.

589
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,360
No.

590
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,440
I promised to save them,

591
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,570
not to release them.

592
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,080
Then kill her now,

593
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,460
and kill me too so you can report back.

594
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,440
Don't push people into a corner.

595
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,650
If you insist on taking everyone back,

596
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,140
you might not take anyone back at all,

597
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,290
and what the Emperor ultimately wants isn't people.

598
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,680
Tell Zeng Qian

599
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,720
the Emperor knows about Manzhudai,

600
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,440
and he wants its location.

601
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,040
Her brother is dead.

602
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,280
What can you bargain with?

603
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,640
Your lives.

604
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,800
In today's world,

605
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,560
Baili Yuan won't tolerate you.

606
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,200
If the Emperor won't either,

607
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,600
besides the underworld,

608
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,160
where else can you go?

609
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,440
I'm giving you four days.

610
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,820
When the time is up,

611
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,800
you'll be like stray dogs.

612
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,020
This is all I can do to help.

613
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:00,580
What happened?

614
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,810
Those two guards from Baili Yuan ambushed us.

615
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,560
You...

616
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,400
Put this

617
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,640
into his body.

618
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,680
Alright.

619
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,160
Save him.

620
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,120
Use it yourself.

621
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,000
You're in no better shape

622
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,760
than I am right now.

623
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,530
You use it first.

624
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,360
I have more.

625
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,840
Stop lying to me.

626
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,800
I may not be clever,

627
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,840
but I'm not stupid.

628
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,000
If you had more,

629
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,400
why wouldn't you use it yourself?

630
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,360
The life-saving medicine

631
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,400
is the only one.

632
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:26,600
Right?

633
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,040
It seems

634
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,600
only one of us

635
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:36,120
can survive.

636
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,040
Old woman!

637
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,760
I always scold you.

638
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,800
Don't worry about me.

639
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,220
You were right to scold me.

640
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,720
I've always

641
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:53,320
been

642
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,480
a bad person.

643
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,200
Tongtong.

644
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:12,720
Tongtong!

645
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,320
I told you I'm not stupid.

646
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:15,000
That's amazing!

647
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,760
I really want to learn

648
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,080
your medical skills.

649
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,360
Do you remember

650
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,800
our promise?

651
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:39,880
Stay alive.

652
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,760
Wouldn't it be better to do something meaningful?

653
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,690
What is something meaningful?

654
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,010
Now that you mention it,

655
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,680
I really don't know.

656
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,360
But...

657
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,600
We'll figure it out eventually.

658
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:53,760
How about this:

659
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,090
let's find it together.

660
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:55,960
Let's see who

661
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,660
finds it first.

662
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:02,680
I found it.

663
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,340
Tear his clothes open.

664
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:12,780
Pull out the knife.

665
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,800
Clean the wound.

666
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,400
These two things work differently.

667
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,160
This one

668
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:54,050
can only temporarily seal the damaged parts of the body,

669
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,570
but it only lasts for five days.

670
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,380
What happens after five days?

671
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,640
The wounds, from inside out,

672
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,520
will burst open again.

673
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,560
By then,

674
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,560
We can find a doctor during this time.

675
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:11,680
No one here

676
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,800
can treat this kind of injury.

677
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,520
Unless

678
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,160
you go to the City of Rebirth.

679
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,720
That healing bed.

680
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:26,500
Don't move him.

681
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,320
After one hour,

682
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,360
this substance

683
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,440
will stabilize in his body

684
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:33,850
and take effect.

685
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:35,720
During this time,

686
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,200
his body must remain still.

687
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:40,280
Otherwise,

688
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,820
it will have the opposite effect.

689
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,640
It's impossible to find a doctor this late at night.

690
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:52,760
Even those horses

691
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,280
were found with Brother Bao's help.

692
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,010
Brother Bao?

693
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,490
How is Brother Bao here?

694
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,160
Last time,

695
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,880
didn't he swim away?

696
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,960
Somehow he ended up in Chenzhou.

697
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,520
Said he had some friends here

698
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:05,680
and stayed a few more days.

699
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,940
He must have swum in the wrong direction.

700
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,800
Xie Jingtang is in no condition to travel.

701
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,130
I'll ask Brother Bao to find us a carriage.

702
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,520
So those other two items the armored stranger left you

703
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,920
were for this purpose.

704
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,660
They can bring people back from the dead?

705
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,240
They're only for treating wounds.

706
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,840
If they could truly resurrect the dead,

707
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,680
we wouldn't need to come here.

708
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,320
Then ask him to give Xie Jingtang one like

709
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:39,440
the one you used.

710
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,440
He Xiguang won't give it.

711
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,800
Doesn't Baili Yuan want the Manzhu Dai?

712
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,360
I can trade it with him.

713
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,160
Saving a life is more important.

714
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,570
I do have a way to save your brother,

715
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,120
but the condition is

716
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:56,040
we must go to the City of Rebirth.

717
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,480
The only thing that can control the City of Rebirth

718
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,410
and remove its protective barrier

719
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:03,290
is the King of Jingnan's Halberd Fang.

720
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:05,760
Lin Han just said

721
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,490
the King of Jingnan also wants the Manzhu Dai now.

722
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,000
If you give it to Baili Yuan,

723
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:12,800
it means

724
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,570
you won't be able to save your brother.

725
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,480
Including Tongtong.

726
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,440
I just don't understand

727
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,800
why these two identical iron warriors

728
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:38,920
can do something

729
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,680
while the other can't.

730
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,280
The King of Jingnan's Halberd Fang

731
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,480
has two devices.

732
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,760
One controls mirages,

733
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,280
and the other

734
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,480
can remove its outer protective layer.

735
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,560
So if you get these two devices...

736
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:54,720
Can we use it too?

737
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:55,840
Yes.

738
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,920
But the device that controls the mirage

739
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,760
is integrated into his body.

740
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,210
It can't be removed no matter what.

741
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:05,440
The device that disables the protection

742
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,080
is hidden in his armor.

743
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,480
With our abilities

744
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,800
we can't handle him.

745
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,240
We can't defeat him.

746
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,280
He Xiguang's Iron Man should be able to, right?

747
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,320
I see you have a good relationship with him.

748
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,160
He even let us go for your sake.

749
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,640
Can you ask him to help us with this?

750
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:23,840
I just said

751
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:26,680
the device controlling the mirage cannot be removed.

752
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,800
So we can never find the mirage.

753
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,240
Even if He Xiguang's Jiya

754
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,900
helps us get the protection-disabling device,

755
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,560
it would be meaningless.

756
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:42,090
After all this talk, we still need to find the Prince of Jingnan.

757
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,360
But why did he

758
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,920
learn about Manzhudai so quickly?

759
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,920
The Crown Prince must have told him.

760
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,840
The Prince of Jingnan's two-month limit in Dengzhou

761
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,040
has only four days left.

762
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,040
That's why he only gave us four days.

763
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,360
If he returns to the capital,

764
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,000
it will be even harder to see him then.

765
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,360
Let's go find him now.

766
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,040
This way,

767
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:04,360
we can not only save Zeng Xin and Tongtong,

768
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:05,880
but the medical bed on the mirage

769
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,600
can also heal Xie Jingtang's wounds,

770
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,930
and treat your illness too, young master.

771
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,140
What stage is your illness at now?

772
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,000
Are you having nosebleeds?

773
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:16,400
No.

774
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,120
Before we went to Yangjia Ridge last time,

775
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,760
you were unconscious for three hours

776
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,760
and had a nosebleed when you woke up.

777
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:25,700
That nosebleed had nothing to do with my condition.

778
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:30,880
Haven't you told everyone yet?

779
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:31,680
No need.

780
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,360
What does the nosebleed mean?

781
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,370
Cao Jiande wrote in his manuscript

782
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:44,560
that if his illness

783
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,220
reaches the nosebleed stage,

784
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:48,620
death is imminent.

785
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:55,010
There's nothing wrong now.

786
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:56,120
What are you worried about?

787
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:58,780
You should hurry to get treatment on the mirage.

788
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:01,640
But we need to consider an issue now.

789
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,400
If we give the Prince of Jingnan Manzhudai's location,

790
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,260
how do we ensure

791
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:07,600
he won't break his promise?

792
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:08,330
That's true.

793
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,040
This man not only breaks his word

794
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,680
but is also full of schemes.

795
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:12,740
Just like last time

796
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:15,960
when he told the young master to get the acceleration map from Baili Yuan,

797
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:18,280
but secretly had the Crown Prince make a move.

798
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,480
We must be more cautious of him in the future.

799
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,280
The Prince of Jingnan wants the acceleration map.

800
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,200
If I had helped you earlier,

801
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,040
I could have given him that map.

802
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,160
What do you mean?

803
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,090
You have the map?

804
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:35,640
I can draw it.

805
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:39,240
When I first met He Xiguang,

806
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,240
I saw it.

807
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,720
This is what I got from inside.

808
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:47,540
It records the acceleration method.

809
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:50,640
I didn't expect Cao Jiande had already figured it out.

810
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,560
Is what's drawn on the diagram that simple?

811
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,360
You saw it once and could draw it?

812
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:56,340
It's not necessarily simple.

813
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,400
I just have a good memory.

814
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,530
Photographic memory, huh?

815
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:03,000
You really should have helped earlier.

816
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:08,250
But giving him the acceleration diagram now is useless.

817
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,410
What he wants is Manzhudai.

818
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,100
The King of Jingnan is suspicious by nature.

819
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,720
Even if Zeng Qian gives him the location of Manzhudai,

820
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,050
he might not believe it.

821
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,000
He'll definitely send people to verify.

822
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,880
This will waste a lot of time,

823
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,800
and we don't have much time to begin with.

824
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,260
If we can't reach Shenjing within five days,

825
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:26,490
Xie Jingtang...

826
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,880
From here to Jiuyuan Mountain

827
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,920
is closer than from here to Dengzhou.

828
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,920
Why don't we go to Jiuyuan Mountain first to find Manzhudai,

829
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,800
make sure there are actually minerals there,

830
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,760
and bring some minerals to him while we're at it?

831
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,220
It might save us some time.

832
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,400
We'll wait until that thing on Xie Jingtang

833
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,200
stabilizes, then we'll set off.

834
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,720
I know.

835
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:01,920
Saying sorry now won't help.

836
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:05,900
This is all because of my selfishness

837
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,960
that led to these consequences.

838
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:11,240
You said before that people from your place

839
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,200
are much smarter than us.

840
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,520
But now it seems

841
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,560
that in many things,

842
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,160
the confusion you should have,

843
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,400
the mistakes you should make,

844
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,760
are no fewer than ours.

845
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,560
I've never agreed with

846
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:23,880
what He Xiguang said.

847
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,000
That we're much more advanced than you.

848
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:28,600
On the contrary,

849
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,560
in many ways,

850
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:32,890
we're not as good as you.

851
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:36,090
Take all of you for example.

852
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:40,160
Cao Sheng and Xie Jingtang are from official families.

853
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,640
Feng Buhai is a commoner.

854
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,280
Zeng Qian is a hunter from the mountains.

855
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,600
Yun Niang is a maid.

856
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,680
You can be honest with each other

857
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:52,410
and share hardships together.

858
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,660
This kind of relationship

859
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:56,800
is truly enviable.

860
00:54:58,360 --> 00:54:59,640
But where we come from,

861
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:01,930
class distinctions are clear.

862
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:03,920
This kind of situation

863
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,800
would never happen.

864
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,520
So when Cao Jiande

865
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:11,720
removed the collar from the other Jiya,

866
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:15,520
he followed Cao Jiande

867
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,880
for this very reason.

868
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:19,160
That's why He Xiguang's armored man

869
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,840
has been kept in a dog cage.

870
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:23,880
No matter how capable he is,

871
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,680
he remains lowly.

872
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:09,480
You're free now.

873
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:11,240
Go.

874
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,240
If you leave now,

875
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,940
they can't do anything to you.

876
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:24,240
You removed his collar.

877
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,140
Then why doesn't he leave?

878
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:29,360
Because back where we come from,

879
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,040
he has his children.

880
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:34,760
That's his weakness.

881
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:37,160
If he betrays them,

882
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:39,440
his children

883
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:41,920
will be executed.

884
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,880
When we ambushed Jiya,

885
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,560
when he swung his blade at me,

886
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:21,720
Tongtong rushed in front to protect me.

887
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,360
Jiya's blade stopped.

888
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:27,760
We wondered why he did that.

889
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:29,880
Xie Jingtang said

890
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:31,640
the armored man might have been touched

891
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:33,840
and that even bad people have children.

892
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:35,680
Who would have thought

893
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,210
he actually guessed right.

894
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,240
Actually, your world isn't that bad

895
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:42,960
and ours isn't that great either.

896
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:45,360
Each has its own beauty

897
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,860
and its own frustrations.

898
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,040
Perhaps it's not the worlds

899
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:53,600
but the people that make things good

900
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:56,040
or bad.

901
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,220
When I lived in the mountains,

902
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:01,040
facing wolves and tigers every day,

903
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,500
I didn't feel much danger.

904
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,000
They're simple and pure.

905
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,970
Once you understand their habits,

906
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,300
they're actually easy to get along with.

907
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:12,280
But after coming down the mountain, dealing with people

908
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:13,880
became much more difficult.

909
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:15,560
Human hearts are complex

910
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:16,730
and unpredictable.

911
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:19,880
Wild beasts show their ferocity before they bite.

912
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,360
But some people

913
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:22,600
smile to your face

914
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:24,480
while hiding a knife in their heart.

915
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,040
Wild beasts kill

916
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:27,360
only to survive.

917
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:30,120
But some people kill

918
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:32,920
and claim it's for the greater good.

919
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:34,890
How ridiculous.

920
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:48,520
I really miss my days in the mountains now,

921
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,400
even with tigers and wolves as companions,

922
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:51,800
it was peaceful and free.

923
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,480
I must take Axin

924
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,200
and return there.

925
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:55,930
Sounds good.

926
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:57,500
We'll go together.

927
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:01,360
Along with a fully recovered Xie Jingtang.

928
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:05,240
It's changing color.

929
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:08,600
This means his condition has stabilized.

930
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:10,920
In the next five days,

931
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:13,560
this silver line will gradually fade.

932
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:15,890
We must get him there before it disappears

933
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:17,760
to the City of Rebirth.

934
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:19,080
Lin Han,

935
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:21,760
take Xie Jingtang back to Dengzhou first.

936
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,160
After we finish at Jiuyuan Mountain,

937
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:24,290
we'll meet up again.

938
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,200
Is five days enough time?

939
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:29,000
From here to Jiuyuan Mountain,

940
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,200
if we keep changing horses,

941
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:31,760
we can get there in one day.

942
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:32,840
After getting the ore,

943
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:34,440
we'll rush back to Dengzhou.

944
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,720
If all goes well, we can meet the day after tomorrow

945
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:40,180
and won't exceed the four-day limit set by the King of Jingnan.

946
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:41,600
I'll go to the nearby village

947
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,800
to borrow some clean clothes for you.

948
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:44,520
No need.

949
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,120
I can just wash my outer robe.

950
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:47,440
I don't need any either.

951
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,640
Get some for Tongtong and Xie Jingtang.

952
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,930
He's in this condition now.

953
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:53,240
Are we just going to let it go?

954
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:55,040
Of course we can't just let it go.

955
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:58,700
But no matter how much we hate Baili Yuan now,

956
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,000
we have no way to take revenge.

957
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,730
Although we can't get revenge,

958
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:05,780
I have a way to ease our hatred.

959
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,380
He hurt someone we care about,

960
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,520
so we'll destroy what he values.

961
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:15,720
The map in Baili Yuan's possession is valuable

962
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:18,280
because its contents are extremely confidential.

963
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:20,840
But what if everyone knew what was on that map?

964
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:23,570
Including the King of Jingnan.

965
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:26,360
Although the acceleration map needs a mutation vessel to work,

966
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:28,360
the King of Jingnan has obtained it.

967
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:31,280
That's enough to make Baili Yuan feel like he's sitting on pins and needles.

968
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:33,200
In that case, the map isn't important anymore.

969
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,730
Manzhu Dai is what matters.

970
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:37,940
Tongtong can draw the map.

971
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:38,760
As for the rest,

972
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:39,760
leave it to Brother Bao.

973
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:40,820
Are you calling me?

974
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:32,440
This drawing,

975
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:35,160
so many kids outside

976
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:38,640
are using it to make kites.
