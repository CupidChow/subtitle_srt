1
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,640
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

2
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,760
For safety sake,

3
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,920
you guard the door.

4
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,440
It's like the legendary magic.

5
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,960
If this is left by your father,

6
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,840
his real identity is not simple.

7
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,700
Compared to robot men,

8
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,480
than robot figures.

9
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,880
It's been 20 to 36 years.

10
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,570
and entered the temple.

11
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:28,440
What does that mean?

12
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,040
Why are you looking at me?

13
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,400
As if I knew.

14
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,130
This is left by your father.

15
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,240
Young Master!

16
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,200
The robot monster is killing again!

17
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,000
He's invisible. I can't see him.

18
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,160
Tong Tong.

19
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,360
Tong Tong.

20
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,960
Move! Move! Move!

21
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,020
Move! Move!

22
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:53,920
Hurry up!

23
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,040
What did you do?

24
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,570
I was wondering why you were so cheeky.

25
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,440
The robot man is gone.

26
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,530
He must have gone after that thing.

27
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,720
We thought those people were killed by robot men.

28
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,840
They can also be invisible.

29
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,680
Now it seems

30
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,880
the real murderer

31
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,340
[is the invisible thing.]

32
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,040
Sir.

33
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,040
Let me ask you.

34
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,520
where this family is.

35
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,000
Sir.

36
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,560
Sir.

37
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,160
He's pretending.

38
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,680
Do you have to ask him?

39
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,480
If I punch him,

40
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,860
he will wake up.

41
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,640
No need.

42
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,040
I'll punch him.

43
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,600
he will wake up.

44
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,840
Are you asking about Guo's family?

45
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,000
They disappeared a few days ago.

46
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,780
Didn't all the missing people come back?

47
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,770
Why didn't their family come back?

48
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,320
It's not like that.

49
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,200
In the mirage,

50
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,080
only Guo Huai was missing.

51
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,250
It’s his second son.

52
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,410
an opera performer.

53
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,880
Later,

54
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,080
Mirage disappeared.

55
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,240
Everyone is back.

56
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,220
Guo Huai didn't come back.

57
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,680
The next day,

58
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,000
his family

59
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,360
disappeared for no reason.

60
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,200
So,

61
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,160
other than Guo Huai,

62
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,640
Other people's disappearance has nothing to do with Mirage.

63
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,600
The government asked several times,

64
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,000
but there was no result.

65
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,940
It doesn't matter.

66
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,440
The point is

67
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,000
I've been craving their buns these days.

68
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,720
Their boss is a menu.

69
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,200
The buns

70
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,360
is really amazing.

71
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,740
What's so special about Guo Huai?

72
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,280
Sir.

73
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,640
She means

74
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,880
is there anything different about Guo Huai?

75
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,480
Well,

76
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,640
[Special]

77
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,720
Special?

78
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,520
he’s just a performer.

79
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,480
This finger

80
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,520
is broken.

81
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,450
You need to wear a finger set when you sing.

82
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,760
Because it's golden

83
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,440
Everyone calls him golden fingers

84
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:53,840
Of course.

85
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,280
Sometimes gold is not as useful as money.

86
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,000
Take a rest.

87
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,040
Didn't I tell you

88
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,280
Don't pull a long face.

89
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,440
I heard that

90
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,320
you used to give others money.

91
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,800
You only gave them money.

92
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,160
They even scolded you.

93
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,440
You're talking about me harassing the people on the street, right?

94
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,160
I guess I don't have any good reputation.

95
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,400
I thought you'd really punch him.

96
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,600
He can't be a fool forever.

97
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,240
My father wanted to be a good official before he died.

98
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,170
Unfortunately,

99
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,340
There's no chance.

100
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,320
I believe

101
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,520
he doesn't want me to be like him.

102
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,160
How can I get in?

103
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,360
You masters

104
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,360
enter like this.

105
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,200
The room is neat.

106
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,840
There's no clue here.

107
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,240
We need to find a clue here.

108
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,570
We need someone to help.

109
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:35,880
Cao Sheng.

110
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,240
Zeng Qian.

111
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,600
Isn't she just a hunter?

112
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,040
A hunter?

113
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,800
Don't forget

114
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,740
she almost grabbed the ferry.

115
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:54,640
By the way,

116
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,960
we need to take those things

117
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,280
to Tong Tong.

118
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,560
Zeng Qian.

119
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,560
Come on.

120
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,400
Help me.

121
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,010
Let's go.

122
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:03,760
What?

123
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,320
I have something to do here.

124
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,040
What can’t Cao Sheng handle?

125
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,000
I need you here.

126
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,000
Let's go.

127
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,560
What?

128
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,400
There is such a big room in a carriage.

129
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,170
This is ridiculous.

130
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,600
According to your description,

131
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,320
the person I met with Tong

132
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,880
is the man I met in the alley.

133
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,800
I let the bad guy go again.

134
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,130
This is the second time.

135
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,760
Who's the first time?

136
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,760
The Crown Prince.

137
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,130
He killed my father.

138
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,240
I think the murder of my father

139
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,640
must be related to Guo Huai's missing case.

140
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,360
Lin Han.

141
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,680
Did you kick the door open?

142
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,720
Awesome.

143
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,080
You showed your strength right after you arrived.

144
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,000
But how do you know

145
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,520
I didn't kick the door?

146
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,900
Did you see Lin Han's footprints?

147
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,610
You're not that strong.

148
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,930
Who are you looking down on?

149
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,720
How is it?

150
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,250
Did you find anything after going around?

151
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,410
They disappeared at night.

152
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,880
How do you know it wasn't during the day?

153
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,880
On the way here, you told me

154
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,320
the Guo family's leader is a member of the state eclipse.

155
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,640
They usually do this kind of business.

156
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,680
at night.

157
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,360
The next day

158
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,400
But there's a pot of overcooked noodles here.

159
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,800
It means they didn't have time

160
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,960
had been taken away

161
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,640
before they could use it.

162
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,200
They were taken away.

163
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,800
They usually sleep at night.

164
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,120
If you go out in a hurry,

165
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,360
the bedding will be messy.

166
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,560
But their bedding

167
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,880
is too neat.

168
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,360
Someone obviously wanted to erase the traces.

169
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,420
But some of them are more than enough.

170
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,160
The whole family was caught at night.

171
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,240
Nothing happened.

172
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,650
There's only one possibility.

173
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,200
It was broken.

174
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,280
but it was mended.

175
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,320
A hole.

176
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,960
You're right.

177
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,640
I can't tell if I don't take a closer look.

178
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,170
But even if a hole is broken,

179
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,160
it's normal for them to fix it.

180
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,200
It's normal.

181
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,680
But it's so thin.

182
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,480
There's almost no trace.

183
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,120
It's abnormal.

184
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,359
It's indeed a hallucinogenic incense.

185
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,720
This family was knocked out

186
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,050
and then took them away.

187
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,160
Maze incense?

188
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,839
I've heard of some flowers picking thieves.

189
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,720
will break the window paper

190
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,359
when others are asleep.

191
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,490
Blow the incense in.

192
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,780
So this is how this hole came from.

193
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,319
This incense

194
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:26,000
smells like thorn apple and aconitum?

195
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,569
How did you know?

196
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,920
This is the knockout incense specially for the guards.

197
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,280
There is also a way to repair the windows and paper.

198
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,600
is also used by us.

199
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,480
You mean this family

200
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,720
was taken away by you?

201
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,460
Our Hans Camp has been disbanded.

202
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,120
It can't be related to them.

203
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,160
There are six ministries and 36 camps.

204
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,680
There might be other thousand guards coming to Tongzhou.

205
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,760
The guards are only responsible for capturing the criminal of the imperial court.

206
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,420
Why did they kill this family?

207
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,420
The Crown Prince should be the one who did it.

208
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,240
My father was killed to investigate this case.

209
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,420
There's a huge secret inside.

210
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,200
If there are other thousands of guards here,

211
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,820
it's not difficult

212
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,090
to find them.

213
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,280
Lin Han.

214
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,680
I want to talk to you alone.

215
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,820
I'll go upstairs to see Tong Tong.

216
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,640
I told you she's not Tong Tong.

217
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,280
But her body is...

218
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,920
Last time you mentioned

219
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,320
Father asked you to escort him to Tongzhou.

220
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,960
He gave a carriage to two trusted aides.

221
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,280
Are those two

222
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,720
Cao Ming and Cao Fu?

223
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,320
I don't know their names.

224
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,600
A man in his forties

225
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,000
in his 40s.

226
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,040
He knows kung fu.

227
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,130
The other is in his fifties.

228
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,240
Kind eyebrows

229
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,770
That's Uncle Ming and Uncle Fu.

230
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,440
Uncle Ming brought the car to Tongzhou.

231
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,090
He was killed today.

232
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,960
The money he had was exchanged in Maozhou.

233
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,520
I guess

234
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,760
Uncle Fu should be there too.

235
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,250
Do you need me to pick him up?

236
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:20,800
No.

237
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,720
You can leave it to others.

238
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,810
I'll arrange it.

239
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,770
I thought of something.

240
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,640
I want to ask him face to face.

241
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,280
By the way,

242
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,720
I've heard about

243
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,320
about your brothers.

244
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,920
They made a big fuss.

245
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,690
Shen Hui melted your gold medal

246
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,760
is Bao.

247
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,360
It's not easy to get your gold medal.

248
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,260
It's a pity if it melts.

249
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,280
And

250
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,280
give the 100,000 taels

251
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,600
to your brothers.

252
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,960
I can't accept the money.

253
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,880
Although it's hard for them,

254
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,210
but they're different.

255
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,280
what they are now

256
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,900
is directly related to my father.

257
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,200
And he left the money.

258
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,240
Consider it

259
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,840
for him.

260
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,480
With this money,

261
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,520
is enough for their family's living expenses.

262
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,650
They don't have to take risks anymore.

263
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,560
Enough, stop pretending.

264
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,000
I know she's fine.

265
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,160
I was just kidding. You even exposed me.

266
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,960
No wonder you don't have many friends.

267
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,840
Do you have any?

268
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,360
From now on,

269
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,840
one more friend is missing.

270
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,460
I'll go make the medicine.

271
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,840
You took all my stuff

272
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,280
when I wasn't sober.

273
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,890
Everyone else asked me a lot of questions.

274
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,740
Why didn't you ask?

275
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,040
You wouldn't tell me even if I asked.

276
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,440
Aren't you curious

277
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,200
if I'm still Tong Tong?

278
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,560
I hope you are.

279
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,500
Young Master really brought Tong Tong's stuff.

280
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,480
She exchanged the manuscripts with the robot men.

281
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,240
It looks weird,

282
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,850
But it's important.

283
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,000
Yes.

284
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,480
It looks useless.

285
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,240
I saw her press this

286
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,570
I saw her press this too.

287
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,240
This thing

288
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,460
can send a distress signal to the robot man quickly.

289
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,000
Because after she pressed it,

290
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,600
the robot man appeared soon.

291
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,200
No.

292
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,440
I pressed it several times.

293
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:08,120
Is the robot man coming soon?

294
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,560
I pressed it just now.

295
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,520
Tong Tong will shine when she presses it.

296
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,920
It didn't react when we pressed it.

297
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:16,960
So these things

298
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,530
can be used by Tong Tong.

299
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,440
You scared me.

300
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:27,640
It recognizes its owner.

301
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,720
Get the medicine according to this.

302
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,120
Make three bowls of water into a bowl of water.

303
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,360
and send it to the little girl right away.

304
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:34,690
Okay.

305
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,730
Come on. Come on.

306
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,780
Remember to make it with low heat.

307
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,240
Cao Sheng.

308
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,440
Zeng Qian told me that the robot monster

309
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,840
has been chasing something invisible.

310
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,200
It sounds like a ghost.

311
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,490
Is it dangerous?

312
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,720
He's inside.

313
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,560
Let's talk.

314
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,420
Tong Tong needs someone to watch her.

315
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,520
Let me do it.

316
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,040
It's invisible.

317
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,200
Is it a ghost or not?

318
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,200
It's a ghost.

319
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,800
What is that robot monster?

320
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,040
A ghost hunter.

321
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,010
The robot monster is a monster.

322
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,080
At most,

323
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,760
to catch the monster.

324
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,180
I don't know if the robot man is a monster.

325
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,480
But what can't be seen must be a monster.

326
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,040
That's weird.

327
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,080
In that case,

328
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,260
the people who died before

329
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,080
were killed by this monster.

330
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,760
The robot man was protecting them.

331
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,410
He might have been tracking that monster.

332
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,640
so he always shows up at the crime scene.

333
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,560
When I ran away with Tong Tong,

334
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,600
there was a blue light behind me.

335
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,200
Then the robot man appeared.

336
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,680
The heirloom was always on.

337
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,800
and the monster couldn't see it.

338
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,120
So I thought

339
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,120
the heirloom sensed the robot man.

340
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,000
Now it seems

341
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,200
the one chasing us should be that monster.

342
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,960
The heirloom sensed it.

343
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,720
That explains

344
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,720
why the robot man appeared

345
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,880
when the robot appeared?

346
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,200
It also explained

347
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,700
why the robot man wanted my family heirloom.

348
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,940
Because it can sense the monster.

349
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,820
But how did he know the effect of my family heirloom?

350
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,520
Apart from me,

351
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,360
knows my family heirloom better than me.

352
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,480
If everyone who went missing

353
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,080
are all like Zeng Xin and Tong Tong,

354
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,880
just like Zeng Xin and Tong Tong.

355
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,320
The robot man let them back

356
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,800
and protect them.

357
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,040
That makes sense.

358
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,920
But who are those souls?

359
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,520
Who is the monster

360
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,760
who hunted them?

361
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,120
They should know.

362
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,960
But no matter what we ask,

363
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,880
she won't tell us.

364
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,440
Her soul may not be Tong Tong,

365
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,520
but her body is...

366
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,170
No one can touch her.

367
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,520
It might be a bit selfish.

368
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,280
But...

369
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,490
I understand

370
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,300
If it were Bingxin,

371
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,980
I would be like you.

372
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,840
What should we do now?

373
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,800
She's not the only one

374
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,720
who went missing.

375
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,520
Tiger.

376
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,440
You have no idea.

377
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,280
After you went missing,

378
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,560
Master San almost turned the whole city over.

379
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,200
Do you think we're good friends?

380
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,240
You're a good friend.

381
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,040
Here's to you.

382
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,200
Just let him go.

383
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,940
The backyard is empty.

384
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,080
I know you're not Wang Hu.

385
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,810
You just occupied his body.

386
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:14,920
Tell me.

387
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,560
Who are you?

388
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,400
I don't know what you're talking about.

389
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,840
I am Wang Hu.

390
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,640
Are you hysteria?

391
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,460
I really don't know what you mean.

392
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,480
It's no use chopping my hands.

393
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,360
You won't tell me if I ask you now.

394
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,800
Because you bet I won't do it.

395
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,840
I'll tell you what will happen next.

396
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,320
I'll cut off one of your fingers.

397
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,120
It must hurt.

398
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,080
But you'll say you don't know.

399
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,000
You thought I would believe you.

400
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,400
But I won't let it go.

401
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,560
I'll cut off your second one.

402
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,680
The third one.

403
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,040
You won't be able to stand it.

404
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,050
You'll definitely say,

405
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,800
By then, your fingers will be gone.

406
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,330
And you'll never grow back.

407
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,600
You'll regret it.

408
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,970
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

409
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,400
So...

410
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,560
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

411
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,440
I'll tell you.

412
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,880
I'm not Wang Hu.

413
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,130
Then who are you?

414
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,320
I'm from

415
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,560
far away.

416
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,600
Where is it?

417
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,640
You won't know.

418
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,640
We are not from the same world.

419
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,200
We are from another world.

420
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,920
You mean

421
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,080
you're outlaws.

422
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,690
You can say that.

423
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,240
Your soul occupies Wang Hu's body.

424
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,960
Where is Wang Hu's soul?

425
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,720
What can we do

426
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,380
to bring him back to this body?

427
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,760
I don't know.

428
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,160
How did you get into this body?

429
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,200
Before I came here,

430
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,860
before I came here.

431
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,120
When I woke up,

432
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,480
I became Wang Hu.

433
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,040
I know nothing.

434
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,520
It's useless to keep you.

435
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,160
It's no use killing me.

436
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,090
If you want to know more,

437
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,560
you have to find someone.

438
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,080
Who?

439
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:41,840
Where?

440
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,760
I don't know where it is.

441
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,480
But I know

442
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,560
he was wearing a strange armor.

443
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,980
He arrived here before us.

444
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,920
He's in charge of helping us.

445
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,000
You know these symbols, right?

446
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
What does it mean?

447
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,040
No.

448
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,960
Don't force heroine to fight again.

449
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,960
These symbols

450
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,640
were abandoned long ago.

451
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,040
Only a few people know it.

452
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,080
Tell me.

453
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,280
Who knows?

454
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,800
Some...

455
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,100
some lowly people.

456
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,880
and some

457
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,650
who are knowledgeable.

458
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,120
There are many outsiders like you in Tongzhou.

459
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,820
Find me someone who knows these symbols.

460
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,500
As far as I know,

461
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:51,880
no one

462
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,240
No one knows these.

463
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,040
You can ask

464
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,480
why your handwriting is different from ours.

465
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,280
But your words

466
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,760
are the same.

467
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,440
There is

468
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,960
there is something

469
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,280
to help us.

470
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,280
We also caught a few.

471
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,680
But just like you,

472
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,960
Nothing useful.

473
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,720
They said they came from the sky.

474
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,520
Do they live in the sky?

475
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,180
The sky here doesn't mean the sky we usually see.

476
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,120
The universe is everywhere.

477
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,760
From ancient times, it's called the universe.

478
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,120
They said beyond the world,

479
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,380
outside the universe.

480
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,200
We don't know

481
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,500
what it looks like.

482
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,320
Just like the legendary fairy realm.

483
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,280
They are immortals.

484
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:45,880
Fairies?

485
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,960
The one we caught didn't even ask

486
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,080
before we even asked.

487
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,740
What kind of immortal is that?

488
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,440
The outsiders may be like us.

489
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,000
like us.

490
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,040
If that's the case,

491
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,880
Tong Tong and the robot men are strong?

492
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,600
Cao Sheng.

493
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,400
Is your father also an outsider?

494
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,400
Then you are the son of an outsider.

495
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:12,920
No wonder you're different.

496
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,240
Tell me then.

497
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,960
how is our young master different?

498
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,720
He...

499
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:17,840
is smart.

500
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,160
He also has

501
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,240
His illness?

502
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,480
I knew you'd say that.

503
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,080
Shut up!

504
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,440
Young Master.

505
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,320
Leave him alone.

506
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,800
Father.

507
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,280
Isn't that city hard to find?

508
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,920
We'll find it.

509
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,240
I asked everyone I know.

510
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,400
They've never been sick like me.

511
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:03,880
You're just different from them.

512
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,840
Why am I different from them?

513
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,480
Why should I be like them?

514
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,080
All your doubts

515
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,920
will have an answer in the future.

516
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,920
The strange things Tong brought

517
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,360
are weird.

518
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,000
It reminds me of when I was in prison.

519
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,160
when I was in prison.

520
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,500
He pointed his finger on my forehead.

521
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,580
I went outside the city in an instant.

522
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,600
Now that I think about it,

523
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,920
he used the same thing as those objects.

524
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,080
Do you really think

525
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,570
your father is an outsider?

526
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,280
If a mirage represents the arrival of an outsider,

527
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,400
then the mirage of Gao Meng

528
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,380
means they have been here.

529
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:12,719
Then,

530
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,530
my father might have...

531
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,400
After that,

532
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,600
were killed by that invisible monster.

533
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,610
The file doesn't necessarily record all of them.

534
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,960
How old are you

535
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,780
How old are you?

536
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:44,960
Are you asking

537
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,420
if my father is my biological father?

538
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,639
No matter who he is,

539
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,010
it's more important that you know who you are.

540
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,000
Yes.

541
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,720
Your past

542
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,210
is more complicated than mine.

543
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,880
I'm not afraid of the complicated past.

544
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,640
I'm afraid

545
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,880
being trapped in the past

546
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,520
in the past.

547
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,100
But the past and the present can't be separated.

548
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,160
We can't.

549
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,960
But I can sort it out.

550
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,600
Clear?

551
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,600
You're right.

552
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,960
The past is the past.

553
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,400
The present is the present.

554
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,130
Let's solve the problem first.

555
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,360
I have an idea.

556
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,360
It seems that the key

557
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,200
the key is the robot monster.

558
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,520
Tong Tong is also very important.

559
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,880
Everyone who went missing

560
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,240
She's the only one who has connections with the robot monster.

561
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:14,720
Then,

562
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,480
can we not hurt Tong Tong's body

563
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,330
and force her to tell the truth?

564
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,960
This is great.

565
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,440
Two key characters.

566
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,280
One can fight,

567
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,200
but I can't.

568
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,720
One can defeat

569
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,840
but you can't.

570
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:33,410
There's actually another breakthrough.

571
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,480
Zeng Xin.

572
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,000
He's in Wuji Monastery now.

573
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,520
Let alone if we can save him again.

574
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,320
Even if we save him,

575
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,520
can we hurt him?

576
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,650
We have to ask her first.

577
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,200
The soul of the emperor occupies the body of Zeng Xin

578
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,760
because the Emperor's previous body couldn't carry on.

579
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,240
What if the body

580
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,280
can't be used?

581
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,800
Let's catch Zeng Xin first

582
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,280
and poison his body.

583
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,640
so that his body can't be used anymore.

584
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,770
to force the soul of the emperor to leave Zeng Xin's body.

585
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,800
If the Emperor is willing to do that,

586
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,260
we'll have a chance to know how to change souls and the process.

587
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,660
We'll detoxify Zeng Xin's body then.

588
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,080
and use the same method

589
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,600
in the same way.

590
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,480
Of course,

591
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,800
this method can also be used on Tong Tong.

592
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,440
The biggest difference between Tong Tong and Zeng Xin

593
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,500
is their identity.

594
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,250
Zeng Xin is the emperor now.

595
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,200
He cherishes his life more than anyone else.

596
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,800
But after what happened last time,

597
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,240
it's impossible

598
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,970
to enter Wuji Temple again.

599
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,720
Otherwise, we wouldn't have taken the risk to kidnap the Crown Prince.

600
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,920
I told you before.

601
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,560
Wuji Monastery is not suitable to attack by force.

602
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,200
We can only take advantage of it.

603
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,480
Last time we took advantage of the footwork.

604
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,410
We didn't have a chance after that.

605
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,120
Now it's the chance.

606
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,840
We can take advantage of Tong Tong.

607
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,770
What do you mean?

608
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,280
Even if we can enter Wuji Temple,

609
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,160
the emperor has a robot now.

610
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,760
What if the robot man is gone?

611
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,400
Feng Buyan and Zeng Qian

612
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,560
with Zeng Qian.

613
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,600
Tong Tong.

614
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,490
I'll call you Tong Tong.

615
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,240
I don't know who you are,

616
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,360
but come with me.

617
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:26,520
Where?

618
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,040
Somewhere quiet.

619
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,850
I have something to ask you.

620
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,280
Cao Sheng’s idea is good.

621
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:41,560
Oh no.

622
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,320
Lin Han is still inside.

623
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,320
I didn't tell her.

624
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,700
What are you doing?

625
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,640
She's not Tong Tong.

626
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,880
Feng Buwei is not here.

627
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,210
You can't take her away.

628
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,200
Leave her to me.

629
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,260
I have a way to make her tell the truth.

630
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,600
Not only for my brother,

631
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,200
but also your real daughter.

632
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,900
I know what you're going to do.

633
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,600
What would you do

634
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,040
what would you do?

635
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,520
Where are you going?

636
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,320
Go home first.

637
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,280
What about your mother?

638
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,740
I'll explain to her later.

639
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,210
It's not safe for you to be here.

640
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,720
Stop acting.

641
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,560
Let's go.

642
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,120
You're acting.

643
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,760
I forgot to tell you.

644
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,360
I'm sorry.

645
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,280
You should have known

646
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,340
Lin Han doesn't know our plan, right?

647
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:05,880
Yes.

648
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,840
But I think this is more real.

649
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,240
Okay.

650
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,080
The plan has started.

651
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,200
Keep a distance.

652
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,600
Don't hurt Mr. Cao.

653
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,260
The four brothers at the back,

654
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,560
Don't step on the rope.

655
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,440
Be careful.

656
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,280
Keep a distance from Mr. Cao.

657
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,440
And look at the speed of this wheel.

658
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,240
Okay.

659
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,000
Okay.

660
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,360
I'll leave the key to you.

661
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,760
I rented this house.

662
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,880
Stay here for a few more days.

663
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,900
Why don't you stay at home?

664
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,040
You have to live here.

665
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,120
It's safer for you to stay here now.

666
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,120
Are you worried about that monster?

667
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,720
I'm worried about Zeng Qian.

668
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,320
Now I put all your things on the table.

669
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,090
But you can't take them.

670
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,460
You're faster than me.

671
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,620
This necklace looks like a necklace for you to leave Tongzhou.

672
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,410
But we're less than ten miles away from Tongzhou.

673
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,760
You won't need it for the time being.

674
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,960
You sent this message to the robot man for help.

675
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,600
I don't know what these two are for now.

676
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,320
Anyway, I'll keep these for you.

677
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,920
I'll take them out when you're in danger.

678
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,240
At least

679
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,340
you can call the robot man in time.

680
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,580
I'm afraid that monster has come.

681
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,220
the robot man won't be able to save me.

682
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,520
That's better than taking you away now.

683
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,400
This is a kind of poison used by the Guard.

684
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,320
It's very poisonous.

685
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,560
It won't take effect immediately.

686
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,620
There is antidote.

687
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,120
It should reach the effect you want.

688
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,120
Your hand

689
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,000
To make this kind of poison,

690
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,060
needs a herb called Fairy Residence.

691
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,840
to crush it and mix it in it.

692
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:56,250
It can delay the time of the poison.

693
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,210
This herb is not poisonous,

694
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,840
but it has corrosion.

695
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,200
So...

696
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:03,560
It's okay.

697
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,320
I'll be fine in a few days.

698
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,010
Why do you have to smash it with your hands?

699
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,440
Because the temperature on your hands

700
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,040
can stimulate its medicine.

701
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,360
It can't be replaced.

702
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,240
Good. Very good.

703
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:20,970
We'll do it again later.

704
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:21,800
Bao.

705
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,600
Your buddies are professional.

706
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:25,800
Of course.

707
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,330
We need to be professional.

708
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,960
They used to

709
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,360
practising acrobatics.

710
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,520
Why are they

711
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:33,760
follow me now?

712
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,680
But it's not bad to follow me.

713
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,000
They have their own houses by the beach.

714
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,960
They rob the rich and help the poor.

715
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,880
Don't tell me you're poor.

716
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,000
Don't say that.

717
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,720
We have hands and feet.

718
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,280
We can make a living on our own.

719
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,880
Let's get down to business.

720
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,210
You don't need to worry about these ropes.

721
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,040
Isn't your plan at night?

722
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:56,840
By then,

723
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,800
we'll paint these ropes black.

724
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,460
The brothers pulling the rope

725
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,760
will also make them wear black clothes.

726
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:04,280
A little further away.

727
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,160
I'm sure it'll be the same when you fly.

728
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,490
The button is loose.

729
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,520
Don't frown.

730
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,880
Don't forget that I was the one

731
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:25,600
was me too.

732
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:29,720
Young Master.

733
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,840
Why don't I go?

734
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:34,080
Look.

735
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,280
I still know kung fu.

736
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,760
I also practiced

737
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:38,720
Me too.

738
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:42,360
You just want to be as tall as that robot.

739
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,640
I'm almost the same.

740
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:46,640
I can put it higher.

741
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,410
Don't worry.

742
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,800
This is not my first time hijacking the emperor.

743
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,480
He's not as good as me.

744
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,280
By the way,

745
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,520
Remember to prepare the needle.

746
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,680
Long or short?

747
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:02,940
Just like last time

748
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,840
It's long again

749
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:37,800
It looks like him

750
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:41,720
Come in.

751
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,570
I caught a thousand guards.

752
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:54,360
As expected, there are other thousands of guards in Langzhou.

753
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,200
The Yu army?

754
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,960
When the Crown Prince took people to kidnap Zeng Xin,

755
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,480
according to your description,

756
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,200
he has a female guard.

757
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,520
Now it seems

758
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,600
he should be the commander of the Yu army.

759
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:05,400
Nangong Yu.

760
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,920
How did you catch her men?

761
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:10,140
We have our own contact information.

762
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:12,640
Zeng Qian.

763
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:14,920
No.

764
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:16,340
Your Highness.

765
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:17,560
Where is Bao's makeup?

766
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:18,600
I've done it.

767
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,840
What if there's nothing else?

768
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,300
I need to go out for a while.

769
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,160
You may leave.

770
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,360
Learn well.

771
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:27,160
Wait.

772
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:30,640
You have to disguise as another person.

773
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,400
Who else?

774
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,360
It’s not you.

775
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:03,960
Did you catch

776
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,160
Did you catch them?

777
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:08,650
Why did you arrest them?

778
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,200
We're friends.

779
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,730
I know it's useless to torture you.

780
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,200
I'll give you some time to think about it.

781
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,040
When the dog finishes this pancake,

782
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,400
if you don't tell me,

783
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,240
I'll kill you.

784
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:33,600
Report!

785
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,200
Lin Han.

786
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:26,720
I think I don't need to change my face.

787
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,400
Mr. Xie is in Tongzhou.

788
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:30,880
Stop it.

789
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,780
I know what you want to say.

790
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,000
I'm so famous, right?

791
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,320
Hearing that makes my ears ache.

792
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,400
But you asked me to act for you.

793
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,840
Why didn't you tell me?

794
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,880
It's useless to torture the Guard.

795
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:43,940
It can only be used.

796
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,320
The play just now

797
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,360
will make him think we've got the whereabouts of Guo Huai's family.

798
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,960
He will report it when he goes back.

799
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:52,960
If Guo Huai and his family are really in the hands of Yu,

800
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,240
they will send someone to transfer them.

801
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:56,560
I let them go,

802
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,320
but in fact, he'll take us

803
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,800
He will take us to where we should go.

804
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:03,120
I'll follow him.

805
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:04,000
Follow my mark.

806
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,280
You can still catch up after running so far?

807
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,210
I don't understand your password.

808
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,650
Give me some time to get changed, okay?

809
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:24,680
It's not good.

810
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:26,860
I have no appetite.

811
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,010
The owner of this house is back.

812
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,360
Maybe he came back to get something.

813
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:46,880
Here you are.

814
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:47,920
Call for help.

815
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,490
We're going to run away.

816
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,120
Aren't we too easily exposed?

817
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:25,880
Hush.

818
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,520
He's sleeping at a bad time.

819
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:34,970
It shouldn't be.

820
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,810
I already had an injection.

821
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:42,400
What is this?

822
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:14,080
Young Master!

823
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:15,280
Young Master.

824
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,640
Why don't we go back first?

825
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:17,900
Wait until he wakes up.

826
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:34,920
It's too late.

827
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:36,720
If we don't act tonight,

828
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,560
I'm afraid there won't be a chance in the future.

829
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:40,090
I'll go in for Young Master.

830
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,200
I'm not tall enough.

831
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,400
You two find something to put me higher.

832
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,000
You may leave.

833
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:39,840
Yes.

834
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:53,360
Don't move!

835
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:01,290
This body belongs to your brother.

836
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,010
Are you willing to do it?

837
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,680
The soul is yours.

838
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,320
Will it hurt if I stab you?

839
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,440
Let's find a place

840
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:11,180
Let's talk.

841
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:15,040
Over there.

842
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:23,480
Hurry up.

843
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:32,760
Take it out.

844
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:38,320
Take care of it.

845
00:57:58,320 --> 00:57:59,560
I'll leave this to you.

846
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:00,520
I'll keep watch.

847
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,320
Golden finger.

848
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,770
This person should be Guo Huai.

849
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,680
But why is he alone?

850
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:02,880
What about his family?

851
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:06,680
What's so special about this clown?

852
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,920
Guard Chun must kill him.

853
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,440
I saw someone last time.

854
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:24,680
When he held the knife,

855
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,240
when he holds a knife.

856
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:28,730
Who is it?

857
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:35,320
King of Jingnan

858
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,440
His five fingers are healthy,

859
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:44,970
but only with four fingers.

860
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,360
As the emperor,

861
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:50,360
as the emperor.

862
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:53,400
You kidnapped me twice!

863
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:00,500
This is a bottle of poison.

864
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,170
It works immediately after taking it.

865
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:05,400
Within 12 hours,

866
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:08,080
your skin will be itchy

867
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:11,120
coughing, organs and other symptoms.

868
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,040
After 12 hours,

869
01:00:14,840 --> 01:00:16,520
you will die of ulcer.

870
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:21,120
So that's what you meant.

871
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:24,320
You want to force my soul

872
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:26,440
from this body?

873
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:29,040
So,

874
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:30,890
you must have the antidote.

875
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:32,840
If I don't obey,

876
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:37,960
will you watch your brother's body decay?

877
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:39,560
If you don't come out,

878
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,820
my brother is no different from dead.

879
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,520
It's useless to keep this body.

880
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,080
You're the king of the world.

881
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:49,240
My brother is just a civilian.

882
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,360
You want to bet?

883
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:52,640
Sure.

884
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:55,120
In the afterlife,

885
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:56,720
my brother has an emperor.

886
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:58,640
It's quite rare.

887
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,720
I thought it was strange.

888
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:05,760
Now that I think about it,

889
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:09,560
so many people's bodies were occupied by other souls.

890
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:11,360
Will King of Jingnan be the same?

891
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,800
His soul has become Guo Huai's.

892
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:18,560
Guo Huai lost his finger.

893
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:21,120
So when he held the knife,

894
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:23,760
his index finger didn't use any strength.

895
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:33,240
What was that sound

896
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:36,100
What is the emperor doing inside?

897
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:12,600
You may leave.

898
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:13,680
Yes.

899
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:26,540
The emperor knows kung fu.

900
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:37,240
If this Guo Huai

901
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:38,600
was this Guo Huai,

902
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:41,440
Where is the real King of Jingnan

903
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:43,200
is?

904
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:58,560
Didn't you say

905
01:02:58,760 --> 01:02:59,680
the emperor

906
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:01,480
Don't you know kung fu?
