1
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,680
This is it.

2
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:27,840
There's no road ahead.

3
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,120
We need to walk from here.

4
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,120
But first we need to find some tools.

5
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,210
I really couldn't find your knife.

6
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,000
If you're not comfortable with other weapons,

7
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,160
I can find you a nice treasure.

8
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,400
During the great battle between Dian and Dayin,

9
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,079
the county office collected many items.

10
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,540
I remember there's a knife similar to yours.

11
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,040
However, it's been in storage for many years,

12
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,040
not sure if it's still usable.

13
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,040
It might be rusty.

14
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,720
I'll get some plant ash later

15
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,450
to polish it.

16
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,090
I guarantee you'll like it.

17
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,600
This is Manzhudai.

18
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,620
I thought Manzhudai was supposed to be a flower.

19
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,200
And that its petals have five colors.

20
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,850
This clearly looks like a vine.

21
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,200
And a very ordinary one at that.

22
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,690
It looks similar to morning glory.

23
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,960
I don't quite understand it either.

24
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,760
When I was little, my father told me it was a flower.

25
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,360
But I've never seen it bloom.

26
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,360
No wonder it was hard to find.

27
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,560
This thing looks nothing like its name.

28
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,520
This thing you taught me to make,

29
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,960
I told my father about it that night when I got home.

30
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,200
He said he knew how to make it too,

31
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,400
but there was no need.

32
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,800
Because our duty

33
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,920
is not just to water the Manzhudai,

34
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,640
but more importantly to protect it.

35
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,200
So,

36
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,200
it wasn't until we were attacked

37
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,660
and had to flee Jiuyuan Mountain in disguise

38
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,180
that I finally used it.

39
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,520
I come back to check on it from time to time.

40
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,240
If Manzhudai is truly related to the mineral,

41
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,040
then let's see

42
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,500
if it's as we expected.

43
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,720
The secret

44
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,200
must be beneath the soil.

45
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,280
This is an alienation vessel.

46
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,600
I think I saw it in that room with the carriage.

47
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,240
You said

48
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,180
it's used for alienating ore.

49
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,600
Does that mean

50
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,280
there's ore underneath?

51
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,380
This must be the so-called pearl ore.

52
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,800
This is alienated pearl ore.

53
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,290
Normal pearl ore

54
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,960
isn't this color.

55
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,720
The tree oil flows down from the top of this tree.

56
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,200
On the surface, they're watering the Manzhu Dai plant,

57
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,060
but in reality,

58
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,640
the tree oil seeps into the mutation dish below,

59
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,370
activating the mutation dish.

60
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,160
Mutation ore.

61
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,450
When I was about 4 or 5 years old,

62
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,210
my father brought me here to water the Manzhu Dai.

63
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,800
He said he was about the same age

64
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,680
when his grandfather brought him here.

65
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,520
This means

66
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,760
this mutation dish has been here for decades at least.

67
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,880
And Cao Jiande, as one of your first immigrants,

68
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,340
arrived only 23 years ago.

69
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,040
So...

70
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,260
This mutation dish

71
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,700
wasn't created by Cao Jiande.

72
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,600
He merely discovered it.

73
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,340
The mutation ore incident

74
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,040
happened before Cao Jiande arrived in your world.

75
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,000
The mutation ore is connected to that monster.

76
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,130
Unless that monster

77
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,120
existed before you all arrived.

78
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,120
That's unlikely.

79
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,210
In that carriage house,

80
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,480
there are many of Cao Jiande's investigation records.

81
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,940
He was absolutely certain

82
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,920
that the monster only appeared after he arrived here.

83
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,600
This whole thing is quite strange.

84
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,080
Like Xie Jingtang's family heirloom,

85
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,200
it predates the monster's appearance,

86
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,400
and by many years.

87
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,040
These things don't matter to us now.

88
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,280
According to Baili Yuan,

89
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,170
Manzhu Dai is the highest grade of Manzhu.

90
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,320
This means that underneath,

91
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,690
the mineral deposits are extremely vast.

92
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,720
So vast that even this transformation vessel,

93
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,760
which has been working here for decades,

94
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,960
or even a century, hasn't completed the transformation.

95
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,640
That's why Cao Jiande painstakingly

96
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,770
researched methods to accelerate it.

97
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,800
This transformation vessel combined with his acceleration method

98
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,400
might

99
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,970
actually be able

100
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,760
to completely transform all these minerals.

101
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,720
So in that case,

102
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,980
these two items are truly important to the King of Jingnan.

103
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,640
The same goes for Baili Yuan.

104
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,040
Having them is important,

105
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,170
not having them is equally important.

106
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,320
My father and your father knew each other long ago.

107
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,000
So when Baili Yuan sent people to attack you,

108
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,200
my father sent Feng Buhai to rescue you.

109
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,320
Their acquaintance

110
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,400
was very likely also because of the minerals.

111
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,660
The approximate time.

112
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,250
That was the year we met.

113
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,840
It was our first time at Jiuyuan Mountain.

114
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,040
But he never came to my home.

115
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,600
In my memory,

116
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:05,800
my father

117
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,490
never brought strangers home.

118
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,400
Besides my father,

119
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,680
Baili Yuan,

120
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:14,940
He Xiguang,

121
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,200
and even the Prince of Jingnan all coveted these minerals.

122
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,360
They were probably worried about exposing the minerals,

123
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,890
so they kept their distance from your father.

124
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,260
Thinking about it now,

125
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,520
I finally understand why my father

126
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,780
rushed me away from Jiuyuan Mountain so hastily back then.

127
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,460
He must have realized we were seeing each other.

128
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,460
He made me cut off contact with you

129
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,260
probably to prevent the ore from being exposed.

130
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,160
Brother Chong,

131
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,200
you're amazing!

132
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,260
You've been such a great help to us today.

133
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,720
Tomorrow I'll bring meat rolls.

134
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,850
They're delicious.

135
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,730
Sounds good.

136
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,490
See you then.

137
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:04,840
Young master,

138
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,440
Looking at it this way,

139
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,040
your meeting with each other

140
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,280
might seem like coincidence,

141
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,160
but in reality,

142
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,540
it was inevitable.

143
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,240
Now that you have this mutation vessel,

144
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,640
you have enough leverage

145
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,850
to negotiate with the King of Jingnan.

146
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,650
How is the master doing?

147
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,600
You don't need to worry too much.

148
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,400
I've already consulted a fortune teller.

149
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,080
This time,

150
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,320
the master will surely turn misfortune into good fortune.

151
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,850
This is just a small hurdle.

152
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,400
His major crisis will come at age 84.

153
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,140
They're

154
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,040
They're here.

155
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,600
What's wrong?

156
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,400
Brothers,

157
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,040
my Bro Bao is back!

158
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,960
Why are you all hanging out here?

159
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,640
Hello, Bao.

160
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,760
I came all the way back from Chenzhou,

161
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,080
and you guys show no excitement at all.

162
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,680
I even brought you some Chenzhou roasted buns.

163
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,880
Now you're eager when there's food.

164
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,240
Tell me,

165
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,360
what's really going on with you all?

166
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,560
It's nothing really,

167
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,360
just that many beggars have come to town lately

168
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,820
and took over our old spot.

169
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,380
Didn't you mention my name, Bao Mingliu?

170
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,200
I'll go sort this out for you.

171
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,700
How many of them are there?

172
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,120
Just three.

173
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,640
You bunch of cowards.

174
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,080
Thirty.

175
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,040
Let's eat first.

176
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,340
How are things on your end?

177
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,240
You may leave.

178
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,360
Yes, sir.

179
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,050
Your timing is impeccable.

180
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,720
If you had come one day later,

181
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,780
I would have returned to the capital.

182
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,130
Considering the generous gift we sent you a few days ago,

183
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,380
we deserve a little more of your patience, don't we?

184
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,610
This gift you've brought today

185
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,920
seems rather small.

186
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,690
You should recognize this.

187
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,880
Transformed ore.

188
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,580
So you've obtained the transformation vessel.

189
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,240
But

190
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,960
why give me only this?

191
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,760
Is it because you couldn't afford a bigger box?

192
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,020
In a high-stakes game,

193
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,450
only chips are placed on the table.

194
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,130
No one puts their silver

195
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,520
directly on display.

196
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,210
Taking over Qingfeng Tower

197
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,319
would be child's play for me.

198
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,130
Alienation vessel.

199
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,450
Is it really at Qingfeng Tower?

200
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,540
If you're not sincere,

201
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,130
we can hand it over to Baili Yuan

202
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,839
without any trouble.

203
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,040
You people

204
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,120
are getting more and more interesting.

205
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,080
Guanying,

206
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,360
I made you a new pair of shoes

207
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,880
for convenience

208
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,540
when you travel far from home.

209
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,760
This time you went away

210
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,600
saying you were going on a long journey,

211
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,360
and you've been gone for so many days

212
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,440
without any news.

213
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,720
Where have you all been?

214
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,140
I went to see an old friend.

215
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,200
Grandma,

216
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,640
I asked my father to spend a few more days with me.

217
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,170
I'm sorry for making you worry.

218
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,800
On our journey,

219
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,860
we had lots of delicious food,

220
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,100
and Father bought me many fun things.

221
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,080
Really?

222
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,360
Tell me all about it.

223
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,240
We...

224
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,560
We passed by a river

225
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,560
and caught quite a few fish.

226
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,820
We even grill it to eat.

227
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,080
I see.

228
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,880
There's actually technique to grilling fish.

229
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,410
We use fruit tree branches to skewer the fish.

230
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:27,340
This way, the fish will have the fragrance of fruit wood when grilled.

231
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,800
Catching fish is quite interesting too.

232
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,860
At first, I couldn't catch any at all.

233
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,440
Later my father told me not to use my hands.

234
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,620
He used tree branches.

235
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,880
Made a fork.

236
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,120
He could spear one with each try.

237
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,040
Have some dumplings.

238
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,920
Just put them on the table.

239
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,380
I'll go get some hot water.

240
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:51,440
Mom,

241
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,680
I'll cook the rest of the dumplings.

242
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,680
You should rest for a while.

243
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,400
It rained the day before yesterday.

244
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,080
I don't know if our roof is leaking again.

245
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,560
Go back and check.

246
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,730
Why haven't I heard Young Master Xie these past few days?

247
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,080
He went out and hasn't returned yet.

248
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,920
Tongtong took the mutation vessel.

249
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,280
She must be trying to leave the city now.

250
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,260
Although you suffered heavy losses at Baili Manor,

251
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,530
you must have learned quite a bit of inside information.

252
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,400
When a person's body

253
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,840
is occupied by someone else's soul,

254
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,880
the original soul gets suppressed.

255
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,530
It's essentially dead,

256
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,380
and there's no way to bring it back through reverse operation.

257
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,360
This fact

258
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,040
you should already know.

259
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,680
You sent the Crown Prince to Baili Manor as an undercover agent.

260
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,280
Though the objective wasn't achieved,

261
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,880
it wasn't entirely useless.

262
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,660
At least we gathered quite a bit of information.

263
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,880
I've been confidently telling you

264
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,320
that I could bring back the real Zeng Xin

265
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,240
and Tongtong.

266
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,160
Now you must realize I was lying.

267
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,400
But you still came to me,

268
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,760
which means

269
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,890
someone can help you with the reverse operation.

270
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,120
It must be Tongtong, right?

271
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,920
To be precise,

272
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,320
it should be

273
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,800
the extraterrestrial being occupying Tongtong's body.

274
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,960
You don't seem surprised at all.

275
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,560
Cao Jiande told me

276
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,000
that reverse control is possible,

277
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,920
but he couldn't do it.

278
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,450
He Xiguang and the two Jiya couldn't do it either.

279
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,280
Tongtong can do it.

280
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,800
It is surprising,

281
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,600
but also not surprising.

282
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,900
Since we've come this far,

283
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,090
our terms are quite simple for you.

284
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,080
You just need to have your Jiya

285
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,880
control the mirage to come here,

286
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,000
remove the protection on the mirage,

287
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,640
and let us enter that city.

288
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,440
Afterward, we'll give you the mutation vessel

289
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,040
and tell you the location of the Jiuyuan Mountain ore.

290
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,640
This way, with the mutation vessel

291
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,160
and the acceleration diagram,

292
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,680
you can mutate all the ore.

293
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,880
Baili Yuan won't be able to refine Qiu stones

294
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,280
and won't be able to resist the monsters.

295
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,480
The extraterrestrial beings

296
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,640
won't be able to gain a foothold in our world.

297
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,440
You'll essentially be in an invincible position.

298
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,380
What was that phrase you used?

299
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:27,940
Let me think...

300
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,560
I think it's worth it for you.

301
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,200
Then I also thank you

302
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,320
for thinking of me.

303
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,960
Tongtong stole the mutation vessel and left Qingfeng Tower.

304
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,360
Feng and the others are chasing after them.

305
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,000
You've been tricked again.

306
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,220
Why do you say 'again'?

307
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,720
Maybe because you never learn from your mistakes.

308
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,300
Don't try to drive a wedge between us.

309
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,090
First of all,

310
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,080
Tongtong is on our side now.

311
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,600
Secondly,

312
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,490
the mutation vessel

313
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,760
was never at Qingfeng Tower to begin with.

314
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,360
It's darkest under the lamp.

315
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,160
You're surely counting on luck.

316
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,040
Besides,

317
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,580
are you so certain that Tongtong is on your side?

318
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,140
Not even a bit of doubt?

319
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,680
Just because Baili Yuan wanted to have her killed,

320
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,280
but she still survived?

321
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:37,040
What if this is just a ruse they planned together?

322
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,730
Zeng Qian and Feng Buhai have already gone after her.

323
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,040
However,

324
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,520
if Tongtong is really in league with Baili Yuan,

325
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,800
then trying to intercept her

326
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,380
will be difficult.

327
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,400
You could step in.

328
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,930
I was talking about myself.

329
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,410
It's difficult.

330
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,370
Think about the consequences.

331
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,760
If Baili Yuan gets the Transformation Vessel,

332
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,940
then my minerals will be useless.

333
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,840
And you all

334
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,760
won't be of much use either.

335
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:39,760
Fine.

336
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,970
You just rest well here,

337
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,260
I'll go clean up your mess.

338
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,400
Perhaps

339
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,080
Tongtong told you everything.

340
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,880
But there's one thing

341
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,800
she will never tell you.

342
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,210
The so-called reverse control

343
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,720
is to awaken the original soul of the body

344
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,960
and then expel the soul that has occupied it.

345
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,320
The expelled soul returns to the mirage realm,

346
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,640
but the mirage has its limitations.

347
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,580
It cannot help them find a body a second time.

348
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,480
In 15 days

349
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,720
they will vanish.

350
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,240
This means

351
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,040
once the real Zengxin and Tongtong return,

352
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,720
both I and the current Tongtong will die.

353
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:34,960
So

354
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,680
Tongtong will never help you.

355
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:38,980
Neither will I.

356
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,060
The path you're taking

357
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,360
has been a dead end

358
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,040
from the very beginning.

359
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,460
The journey has been long.

360
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,080
Now

361
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,640
it's over.

362
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,480
Time to change shifts, guys.

363
00:26:59,520 --> 00:26:59,960
Chen,

364
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,130
look over there.

365
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,850
You eat my roasted buns then pretend you don't see me?

366
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:29,810
Brother Bao,

367
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:30,900
look at the sky.

368
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,480
Xiaoqiang,

369
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,840
you've been here for several days now,

370
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,700
why are you still so slow-witted?

371
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,480
Boss.

372
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:47,920
Look.

373
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,370
What am I looking at?

374
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,680
That old woman must have planned this,

375
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,610
or we would have caught up with her.

376
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,920
I have something here.

377
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:35,280
You need to deliver it to He Xiguang or Baili Yuan.

378
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,240
Here.

379
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:00,760
Good dog.

380
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,920
Why is its coat looking poor lately?

381
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,040
Later,

382
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,600
feed it more fish oil.

383
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,240
Yes, Master He.

384
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,040
Sir.

385
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,540
I don't know if he's alive or dead.

386
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,320
We anticipated this outcome when we sent him.

387
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,490
At least we got the item.

388
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,880
Go report to Master Baili now.

389
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,560
The time has come.

390
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,040
We can proceed with our plan.

391
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:50,760
Yes.

392
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,040
The city is under lockdown.

393
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,160
Anyone who leaves their home without permission

394
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,960
will be executed without mercy.

395
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,650
The city is under lockdown.

396
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,200
Anyone who leaves their home without permission

397
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,000
will be executed without mercy.

398
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Brother-in-law!

399
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,920
Don't arrest him!

400
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,920
You can't take him!

401
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,520
Let him go!

402
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,850
Go back quickly!

403
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,880
Brother-in-law!

404
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:24,840
Sister!

405
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,120
Brother-in-law!

406
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,280
Next.

407
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,240
Liang Zhaodi,

408
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,680
Pailou South Street.

409
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,130
Move.

410
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:44,610
Sit down.

411
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,080
Father,

412
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:51,640
Father,

413
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,700
come back quickly!

414
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,480
Get down,

415
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,200
hurry up.

416
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:21,640
Get down.

417
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,280
Hurry up.

418
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,080
Stop talking.

419
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,000
Move.

420
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:32,820
Keep up.

421
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,480
Let us out!

422
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,080
Why are you arresting us?

423
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,400
I want to leave!

424
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,800
Let us out!

425
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,280
Don't move.

426
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,240
Let us out!

427
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:02,520
Scout report:

428
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,360
Baili Yuan is leading his troops toward Dengzhou.

429
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,850
Chengzhou City.

430
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,420
What are you doing?

431
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,600
Lord Baili has brought only a few dozen men.

432
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,360
It's truly puzzling.

433
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,560
Lord Baili has brought only a few dozen men.

434
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,280
It's truly puzzling.

435
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,800
It's just to show my sincerity.

436
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,680
To demonstrate that I have no hostile intentions.

437
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,120
And I disregard my personal safety.

438
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,160
It's just to show my sincerity.

439
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,240
To show that I have no hostile intentions

440
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,530
and disregard my personal safety.

441
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,320
I hope you can show mercy to the outsiders.

442
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:02,160
Please show mercy to the outsiders.

443
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,960
Your words sound quite rehearsed.

444
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,520
You know the outsiders

445
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,520
are watching through He Xiguang's eyes,

446
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,600
don't you?

447
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,570
Your words are so well-practiced.

448
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,320
You know the outsiders

449
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,000
are watching through He Xiguang's eyes,

450
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,440
aren't they?

451
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,480
Lord Baili Yuan's concern for the safety of the outsiders

452
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,560
is truly touching.

453
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,360
So,

454
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,170
did you bring the Transformation Vessel?

455
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:34,080
I can willingly give you what you want.

456
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,080
But how can you guarantee that after getting it,

457
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,680
the outsiders will be safely released?

458
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,280
Their 60-day deadline has arrived.

459
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,320
Why don't

460
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,810
you release them from Dengzhou first,

461
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,440
and then I'll give you what you want?

462
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,280
Young Master.

463
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,160
Where are the others?

464
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,000
They're outside.

465
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,240
Wuji Temple really has little defense now.

466
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:17,770
Let's go.

467
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,800
Young Master.

468
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,040
You never removed the needles, did you?

469
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:53,760
I did.

470
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,920
These are new ones I inserted later.

471
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,860
You didn't remove them at all.

472
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,160
It's fine.

473
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,160
We'll be at the mirage soon anyway.
