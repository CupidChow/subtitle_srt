1
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:20,600
Miss,

2
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,980
give us seven vegetable buns.

3
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,360
Here are your seven vegetable buns.

4
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,160
Miss,

5
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,880
who taught you to do business like this?

6
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,280
Are you her guardian?

7
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,240
We're here to buy buns,

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,100
not to play house with your child.

9
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,360
Since you're so straightforward,

10
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,820
I'll tell you about a place

11
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,320
where you can stay.

12
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,200
Sister.

13
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,240
Why don't we rest here for a few more days?

14
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,970
We've been traveling for days.

15
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,220
Here you go.

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:00,840
Thank you.

17
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,340
Take it.

18
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,039
Anything else to add?

19
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,800
Your business is booming like the sun!

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,200
Thank you, thank you.

21
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:22,720
Here.

22
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,840
Here you are.

23
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,460
The vendor is generous

24
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,360
and masters the universe.

25
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,760
Standing strong on all sides.

26
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,960
Thank you. Thank you.

27
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:43,920
Tongtong.

28
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,520
Sanwen.

29
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,810
Let's close up early today.

30
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,280
Wearing a black bamboo hat on his head,

31
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,400
scars on his face like a monster,

32
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,560
stupid child with no mother's love,

33
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,800
and a blind old woman at home.

34
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,920
Stupid child.

35
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,160
Big monster,

36
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,240
stupid kid with no mother's love,

37
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,440
and a blind old woman at home.

38
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,160
Tongtong,

39
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,920
you're back.

40
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,520
Grandma.

41
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,690
Grandma.

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,660
Let me do it.

43
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,740
Then I'll go prepare the vegetables.

44
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,280
Guanying,

45
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,380
we're out of firewood.

46
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,840
Could you go outside and get some?

47
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,360
Okay.

48
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,200
How many times have I told you?

49
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,920
I can't stand that noise.

50
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,400
Be more careful next time.

51
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,079
You always say that.

52
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,160
Liar.

53
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,840
You two.

54
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,560
Mother-in-law,

55
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,820
have more vegetables.

56
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,960
How were the sales of the buns today?

57
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,760
All sold out.

58
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,290
Mother-in-law,

59
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,200
your buns are really popular.

60
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,960
Why can't you eat again?

61
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,120
How can someone your size not finish a few buns?

62
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,240
Good thing I'm still growing.

63
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,000
Tell mother-in-law tomorrow

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,320
to make fewer of them.

65
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,340
Why should I be the one to tell her?

66
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,690
I'm not good with words.

67
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,850
How can you, as a father, keep teaching your child to lie?

68
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,000
We're almost out of lamp oil.

69
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,200
I'll go get some more.

70
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,040
Wait.

71
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,520
That's not fair.

72
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,000
You ambushed me.

73
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,300
Let's go again.

74
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,400
Forget it.

75
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,480
I was just playing dead.

76
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,159
How did you see through it?

77
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:35,680
No one flies several yards away

78
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,680
without spilling a drop of lamp oil.

79
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,600
Well, that lamp oil costs money too.

80
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,159
Money can't buy life.

81
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,940
Then why did you hit me so hard?

82
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,450
That kick was actually gentle for you.

83
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,680
Remember,

84
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,120
at all times,

85
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,000
you must stay vigilant.

86
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,000
You're the famous Ye Yao.

87
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,700
I follow you every day.

88
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,250
What danger could there be?

89
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,720
I can't be with you forever.

90
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,680
Do you have something on your mind?

91
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,000
Also,

92
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,200
you washed off your drawn eyebrows again.

93
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,560
Still dressed so flashy?

94
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,490
Aren't you afraid of being caught?

95
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,280
Let me discuss something with you.

96
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,160
Can I beat up those kids?

97
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,280
No.

98
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,820
I'll cover my face.

99
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,080
No.

100
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,160
What if I walk on stilts like an adult?

101
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,920
They definitely won't recognize me.

102
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,159
No.

103
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,200
The imperial edict General Baili received today

104
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,600
is already the fifth one.

105
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,400
If we cannot

106
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,200
eliminate these rebels by the end of the month,

107
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,200
even if we eventually win this war,

108
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,600
General Baili will still be punished for ineffective suppression of the rebellion.

109
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,730
These rebels number in the thousands.

110
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,360
Even though this area is vast with few people and dense forests,

111
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,160
how have they managed to disappear without a trace?

112
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,960
Anyway, now the burden falls on our Captain Tabai.

113
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,840
We have ten days left until the end of the month.

114
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,440
If we cannot find the rebels,

115
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,760
we will be the first ones to be punished.

116
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,280
Let's split up.

117
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,040
You two cross the Huo River first.

118
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,700
You can look after each other.

119
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,880
I'll go to Tiger Head Mountain.

120
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,120
We'll meet at Black Wind Valley in two days.

121
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,520
Be careful going into the mountains alone.

122
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,040
The same goes for you two.

123
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,730
Water is scarce near Tiger Head Mountain.

124
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,680
Take extra water with you.

125
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,320
Found it! Found it!

126
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,600
(Qianji Guards are entering the city tonight)

127
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,720
Come.

128
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,600
Commander Lin, please.

129
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,640
Take the seat of honor.

130
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,000
You're too kind, Magistrate Xie.

131
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,160
Not at all.

132
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,480
Commander Lin and your team carry important duties

133
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,040
and have traveled a long way.

134
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,760
How could I dare to neglect you?

135
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,460
This isn't enough?

136
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,720
It's wasteful.

137
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,000
Then you...

138
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,160
Magistrate Xie, you may not know

139
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,240
that when we Qianji Guards travel on duty,

140
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,800
we always bring our own provisions

141
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,000
and don't eat outside food.

142
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,600
Moreover,

143
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,440
wine makes one drowsy on a long journey.

144
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,010
Restraint in food and drink

145
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,120
helps us maintain high vigilance.

146
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,080
Yes, indeed.

147
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:50,960
The Qianji Guards' strict discipline truly lives up to its reputation.

148
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,080
Has the prison been cleared?

149
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,970
As per your instructions, Commander Lin,

150
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,020
the existing prisoners have been moved elsewhere.

151
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,720
All the guards will remain vigilant

152
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,680
to help you watch over the important prisoner.

153
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,080
That won't be necessary.

154
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,580
Our own men will handle the guarding.

155
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,760
I have a plan now.

156
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,960
To rescue his father.

157
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,780
His goal is to destroy Dengzhou City,

158
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,520
but he doesn't need to perish with the city.

159
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,530
The entire plan was devised by the master.

160
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,720
I also offered to save him,

161
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,840
but he refused.

162
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,400
It's truly baffling,

163
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,760
I can only follow orders.

164
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:35,440
He must be worried that rescuing him would affect the execution of the plan,

165
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,770
but now you're all set and just waiting for the right moment.

166
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,560
I can guarantee

167
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,640
tonight we can both rescue my father

168
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,170
and destroy Dengzhou City.

169
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,760
But...

170
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,890
Don't worry, Zhong.

171
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,580
I've planned everything.

172
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,720
Look,

173
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,120
this is the county jail.

174
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,520
Yunniang bought a house nearby,

175
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,120
and I've already arranged for people to dig a tunnel

176
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,120
from the house directly to the jail.

177
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,040
Tonight, before you destroy Dengzhou City,

178
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,640
we'll rescue my father from prison.

179
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,760
Young master.

180
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,960
At that time,

181
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,480
the prison guards are all from the Qianji Guard.

182
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,010
With our current manpower,

183
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,080
I'm afraid...

184
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,760
You proceed according to the original plan.

185
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,220
As for rescuing my father,

186
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,120
Yunniang and I can handle it.

187
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,560
Alright.

188
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,400
Are the 20,000 people in Dengzhou

189
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,160
really going to be left to die?

190
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,680
I believe my father has

191
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,210
his reasons for doing this.

192
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,760
The most important thing now

193
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,160
is to get him out quickly.

194
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,600
I remember you said

195
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:00,160
your plan still needs that female bounty hunter Zeng Qian and Ye Xiao.

196
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,360
From your deliberate appearance near Dengzhou,

197
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,820
luring her to capture you,

198
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,800
then letting her know Ye Xiao is in Dengzhou,

199
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,240
she has always been part of your calculations.

200
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,400
But what about Ye Xiao?

201
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,930
Nobody even knows who he is.

202
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,280
I know.

203
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,220
How many more things haven't you told me?

204
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,240
Tonight's plan must be foolproof.

205
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,160
With Zeng Qian's abilities,

206
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,520
she must have found clues about Ye Xiao

207
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,080
and is setting up to capture him.

208
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,000
We have two hours until the Hour of the Tiger.

209
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,660
We need to hurry and prepare for what comes next.

210
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,280
The carriage is ready,

211
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,600
and we have enough smoke powder,

212
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,320
but can you manage alone?

213
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,170
I should be asking you that.

214
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,240
You need to prepare other things.

215
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,570
The beggar Xie Jingtang found is crucial.

216
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,460
Can you handle it by yourself?

217
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,840
These Qianji Guards...

218
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,840
I'm getting the cold shoulder.

219
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,760
What kind of treatment is this?

220
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,760
Indeed.

221
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,640
My goodness!

222
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,560
Didn't I tell you to hide outside?

223
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,480
Why did you come back?

224
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,680
I didn't kill anyone.

225
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,760
Why should I hide?

226
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,240
I, Xie Jingtang, have nothing to fear with a clear conscience.

227
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,480
When have you ever been innocent?

228
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,480
You can still eat at a time like this.

229
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,800
Here's what we'll do.

230
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,720
I'll now

231
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,770
arrange for someone to escort you out of the city.

232
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,020
Go to your father-in-law's place to lay low for a while.

233
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,040
Fine.

234
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,240
Young master,

235
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,720
weren't you leaving the city?

236
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,760
Why aren't you taking your valuables?

237
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,490
Who said I was leaving the city?

238
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,480
If I flee now,

239
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,930
it would confirm I'm guilty of murder.

240
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,520
I, Xie Jingtang, cannot die from false accusations.

241
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,850
I'm staying in the city.

242
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,360
I need to find that little beggar

243
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,700
to prove my innocence.

244
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,000
- Go.

245
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,250
- Back to the inn.

246
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,920
Driver, let's go.

247
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,340
We've been walking for so long. Why aren't we there yet?

248
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Something's not right.

249
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,120
Where are we going?

250
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,540
What is this place?

251
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,610
Young Master, let's go.

252
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,000
Give him more sedative.

253
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,660
Otherwise he'll wake up soon.

254
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,320
Young Master.

255
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,400
Young Master.

256
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,320
Young Master.

257
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,600
The news that Lin Han is coming to Dengzhou with her Qianji Guards.

258
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,660
You've already spread it out, right?

259
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,560
Ye Yao must already know.

260
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,240
Boss,

261
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,680
everything is arranged.

262
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,960
How did Lin Han find out Ye Yao is in Dengzhou?

263
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,220
She's known all along.

264
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,520
So tonight between the two of them,

265
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,520
there will definitely be a showdown.

266
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,780
This gives us an opportunity to exploit.

267
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,080
Can Ye Yao alone

268
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,740
defeat so many Qianji Guards?

269
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,000
Does she stand a chance?

270
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,200
Why do you think I let Zeng Qian find him?

271
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,520
Also,

272
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,500
Xie Jingtang's father

273
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,920
must have seen the note I left for him by now.

274
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,560
To redeem your son,

275
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,480
prepare 20,000 taels of silver.

276
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,360
Meet at the City God Temple tonight at 9 p.m.

277
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,680
Night Fiend

278
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:40,000
Master, we might as well give this money to those bounty hunters

279
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,280
and take this chance to eliminate Night Fiend completely.

280
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,080
Forget it.

281
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,930
That bunch of incompetents

282
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,320
have been wandering around Dengzhou for so long

283
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,050
and haven't even caught a glimpse of Night Fiend.

284
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,080
It takes a villain to catch a villain.

285
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,340
Find the Imperial Guards.

286
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,760
Lure the tiger away from the mountain.

287
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,600
Good plan.

288
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,800
Everything is going smoothly now.

289
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,860
We'll definitely rescue our master.

290
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:10,920
Fly!

291
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,400
Fly quickly!

292
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,040
Weren't you flying just now?

293
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:17,930
Don't sleep.

294
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:21,880
Fly!

295
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,220
Little bug.

296
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,040
Come on. I'll take you to play by the stream.

297
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:36,960
Father.

298
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,800
Is that so?

299
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,100
Commander Lin.

300
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,880
What are you doing?

301
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,840
A feint strategy.

302
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,600
Having the Qianji Guards

303
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,440
wear our constables' uniforms to ransom people at the City God Temple

304
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,560
is meant to make Yexiao lower their guard.

305
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,520
No.

306
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,160
It's your men wearing our uniforms.

307
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,960
Has Lord Xie considered

308
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,120
why as soon as we Qianji Guards arrived in Dengzhou

309
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,650
your son was taken hostage?

310
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,040
What if they're using a diversionary tactic

311
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,280
deliberately drawing our men away

312
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,920
to take advantage of our weakness

313
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,250
and rescue the prisoner we're escorting?

314
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,600
That's possible.

315
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,320
But what if it's not?

316
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,440
If it's not,

317
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,820
you'll lose at most 20,000 taels.

318
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,480
They only want money,

319
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,880
they won't take your son's life.

320
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,680
Then have them exchange clothes.

321
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,620
What's the point anymore?

322
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,440
We'll turn their plan against them.

323
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,880
If they really want to break into the prison,

324
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,720
they'll think we've fallen for their trap

325
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,720
and gone to rescue the young master.

326
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,920
Little do they know we've turned the tables

327
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,120
and already set up an ambush.

328
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,840
So it turns out

329
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,720
we were working for you all along?

330
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,280
Draw the tiger away from the mountain.

331
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,040
Good plan.

332
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,880
But can Xie Kui really summon the Qianji Guards?

333
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,540
If they were that easy to fool,

334
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,920
they wouldn't be the Qianji Guards.

335
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,080
You anticipated Lin Han would disrupt the plan.

336
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,560
Disrupting the plan is still part of the plan.

337
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:23,400
Either way,

338
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,320
taking Xie Jingtang hostage will indeed draw away manpower from the county office.

339
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,720
As for the Qianji Guards,

340
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,020
that depends on Zeng Qian and Ye Xiao.

341
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,610
Look who's here.

342
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,290
Is that Little One-eye?

343
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,240
Seems like it.

344
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,140
Quickly notify Mr. Hu.

345
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:41,840
It's 2 AM. Freezing cold.

346
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:42,690
Brother,

347
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,770
may I ask you something?

348
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,160
Have you seen this person?

349
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,060
Never seen him.

350
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,060
Alright. Thank you, brother.

351
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,600
How can you guarantee

352
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,280
that Zeng Qian will definitely help Ye Xiao?

353
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,440
Ye Xiao has the answers Zeng Qian wants.

354
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,100
She won't let him fall into anyone else's hands.

355
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,040
Sister.

356
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,200
The guards outside are in disarray.

357
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,880
Let's escape through the side door.

358
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,880
What I feared most

359
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,160
has happened after all.

360
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,100
We can talk after we leave this place.

361
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,360
We can't leave.

362
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,680
The Hour of the Tiger is almost here.

363
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,360
No one can leave now.

364
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,120
Father.

365
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,800
You know about the plan

366
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,000
to flood the city.

367
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,120
So you...

368
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:54,920
Brothers,

369
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,890
see you in the next life.

370
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,220
This wooden knife is quite heavy.

371
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:48,800
Here,

372
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,080
take it.

373
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,240
Sir,

374
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,500
what's the situation?

375
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,400
Is the young master inside?

376
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:58,960
Sir,

377
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,240
no one's inside.

378
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,370
We only found a note.

379
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,760
Yanxi Street, Number 7 Xuan.

380
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,020
What place is that?

381
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,000
What's going on?

382
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,920
The officials know about your plan.

383
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,560
What?

384
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,600
Master Hu.

385
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,640
Where is everyone?

386
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,570
One-Eye went into that residence.

387
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,760
Why are there others?

388
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,640
Actually,

389
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,480
I took money from other assassins too.

390
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:43,960
You!

391
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,840
Master, don't waste time.

392
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,040
Be careful not to lose the opportunity.

393
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:56,600
Open up!

394
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:57,960
Open up!

395
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,970
You two proceed as planned.

396
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,280
The rest of you, help me hold off the officials.

397
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:05,680
Yes.

398
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,360
In a single night,

399
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,080
taking the lives of 20,000 people in the city.

400
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,480
This matter,

401
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:19,440
I knew you could never bring yourself to do it.

402
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,360
So

403
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,320
I kept it from you

404
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,200
and sent Cao Zhong alone to carry it out.

405
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,080
I secretly discovered something suspicious.

406
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,940
I tricked Cao Zhong into talking,

407
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,530
making him believe I was also part of the plan.

408
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,240
He never would have imagined

409
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,800
that you would be the one to ruin the entire plan.

410
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,890
Don't you dare bully my sister.

411
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,720
Since childhood, I've been taught by you

412
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,640
that even insects and ants are living beings.

413
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,880
So why now are tens of thousands of lives

414
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:10,280
worth nothing more than grass in your eyes?

415
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,480
Do you know?

416
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:16,160
Sometimes killing people is to save others,

417
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,120
and sometimes saving people actually harms them.

418
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:22,800
Cao Sheng, oh Cao Sheng.

419
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,360
You've caused a terrible disaster.

420
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,320
I only want to protect Father now

421
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,520
and leave this place.

422
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,040
No matter what hardships lie ahead,

423
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:51,720
I am willing to stand with you,

424
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,520
and face them together, Father.

425
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,040
Face them.

426
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,400
You have no idea

427
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,800
what you're about to face.

428
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:28,400
Remember.

429
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,240
The beginning is the end,

430
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,520
and the end is also the beginning.

431
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:07,720
This prison is a restricted area. No unauthorized entry.

432
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,170
Everyone withdraw!

433
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:55,880
Sister, are you alright?

434
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:56,600
Let's go.

435
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:10,920
Why did you hit me?

436
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:12,080
Why did you hit me?

437
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,240
Again?

438
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:18,840
Where is One-eye?

439
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,010
For a little beggar,

440
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,040
is it worth it?

441
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,840
Anyone who stands in my way dies.

442
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:35,720
Stop!

443
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,220
Officials are coming!

444
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:46,640
Secretary Geng,

445
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,440
he's one of us.

446
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,130
Shut your mouth.

447
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,880
Cao Zhong,

448
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,520
you've failed your master.

449
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,240
What a pity.

450
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,600
But you came.

451
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,520
Actually,

452
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,000
our fate is the same.

453
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:14,960
It's almost dawn.

454
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,050
More people are coming out.

455
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,930
We can't keep sneaking around.

456
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:19,840
How about

457
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,600
going to the rooftop?

458
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:22,240
No.

459
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,160
I'm tired.

460
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,610
What was that monster just now?

461
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,480
I was about to ask you.

462
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:29,490
Why are you here?

463
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,560
Who's that woman with the big sword?

464
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,200
What's your relationship with her?

465
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,560
Why did you come?

466
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,920
I knew something was bothering you.

467
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:43,400
Never thought you'd be sharpening spears in the courtyard at midnight.

468
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,330
Don't think I don't know anything.

469
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,040
One-Eye.

470
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,040
So this is where you've been hiding.

471
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:36,600
Don't run!

472
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,200
Gunpowder.

473
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,120
Carrying this around

474
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,440
means he can escape anytime.

475
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,160
Why did he wait until now?

476
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:56,080
Sis.

477
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,200
Don't worry too much.

478
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,280
We'll definitely find him again.

479
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,280
You must be tired.

480
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:05,140
I'll get you some hot water to wash your face.

481
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,160
Mother-in-law is making steamed buns.

482
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:12,560
You've been up all night.

483
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,090
Why don't you take a day off?

484
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,160
Don't go to your stall today.

485
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,140
You can't eat all those buns by yourself.

486
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:39,180
You didn't sleep well last night either.

487
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:40,840
Later,

488
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,640
you should get some proper rest.

489
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,320
Axin.

490
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:55,840
Axin.

491
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,680
It's already dawn.

492
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,200
You can really run.

493
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,360
Have you seen my brother?

494
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:38,600
Didn't you just take a basin of hot water upstairs?

495
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,240
Tongtong.

496
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:45,520
Why haven't you left yet?

497
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:47,880
Mother.

498
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,080
Have you seen Tongtong?

499
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:49,920
I don't know.

500
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:52,400
I thought you had left already.

501
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:06,040
Axin.

502
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,760
Cao Sheng, oh Cao Sheng,

503
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,440
you're in big trouble!
